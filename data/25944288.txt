It also doesn&#x27;t support a HEAD request, which is odd, as it supports GET, POST, PUT, PATH, DELETE.  With a HEAD request, you could do the Etag or Last-Modified comparison yourself.<p>I suppose you could just download the image and do a &quot;diff -q&quot; or compare an MD5 checksum, or even just file size.<p>Or use a different tool maybe? I see that rural supports head requests. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;rural" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;rural</a><p>Edit: Appears that ht may be able to get response headers. It&#x27;s sort of a documentation bug.  It has a -p&#x2F;--print option, but the README doesn&#x27;t document what the arguments are.<p>Found it.. &quot;ht -p h <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.com</a>&quot; returns the headers, so you could extract the Etag or Last-Modified header.')
