All of the Witcher games were brutal on release.<p>But every time they have not only released thousands of bug fixes&#x2F;improvements for free, but also delivered large dlc&#x2F;content updates.<p>The difference with CP2077 I believe is that it was just the highest profile launch they have ever had by a wide margin. They are too big now.<p>I don&#x27;t regret pre-ordering at all, because they have always done right by me.')
