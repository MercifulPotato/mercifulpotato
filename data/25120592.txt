It&#x27;s being able to perform work (and well) that requires more knowledge&#x2F;ability. I know quite a few people who can&#x27;t be replaced with 2 average engineers, but that&#x27;s not because they work at a &gt;2x faster pace, it&#x27;s because I wouldn&#x27;t trust an average engineer to do their job.')
