First, with NRT (gum, lozenge) you can use nicotine much more frequently - e.g. even going to bed with lozenge in your mouth.  Second, you can easily increase your dosage.  2mg piece of gum not doing it for you? Pop in a few more or move up to 4mg.  Switch to mini-lozenge and you can suck on say 5 * 4mg lozenges at one time.')
