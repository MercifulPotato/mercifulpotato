Well researched verifiable stories from sources with a long track record of accuracy and stories that immediately fall apart if you dig into them at all just come in to you in one big stream, often indirectly and with misattribution due to reposts by people you follow (or people your followers follow that the site&#x27;s algorithm decides to show you).<p>That still leaves a question. Social media may by its current nature should lead to people who rely too much on it being poorly informed, but that should be across the political spectrum. So how come the social media misinformation that has the biggest real world effects seems to be that which aims for conservatives? I can&#x27;t think offhand of anything on the liberal side to compare to QAnon or the various COVID conspiracy theories.<p>It is not that liberals are somehow smarter or less gullible or better at telling what is news and what is not in a social media feed. No, liberals suck at that just as much as conservatives do.<p>I think the difference is simply that when foreign content farms started targeting US social media to try to destabilize the US and increase polarization, liberals were in power and so the content farms targeted conservatives as the most effective way to disrupt Obama.<p>Before foreign content farms got into the game there were about an equal number of stupid liberal conspiracy theories and stupid conservative conspiracy theories, and none of them really got any widespread traction.<p>If McCain had won in 2008 and was reelected in 2012, those content farms would have been pushing ridiculous liberal conspiracy theories instead, to try to hamper the McCain government.<p>My suggestion to people who want to avoid being duped by baseless conspiracy theories is try to avoid getting news from social media.<p>Try the ABC, NBC, or CBS nightly broadcast news for the major events of the day. If you are conservative you can add Fox News to that, and if you are liberal you can add CNN, but with both Fox and CNN make sure you are watching their news broadcasts, not their opinion broadcasts.<p>The BBC US coverage is also good. Their TV news broadcast is often carried by PBS stations, and their radio news broadcast is often carried by NPR stations.<p>For printed non-local news, try the Wall Street Journal if you are conservative, or the New York Times or Washington Post or Los Angeles Times if you are liberal. The WSJ is actually fine for liberals, and the NYT, LAT, and WP are fine for conservatives. It&#x27;s just that the WSJ might provide more extensive coverage of issues of interest to conservative, and the others more extensive coverage of liberal issues, so they will be more interesting for news outside of the big stories.<p>Best is to read a couple of them. As with Fox&#x2F;CNN, make sure to note if something is in the news section or the opinion section. The papers all clearly label opinion so this is not too hard.<p>When you see news on social media, don&#x27;t give it much weight unless you can find it in a couple of the aforementioned broadcast news shows or newspapers.')
