Except they really did deserve it but not because they could not compete, but because instead of trying to help board manufacturers making better computers they sued them.<p>Nvidia made an awesome chipset with a  mini cpu made to handle basic instructions and used intel cpu for the high end computation. Intel sued them for not using their own Chipset.<p>The nvidia chip was a power saver in 2010. And it was the best of both worlds. Zotac put together their chipset and board into a mini itx pc. Fabless. Playing 1080p video.<p>That was the height of innovation and intel tried to keep a clamp on the market for fear of losing it.<p>And maybe that is the bottom line. They knew their product was dying. Their market was no longer going to grow. So they followed the 40% rule. \nAnd tried to milk the market as much as they could.<p>Source. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotac.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;product&#x2F;mainboards&#x2F;zotac-ionitx-t-series" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotac.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;product&#x2F;mainboards&#x2F;zotac-ionitx-t-s...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wargamer.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;intel-sues-nvidia&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wargamer.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;intel-sues-nvidia&#x2F;</a>')
