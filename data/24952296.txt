What triggered Tesla disabling the feature at this time for this car?<p>I mean look, if you want to sell your Tesla back to an official Tesla dealer and they have an agreement with Tesla to disable software add-ons before reselling... then that&#x27;s Tesla&#x27;s right. But then the purchaser would never have seen any extra features enabled in the first place -- there would be nothing to complain about.<p>So what is actually going on here?')
