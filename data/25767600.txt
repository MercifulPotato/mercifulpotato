Item(by='jjk166', descendants=None, kids=[25768011], score=None, time=1610570036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25766258, text='That title is an abomination.<p>Also a 20 minute commute across this thing is ridiculous - that wouldn&#x27;t just require you to go 317 mph, it would require you to average 317 mph. With everything along the same path, your high speed rail needs to stop at every city node. If the video is accurate to scale, these nodes are only a half mile apart, so you&#x27;re talking over 200 stops along your journey. Even if you had a train that could teleport instantaneously between stations, that would leave only 6 seconds at each station for embarking&#x2F;disembarking. With everyone travelling on the same path, you can&#x27;t skip stops even if you know for a fact no one on your train is getting on or off there without risking a collision with another train that does have a stop.<p>You could do a little better with parallel rail lines - for example an express line connecting every 15th node and a local line servicing the nearest 15 nodes so in the worst case scenario you only have 30 stops, but that&#x27;s still only 40 seconds between stops on average and that has to include switching trains. Best case is 5 parallel lines which gets you down to a worst case commute of 15 stops over 159 total miles. Assuming a minute at each stop on average (which note includes 4 different transfers), your train only needs to go 1908 mph (not including accelerating or decelerating) to get you home in 20 minutes (not including any walk to or from stations).<p>God forbid one of these lines requires maintenance.<p>If we assume a high speed train that can average 200 mph not including time at stops, your commute time across the city is about an hour. Not bad when you consider that this is the equivalent of traversing every street in a city, but abysmal when you consider that if this city was a solid circle you could get to your destination in half the time on a bike at a leisurely pace.')
