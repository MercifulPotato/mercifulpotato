As such, it is deeply immoral, despicable, and should be outlawed on the constitutional level!\nI also believe that this manipulation is the foundation of almost every evil in the western world, because it is the perverse motive that corrupts our democracy and our economy. \nThe ability to manipulate masses of people to buy your idea or product using money allows those with money to dominate, not those who are competent or correct (either at politics or economy).\nThe fact that our societies not only allow this but actively celebrate the biggest manipulators as the best of us (google facebook etc.) is beyond immoral for me. It&#x27;s insane!<p>I also believe that anybody who calls out this sick game at the level of society would be cruelly ostracised by those in power, either in media or politics or economy.\nStill, we should voice this more often. We should make people rethink our societies.')
