I can use this as a springboard to look deeper and more constructively into the highlighted events. Too often these kinds of articles are simply a smokescreen for an underlying argument that is essentially a clever version of “left wing liberals are stealing your freedom”... and this wasn’t.  Which is fantastic, because as an eclectic political centrist I can’t have meaningful discussion with either end of the any particular political axis as they tend to devolve into gibbering furby dolls parroting the talking points of their politicians of choice... for society to progress this has to end.')
