Their keyboard layout support didn&#x27;t correctly honour the keyboard layout in macOS that I used, and the response was &quot;file a bug&quot;, pointing me to a public issue tracker where I found someone else had reported it 6 years previously. I think that bug has been open for 8 years now â€“ I got an email when another poor customer found it and asked if there was any update. All the issue asks for is for their products to honour the keys the OS says are being pressed.')
