Or would we be better served by making good teachers available to those who want to learn it, at the time they want to learn it?<p>I&#x27;d -love- to go through some of my college level math classes; both the ones I took, and the ones i didn&#x27;t need to take. They weren&#x27;t especially relevant then. They&#x27;re slightly more now, but more than that, I&#x27;m -interested- now. But self-learning takes too much of an investment of time (when I run into something I don&#x27;t know I have to research -that-, and it becomes this infinite process of diving down rabbit holes, rather than having someone who has gone before who can give me a sufficient answer to unblock me on my original question).')
