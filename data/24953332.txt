The lane keeping and emergency braking are just there and mostly help out (although, apparently I like to drive on the line when exiting a freeway, so it&#x27;s kind of annoying there). Radar cruise would be nice, except I don&#x27;t do much long distance driving, and I don&#x27;t like the following distance options, a different car might give different options that would be better.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t like to be in a car that drives like either the Tesla or the Waymo cars though, the Tesla&#x27;s are too aggresive, and the Waymo cars are not aggressive enough (which is generally good and safety aware, but would still be frustrating to ride in).')
