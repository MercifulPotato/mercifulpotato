Item(by='thu2111', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603886009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24916258, text='Eh, look at the modern attacks on white males. Mainstream politicians give speeches where they denounce white men and say things like, &quot;women are better than men&quot; (Obama), &quot;women are the primary victims of war&quot; (Clinton), &quot;It&#x27;s an English jurisprudential culture, a white man&#x27;s culture.  It&#x27;s got to change&quot; (Biden). They do it because it their base loves it, it plays well to &quot;the mob&quot; (though of course calling it that won&#x27;t win me any favours here on HN), discrimination and effective banning of white men from being appointed to top positions is widespread behaviour throughout the west at this point, and so on.<p>There seem like two big differences. One is that - so far at least - the politicians doing this don&#x27;t call for actual violence against white men. However, it&#x27;s starting to get close. In places where BLM is active people scrawl on their storefronts that they&#x27;re black, in an attempt to avoid the violence and damage dished out against any business not perceived as &#x27;allied&#x27;. Prominent politicians conspicuously avoid condemning the violently racist behaviour of these rioters.<p>The other is that Hitler genuinely hated Jews as a race. He didn&#x27;t have any concept of &#x27;allied&#x27; Jews. Modern racial hatred often comes across as not especially genuine because it&#x27;s full of white men condemning &quot;white men&quot;, and people demanding women &#x2F;blacks&#x2F;black women be put into powerful positions ... unless they&#x27;re the wrong kind of minority, i.e. conservative, in which case they are treated in exactly the same way as the &quot;white men&quot;. Scott Alexander has written eloquently about the way these labels, which on the surface appear to have clear racial or gender-based definitions, have been effectively adopted and rewritten within certain subcultures to be code words for conservatives. This doesn&#x27;t seem to precisely parallel what happened in Nazi Germany where, for all you can say about him, Hitler said exactly what he was going to do and then did it. Although Goebbels was well known for his ideas on propaganda, the regimes most famous for screwing with their citizens minds were all communist. Orwell&#x27;s 1984 was inspired by socialism and not the more obvious and immediate example of Nazi-ism for that reason.')
