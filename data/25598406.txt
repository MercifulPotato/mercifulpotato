Item(by='sunshinerag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609456866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25598293, text='&gt;&gt; The capital gains tax issue isn&#x27;t stopping your average person from wanting to use Bitcoin<p>How are you so sure? if I had to report and fill forms for every single transaction that I do, like say buying coffee or video games I would be put off with trying to use the currency. it is a way to cripple it&#x27;s usage.<p>&gt;&gt; The bottom line is that rational consumers like the features and services offered by traditional banks and credit cards.\n&gt;&gt; If someone steals your credit card and spends a ton of money, you just call up the credit card company and get your money back.\n&gt;&gt; If someone gets access to your Bitcoin wallet and takes all of your Bitcoin, that&#x27;s it. Game over. Should have had better OPSEC, grandma.\n&gt;&gt; Likewise, people don&#x27;t want to manage wallet passphrases and key files themselves. They want an exchange to handle the details for them, including as much risk as they can move to the exchange.\n&gt;&gt; The reality is that Bitcoin is still far and away an inferior experience to traditional payment methods. If I pay with Bitcoin, I have to deal with transaction fees and variable network delays and I have zero recourse if the vendor simply steals my money. With a credit card, the bank literally pays me 1-3% to use their credit card, payment is instant, and I can simply call the bank up and reverse charges if something goes wrong.<p>I completely agree with these points. And I hope the ecosystem improves on these. Still the advantage of Bitcoin&#x27;s fixed supply and it&#x27;s ability to hold value vs fiat systems whilst it&#x27;s capacity to also act as a currency is still something valuable. While it doesn&#x27;t do everything the way horses (fiat) are now, it will get better as it is the car in the race.')
