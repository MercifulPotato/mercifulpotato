The company is just a handful of people, including the CEO, and we’ve been in meetings where they are basically yelling at each other, sometimes us, trying to allocate blame. Fixing stuff is less important than identifying who is to blame.<p>Trying to get a decision about anything is impossible, we have questions that goes unanswered for months. It frequently trivial stuff like:  when do you want this script to run? Picking a date, or where is this documented (it’s not but they’ll insist it is, and we’re just to stupid to find it).<p>It all stems from the leadership within. Their managers all have one or more of the traits in the article, and it seems to trickle down to the employees who act similarly towards people on the outside.<p>Personally I’ve take the approach that I’m consulant, paid by the hour (because the client refuse to sign an actual contract), so I really don’t care, I’ll make any modification they want, write whatever document they need, redo anything they’re unhappy with, even if the result is worse.<p>The main things with having these companies as clients is:<p><pre><code>  * Double check everything you write, before sending it.\n\n  * Have them sign of on everything, before starting the work.\n\n  * Always get everything in writing.\n\n  * Don’t lie, they will catch you and use it to blame you for unrelated stuff.\n\n  * Don’t take it personal.\n\n  * Bill by the hour.</code></pre>')
