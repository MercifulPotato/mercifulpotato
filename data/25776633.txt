Quite a few software engineers in high and very-high cost of living areas make that--but the vast majority don&#x27;t.<p>See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;how-much-income-puts-you-top-1-5-10&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;how-much-incom...</a><p>Look at the wage growth for the 90th - 95th (top 10% to top 5%): it&#x27;s in the bottom.<p>The distribution of salary for Senior SWE is found, e.g., at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salary.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;salary&#x2F;alternate&#x2F;senior-software-engineer-salary" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salary.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;salary&#x2F;alternate&#x2F;senior-soft...</a>. The median is $115k, the 90% is $130k--still not the top 10%. Even when you bonuses the salary curve shifts right by less than 10% (e.g. median goes to about $116k, 90% outlier to $138k).<p>Some 4 million people in the US work as software engineers (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Software_engineering_demographics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Software_engineering_demograph...</a>). FAANG accounts for, what, 1% - 2% of that? Maybe a bit more, but not much. The vast majority don&#x27;t have high TC, most of them are paid a flat salary with a modest bonus and either have ESPPs or no equity at all.<p>Software engineers are laborers, in effectively the same social class as manual laborers. Our economic circumstances are better, but not that much better.<p>Your comment is a great example of how the huge inequality gaps and the infotainment media have distorted perceptions among workers.')
