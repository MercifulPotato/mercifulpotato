If people want a nasty app on their phone, then they should be able to have it.<p>Exactly. The real problem isn&#x27;t that Apple has some policy about moderation for their app store -- it&#x27;s their app store, some amount of curation is completely necessary, that they have policies to that end is completely fine. That&#x27;s how stores <i>work</i>.<p>The real problem is that people don&#x27;t have a choice to use any other app store, or independently install an app some other way (e.g. directly downloading it from a webpage or transferring it over a USB cable).<p>In Androidland, once Parler is back up on some web host, it will be technically possible to get their apk from somewhere else and install it, if you want it. Just like I can get NewPipe somewhere other than Google&#x27;s app store.')
