You can’t just turn a dial and add more talent.<p>Although a bit off topic there are some authoritarian nation states who tried to do this by social engineering. Soviet Union made being an engineer a common place job title and China is trying to make tons of super smart kids at STEM. But we all know there is more to being smart than forcing kids to go down certain academic route and get top end scores (you know the whole creative side and capacity for original works to be created).<p>The democratic approach still seems to be the winner (not just due to brain). It’s as I mention always going to be a small minority who do great things. That doesn’t scale up artificially.')
