These are generally people who dislike Christianity or another, and&#x2F;or whom dislike its pervasiveness in American culture over other religions.<p>Likely more prevalent are the people who don&#x27;t like corporations, public services, etc. wishing everyone Merry Christmas year after year while ignoring the holidays of other religions.<p>To avoid all of this, many places are switching to &quot;Happy Holidays&quot;, except there are a not-insignificant number of people who are upset by this and feel that companies&#x2F;governments should be saying &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; <i>because</i> they should be aligned with Christianity.')
