I&#x27;m really enjoying the challenge of learning new things (I didn&#x27;t learn much of anything new at WGU. That&#x27;s not a knock against WGU&#x27;s materials, which seemed good. It&#x27;s just a reflection of my having worked in industry and self-studying for 15 years before applying).<p>I do think GATech could learn a few things from WGU. I found WGU to have much better administration. WGU was 10x better about enrolling, being able to get support, and such. Overall, WGU had less bullshit than GATech. I also really loved the ability to go at my own pace at WGU.<p>GATech uses a semi-synchronous model in that you&#x27;re on a deadline for each assignment and exam. I don&#x27;t like the subjective grading of the assignments, and sometimes they&#x27;re ambiguous about what they want exactly. Seems to very a lot from class-to-class. I loved that at WGU you could have redoes - even though I never took advantage of that it was a lot lower stress knowing I could redo an assignment or exam. At GATech there are no redoes short of dropping a course.<p>Overall, I think WGU is the best value for a BS CS, and GATech is the best value for a MS CS right now - and really there aren&#x27;t any close seconds.<p>If you want to discuss further, let me know, and I&#x27;ll send you an email.<p>Also, off topic, but did you get any scholarship at WGU? Their scholarships are basically coupons. I thought everyone got one, and I was surprised to not see that in your accounting.')
