It plays into the mob&#x27;s hand-- an <i>outsider</i> is trying to convince so-and-so to become a rat! You&#x27;re not a rat, are you, so-and-so?<p>I&#x27;m sorry OP has to go through the heartache of coming to terms with this, if that is indeed anything like what they&#x27;re going through. But I have to admit to being less concerned with your and OP&#x27;s blanket warning about Indian families, and vastly more concerned that you and OP apparently think a broad statement like that could somehow justify tapping a loved one&#x27;s phone. On HN of all places.<p>To be crystal clear-- if that mom of the Nxivm cult member had actually bugged her daughter&#x27;s phone at any point in the saga, it would have <i>shattered</i> her trust with her mom and made it impossible for her to ever leave. You get that, right?')
