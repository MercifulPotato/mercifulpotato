If kscreenlocker crashes, the black rectangle is still here, and ksmserver will spawn kscreenlocker again but this time with software rendering (just in case it crashed due to graphics driver issue). If kscreenlocker crashes four times then KDE Session Management Server gives up, stops respawning kscreenlocker and simply draws the following text on the screen.<p><pre><code>  The screen locker is broken and unlocking is not possible anymore.\n  In order to unlock switch to a virtual terminal (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+F2),\n  log in and execute the command:\n  \n  loginctl unlock-session %1\n  \n  Afterwards switch back to the running session (Ctrl+Alt+F%2).\n</code></pre>\nIf ksmserver itself crashes then the entire session closes.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why GNOME screensaver cannot do something like this. Lock screen crashing seems like something inevitable (especially considering buggy graphic card drivers and so on), and it makes sense to prepare for it so that crashes won&#x27;t bypass the screen locker.')
