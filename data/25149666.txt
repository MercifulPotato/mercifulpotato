They deliver ads on videos as short as 2 minutes long. Move onto the next video after watching an ad + 2 minute video == another ad.<p>I&#x27;ve stopped using the native app and have now switched to the mobile-browser version now (I use Adguard as an ad-blocker for mobile Safari which blocks YT ads in browser)..')
