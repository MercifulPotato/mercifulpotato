The employee doesn&#x27;t want to fall afoul of any liabilities they might place upon themselves or the company by revealing or promising anything they shouldn&#x27;t.  So personal social media activity is not prohibited, but social media activity in the context of your employment by the company is.<p>I suspect Apple might be far harsher than most companies if people step over the line, based upon previous examples.')
