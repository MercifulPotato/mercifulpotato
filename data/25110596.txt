Item(by='odiroot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605527338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25107964, text='&gt; However one thing that bug me is that a number of media&#x2F;opinion tend to characterize the deal as some kind of China nefarious plot even though the initiative came from South East Asia.<p>I would guess it&#x27;s a huge win for smaller SEA countries. China could dictate the rules before anyway (big = important) but now they&#x27;re all supposedly going to play on a level field.<p>And ASEAN being behind this project, it probably benefits Singapore greatly.')
