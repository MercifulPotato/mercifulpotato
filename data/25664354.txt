They say more or less the exact same thing about the left and on the same list of topics no less.  I can paraphrase talking points if you would like.  There is a fundamental and irreconcilable difference in beliefs between the left and the right when it comes to the what is right and what is wrong.<p>I think if you expanded your list of issues slightly you would be very hard pressed to find someone who is not a hardcore partisan from either party that does not believe that the &quot;other party&quot; has it right on at least one or two issues.')
