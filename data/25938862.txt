I will say it simply as I can: iOS, iPadOS and in the near future macOS are vertically integrated service and sell channels. The right move that I expected was to make at least iPadOS macOs like not the other way around. The idea to run macOS apps on iPad is more valuable in general computing terms than using touch designed software on desktop os. \nIpads are powerful enough but we don&#x27;t have a proper access to filesystem and terminal. You can&#x27;t compile on iPad or iPhone. The macs are around as development platform for increasingly restricted environment. Combine this with trend for SaaS and you will see that using your computer is actually renting overpriced hardware to work in the cloud.  \nEverything that Apple does is exploiting the limits of their user base. \nDon&#x27;t let me start on system design decision about VPN and Kernel extensions. (I know they will fix this in next update, but whats next?)')
