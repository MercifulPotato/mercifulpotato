I&#x27;ve been looking for PC parts in the EU and there don&#x27;t seem to be great choices. Newegg has a good interface but their offer in the EU is poor compared to the US.<p>Amazon filled a lot of these verticals with sometimes the best service they&#x27;ve ever had and often just good enough. Finding someone else for each is hard. But it may be a good business model fot the next 10 years. Spin up good customer-focused eCommerce operations for a vertical you know well in a market that&#x27;s large enough (US and EU are both huge). Fraud and cut-throat pricing may eat you up though.')
