The function stack would be this (discarding everything outside of my code):<p><pre><code>    1: ImageData::verify_and_update - src\\main.rs:104\n    2: run - src\\main.rs:653\n    3: main - src\\main.rs:673\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s why the backtrace is worthless here. It doesn&#x27;t actually tell you where you were in the chain of function calls. In this case, it&#x27;s relatively simple, so just knowing the line does help. But in a more complex application you could end up in a scenario where a function is called in multiple places, with different call stacks, and you don&#x27;t know how you even got there because things were inlined and the backtrace doesn&#x27;t tell you.')
