Item(by='moron4hire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608304271, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25466854, text='About 7 or 8 years ago, I hit a point of &quot;I&#x27;m going to quit tech completely.&quot; I felt everything this guy was feeling. Loved programming. Hated the people I invariably ended up working for.<p>I spent a month on unemployment, looking for my Next Thing. Ended up doing more programming than I had done in the previous year. Went freelance. Suddenly, most things were better.<p>Started to hate things a little bit again. I was never very good at finding clients, so I got stuck at a single, long-term, full-time one, and was feeling stagnated. Changed my focus from webdev to VR. Loved the work, but couldn&#x27;t find clients. Ended up an employee again. Right back into the same, old shit.<p>Eventually ended up at an established, non-tech company that decided they wanted to start doing their own R&amp;D on improving their offering. Everything is great. This company has the best culture I&#x27;ve ever seen. People work and are happy to work, but it&#x27;s not a cult that fawns over the company. The company is small enough that everyone knows everyone else, but not so small that we&#x27;re constantly rushing around, looking for money.<p>Moral of the story: never trust an MBA who has studied the tech industry. My boss now has an MBA, but it was more &quot;this is what I&#x27;m going to study to help out in the family business&quot;.')
