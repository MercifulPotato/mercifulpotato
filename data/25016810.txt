USA may not get it because they never really had fascism, but some of us in Europe do. Itâ€™s not pretty.<p>The scariest part, to me, regarding the way the Trump administration whitewashed fascism is that those of us who live in countries who experienced it are fully aware that fascism doesn&#x27;t dawn upon us with a bang, and more often than not it just seeps in.<p>Therefore, people are desensitized towards fascism because they expect it to come as a bogeyman that strong-arms his way into power in an obvious way and against everyone&#x27;s wishes.  It does not.  It sneaks in with overwhelming popular support, based on a rhetoric that there&#x27;s an inhuman enemy threatening the little people and that the fascist hero is here to save everyone from evil by doing whatever it takes.  That&#x27;s precisely what we are seeing with Trump, with their supporters demanding beheadings and bullets to the head of reactionaries, while their supporters praise Trump for being a bully that&#x27;s on their corner protecting them.')
