An apparently great idea, it became popular because many needed an additional income to survive, to the point people accepted the idea of having strangers sleep in their houses for money as the norm.<p>Beside the incredible damage AirBnb did to the housing situation in many cities -in my city, 35% of the housing is now AirBnb only. Locals have been forced out of their own city-, did the &quot;airbnbs&quot; ever think that the problem they were trying to solve (people in need of more money just to survive) was caused exactly by capitalism, the same mechanism they thought they could use to make the world &quot;a better place&quot;?')
