I&#x27;m not saying that as a value judgment, but as a matter of fact.<p>How are you able to attest to that fact?<p>&gt; I can not prove a negative, other than the absence of evidence of the contrary.<p>What evidence would you expect to see if YouTube had deleted a good faith video?<p>&gt; Do you have any examples of good faith actors being silenced that we can discuss the merits of?<p>No because I&#x27;m not even sure how one would attest to the &quot;good faith&quot; of a video that is no longer on YouTube. Thats why I&#x27;m so puzzled at the certainty exhibited by people who seem determined that these videos and ideas are so dangerous that they should be suppressed. What kind of experiences and evidence would make someone so confident that they were right and they hadn&#x27;t merely been misinformed?<p>&gt; Yes, but I have seen no evidence of this, so I reserve that hypothetical for when it happens.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t you want to have some evidence in support of your statement before you make sweeping claims? I&#x27;m trying to see how you can reconcile the part where you think these other people are bad because they make statements about reality without evidence, but you&#x27;re fine with making statements about reality yourself without evidence.')
