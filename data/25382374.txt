Jupyter notebooks come close, but not quite there.<p>The thing that really helped was watching videos of talks &#x2F; tutorials of people on youtube coding something up, for example [0]. I&#x27;m not calling that one out specifically as a  great tutorial, that&#x27;s just an example of what I mean =)... I personally would start with an example of a form and then build it up in stages, basically tinkering with the form as I work out how I want it to function.<p>Another thing is that you don&#x27;t have to use a particular editor etc. I&#x27;m not sure for example if you think you have to use emacs. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s a great environment, but if you&#x27;re a beginner to it and clojure, that&#x27;s not a good combination. Pick something you like which hopefully has a good repl plugin. There are a fair few options these days. Intellij, vscode, atom, vim among others.<p>Worst case if you&#x27;d like me to sit down and have a short call to go over stuff I&#x27;d be happy to set aside a little time =)... I&#x27;ve done tutorial stuff before and it&#x27;s always nice to help someone else get comfortable in the ecosystem.<p>Hope that helps.<p>- [0]: [Clojure, REPL &amp; TDD: Feedback at Ludicrous Speed - Avishai Ish-Shalom](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ngt29DyNDRM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ngt29DyNDRM</a>)')
