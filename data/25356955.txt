This was the main reason I stopped using it.<p>2.0 was (maybe still is?) supported by Saxon, a proprietary library, needing to be licensed. Built-in support was capped at 1.5.<p>If I remember, in order to run XSLT 2.0, you had to license and install Saxon on your server (i believe it was a Java application, meaning the server need to have a JVM), then call it, using system calls. Awkward, at best.<p>But this was many moons ago. I suspect&#x2F;hope that things have improved, since then.')
