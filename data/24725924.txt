Item(by='username90', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602208285, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24725161, text='&gt; The Justice Department is claiming that those African Americans accepted into Yale are actually hurt by being accepted because their acceptance is reinforcing stereotypes that they needed extra assistance to get accepted.<p>It is perpetuating the racial stereotype of black people as stupid and likely creates strong unconscious bias in everyone at that college that black people are dumber, since among the students accepted to the school the black students will have the worst track record. It doesn&#x27;t hurt the black people individually, but it hurts black people as a group. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we include the group effect that even the individuals are hurt more than helped long term.')
