Content creators can use &quot;natural&quot; parameters for material&#x2F;lights, and you don&#x27;t need to insert fake lights to achieve realistic shadows, dynamic lights. That&#x27;s in a way &quot;simplifying&quot; things, but in the end it just gives more realistic games for the same or higher effort. Until everyone can use ray tracing, it&#x27;ll also add another layer of complexity becauuse you need to make a separate path for ray tracing, so level editors and content creators need to ensure everything looks good both in both cases.')
