It isn&#x27;t like there is a set price for every documentary.  This movie was always going to come with a relatively big price tag compared to its financial viability.<p>I am not ignoring the politics of the situation.  I simply said I don&#x27;t know if the tale told in the article is believable because there are valid non-political reasons that seem to do a better job explaining what transpired.')
