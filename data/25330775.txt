You can then add a test suite and start refactoring and gradually move to a codebase you&#x27;re happy with, while breaking few or no users on the way.<p>Another approach is to split it into blocks and replace parts of the system, but whether that is feasible depends on the software and how modular it is.<p>Finally, you could try a clean-room rewrite, but that could take years without visible results and is hard to find the motivation for if existing software works ok.')
