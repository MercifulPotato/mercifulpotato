People have been talking about this for years; they were labeled conspiracy theorists. Same with social media in general. Censorship? Shadow banning? Nah, you&#x27;re crazy bro! Now it&#x27;s being done openly - with PR language, of course, that is designed to manipulate the public&#x27;s perception of censorship.<p>These are private companies. They&#x27;re in their legal right to censor whoever they want. However, what throws me off is when these very same companies preach freedom, protecting democracy, and <i>drum roll</i>....freedom of speech.<p>They don&#x27;t believe in any of those values.
