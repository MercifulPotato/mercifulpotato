Even today it&#x27;s a garbage experience that takes up hours&#x2F;days of debugging to get right, and then it&#x27;s still way worse than the mac&#x2F;windows experience.<p>This. Writing this from a laptop running Ubuntu with an nvidia card and I can feel my body tense up just reading it.<p>I remember several nights in college just struggling to get the drivers to work and finding the right cuda spec from the repository, after combing through multiple sources.<p>It&#x27;s still a nightmare and I always dread that the StackOverflow and Ask Ubuntu posts in the bookmarks folder that I&#x27;ve reserved for this arduous process will be obsolete when the GPU card crashes again for the umteenth time.')
