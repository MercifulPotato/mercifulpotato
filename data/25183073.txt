You can finish the game without this invincibility but it does look cool when no enemy can inflict any damage to you.<p>So my older brother went for the challenge. You can do this by getting an armor that makes small enemies damages smaller than the normal health recovery rate. Every time they hit you, it makes you stronger towards their element. This meant, my brother would turn on the psx, find a weak enemy, turn off the tv and let them inflict damage. He would let the psx on for days at a time. Put a little fan on the console and a glass of water on top (another optimization).<p>This also meant the rest of us couldn&#x27;t use the PSX. Also, when my brother achieved his goal, he never played the game again.')
