Whether Apple or &quot;Our Government&quot;, we shouldn&#x27;t be giving this much power to institutions.<p>&gt; But even so, what are we supposed to do?<p>Vote with your wallet. Stop consuming whatever it is that comes with attached strings. Stop putting convenience above principles. Refuse to pay&#x2F;subscribe&#x2F;accept any terms that are clearly not in your best interest.<p>You don&#x27;t need Big Government to do that. You don&#x27;t even need to be part of a mobilized group. It&#x27;s in your hands and every individual can choose for themselves. Let&#x27;s take responsibility for our own actions and stop using the vices&#x2F;failings of others to excuse ourselves to do the same.')
