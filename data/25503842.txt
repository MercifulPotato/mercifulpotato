Oracle will sell you a support contract claiming &quot;binary compatibility&quot; even when they are using a newer kernel than what&#x27;s in RHEL.<p>They are trying to make lives easier to collaborate with their frienemies who all maintain a RHEL clone.  That means calling CentOS what it actually is: upstream of RHEL.')
