It does change and people employ really complex idioms to facilitate that. It might be &quot;easy to reason about&quot;, but it&#x27;s definitely not easy to grasp. Lots of people find it much easier to just mutate something (hence the popularity of imperative languages).<p>Rust takes best of both worlds. You can both mutate, and you are sure that this is compile-time guaranteed, so you can&#x27;t just try to mess with a value that this part of the code does not own.')
