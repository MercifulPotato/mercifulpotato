I&#x27;ve seen too many C projects (including some of mine) starting by swearing out C++ for one reason or another and then ending out reimplementing half of it using macros or poorly written hashmap implementations taken from somewhere.<p>Glib2 is one excellent example of how people have been shunning C++ due to its complexity, while on the other hand implementing overly complex libraries to mitigate the fact it&#x27;s too barebones, which is oxymoronic to me. Either you say C is better because its simplicity and you keep stuff simple, or you are just being a zealot for the sake of it.<p>Basically everything I can put my hands on supports C++, I&#x27;ve been running massive applications on embedded microcontrollers and it works as fine as C. If you don&#x27;t like some features, just write C-style C++, use the C ABI and #include &lt;&gt; all the containers you need.')
