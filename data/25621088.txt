There is a strict standardized format for scripts, for typography and layout, and certain words and character names are always capitalized. E.g. every scene starts with a capitalized header like:<p><pre><code>    INT. TYRELL CORPORATION INTERROGATION ROOM - DUSK\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    EXT. OVERHEAD VIEW CITY - NIGHT\n</code></pre>\nThe header indicate (1) interior or exterior (2) setting (3) time of day. (The movie Mank actually display these headers on the screen to introduce the flashback scenes. It is an inside joke since it is a movie about a screenwriter.)<p>Dialogue lines are always indented, and with the character name in capitals:<p><pre><code>    Leon&#x27;s upper lip is quivering.\n\n                            LEON\n              Whatya mean, I&#x27;m not helping?\n\n                            HOLDEN\n              I mean you&#x27;re not helping!  Why is\n              that, Leon?\n\n</code></pre>\nNow <i>in addition</i> to such capitalization rules, the author can capitalize words the reader should pay special attention to, typically visual or sound cues.<p><pre><code>    A blimp is drifting silently over the city reflect-\n    ed in an eyeball while we hear the SOUNDS OF THE\n    STREET.\n</code></pre>\nBut there are no hard and fast rules about which words to capitalize here. The scriptwriter in the article do seem to like to emphasize many words.')
