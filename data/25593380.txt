We have two dual-language immersion schools (Spanish&#x2F;English and Arabic&#x2F;English), a Montessori school, and one school that doesn&#x27;t fall into any particular bucket but is highly ranked.  Those are the _public_ schools for this neighborhood.  If you live here, you&#x27;re going to one of those three or paying for one of the private (mostly Catholic) schools nearby.  Hell, we&#x27;re not even in one of the &quot;good&quot; school districts... Those are out in the suburbs.<p>You do realize that Houston _is_ the global R&amp;D center for multiple domains, right?  Medicine, Geoscience, several different engineering disciplines.<p>The migration you&#x27;re talking about started in the 70&#x27;s and has been going strong for many decades.  As someone who moved here for work after getting a PhD, I can assure you, it&#x27;s not that hard to &quot;attract scientific-minded employees&quot; here.  My previous employer had thousands of positions that required a PhD.  The overwhelming majority of those were filled by people who moved here for the job.<p>Yes, the TX state educational board is fucked up.  That doesn&#x27;t translate to what&#x27;s taught in most schools in urban areas.  It unfortunately _does_ mean that schools have the leeway to teach bizarre stuff, but most in the areas being discussed by this article don&#x27;t.<p>The reason folks don&#x27;t want to move here has more to do with the weather and traffic than anything else.  (The weather really does suck half the year, but we get 4-5 really nice months of weather in the winter.)<p>There are definitely some sprawly areas that I&#x27;d recommend avoiding (Houston has more in common with LA than with SF), but by and large, Houston&#x27;s a great place to live.  I walk more or less everywhere I go, have a 110 year old house with a great backyard, and live within walking distance many of the best-rated restaurants and bars as well as downtown.  This is the expensive area, and you can still easily buy a house for under $500k.<p>You just have to survive August...')
