There are a lot of physics-derived tools that are coming into increasing use, though. Half of social network analysis seems to come from sociology, and the other half (the highly computational part, in the main) from physics. I&#x27;ve done bits of network analysis (one of my better-recieved recent papers was applying network partitioning to the problem of identifying the edges of news &#x27;stories&#x27; in sets of articles) but I do most of my stuff in the text analysis space where NLP&#x2F;topic modelling&#x2F;matrix factorisation stuff is making most of the running, and that&#x27;s mostly drawing from CS rather than physics.')
