Atlassian have a ticket tracking system for their problems.  They just ignore so much of the big hard problems, they close tickets with hundreds and hundreds of people on it explaining a multitude of core problems.  Coming on HN is just trying to spin it for PR purposes is just not going to work, thread after thread on HN just shows that many many people have been BURNT by Atlassian products.   However, I will say, Confluence has improved, but so many things still suck about it, including it being sluggish, and a search that seems really brain dead.')
