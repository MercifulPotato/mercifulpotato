Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609803103, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25637495, text='&gt;  Point in case the voters of Oregon have multiple times voted to not issue driverâ€™s licenses to illegal aliens.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why. Licensed or not, they&#x27;re going to drive. If they&#x27;re in the country illegally, they&#x27;re not gonna care they&#x27;re driving illegally. Isn&#x27;t it safer for others on the road if they&#x27;re made to take the appropriate tests and have insurance like everyone else? If you&#x27;re involved in an accident with an undocumented person, isn&#x27;t it better to be able to get their insurance information?<p>In this case, I think the voters really are being dumb. Or they&#x27;re being fed a pack of lies, such as getting driver&#x27;s licenses will make undocumented aliens eligible for other benefits.<p>Maybe these legislators are able to see both sides of the issue and believe that giving driver&#x27;s licenses will be a net benefit to their constituents. Even if those constituents don&#x27;t realize it themselves.')
