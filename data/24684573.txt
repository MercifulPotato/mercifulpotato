I did find zenoradio.com (which used to be <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audionow.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audionow.com&#x2F;</a>) and they have a Call-to-listen feature with a fixed number for each podcast. However, can&#x27;t get a number right away, you have to complete a certain number of sessions before they&#x27;ll assign you a number (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intercom.help&#x2F;zenotools&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;1843279-how-can-i-receive-a-call-to-listen-number-for-my-station" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intercom.help&#x2F;zenotools&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;1843279-how-can-...</a>).<p>I&#x27;ve also seen a few church have their own &quot;Dial a Podcast&quot; feature for their own sermons (which is what this originally started out as, although that was done through our self-hosted FreePBX box).<p>My primary target audience is smaller churches with existing podcasts who want help to reach members who don&#x27;t have internet access, or are less technology inclined (not a judgement, it&#x27;s just what they&#x27;re comfortable with). This generally tends to be older members, so that&#x27;s who I designed it in mind for.<p>I think having a fixed phone number and code (versus Bullhorn&#x27;s rotating number) is key because you can write it on a post-it note, give it to them, and then they can call it any time. I mean, it doesn&#x27;t get much simpler than, &quot;Grandma, call this number and when the person starts talking press x-x-x-x-x-x&quot;.<p>Also having it be simple for churches to setup and administer is important. I&#x27;ve gotten several calls from other churches this year about how we do our online streaming services. Having this be a low-cost fire-and-forget was important.')
