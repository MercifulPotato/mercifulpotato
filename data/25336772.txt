These are individuals who have had considerable impact on a piece of technology whose names I can recognize for the tech they built.<p>I have no idea what or how this individual matters at all or the tech that she is relevant in. Not everyone at FAANG are industry leaders, and there are several cogs just like at IBM. I fail to see why I should care for every individual starling who can&#x27;t stand out other than the company they work for.<p>This random individual along with James Damore and that random FB grad are not on the same level.<p>Your arguments tell me more that FAANG should be broken apart. Public attention and scrutiny would achieve nothing in affecting Google&#x27;s decision making here.')
