I&#x27;m saying they could also do the opposite. My point is that a &quot;mission-oriented&quot; code of conduct if you will allows the people who set the mission (read: leadership) to set the ethics too.<p>Fighting segregation can be part of the mission, or not. But if it isn&#x27;t, you can&#x27;t work on it.')
