Item(by='sokoloff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605528970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25107548, text='One of the key takeaways from the paper for me is the <i>relative ranking</i> of those 54 attributes. If the employees ranked “long-term thinking” above “creates a safe haven”, I have possibly learned something. If engineers rank attributes differently than managers or if cashiers rank attributes differently than tech workers...<p>Side note: I also thought the negative phrasing methodology used was interesting. They asked “is it possible to be a great engineer <i>without</i> this quality?” which I think is most tuned towards qualifying and ranking attributes.<p>Will it tell you individually <i>how</i> to become a great engineer? No, there are hundreds of posts, many on medium.com for that. This paper may not be perfect, but I found a lot to consider inside and “beyond useless” is pretty far from my judgment.')
