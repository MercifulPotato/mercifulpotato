If the business that designed and painted the lot allocated insufficient space, neither driver should blame the other.<p>The premise that there are groups in America who need saving from poverty and lousy schools is true, but why save only a few of them by sending them to a school for gifted students? Deal with the inequality of income and of the school system. Last time I checked, Finland does pretty well with that strategy.')
