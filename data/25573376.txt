On the American side media violence is penalized less (in terms of adult ratings) than nudity&#x2F;sex while across the ocean you see the opposite trend.<p>Can anyone with more exposure to European (or Aussie&#x2F;Kiwi) media confirm&#x2F;deny this? I&#x27;m curious to hear the reason why if true.')
