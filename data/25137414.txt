As someone who is relatively interested in this stuff but by no means an expert (i.e. I&#x27;ve read a few pop-psych books), do you have any further reading I could do to see where you&#x27;re coming from with this claim?<p>Because, by my very limited understanding, I always thought something like electromagnetism was always thought to be &quot;concrete,&quot; for lack of a better word - whereas I always thought that sociology and psychology were much more subjective fields (and this is why it&#x27;s impossible to, for example, predict whether a stock will go up or down). Is there any reading to suggest the latter?')
