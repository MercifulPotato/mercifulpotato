Item(by='romanoderoma', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607774153, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384175, text='If that was even possible, you would have to wait at least 10 years.<p>At that point who knows if tablets as a form factor survived.<p>To be clear, I think that a tablet (not specifically iPads which are expensive in their segment as any other Apple device, there is no cheap option) could replace most PC nowadays, but to reiterate what&#x27;s already been said: Apple is not present in too many places, for a reason.<p>To make an example: I work for a company in Italy with 14 thousands employees.<p>The laptops they give us software developers today are gonna be the accountants PCs of the future. Unless they break before. In that case they are replaced by the supplier with something with similar specs but new. Probably it will be a different brand, depending on what&#x27;s available at the moment.<p>It&#x27;s not imaginable that a company like this, which is relatively small if we look at the real giants of the World (including many in Italy as well), will replace every PC with tablets, not only for monetary reasons, but because they had to re-train thousands of employees. Being in Italy I&#x27;m sure that only talking about it would end up in a strike. No kidding.<p>But even assuming that it would happen, they would buy cheap Asus tablets.<p>But even assuming it would be iPads, does this software the company has been using for 15 years runs on it?<p>The answer is most certainly &quot;no, it doesn&#x27;t&quot;.<p>Battery life and power efficiency is not a factor in such environments, they prefer to plant trees, be part of a renewable energy consortium or power the offices with solar panels, that they can also spin in PR, than buy Apple devices because they have an incredibly power efficient CPU. \nIt doesn&#x27;t really matter to them.<p>And I tell you this knowing that I work there because I know that ethically speaking they are vastly better than the average. They really do care of many small things that many others don&#x27;t, but Apple ARM CPUs aren&#x27;t one of them.')
