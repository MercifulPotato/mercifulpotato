They have a shop where designs are done in caffeinated weekend pushes without input from other developers. This sounds like a shop full of junior developers. Engineering is not just about code. It is the balance of creation with constraints. They could have know the &quot;old-new&quot; system wouldn&#x27;t have worked if they had some idea of load, or were measuring latency. They could have used these measurements to push a better design if they bothered with a design process. People would have supported the design, and slogged through bugs if people were bought into it actually be the correct design. Instead, we had a system written twice.<p>There&#x27;s a reason senior engineers are paid what they&#x27;re paid, and it&#x27;s because it saves time like this. You pay a senior engineer because they sidestep these problems.')
