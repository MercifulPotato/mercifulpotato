The touch screen worked fine, and having a big map on the center console and a small map on the panel behind the steering wheel was really impressive to me.  Adaptive cruise control, lane assist, and proximity warnings made driving much less stressful than it used to be.<p>But I also have owned a car in 12 years, have only rented 4 cars in that time, and borrowed a parent&#x27;s car occasionally when visiting them, so I don&#x27;t really know if BMW&#x27;s work is really ahead of many others or if they&#x27;re more standard features you see in all cars.')
