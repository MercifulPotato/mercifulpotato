Imagine using all your political capital championing those non-issues and not really getting anything tangible back in return. What a waste, it makes the Republicans look similar to the college racket, they sure took the votes (the same way college sure takes the money).<p>The Democratic establishment is in danger of this fate in the long term as well.
