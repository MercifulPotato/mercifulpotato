Nor can it gamble on US partisanship in antitrust matters. By the time any antitrust process can have results, the internet economy is destroyed and just serves FAANG, even more than it does already. Maybe the EU is waiting until after US elections, but they absolutely shouldn&#x27;t put any hope in another administration (who are, after all, partly responsible for this monopolistic situation, and taking money from Google). Just as the digital tax initiative is going nowhere, so will this antitrust process.')
