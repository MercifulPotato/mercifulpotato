It is fairly straightforward to prove that you stuffed a thousand ballets if you actually did that, we just have to show evidence of what you did! It is  impossible to prove that you or someone else didn&#x27;t stuff ballots, because it is logically a possible that it occurred. IE proving existence is something that is possible, proving non-existence is something that is impossible.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m saying the wrong doing is invalidating the electoral process.<p>I&#x27;m saying that there is simply no evidence of wrong doing so the courts have nothing to act on.
