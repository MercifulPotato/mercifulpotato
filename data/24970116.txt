I think person needs to understand the concept of alternative cost when approaching such problem. Sure, you will save money on the server itself, but you don&#x27;t get all other things that AWS is adding and you would have to one way or another do them by yourself. Even if your time is extremely cheap, I don&#x27;t think one is able to beat their price as much to justify doing all this work. They&#x27;ve been at it for years and their solution is battle tested and you may be adding issues you won&#x27;t be aware of that will bite you once you get growing.')
