Binaries for SFU&#x2F;SUA could not be executed on a system without SFU&#x2F;SUA configured, because the kernel subsystem would be absent.  (I also don&#x27;t believe you could call win32 from SUA, but my memory is foggy.)<p>Cygwin and MSYS are attempts to map UNIX semantics onto windows system calls, to varying degrees of success.')
