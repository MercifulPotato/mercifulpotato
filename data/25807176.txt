When folks start becoming managers of managers this becomes a bigger focus of their job.<p>I see the whole &quot;agile&quot; movement as a response to this problem. In an effort to mitigate the &quot;error bars&quot; of an estimate a process that iterates over 2 week sprints allows for estimate corrections during development. It isn&#x27;t obvious to everyone but this is just upping the sample rate on the estimation signal to get a better handle on the noise and thus the signal to noise ratio.')
