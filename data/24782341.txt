This will probably more than offset the general energy savings in electromobiles. Progressively you want to transition most of heating to heat pumps (COP of 3.0 should be quite possible) rather than direct heating, such as oil ovens and such (COP of basically &lt; 1). Practical heat pump motors usually run on electricity and maybe natural gas but probably not heavy oil, coal or even wood. Also insulation of private homes will probably improve a lot in the coming years. It is a very complicated matter that is frequently occluded by politics in some form. It is nice to have interesting facts being mentioned, e.g. I didn&#x27;t know the 8x blade diameter distance figure.')
