Even with LG onboard, LG is supplying only 20% for the upcoming iPhone 12. My point is, Apple always slaps a fancy marketing name to their screens (Retina...) but in reality the the quality is worse than Samsung phones. But Apple buyers ask if Samsung Phones have a Retina display...and when the answer is no, they feel they&#x27;re getting an inferior phone.')
