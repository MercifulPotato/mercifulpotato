Kavanaugh just wrote an opinion last week that it is critical that election results <i>must</i> be called by TV networks on the night of the election. This is of course despite the fact that (a) there is no such law, (b) none of the founding fathers could have ever imagined TV networks calling elections day-of, (c) and election results are routinely not known for many days&#x2F;weeks after an election. This bizarre opinion is just one of countless that disproves the &quot;originalism&quot; myth.<p>And as for legislating from the bench, few are more guilty of that than Alito and Thomas.')
