Item(by='izietto', descendants=None, kids=[25498706, 25495281], score=None, time=1608561029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25494789, text='I really dislike this:<p><pre><code>  {b: 0, c: 1} =&gt; {b:}\n  p b #=&gt; 0\n</code></pre>\nIt is so weird that a variable named `b` is initialized after an hash-key-like symbol is referenced (`b:`). It&#x27;s something you&#x27;ve never seen in Ruby before and that I hope I&#x27;ll never encounter along my career as Ruby on Rails developer.')
