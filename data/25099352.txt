How sociopathic bullshitters and strongmen rule, instead of aim for greater good that would at the end benefit us all, including those on the very top. To know that its perfectly possible to have a proper paradise here, sustainable, peaceful, yet we will never get there unless we change some pretty fundamental human traits.<p>And that is ignoring all the crap that went down this year and still coming strong.<p>I would say it actually takes quite a bit of ignorance to ward off semi-constant depression. What helps, I mean properly helps, apart from professional help is frequent physical activity and being in the nature, ideally both combined. Nature has some weird magic effect of recharging some imaginary internal battery and helps you take more life&#x27;s bullshit and just keep going. Works for literally everybody I know. Covid obviously heavily interferes with both, depending on location.')
