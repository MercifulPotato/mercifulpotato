The former slaves weren&#x27;t free from the economic coercion their destitution entailed. Just because you aren&#x27;t someones literal property anymore doesn&#x27;t necessarily make you free or in any position to demand a livable wage. The planters were well aware of the disposablity of the wage labourer and even used that it their pro-slavery propaganda that went something like &quot;We actually need to take care of our property, unlike you, who just replace them&quot;.')
