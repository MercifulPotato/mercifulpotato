In college I had a habit of waking up with the exact minimum amount of time necessary to get to class. I would throw myself out of bed, get dressed and brush my teeth as quickly as possible, sprint down the stairs, and then race my bike as quickly as I could to class--only to fall back asleep as soon as I was in my chair.<p>In fairness, I was rather sleep deprived at that time.')
