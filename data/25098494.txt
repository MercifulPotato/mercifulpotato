The reality is Israel is a neo-colonial state that acts as a nuclear armed forward operating base in the middle east for the US. Without US arms and funds, Israel&#x27;s militaristic stance would not be possible. As a Jew, I look forward to the day we can end the wars, end funding of an apartheid regime, stop the mistreatment of Palestinians who live in a blockaded prison city, and the attainment of real democracy in the region for every group without imposing a fake version at the point of a US gun.<p>I look forward to the liberation of Afghanistan and Iraq from neocolonial rule. I look forward to a new era when control of oil fields is no longer a matter of geostrategic importance and drilling will incur sanctions by an international body.')
