The story is like this: I was born into a christian family, but like many young people, and helped by some written works, some healthy amount skepticism, other not-so-healthy things, and what I saw inside and outside my social circles, I came to doubt my previous beliefs.<p>Anyway, then I discovered Aron&#x27;s blog, and it was like a new world open to me. Something that I&#x27;ve experienced very few times in my life; maybe when I found SICP&#x2F;Lispâ€¦<p>And it could even ve said that I discovered that blog thanks to SICP since it went something like this: OCW &gt; SICP &gt; Paul Graham &gt; Hacker News &gt; (eventually) The Blog. ^^<p>Scott does write from an atheist viewpoint, since he is atheist, but even though I am not, I still enjoy his writing very much, just as I&#x27;ve liked many of PG&#x27;s essays or LessWrong articles. It is not necessary to hold the same beliefs to enjoy intellectual fellowship&#x2F;communion as it is (usually) exemplified by Hacker News itself.<p>Also, if you want to, I can share with you some of my favorite articles there. I have a huge list though.')
