In short:<p>- Companies can sign up for a paid account and build their &quot;remote profile&quot;<p>- People looking for remote job can learn more about these companies, their remote culture, jobs and more<p>RemoteHub started out as &quot;remote companies on a map&quot;, but now only paid accounts can build their maps and so I wanted to make a more simple (free) version.<p>So I created a Map Builder:<p>1. Add cities your remote team works from<p>2. I will count your cities, countries and timezones for you<p>3. Add your logo and name<p>4. Generate your map (and share it if you want)<p>Would be fun to see some new remote teams coming from Hacker News!')
