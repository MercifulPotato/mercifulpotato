Last year we launched Zepel on HN and we got a tremendous amount of feedback and as well as our first bunch of paying customers.<p>Over the past year, based on the conversations with our users, we have been fine tuning the product and filling the missing functionality gaps.<p>While talking to our users we realised one of the biggest pain points with building software products is deciding what to focus on next. Yet the end users of your product are providing those very signals through multiple customer facing tools that your organisation uses. We felt that to answer this question effectively teams need the ability to get data from multiple tools that they use such as Intercom, Zendesk, Canny, Github Issues, etc to prioritise and plan work.<p>That’s why we have launched a new aspect to the product called Zepel Streams.<p>Streams lets you consolidate customer feedback, feature requests, bug reports, and even internal requests from several sources, prioritize, and align your teams on the desired outcome.<p>As a part of this launch, our tracking &amp; execution side of the product will be renamed to Zepel Squads.<p>We would love to get your feedback on Zepel! Thank you.')
