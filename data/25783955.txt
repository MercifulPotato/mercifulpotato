Do you have any benchmarks against Borg and Restic?<p>I&#x27;m looking for smaller single-host backup tools. I have approximately a ~1Tb Postgres database I need to backup once a month (that&#x27;s how often genomic data is released) and I&#x27;m a little worried about Restic RAM usage, since I have hit it when backing up a few other files. I&#x27;m trying to figure out if snebu would be a good fit for my low-ram machines.')
