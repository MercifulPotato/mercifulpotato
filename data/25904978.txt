Invoking API&#x27;s that have been around for a long time, usually meaning OS API&#x27;s<p>2. Hand-optimized performance sensitive code where, for example, you&#x27;re auditing every runtime memory allocation that has to be done in the inner loops<p>3. Modifying legacy code that&#x27;s written in C++<p>In all of those cases you have to dip into unsafe territory regularly, so you end up with pretty much what Rust does with safe&#x2F;unsafe, but with less in the way of the language helping you to ferret out your memory handling bugs. Every time I do it, even if I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve created memory handling bugs, and even when my tools don&#x27;t catch anything, I always leave with a low grade fear that my code will end up in a CVE somewhere.')
