But can that even work, and if so, for how long?<p>Imagine a libertarian owned spacecraft in which the inhabitants decided to just leave the sphere of influence of that government. Would they be chased? What about children born on that ship? What if those children were abused?<p>How far should we chase them? I feel like humanity should punish some crimes universally, but murder isn&#x27;t necessarily the worst crime.<p>We do need some system of space justice, but I&#x27;m not sure what form it should take.')
