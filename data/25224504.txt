And while the style of this music has evolved quite a bit, new instruments introduced, the essential features have not gone away.<p>This music is also not written down (intentionally, I might add), so while roughly the same forms have been practiced for 100s of years, most of what is remembered and played is from the past 150 years or so. You can call this era classical, if you will.')
