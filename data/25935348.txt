You cannot rely on any one source for the full story. You must read multiple perspectives, ideally from different points in the political spectrum.</i><p>The problem is that counter-intuitively, in the past with limited news sources, you&#x27;re more or less forced to hear more sides of the story. A newspaper would carry both e.g. conservatives and liberals (at least a few of the side it didn&#x27;t favor) to attract people. If you bought it, you had the chance to see the other side expressed.<p>Now with the internet, we can loose ourselves in an echo bubble of our own creation (only reading stuff on &quot;our&quot; side, since we&#x27;re no longer forced to get our news wholesale like in print newspaper format). Or the news website or social media site can elect to show us just (or much more of) the stuff we like by itself.')
