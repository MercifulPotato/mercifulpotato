Item(by='giantrobot', descendants=None, kids=[25577551], score=None, time=1609292172, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566834, text='Starship isn&#x27;t a very good option. While Starship can lift a lot of mass to LEO in order for it to be reusable it needs to then get it all to the Moon&#x27;s surface and then <i>take off</i> from the Moon&#x27;s surface and then get back to Earth.<p>Every gram of fuel is one less gram of payload. So a Starship either needs to carry all of its fuel needed for Lunar take-off and TEI (significantly reducing payload) or refuel on site. Since there&#x27;s no LOX and Methane deposits on the Moon every Starship Moon landing would need both sent to the Moon ahead of it.<p>Even if you want to assume you can find a bunch of water ice under the regolith you then need to send up a water cracking factory, compressors, and literally tons of solar panels. Then you still don&#x27;t have any methane. So even if you <i>just</i> have to send methane you&#x27;ve had to build a huge amount of infrastructure out of technology that doesn&#x27;t exist just to reuse Starships. If you don&#x27;t reuse Starships you don&#x27;t get much dollar savings over using Falcons.<p>Starship is designed to use aerobreaking for landing. This is something that&#x27;s viable on Earth and Mars but useless on the Moon. So any Starship landing on the Moon needs fuel to de-orbit <i>and</i> land, with aerobreaking only the terminal phase of the landing needs fuel.<p>Starship&#x27;s economics only really work if there&#x27;s fuel available in LEO, its destination, and its destination has an atmosphere for aerobraking. If those things aren&#x27;t true it needs to carry all of the fuel needed for its mission from Earth&#x27;s surface which significantly reduces its payload.<p>Doing shit in space is hard.')
