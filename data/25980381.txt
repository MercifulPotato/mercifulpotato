The only instance of politicians that i have seen is Trump dancing (he wasnt ridiculed in the meme), and the fact that AOC and Don Trump Jr agreed.<p>re 4: You can not begin to imagine the amount of bots posting absolute nonsense during the time. Had it not been for the mod team and the reddit team, the whole reddit would have shut down.')
