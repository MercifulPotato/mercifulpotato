I can’t stand any of the Linux desktops. And believe me I have tried hard to like them. I love programming and have been programming since I taught myself machine code programming when I was 11. I recommend not assuming that people who choose to use Windows somehow don’t get it or don’t see the “magic” of whatever you happen to like. People are different with different tastes and experiences.')
