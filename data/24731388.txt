I am completely uninterested in using a fake digital currency inside your app. Doing that tells me everything I need to know about the app and the developer(s) behind it.<p>In my book every &quot;free-to-play&quot; game that monetizes like this (even if they try to say they aren&#x27;t &quot;pay-to-win&quot;&#x2F;&quot;pay-to-play&quot;) is trash. I don&#x27;t want to hear &quot;It&#x27;s a fun game and you don&#x27;t have to pay to enjoy it&#x2F;play it&quot;, that&#x27;s bullshit. I&#x27;ve yet to play an example of such a game that didn&#x27;t (eventually) make the game unplayable&#x2F;unbeatable without paying.')
