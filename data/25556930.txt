I wear headphones 8+ hours a day for work. Around two months ago I upgraded my 10-year-old (cheap, wired) Sennheisers to some mid-range wireless ones with noise canceling, they&#x27;re a bit heavier but otherwise just as comfortable and noise canceling is awesome for helping me focus. I&#x27;ve never had any negative effects from either (although I&#x27;m careful to keep the volume down).')
