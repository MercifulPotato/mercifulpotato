This is just something hacked together over a christmas weekend. The points you mentioned definitely need to be addressed before this library can even be called production-ready.<p>Though I would push back on the notion that because the problem is big and big players already do the job, why even try. There&#x27;s a huge number of indie hackers, bootstrappers with small projects that can definitely benefit from an open source solution like this than have to pay $30&#x2F;month.<p>I have already tabulated the items needed to make this a quality package and not just another hacky js library. I would invite you to keep track of the project and keep us honest :)')
