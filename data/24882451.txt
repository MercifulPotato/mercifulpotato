It was called MakeCode <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;makecode" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;makecode</a> and I remember it because they had a nice Minecraft integration. Well... it still exists: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;minecraft.makecode.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;minecraft.makecode.com&#x2F;</a><p>So to go on a bit of a rant: there&#x27;s Scratch, MakeCode, Tilecode now, on top of &quot;fantasy consoles&quot; and dozens of very easy-to-use game engines (like, really, lots of them, in the browser, native... way below the Unity and Godot stepping stones). You know what&#x27;s sad? Somehow I feel like we can&#x27;t solve this barrier to entry for casual coding. On the one hand, a teacher or parent wanting to teach their kid(s) is overwhelmed with choice. On the other hand there&#x27;s the attention economy basically saying: &quot;don&#x27;t bother.&quot;<p>Later on in the academic career, you have lecturers either having to overwhelm students (especially non-CS students) with all the best practices at once (you need this IDE, and GIT, and tests...) or having to resort to something which looks like it&#x27;s made for kids and &quot;won&#x27;t make it in the real world&quot; (speaking from experience here).<p>It&#x27;s a pity that computing got so complicated. This is a hard problem to solve. Nonetheless, I applaud any efforts made towards this.')
