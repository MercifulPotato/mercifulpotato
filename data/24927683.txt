Why?<p>Do you read the code of conduct when you attend a conference? Personally, I haven&#x27;t even read the code of conduct for my job, and certainly wouldn&#x27;t read one if I was speaking at or attending a conference.<p>The CoCs are completely unnecessary and, as shown in this example, arbitrarily enforced. In the blog post I read that their CoC prohibits threats and assaults. Consider how silly that is. If someone&#x27;s threatening you or sexually assaulting you you&#x27;re going to go the police, not report them for a code of conduct violation.<p>Likewise, for more mundane stuff, it&#x27;s all common sense. Don&#x27;t be obnoxious, rude, make people uncomfortable, etc. If you are doing that, they&#x27;ll ask you to leave and ban you from future attendance if it&#x27;s severe. You shouldn&#x27;t need a CoC to know that and they don&#x27;t need one to do it.<p>Consider something that&#x27;s not covered by their CoC. Maybe I bring my pet skunk with me and they don&#x27;t have a provision about skunks in their CoC. Are they now powerless? No, they&#x27;re going to do what&#x27;s sensible and ask me to not have the skunk, and if I say &quot;Your code of conduct doesn&#x27;t prohibit skunks&quot; they&#x27;re going to ask me to leave.<p>Codes of conduct are silly. They create these dumb regulations and committees for no real reason and create the apparatus for mistakes like these.<p>I&#x27;m actually shocked that Jeremy supported and still supports codes of conduct. He seems like a smart guy and they&#x27;re obviously a bad idea.')
