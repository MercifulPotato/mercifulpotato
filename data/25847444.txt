Open sourcing something is an act of commoditization - and that&#x27;s great for businesses to do if the thing they are commoditizing complements their core business. E.g. you sell consultancy around X, so you open source X (cf Magento, RHEL). But if what you actually sell is X, then open sourcing it is shooting yourself in the foot. And sadly, if what you&#x27;re selling is &#x27;deployment of X&#x27;, then there&#x27;s a risk AWS will just come along and sell the same thing - because they&#x27;re in the business of commoditizing deployment. Basically if you want to build a business around an open source project, you need to figure out a business model where you get paid for some part of the equation that hasn&#x27;t been commoditized yet. I really hope the OSS community figures that out, because I&#x27;d love for OSS development to be good business.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;strategy-letter-v&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;strategy-letter-v&#x2F;</a>')
