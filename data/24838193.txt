They&#x27;re typically meat, but I guess I&#x27;ve never assumed they had to be; just that most plant-based sandwiches are closer to other things.  Interestingly, salmon in patty form is usually referred to as a salmon patty even after being cooked (at least around me).<p>I don&#x27;t find it at all confusing.  A veggie burger is a patty made of veggies, just like a turkey burger is a patty made of turkey.  The only case where I think it might be confusing is if the patty is made out of something that could plausibly also be blended into the meat of a regular burger.  If the box said &quot;jalapeno burger&quot; and inside was veggie burgers with jalapenos in them, I&#x27;d feel mislead.')
