Item(by='d33lio', descendants=None, kids=[25002965], score=None, time=1604613666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25002403, text='&quot;mandatory spending&quot; - right<p>I take a bigger issue with programs like student loan debt forgiveness which would be a slap in the face to poor people like myself who worked their way through college in order to no longer be burdened by loans.  Not to mention the fact that without a refresh of regulation on universities (specifically graduate degrees) loan forgiveness would just further embolden universities to increase tuition.<p>The issue with taxes in this country is that the budget is expected to always be met WITH excess.  That&#x27;s the disgusting part, the assumption that &quot;well we can go over and shell out benefits to our beneficiaries (people who voted for us) and the american tax payer will foot the bill&quot; <i>is</i> atrocious.<p>Both parties are guilty of this, however I also find it ironic that Americans (specifically privileged americans) seem to think that &quot;taxing the rich&quot; is a solution, when a) rich people already pay an overwhelming majority of taxes, b) the rich will always find ways to out-smart the government and avoid taxes they deem as unfit and c) even if you taxed earners above $400k 95% of their income it would only amount to maybe a trillion dollars - so not even close to bringing the national deficit down.')
