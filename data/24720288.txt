If you have a low enough case count and a well functioning health department that is doing contact tracing, then it&#x27;s helpful to confirm that your kid is positive.<p>If you&#x27;re in an area where neither of those things apply then, for a child a test isn&#x27;t going to change anything. It&#x27;s not going to change their treatment. If it&#x27;s positive they&#x27;ll tell you to isolate, but if it&#x27;s negative, there&#x27;s a high enough false negative rate, and there are enough cases that it&#x27;s still very likely they have it, so you&#x27;ll still want to treat it like they do.')
