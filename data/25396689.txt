The &quot;free&quot; IPv4 address is certainly a part of the price. (There are other parts like good maintenance, which you don&#x27;t necessarily get from cheaper competitors)<p>Scaleway charges you 1 â‚¬ &#x2F; month for such address whether you use it or not. That&#x27;s a 25% premium on the cheapest machine when in use. Much cheaper than AWS whether in use or not.<p>Not sure how many customers could perfectly live without the IPv4, but AWS seems to be in the market position to (covertly) charge them, too.')
