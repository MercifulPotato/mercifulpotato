The UX and UI make a lot of sense. You where supposed to have a lot of channel since you where usually creating one per game &#x2F; per team. I remember having channel lol-1, lol-2, cs-1, cs-2, etc, so that multiple team could play the same game at the same time without speaking over each other. Then you had a main channel where you where hanging out when not playing anything.<p>But discord became so popular, it stopped being used just has a &quot;game voip&quot; service and has a general messaging service. A lot of streamer&#x2F;youtuber use discord to host their community. I even know some company who switched to it when the pandemic started. And the fact and the matter is that discord was never designed for this.')
