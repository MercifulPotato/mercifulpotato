You could spend time narrowing down the set of logs to download... but in the time it takes to figure that out, you might as well just download them all.<p>Having &quot;home depot&quot; locally available for analysis is never a bad thing, plus you may be racing against time re log rotation, etc.<p>&gt; For someone that is all set-up and on top of things, this seems like something that is a day&#x27;s work and easily more, not counting follow-up work and validation to further investigate the additional questions that would inevitably (in my opinion) be raised on such a big dataset.<p>In the middle of a SEV, you don&#x27;t have a day to perform this kind of analysis. 15 minutes till the SLA clock starts ticking and customers are owed refunds.')
