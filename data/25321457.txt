YC was doing its first year. Cloud computing wasn&#x27;t really a thing yet. You had to have own your own metal if you were at any serious scale.<p>What I left out of my original story was that a third engineer chimed in (from Yahoo!) that asked if the real enemy to innovation here wasn&#x27;t the map-data companies whose terms made it impossible to leverage for innovation. The cost was prohibitively high to get started. It&#x27;s really what kept innovation back in maps and affording it was what google&#x27;s real advantage was.<p>But that&#x27;s a big reason why OpenStreetMaps exists today.')
