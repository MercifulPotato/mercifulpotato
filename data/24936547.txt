Low level thinking might sound like, “All the other classes are adding &lt; ApplicationController if they want to use this method, so I need to do that too. Otherwise it throws an error.’’<p>&gt; But high level thinking might be more like, “I need to access the ApplicationController class’ methods. Ruby supports inheritance, so I’ll add  &lt; ApplicationController to the class definition to let the compiler know that I’m inheriting it.”<p>I don&#x27;t think this is &quot;high level&quot; vs &quot;low level&quot; thinking. Both are just different approaches to discovering the same thing. It&#x27;s akin to learning guitar through tabulature vs standard notation.')
