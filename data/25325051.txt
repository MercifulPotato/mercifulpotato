Dime a dozen.  Every person who goes down this path has to make decisions like the ones described.  Read the YC library, it&#x27;s full of &quot;how tos&quot;.<p>I think the <i>more</i> interesting lessons and questions are (which they are not incentivized to have you think about):<p>-- Decide early on who&#x27;s going to control your path: you, the product, or the money?  Many figure out too late who&#x27;s in control.<p>-- Are you willing to hand over the keys if some day you discover you&#x27;re not the right person to lead?  What will you do if you find out this isn&#x27;t what you signed up for?<p>-- What are you <i>not</i> willing to do in pursuit of growth?<p>-- Are you willing to walk away from a lot of money today, for something deeper tomorrow?<p>-- Who do you want to be, and what does this company do for you in your life?<p>I myself generally hate that things have to become &quot;people stories&quot;, but in my experience, these are far more fundamental questions that you will have to confront when you talk to your team, the VCs, the investors, more so than anything about how to manage a feature roadmap or the perennially boring, &quot;when to hire a CMO&quot;, etc.')
