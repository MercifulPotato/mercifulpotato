I use it for 4 external monitors (2 vertical) and it&#x27;s a god-send. I also recommend people look into software to move their app windows into prefered locations. I use Phoenix [0] to resize&#x2F;place my windows in their designated spots when I hit a hotkey. I tried stuff like Stay [1] and a few other similar tools that I forget the names of but they didn&#x27;t work well or at least didn&#x27;t work well on a multi-monitor setup. Phoenix required a little more up-front work but now it works perfectly for my needs.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kasper&#x2F;phoenix" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kasper&#x2F;phoenix</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cordlessdog.com&#x2F;stay&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cordlessdog.com&#x2F;stay&#x2F;</a>')
