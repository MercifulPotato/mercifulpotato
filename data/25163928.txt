We don&#x27;t get fantasy-world factories in the USA. We just lose jobs and all control, with the products produced in terrible conditions abroad.<p>So, do we want to suffer the cost of the regulations? If so, simply keep the status quo with the Jones Act. If not, then deal with the problem directly, and eviscerate the regulations that are making Americans uncompetitive.')
