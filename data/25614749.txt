Item(by='lisper', descendants=None, kids=[25614969, 25615049], score=None, time=1609610380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614633, text='&gt; there was plenty of evidence in the early 90s that HIV caused AIDS. It was conclusive.<p>That is far from clear, at least to me.  The main thing that bothered me at the time, and which I&#x27;ve never seen satisfactorily explained, is that 1) AIDS was widely believed to be 100% fatal, 2) believed to be caused by HIV, but 3) the HIV virus had incubation periods of [EDIT: up to] ten years or more.  I don&#x27;t see any way to validly conclude that HIV causes AIDS at a time when the virus had only been known for ten years or so.  One could advance this as a plausible hypothesis (one which ultimately proved to be correct), but in the mid-90s I think there was still room for valid doubt.<p>But I&#x27;m very open to being convinced that I was wrong about this (not that it matters much at this point, but it is of historical interest to me).')
