What if it&#x27;s just a really close copy of your face&#x2F;body generated by machine, stitched together in a very believable fashion? You could maybe claim ownership of your likeness, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be possible to really enforce - Many people look near identical already. Or they add a mole here or there and claim - look - clearly not you!<p>People make all kinds of claims all the time, including transparently self-serving ones like your example, but that doesn&#x27;t mean anyone buys them.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure what&#x27;s going to happen is the law will make it clear that porn generated from your likeness and distributed without your consent is as illegal as revenge porn.  Then a bunch of people who did it anyway will go to jail and that will put a strong chilling effect on the whole thing.  In most cases, the people with the motive an ability to make machine-generated porn of a particular person will be relatively easy to find.')
