Or use any pharmaceutical products or cosmetics that are mass produced? Shampoo? Soap? Hand sanitizer?<p>Do you wear clothing that you didn&#x27;t make yourself from raw cotton you made? Or shop at a store like Gap, Cotton On, Target, Zara etc?<p>Do you drive a car? Or take Uber? Or use something like a bus or car, or other vehicle made by a large multinational engineering company?<p>Do you eat any fast foods? Or eat at restaurants that use any produce or mass produced raw ingredients? Or use any kitchen utensils or kitchenware? Do you shop at say IKEA?<p>Or do you use electronics like a laptop, phone or desktop computer?<p>Or do you keep any of your money at a bank? Or use things like car insurance?<p>It slightly irks me when people claim they want to stick it to the man, and don&#x27;t like &quot;those corporations&quot;.<p>We have a Green party politician in Australia who lives off the grid, and grows his own produce. Whilst I don&#x27;t agree with all his policies - I respect that he lives consistently with his beliefs.<p>If you&#x27;re on HN - I&#x27;d posit that your life (like mine, and billions of others) is dependent on multinational corporations for our current quality of life.<p>If you don&#x27;t agree with one of them, that fine, but often it&#x27;s less to do with principles and more &quot;their customer service is terrible&quot; or &quot;they didn&#x27;t fix this one issue that is very important to me&quot;, or &quot;I read on Reddit&#x2F;FB&#x2F;Techcrunch this terrible fact about them&quot;')
