Problem solved. Sonos still has an edge on the actual audio hardware (that none of the existing &quot;smart speaker&quot; competition can match, besides maybe the HomePod but the lack of Spotify support is a major dealbreaker for a lot of people).<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t see how data collection helps with any of this; selling consumer data alone isn&#x27;t going to be enough to keep the company afloat, and introducing ads into the audio stream itself will be a major no-no (unless the speakers are given for free, but then the costs of that would outweigh the advertising profits). I don&#x27;t think speakers are a thing that can be monetized with data, full stop - and that&#x27;s okay.<p>Most likely the whole idea behind the data collection &amp; analytics is to justify the salaries of their marketing department and give the engineering department something to do (analytics show that X percent of customers loved this new feature, let&#x27;s rebuild&#x2F;expand it) while ultimately all that people want is a speaker that plays their Spotify and gets out of the way (and unlike other hardware, people aren&#x27;t - and shouldn&#x27;t be - used to replacing their speakers every year).')
