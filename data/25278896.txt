It had potential but it is intermixed with political ranting that is unproductive. This is disappointing both because politics seems irrelevant and also because the unsubstantive political jabs undermine the credibility of this entire effort by giving away the author&#x27;s bias.<p>But leaving the political bits aside, I can&#x27;t help but think this is an article written for the uninformed. Complexity isn&#x27;t a bad thing. It is the consequence of specialization and technological advancement. A lot of people bemoan things like complexity in our financial system without understanding why things are the way they are, and without honest consideration that this complexity might actually make sense. That ignorance then causes them to distrust the system or pursue change for change sake, which is what it seems like this article is setting up for.<p>For me, I can accept complexity in many aspects of my surroundings because people voluntarily built up much of that complexity through mutually-beneficial transactions (that is, free trade, supply-demand, and other market dynamics). It means those complexities have survived Democratic policy-making processes, survived market pressures, survived individuals accepting the beneficial tradeoffs that come with complexity, and so on. Without knowing specifics about some complex system, there is automatically a lot for me to trust and accept as a black box.<p>The reality is that complexity and lack of understanding is inevitable, and it has also always been the state of things even before human-created complexity. No matter what, an individual will not be omniscient and will need to take some things as they come. Some aspects of life and our environment will remain black boxes. That doesn&#x27;t mean they are broken or need adjustment to fit our fragile egos. It means we need to accept this situation with humility, and learn more about some area with earnest curiosity rather than viewing it as &quot;too complex&quot;.')
