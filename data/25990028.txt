It&#x27;s really 10.<p>Microsoft offers 5 years of &quot;mainstream&quot; support, where the OS can get feature enhancements and so on, plus an additional 5 years of security and critical bug fixes.<p>All versions of Windows since Windows XP have seen at least 10 years of support, which makes a lot of this article obsolete.<p>Someone could have got their PC with Windows 7 in 2009, had a free upgrade to Windows 10 and can get updates until at least 2025.')
