Item(by='teddyh', descendants=None, kids=[25319762], score=None, time=1607211143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25319174, text='The <i>general</i> incentive to make money always exists, yes, but if LVT is implemented, there would, I assume, be an almost insurmountable force compelling landowners to do so.  I compared LVT with the idea of “fiduciary duty” with intentional precision; CEOs are also, in general, incentivized to make money, but the idea behind decrying the alleged fiduciary duty is that a CEO is supposedly more or less <i>forced</i> to do whatever makes the most money, regardless if they feel it would be bad in the long run, inhumane, or even unethical.<p>The same principle seem to apply to LVT: A landowner would, it seems, be forced, by the taxes extracted from them, to generate a matching (or larger) income by the land, regardless if they might feel that the community would be better served by using the land for something which would, incidentally, make less money for them personally.<p>If the object of LVT is to prevent inter-generational wealth transfer, I would assume that there would be vastly more effective ways to accomplish this more directly.  Or there could at least be some carve-out which limits the effect of a LVT to those instances.')
