For a condition you know nothing about?  Really.  Fine, then it&#x27;s useless, and I&#x27;ve surrounded myself with idiots, all of my careful testing and attempts to understand my condition have failed.<p>This kinda of nonsense, where I debate the very meaning of &quot;me&quot; to some extent is tiring.  Even if I&#x27;m wrong in all of this, I&#x27;m not harming you, you&#x27;re someone online, but I try really hard to not be a burden on anyone I come in contact with.  I actually try to be a net positive to the world, in my small way.  It&#x27;s already hard enough for me to wake up every day and face the world without just ending my pain.  Don&#x27;t make me debate my sanity while I&#x27;m at it.')
