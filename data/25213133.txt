Many of my family members are vegetarians and some of them are in the milk business (small scale). Pretty much everyone knows that the cow&#x27;s milk should go to the calves. Sure almost all companies lie in their ads but people aren&#x27;t as stupid as some would think. Some people are under the impression that they are into some great secret of the world (about how cows are handled in the milk business). But the reality is that most people know about it but don&#x27;t care.<p>So to reiterate the number one reason most people (that I know of) become vegetarians because they are disgusted by meat. I wish there was some great vision to it but there isn&#x27;t.')
