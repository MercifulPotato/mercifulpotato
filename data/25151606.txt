A couple of questions:<p>Does the nominal bandwidth cost of $5 for 1 TB mean it&#x27;s $5 each month for a TB per month? Or is it simply &quot;every 1TB transferred adds $5&quot;, no matter how long it took to use that much?<p>For the rent to own plan, the only thing you&#x27;re paying after payoff is the bandwidth fee? (Which for minimal usage might be under $5 or $5 depending on the above answer) Is that right?')
