Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[24993475], score=None, time=1604526127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24992476, text='two things.<p>&gt; Let’s say I buy and losslessly rip a DVD and upload it to Megaupload as a backup or to have access to it on the go. I don’t share the link with anyone and thus don’t infringe on the copyright by redistributing the content publicly.<p>this right here is (sadly) already a DMCA violation for the person who rips the DVD. I&#x27;m not sure whether or not that makes it a different situation for megaupload vs. a person uploading a rip of a DVD they didn&#x27;t own in the first place.<p>second, the lawyers can probably argue that megaupload knew (or should have known) how widely each upload was being distributed. it&#x27;s hard to argue you don&#x27;t know that infringement is going on if you see hundreds&#x2F;thousands of downloads through a link to a file whose hash matches a known illicit copy. maybe they were at least smart enough not to keep these kinds of logs, I dunno.')
