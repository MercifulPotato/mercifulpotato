And some apparently legal accounting tricks allow the loan repayment to lose its precedence, and when time comes to repay, suddenly there is no money.<p>It is indeed the creditors money that is lost. And AFAIK it is legal. I just wonder why it’s legal.<p>Much like in the subprime crisis, the original creditor knows quite well the likelihood of recovering the loan is low, but they sell it to a dumber creditor (often pension funds) who does not.<p>Unlike toysrus and hostess, the subprime thing included a huge mount of illegal things by many of the parties, but still hardly any enforcement - so I guess it doesn’t matter all that much if it’s legal or not.')
