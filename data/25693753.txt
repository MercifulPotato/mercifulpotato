So Twitter et al need to be thinking about how to get ahead of the complaints that the left has against section 230 (the left hates it because they are not forced to aggressively moderate, the right hates it because they are allowed to moderate at all). This was <i>not</i> looking likely to be something they had to worry about until the surprise sweep in Georgia, so I&#x27;d argue that may have played as big a role as the craziness in DC.')
