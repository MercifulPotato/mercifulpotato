When they tell a story, I appreciate them for much the same reason that I enjoy short stories and novellas: the author gets their point across.<p>I am not a fan of long games.  They consume my time like the cookie monster consumes cookies.  The worse games are full of filler.  The best games are hard to set aside for a while without loosing track of where I am.<p>Yet the long games are usually more memorable on the sole merit of the time spent with them.  If that is true for most players, I admire the developers for their ability to persist in a market where the odds are stacked against them.')
