Super disappointing move by YouTube. It was definitely one of my favorite channels for science education.<p>It seems from his twitter that he even left Oakland for Austin since December when that all went down.<p>But then look at how WSB was shutdown when it presented a real threat to the establishment. I think this is the same thing happening, but Josiah and the CDC were actually just informing people how gene therapies work in the most biohacker&#x2F;biopunk way, which is near and dear to my heart for reasons I already explained.')
