It changed the playing field from &quot;you can use our free app as long as you give us data for marketing or not use it&quot; to  &quot;you can provide a free service in the EU as long as you dont collect data for marketing or dont provide it&quot;<p>Without making a judgement on the merits of the approach, as a user&#x2F;individual I appreciate the power this gives to protect my data. As a company&#x2F;developer the conplexity of navigating the landmines that this poses makes me understand why a lot non EU companies decide to just block EU users.
