I&#x27;ll spin it like this:<p>Your job satisfaction&#x2F;pay are a function of your impact. Your impact is a function of your leverage.<p>If you&#x27;re a &quot;pure coder&quot; who doesn&#x27;t have any of the other skills you mentioned, your output is incredibly limited. At best, you produce a day&#x27;s worth of code in a day, but you also require someone to manage you closely to make sure you code the right stuff.<p>The more of these other skills you have, the more you can (a) work independently (b) make others more productive and (c) make sure your team&#x2F;business is doing the right things and (d) drive overall efficiency.<p>The more of these things you do, you become orders of magnitude more impactful than a pure coder.')
