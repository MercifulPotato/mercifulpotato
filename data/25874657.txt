Most of the time I&#x27;m pretty sharp, although I definitely have days where I basically can&#x27;t get anything done.  I have just started using Anki to great effect (preparing for programming interviews is a nightmare if your brain is a sieve).<p>Since I know that my symptoms are almost entirely caused by diet, I have written down everything that I&#x27;ve eaten, every supplement that I&#x27;ve taken, every hour that I&#x27;ve slept, every noise or pain I feel in my stomach, and information about all of my bowel movements since 2017.<p>I thought I had things under control last year, and didn&#x27;t take any notes for 2 months.  Now I have an issue with H2S bacterial overgrowth, essentially a sulfur sensitivity.  &quot;If it can be measured, it can be managed.&quot;<p>The fact that I moved to Europe in October to avoid the pandemic and election nonsense, hasn&#x27;t helped me.  There are tons of supplements and tests that I would be able to get in the states that are simply unavailable in the country that I&#x27;m residing in.  Pretty frustrating, and tbh, I can&#x27;t wait to get back, hopefully late spring&#x2F;summer.')
