Surely PornHub employees could hypothetically be made up or misquoted in the same way the women in this story possibly were.<p>In that case, we&#x27;d know that the article was pure fiction, which indicates that the opposite case is true based on this strict ruleset of &quot;opinion pieces are always fiction&quot; and &quot;fiction is always to be treated as categorically false.&quot;')
