Item(by='IkmoIkmo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609373291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25586451, text='US pay is certainly higher for the top 5% earners than virtually any other country&#x27;s top 5% earners. But the litmus test of a country&#x27;s system is whether you&#x27;d want to live there, not knowing what person or in what family you&#x27;d be born to. If you know you&#x27;ll be a top 5% earner, of course the US is a better place than say Sweden. If you don&#x27;t, the US doesn&#x27;t look so hot.<p>Second, there&#x27;s work&#x2F;life balance, for example you can look at annual workhours and see there&#x27;s a 350 hour gap between the US and Sweden: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clockify.me&#x2F;assets&#x2F;images&#x2F;working-hours&#x2F;oecd-hours-worked.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clockify.me&#x2F;assets&#x2F;images&#x2F;working-hours&#x2F;oecd-hours-w...</a><p>350 hours is equivalent to 8.75 weeks (or more than 2 months) of 8 hour, 5-day workweeks. That&#x27;s a massive difference.<p>Second, Sweden has free education. Being a top 5% earner in the US sometimes comes easy, but often times you&#x27;re looking at medschool, lawschool or CS or whatever, that can set you back anywhere from 30k to 250k, with 7% average student loan interest rates.<p>Stuff like this can put a massive weight on your shoulders from age 18 til 38 or so, constantly climbing a corporate ladder, working crazy hours, and paying off a massive debt. All the while fearing that an economic crisis or some kind of disability leading to unemployment, can ruin you. In a country like Sweden there&#x27;s no such weight on your shoulders, subsidised, and a massive social safety net. Quality of life is quite stable, and you can both very much enjoy student life, and your life right after, all the way til old age, with a healthy work&#x2F;life balance.<p>You also don&#x27;t have to live in a city that you share with an extremely poor underclass, homelessness, crime, drug addiction, while paying a million for a single bedroom.<p>Of course I&#x27;m not saying everyone in tech is working 80 hours and getting crushed by debt while working in an overpriced city with some minor dystopian undertones. But when looking at these things, Sweden and the US are certainly on opposite sides of the spectrum. And it must be taken into account when looking at pay.<p>I&#x27;d love to move to the US for some time, the natural parks are amazing, I like the culture and the vibe. But work&#x2F;life balance, the lack of safety net if you&#x27;re unlucky and the general state of the country for many of its people, are repelling me. I&#x27;ve never thought of pay as something that attracts me to the US, it&#x27;s really not worth it for me because I&#x27;m not lacking anything (although I do make about $100k equivalent in western Europe, but even at much lower salaries when I was younger I loved it here).')
