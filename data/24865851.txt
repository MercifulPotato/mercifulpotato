I initially quoted a lot more and then trimmed it down, but deleted the wrong part. Let me try again:<p>&gt;From Todhunter&#x27;s biography [9] we learn that the reviewer was William Whewell, F.R.S. Whewell wrote:<p>&gt;<p>&gt;[...]<p>&gt;<p>&gt;&#x2F;Philosophers&#x2F; was felt to be too wide and too lofty a term, and was very properly forbidden them by Mr. Coleridge, both in his capacity of philologer and metaphysician; &#x2F;sarans&#x2F; was rather assuming, besides being French instead of English; some ingenious gentleman [Whewell himself] proposed that, by analogy with &#x2F;artist&#x2F;, they might form &#x2F;scientist&#x2F; [...]<p>The &quot;[Whewell himself]&quot; is an interjection by Sydney Ross. As I said that entire section is cited to the Todhunter biography, so I assumed Ross had found something in the the biography that would verify that Whewell was referring to himself, but I couldn&#x27;t find it myself.')
