It uses the Chromium rendering engine but it&#x27;s still developed and distributed by Microsoft, which means they own the telemetry, the features, the defaults, and the user experience (which are the parts that matter, no one cares about the renderer from a business POV).<p>Google has Chrome, we&#x27;ve covered that already.<p>Apple has Safari.<p>Firefox exists, and is only funded by Google - in my opinion - to fend off anti-trust at this point.<p>Just because Google has more or less won the browser wars doesn&#x27;t mean all those other companies wouldn&#x27;t _love_ to regain market share in the future.<p>And perhaps they will.
