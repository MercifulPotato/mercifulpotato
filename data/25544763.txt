When I looked at it, Google Meet seemed to assume that you are properly signing up an entire organization to Google everything, whereas Zoom is much more &quot;get a few accounts, email invites and get started&quot;, which is a lot easier workflow to get running if you suddenly need video conferencing. Even if you are in Google world, just getting a few accounts for teachers might be faster than getting Meet approved and turned on centrally.<p>Tbh, I still have not ever participated in a Google Meet meeting, so this probably also very much depends on the markets etc.')
