Let our governments and independent investigative journalists do their work and give us a counter view if they disagree with that tweet. There was no need for Twitter to get involved. I think they did that to balance their editorial decision on Trump and to please both, the democratic party as well as the republican because social media companies fear that new legislation could harm them and so they try to appeal to everyone now.')
