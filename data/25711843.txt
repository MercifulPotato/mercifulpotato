I don&#x27;t believe in free speech without limits.<p>I have strongly felt that the actions taken by these companies is morally and ethically the right thing to do, for any business and that is inconsistent with believing in true free speech. My line for free speech seems to lie in speech that incites violence or speech that discriminates against people for immutable characteristics of their person, both of which I know Parler harbors in abundance. I think there are simply some ideas that are too repugnant to not rebuke.<p>That said I don&#x27;t like how centralized we&#x27;ve become on these existing platforms either. Monopoly on communication means it&#x27;s too easy to let that window slide on what is acceptable speech to limit.')
