It would have been 2004-2008 IIRC. I think I did it at the tail end of that time period though. I want to say that it was on the gumdrop shaped macs but I know the school got some of the first iMacs around that time as well. The new iMacs were awesome to me because I could carry around an external hard drive and boot the newest macOS (Mac OS then) off it. It meant I had root and that coupled with a proxy gave me a fully unlocked computer.')
