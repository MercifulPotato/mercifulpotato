I really do. It&#x27;s just that my fight is somehow for it and largely for the entirety of the internet.<p>&gt; What makes you assume anything would different if Firefox dies?<p>At the very least we would be free from the clutches of Mozilla and it&#x27;s gross incompetence.<p>Chromium &amp; Firefox browsers have been forked plenty times by different developers&#x2F;corps for different reasons.<p>The internet battle won&#x27;t be won by a fork. The most famous of forks being Microsoft Edge, another evil player. Which is surprising close to surpassing FF btw [0] It&#x27;s so bad even Safari is ahead of Firefox on the desktop market share.<p>As for funding Firefox, they can and should be actively pro-donation. I would be willing to pitch in even if it made a slight difference. Pocket &amp; VPN should be marketed and developed upon. Am sure there&#x27;s more the mother entity can come up with to add to its revenues. These alternative projects should be pursued using an R&amp;D budget from its revenue. Firefox is still a large enough player in the browser game, its search engine default is a gold mine commanding hundreds of millions from top investors.<p>If they fire their top dollar guzzling CEO [1] and continue to trim down on non-essentials, I don&#x27;t see any reason why Firefox couldn&#x27;t get back on track to its former glory.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kinsta.com&#x2F;browser-market-share&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kinsta.com&#x2F;browser-market-share&#x2F;</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itdm.com&#x2F;mozilla-firefox-usage-down-85-but-why-are-execs-salary-up-400&#x2F;2050&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itdm.com&#x2F;mozilla-firefox-usage-down-85-but-why-are-e...</a>')
