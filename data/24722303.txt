It&#x27;s a public law, but a secret interpretation by a secret court that cannot be challenged by the people to which it applies.<p>It&#x27;s not inaccurate to describe it as a military coup, given that it allows the US intelligence community to surveil everyone in the legislature and judiciary.')
