It&#x27;s not a binary thing. Certainly I am saying that the number of people who read the Bible has decreased as a percentage of the population substantially since 1785.<p>&gt; Is it possible that becoming an MD might require a base level of mental capabilities and hard work?<p>As an example of what I&#x27;m talking about, back in March&#x2F;February all of the nurses and doctors I know were saying that Covid-19 was just the flu and that only medical professionals should wear a mask. I even reached out to one or two of them to try to give them more of a heads up. This was at the same time that videos were coming out of China with vast stadiums filled with sick people and where people were committing suicide rather than infect their family. Now all of those same medical professionals I know are saying that Covid-19 is extremely serious and that everyone should stay home when possible and wear a mask despite the fact that clearly the risk level is a lot lower now. Here where I live Covid-19 primarily attacks the GI like a typical stomach bug rather than as a serious respiratory illness.<p>&gt; Feeling like everyone around you is evil and stupid isn&#x27;t healthy.<p>Again you are imputing a black and white meaning to what I am saying when it was never said or implied. Certainly if one were living in Nazi Germany in the 1930s or the Soviet Union in the 1920s it would be reasonable for one to feel like generally speaking, &quot;everyone around&quot; was evil and&#x2F;or stupid. Are things that bad here? Absolutely not however we are much closer to living in that kind of environment in the US than we were at the beginning of the 20th century.<p>You have a very typical midwit view on this. I do genuinely feel bad for people that are so naive.')
