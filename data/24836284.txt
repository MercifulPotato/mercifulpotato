HN is pun-free and witty quip-less Reddit.<p>Humans are on average dumb pedantic jerks in internet comment sections everywhere.  Some comment sections just have norms of conduct that do a better job masking it and making the people who can&#x27;t mask it feel unwelcome.  On HN we engage in mental gymnastics to avoid being wrong.  On Reddit when people can&#x27;t win they reply &quot;yikes&quot; or &quot;who hurt you&quot; and create an ad-hominum. On the chans they just call you a racial slur of some sort.')
