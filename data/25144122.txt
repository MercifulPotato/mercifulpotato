My phone slowed down drastically after an update, and so I took it in. They confirmed to me that it was this update that throttled everything if the battery health was degraded &quot;in order to prevent further battery degradation&quot;. But when I pointed out to them that my phone was less than a year old and still under warranty, they tested it again and told me my battery didn&#x27;t meet the threshold for warranty replacement.<p>I pointed out the absurdity of their double standard, and resolved to never buy an apple device ever again.')
