Every single time someone has proof that it&#x27;s definitely the Russians, I follow that rabbit hole and the actual evidence is tenuous or non-existent<p>As for its being Russians in this case, it&#x27;s still turtles all the way down: Just as it makes no sense that it&#x27;s the hosting country, it makes no sense that it&#x27;s the Russians, especially if they tip their hand in such a way. What advantage would Russia have for intimidating the US embassy staff by sending thugs to &quot;get out or else&quot;? The embassy are glorified messengers with limited negotiating skills. Even if the entire diplomatic corps quit <i>en masse</i>, the US would just send more.<p>If there were some advantage to sickening, crippling and otherwise poisoning diplomatic staff, why are there not more such incidents across the world?')
