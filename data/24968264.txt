The fault lies in the assumed importance of the list.<p>When I send a kernel patch, I send it to the maintainer, then CC anyone I myself think should be involved, and finally CC the relevant lists (plural). The list acts as feed for lurkers, and as an archive.<p>The mailing list server being down will not affect this workflow in the slightest.
