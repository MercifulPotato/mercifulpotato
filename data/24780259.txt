That is like saying we now know humans don&#x27;t have feathers.<p>Regarding agency, the story the humans have no real choice in the matter because the dragon will kill them all otherwise. Ending aging would be much more valuable than ending war. Wars do not kill billions of people. Of course, it is possible to destroy all life on the planet in a war, but this is orthogonal to solving other problems.<p>&quot;You are hilariously naive to think about solving one problem when there is another.&quot;')
