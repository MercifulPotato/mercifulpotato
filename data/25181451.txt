Item(by='S_A_P', descendants=None, kids=[25182935], score=None, time=1606081998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25180721, text='The cynic in me thinks the &#x27;price in writing&#x27; price match is so that the price matching retailer can report retailers who dont abide by MAP.<p>I dont disagree, but it leads to scenarios like the above where arbitrage exists. I can buy something from Europe and then sell it on Reverb under MAP and still make a tidy profit. This sort of thing doesnt scale and introduces risk to me if I do that(how do you handle warranty claims, most gear is shipped with EU power cords so you have to buy US power cords to ship to customers, etc)<p>For retailers, most do not have the resources to differentiate so 1 store selling for MAP is interchangeable with another. There are boutique stores that have passionate&#x2F;knowledgeable staff that can guide less informed or newer customers. Sweetwater does this at scale, and I do buy from them for this reason when its something Im not completely up to speed on when I purchase.<p>This is not an easy problem, but I do think an unofficial price floor is not good for the consumer. I also acknowledge that there are stores that will discount privately via chat or in person, but ironically Guitar Center was very inflexible on several items I wanted to purchase there in the last 5 or so years. I ended up going to smaller retailers.')
