Is. A. Culture. Problem.<p>The hate-speech&#x2F;censorship problem exists everywhere. If you can publish somewhere, you can publish hate&#x2F;spam. And if there is hate and&#x2F;or spam, you need to censor. That&#x27;s it. The very fact of publishing is the problem. In fact the only true way of solving the problem is to prevent people from publishing stuff.<p>The internet from the 90s didn&#x27;t solve that problem. It just wasn&#x27;t a problem so much at the time. Mastodon is certainly not solving that problem. Email, IRC, Usenet, BBses, etc. don&#x27;t even address the problem...<p>Now, the real question is why do people get so worked up? And how can we shift the culture away from this partisan shithole we&#x27;re in now?<p>Certainly not for me to answer that question. It maybe because people are poor, it may be because people lack some sense of purpose, it may be because of opioids, or video games, or because of vaccines and Gwyneth Paltrow. I honestly don&#x27;t have a clue.<p>But stop making it about platforms vs decentralized crap.')
