Item(by='anfogoat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610721723, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25789205, text='&gt; Why do people use Tether exchanges, over Coinbase? Not just because of leverage, but also because many do not AML&#x2F;KYC, especially if you only deal with crypto. A LOT of people in the crypto community don&#x27;t like to pay taxes, and we&#x27;ve known this from day one.<p>I don&#x27;t know if evading taxes is the main reason but it is definitely not the only one. Going through KYC is an embarrassing and demeaning experience, unless you like prancing in front of a camera.<p>It is also close to equivalent to just plastering your picture and ID all over the public Internet as that is exactly where they&#x27;ll end up when your exchange of choice is eventually broken into.<p>Just another gift from the anointed ones.')
