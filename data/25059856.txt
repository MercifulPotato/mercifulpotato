Most established non-privacy-preserving products have been slowly killing interoperability because data lock-in provides a moat against users leaving and against potential competitors accessing valuable user data. There&#x27;s no economic reason why privacy-preserving products should have worse interoperability than privacy-violating ones. Especially in product categories where interoperability does not imply sending PII to third parties.<p>Edit: Arguably, providing interoperability is <i>easier</i> for products that don&#x27;t gather a lot of user data because there&#x27;s less risk of an embarrassing leak of PII if the API is not properly secured.')
