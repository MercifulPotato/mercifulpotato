(I&#x27;m not challenging them, I&#x27;m just not sure if they&#x27;re relevant for me or not).<p>So, I just did a test (ashift 12, RAIDZ1 with 4 8TB HDDs) and I got better performance in both cases with a 1MB recordsize vs. 128KB (all sequential).<p>Recordsize 1MB:<p><pre><code>  reading one 10GB file: 21 seconds.\n  reading 10000 1MB files: 83 seconds\n</code></pre>\nRecordsize 128KB:<p><pre><code>  reading one 10GB file: 31 seconds\n  reading 10000 1MB files: 116 seconds\n</code></pre>\nMaybe a small recordsize can have some benefits when overwriting parts of the files...mmmhhh...?<p>Ok, it seems complicated =&gt; I&#x27;ll just have to test different variants :)')
