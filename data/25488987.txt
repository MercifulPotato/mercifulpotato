Not having any set work hours and nobody really even aware of whether I&#x27;m working or not, I&#x27;m sleeping a lot more (like 12 hrs&#x2F;day) and not being very productive the rest of the time. This year has just vanished in a haze of sleeping and not doing much, a week can feel like a day sometimes.')
