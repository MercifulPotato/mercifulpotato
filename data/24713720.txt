You zap a person’s tongue and then play a bunch of random frequencies in their ears and it cures tinnitus?  Why?  What’s the mechanism?  Can someone who understands neurology explain how this works?<p>I mean some of the reasoning in the article is so hand-wavy.  Like, saying that stimulating the tongue stimulates the brain.
