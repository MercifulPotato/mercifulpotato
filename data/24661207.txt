Item(by='wegs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601635644, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24651087, text='Price list:<p>* Bosch drill&#x2F;driver kit: $100<p>* Circular saw: $100<p>* Tape measure: $20<p>* Square: $10 x2 (one big, one small)<p>Total: $240. That&#x27;s 1&#x2F;10th of what you quoted.<p>&quot;Step it up a notch&quot; kit as next step:<p>* Random orbital sander: $70<p>* Router: $170<p>* Planer: $120<p>* Guides: $20<p>* Clamps: $100<p>And we&#x27;re up another $500. Still a good ways short of $2500. And that&#x27;s at current Lowes prices. If you wait a few months, you can find complete 5-tool kits on sale sometimes.<p>I don&#x27;t think $250 is unreasonable to spend on a hobby starting out. If OP is at FAANG salaries, then dropping $750 isn&#x27;t unreasonable either. And if OP is a student, use a university woodworking shop, or buy used. These things go for a song on Craigslist sometimes.<p>Planer (or belt sander) saves money in the long run. You can recycle (free) old wood, use cheap S1S2E wood, and similar. For the most part, you just want to build a lot of stuff. Given the random orbital recommendation, I thought of the two, a planer was more versatile. It has unanticipated beginner uses too. E.g. If you mess up and make something 1&#x2F;16th of an inch too small, you can trim a bit, and it will fit. Or if you can&#x27;t do layout&#x2F;cuts precisely and well, you can leave a bit of margin, and keep trimming a piece of wood until it fits.')
