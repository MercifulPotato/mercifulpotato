It became a &quot;meme&quot; because for many years, bitcoin evangelists touted bitcoin as a currency replacement. You can buy pizza with bitcoins! Remember? It has and still is being sold as a virtual currency - after all you can&#x27;t have cryptocurrency without currency.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t expect to be able to buy Starbucks with Apple stock.<p>But you can actually buy goods with bitcoins...<p>You fall into the same trap as all evangelists, self-contradiction. I like bitcoins, I like cryptocurrencies, think the future is bright for blockchain tech. I just don&#x27;t like bullshit.')
