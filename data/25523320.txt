You&#x27;d have to do this everytime you&#x27;d want to use a new release. It&#x27;s trivial but it&#x27;s still work and it isn&#x27;t really worth it; the time spent on circumventing the Lsos library will cost you more than the 10$ &#x2F; month.<p>There are easier ways to circumvent the Lsos library but we can prevent these.<p>Not every company out there is going to agressively wanting to circumvent the Lsos library to save a mere 10$ &#x2F; month. Only very few actually. Large companies are interested in much higher figures than 10$ &#x2F; month; it doesn&#x27;t matter for them to spend a little on open source. They&#x27;d rather pay than going through the hassle to save pennies.<p>Besides the enforce-mode, the trust-mode would generate substantially more income than donations already.<p>Edit: about licensing: Keeping the MIT license is a strong statement that everything stays open source. It&#x27;s important to clearly communicate that. Most devS don&#x27;t understand how copyright works and creating a new license creates confusion about whether the code is still &quot;open source&quot;.')
