Which book to read first depends on your attitude towards the fantasy genre. If you&#x27;re skeptical of it, I would recommend starting with the compact sci-fi short story trilogy of &quot;Fifth Head of Cerberus&quot; rather than the magnum opus of &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot;.<p>If Cerberus works for you, there is a ton more to chew in New Sun, and you should absolutely read it whether or not you like more mainstream fantasy works.<p>And if you like New Sun but haven&#x27;t read Jack Vance&#x27;s original take on a similar world, &quot;Dying Earth&quot;, it&#x27;s absolutely worth it. Nowhere near as deep as Wolfe, but way more funny â€” a truly unique voice from the golden era of sci-fi.')
