That may be true. It also may be true that the actual lands that have been burning and been poorly managed are more state lands than federal lands. California is obviously a large state. That&#x27;s why we need to know what percent of the burnt lands are actually state versus federal before I&#x27;d deem the statistic in question to be useful.')
