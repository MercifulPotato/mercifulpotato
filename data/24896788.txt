It provides a standard mechanism for parsing command lines. An important consequence of it is that auto-complete for Amiga terminals that supports it can do typed auto-complete for any application that uses it without anyone having to write auto-complete script or specifications.<p>It&#x27;s not a hard thing to do. The ReadArgs templates are really basic. Probably too basic. There are tons of good open-source command line parsers. All that&#x27;s really needed is for <i>people</i> to settle on one with a suitable static spec format, and a mechanism for making it easy to extract that format from an executable.<p>But it serves very little purpose unless you convince a lot of people to <i>do it</i>.<p>There&#x27;s a chicken and egg scenario there, in that it&#x27;s a lot harder to find people prepared to spend time creating &quot;standards&quot; like that and pushing them than it is to find people to work on solving an issue with a more immediate payoff. Especially when you really need a critical mass of applications that supports these specs before the benefits starts becoming obvious.')
