Short-term homeless may outnumber long-term homeless in an absolute metric (I was homeless for a few months in 2014) but long-term homeless make many more lifetime visits to a soup kitchen and therefore comprise a higher proportion of the people you meet. They also comprise a higher proportion of the people who are at any given time living on the street. If you solve short-term homelessness but not long-term homelessness, you haven&#x27;t made nearly as much of a dent in the shelter beds and tent cities as you have in the quoted statistic of people who are ever homeless.<p>I&#x27;m sure you do meet &quot;high-functioning adults&quot; in soup kitchens, but I would also doubt they&#x27;re the modal attendees.')
