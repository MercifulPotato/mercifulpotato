Have you seen the guy on YouTube? Give it a watch and decide for yourself.<p>I followed Q (not qanon) in relation to spygate, and let’s just say I was surprised. It’s not some basement mouth breather, it’s state level. Have the people who followed Q also considered it could be some Russian or other country’s psyop against us? Again think for yourself folks.<p>Anyway, I’m convinced Q at this point is out of the bag. Even if you banned it on the clear web it would spill out from the dark web into every public space. The only way to attack it effectively now is to get transparent about some of the central claims Q says control the levers of power:<p>1. What was happening on Epstein’s island?<p>2. What evidence does Assange have regarding the source of hacked emails?<p>3. What were the deleted emails on HRC server and why did the Clinton foundation amass so much money?<p>Interesting enough just <i>now</i> after two years of Q, we’re getting some more information about these, so it really is going to be do or die for “qanon”.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;amp.cnn.com&#x2F;cnn&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;politics&#x2F;pompeo-clinton-emails&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;amp.cnn.com&#x2F;cnn&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;poli...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;17318376&#x2F;united-states-v-maxwell&#x2F;?filed_after=&amp;filed_before=&amp;entry_gte=&amp;entry_lte=&amp;order_by=desc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;17318376&#x2F;united-states-...</a>')
