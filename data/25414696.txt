This is like 40% of the premise of 30 Rock. But that was about the Sheinhardt Wigs hegemony over NBC (and tri-vection microwaves), not Tim Cook&#x27;s influence over a tiny portfolio of streaming shows nobody watches.<p>As long as he doesn&#x27;t fuck with Ted Lasso, I honestly don&#x27;t give a shit. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy another Apple product in 2021, which will re-up my Apple TV+ subscription somehow.')
