The different flight modes are like the most basic part of operating an Airbus in an emergency, and the idea that any trained pilot wouldn&#x27;t first consider which mode they&#x27;re in is staggering.<p>Read the transcript.  You have Bonin pulling back on the stick almost continuously without saying so, you have Robert advising him to descend, and Bonin replying that he was descending, when he never did.  He let the controls go back to neutral, the plane was still ascending with a wildly high AOA for the conditions, and he quickly reverted to pulling back on the joystick.<p>Only less than a minute before impact, when the rapid descent and confusion lead to Robert advising Bonin to climb, does Bonin reveal the critical information, at which point both Robert and the Captain must have been shocked and horrified, both realizing they had to dive and also realizing they didn&#x27;t have enough altitude and were going to crash:<p><pre><code>    02:13:40 (Robert) Climb... climb... climb... climb...\n    02:13:40 (Bonin) But I&#x27;ve had the stick back the whole time!\n     [At last, Bonin tells the others the crucial fact whose import he has so grievously failed to understand himself.]\n    02:13:42 (Captain) No, no, no… Don’t climb… no, no. \n    02:13:43 (Robert) Descend, then… Give me the controls… Give me the controls!\n\n     [Bonin yields the controls, and Robert finally puts the nose down. The plane begins to regain speed. But it is still descending at a precipitous angle. As they near 2000 feet, the aircraft&#x27;s sensors detect the fast-approaching surface and trigger a new alarm. There is no time left to build up speed by pushing the plane&#x27;s nose forward into a dive. At any rate, without warning his colleagues, Bonin once again takes back the controls and pulls his side stick all the way back.]\n    02:14:23 (Robert) Damn it, we’re going to crash… This can’t be happening!\n    02:14:25 (Bonin) But what’s happening?\n    02:14:27 (Captain) Ten degrees of pitch…\n\n    Exactly 1.4 seconds later, the cockpit voice recorder stops.\n</code></pre>\nTranscript with notes: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tailstrike.com&#x2F;010609.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tailstrike.com&#x2F;010609.html</a><p>Bonin may have passed training but he clearly wasn&#x27;t competent to fly an Airbus.  Air France crew resource management (communication between pilots) sucked, and a bunch of Airbus quirks led to the other pilots not discovering that Bonin was doing the wrong thing until it was too late.  However, virtually any other pilot wouldn&#x27;t have stalled the plane.')
