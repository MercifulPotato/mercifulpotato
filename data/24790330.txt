Item(by='ravenstine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602778905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24788790, text='&gt; In my opinion there&#x27;s a narcissism epidemic going on. Charisma is seen not just as a trait but as a value. Everyone wants some. It&#x27;s lumped together with good leadership, extroversion etc. Charismatic selfish people are praised as CEOs, celebrities, youtubers, politicians, actors. And enthralled people keep making excuses for them! And calling YOU crazy.<p>Without going into detail, I can very much relate to this.  The grandiose narcissists are much easier to identify, most of the time, but vulnerable narcissism(which I think most narcissists are) is more socially acceptable and reliant on empathetic energy, making it harder to point out.  On social media in particular, they can easily form cults of victims whom end up enabling the narcissist.  I&#x27;m normally not that bothered by narcissists, but there have been a few times where I pointed out that a public figure is a narcissist, along with concrete details on their lies and misdirection, and got mostly backlash for it.  What&#x27;s funny is my predictions have always turned out to be right because narcissists really aren&#x27;t that difficult to understand.  Most of them aren&#x27;t even good at keeping their stories straight.')
