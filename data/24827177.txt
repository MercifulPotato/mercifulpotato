I&#x27;ve found the driver torque dial to be inadequate most of the time.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of the idea of &quot;mechanic&#x27;s feel&quot; from &quot;Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance.  It&#x27;s when you develop a sense for tightening a screw or bolt for snugness without destroying the threads, the head or the material.  It&#x27;s hard to do that with an electric driver in the way.  (one exception might be the gyro drivers)<p>And with respect to wood glue - I think it&#x27;s worth the effort to add it to the mix with the non-metal furniture.   Not only does it make the furniture more solid feeling, it also helps prevent the screws from loosening.')
