It is the same for e.g. Coursera courses where it is peers and a bunch of students from the university answering questions in the forum not the professor.<p>I quite like the model of Schoolism.com art classes where you can either pay a monthly subscription for all access, start&#x2F;finish any time or pay a quite a bit higher fee per course with fixed schedule and personalized feedback from the instructor')
