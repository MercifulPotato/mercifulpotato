Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607436378, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344762, text='Really quite curious to see how these stack up against the $263 Sennheiser HD1s, my current favorite over-ear noise cancelling bluetooth headphones, which sound lovely (my daily drivers are the HD820s, for reference).<p>I can&#x27;t really speak to the price (like others in the thread) until I hear them.  It&#x27;s possible they&#x27;re $1000 headphones for &lt;$600, much like how insanely high-quality the HomePod is for its price.  It&#x27;s also possible they&#x27;re just some Beats in a metal case.  Impossible to tell without actually using them.<p>Looking forward to trying a pair.')
