You seem to be conflating &quot;money laundering&quot; with all &quot;undesired&quot;&#x2F;illegal transactions.<p>Laundering implies transition from &quot;dirty&quot; to &quot;clean&quot;.<p>This is the kind of scenario that these kinds of regulatory requirements impede:<p>&quot;Dirty BTC&quot; transferred to Binance, traded for ETH, sent to Coinbase, traded for USD, and sent outward to a fiat bank account.<p>Like you say, strictly peer-to-peer value transfer is game over. If every point of contact between cryptocurrency and a regulated entity requires full KYC, those illicit funds can be prevented from entering the regulated economy.<p>What&#x27;s happening here is effectively a battle over the fungibility of cryptocurrency. If the transactional history of each UTXO comes under scrutiny for a business to touch a BTC transaction, the practical value of each satoshi differs. This was actually brought up many years ago as an argument for why bitcoin in its current form (sans untraceable transaction) may lose the &quot;fungibility&quot; property and thus will lose its utility as money.<p>This was early on a main selling point for Monero; &quot;truly fungible cryptocurrency&quot;.')
