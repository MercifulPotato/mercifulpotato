I was a customer support programmer in San Francisco the day that they rolled out a powerful arrays feature on the testing mainframe (no clients, but lots of real work going on).<p>One could put <i>anything</i> as an element inside an array. \nSo I tried:<p><pre><code>    X=array(123, &quot;abc&quot;)\n    Y=Array(X)\n</code></pre>\nand it worked. <i>You know where this is going, right?</i><p><pre><code>    i=loop from 1 to 1000\n    x(i+1) = array (xi)\n</code></pre>\nIt crashed the mainframe at i=67, if memory serves.<p>So far, so good, excusable as &quot;clever programmer tests the limits&quot;.  And then I ran it again.<p>Same result, plus, 2 minutes later, a call for me from my friend Kevin, who was a lead developer on EPS in DRI HQ: \n&quot;Chris, what the ^&amp;<i>^</i>&amp;^!@@ are you doing?&quot;')
