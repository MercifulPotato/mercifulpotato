It&#x27;s not the drug&#x27;s fault for the dealers actions. So how about we stop blaming an inanimate f----- object and work to find a solution to the problem.<p>In your schoolwork example I can come up with four potential solutions off the top of my head:<p>- Speak to the teacher about concerns and ask about other ways of doing what is required<p>- Speak to parents and ask them to help with the homework<p>- Buddy up with a friend and watch the required video with a friend to avoid falling down a rabbit hole<p>- Use software like youtube-dl to download the video locally, to avoid temptation of watching another video<p>Then we come back full circle to the parent comment. It&#x27;s not the drug&#x27;s fault. It&#x27;s not the phone&#x27;s fault. It&#x27;s not some software instruction&#x27;s fault.<p>Blaming and ascribing fault is only helpful in identifying the problem. After that, the question becomes <i>what can I do about it that will helpful for me today</i>? What is <i>my</i> solution for how this affects <i>me</i>?<p>i.e. learning to develop personal responsibility.')
