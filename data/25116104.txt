Odd that this data was never part of the published record from the Post, and that Graham&#x27;s source is apparently secret?  Curious what you make of that?  If the Post had it, they&#x27;d surely have released it.  I guess it&#x27;s sort of academic at this point, but it does point to a few different actors pushing this story in different directions.')
