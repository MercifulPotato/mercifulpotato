Scala 2 gives you a lot of guns to shoot yourself in the foot (see: implicit, as discussed here) - but you can also use it in its mostly-functional form, with immutable values, and then it can become very readable. Granted - I&#x27;ve always been using IntelliJ but I could read the scala code on Github too, just fine.')
