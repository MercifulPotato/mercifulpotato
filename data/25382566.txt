Although their flagship stores have held on reasonably well for a while, their non-flagship stores were damn near empty in the mid-2000&#x27;s.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a shame since for smaller town in Canada, the Bay is often an anchor store for a mall.  There aren&#x27;t great &quot;department stores&quot; left, so when the Bay goes away, smaller towns are going to be a bit stuck (outside of ordering online).')
