I didn&#x27;t know much about his life beyond  basic knowledge of his work during the civil rights movement and the fact that he had been a reformed criminal. Reading about his circumstances in detail and the whirlwind of a life he lived definitely gave me a better appreciation of him and his evolution. Malcolm&#x27;s story was that of changes, as he put it (with much better phrasing) to his collaborator Alex Haley, and he being a late bloomer (in some aspects) like myself gives me some hope about my life.')
