I grew up religious but am now an atheist, and though I haven&#x27;t sought to replace it component-wise, I&#x27;ve been observing de facto beliefs in myself and others that wouldn&#x27;t normally be recognized as such because they aren&#x27;t packaged as a lot. What makes me note similarities between acknowledged religious beliefs and unacknowledged ones is their function. If you look at the desired effects, they have the same aim: guidance in making decisions, association with a group sharing a particular view, value judgments both aesthetic and moral. The religions we created are a reflection of our psychology and physiology, and often the tensions between those two. It seems to me at least that a name brand religion often fills a life module that&#x27;s required for a human to operate. The fact that it might be unlabeled might make it more difficult to identify, but it doesn&#x27;t nullify its existence.')
