I have literally thousands of retro games available from Atari VCS to PS2 I can play at a moment&#x27;s notice. Using playnite I&#x27;ve also pulled together all the games from Steam, Gog and Epic into one place which all streams relatively well to my TV via Steamlink.<p>- Books, Comic books, Papers, and Magazines. I use ubooquity over calibre since it just fits my style and needs better. I have almost 100,000 pieces of readable media organized and available.<p>- Photos, we travel a lot and I like photography. So I have hundreds of thousands of photos also served up via plex.<p>I use two computers to do this. One is a cheap file&#x2F;media server that&#x27;s running plex and ubooquity. It&#x27;s attached to two Mediasonic 4-bay probox serving up somewhere around 70TB of raw storage. The other is a higher-end daily-use computer with a decent GPU that can push the steamlink games and emulate old games with filters really well. It has 32GB of RAM but only around 4.5TB of storage -- which is fine since I use the file serve for most everything.<p>I should probably consolidate both machines down to one higher-end system and offload my desktop activities to a lower-end system but this setup is more something that&#x27;s grown organically over time and wasn&#x27;t really &quot;designed&quot;.<p>However, the end effect is, I can plop in front of my TV, and choose from a virtually unlimited collection of media. And when I want to read something, I&#x27;m exclusively tablet now on the couch or in bed, and have virtually unlimited amount of reading material available as well.<p>I&#x27;ll watch, play, and read something pretty much every day, so this setup has proven itself immensely. It&#x27;s also allowed me to eliminate rooms full of media, game systems, and other<p>The <i>only</i> remaining hangup that I&#x27;m not happy about is how to best handle audiobooks. Right now I shove them into plex as another audio library, but it&#x27;s kind of a mess and plex thinks they&#x27;re all music or something. Tbh, I don&#x27;t really like how plex serves up audio anyways. I also love it if plex just supported ebooks in the way ubooquity does, then I could unify my servers and also more easily serve reading material outside my home network.<p>The last remaining media I <i>really</i> want to be able to serve up in someway without converting them all are old chiptunes, amiga mods and other demoscene tracker music. I have a huge collection but haven&#x27;t yet found a good way to serve them up in a way I like and have them accessible in the ways I have my other media available.')
