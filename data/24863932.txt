The dilemma only exists for those whose political views are already opposed to those of the project owners, and who refuse to contribute on that account - neither a neutral or apolitical position, but one of intransigent political opposition.<p>So rather than simply avoiding ethical dilemmas in favor of cooperation (because plenty of people <i>are</i> cooperating) what&#x27;s being advocated here is concession to anti-BLM advocates exclusively as a prerequisite for their participation, and those are the only people condemning or demanding exclusion of anything (specifically, the political views of the project owners.)<p>Because again, <i>no one</i> is saying that people who don&#x27;t support BLM aren&#x27;t allowed to participate.<p>It&#x27;s open source software, and as is often mentioned when someone objects to a project owner&#x27;s right-wing views, software is apolitical, and contributing in and of itself is not advocacy.
