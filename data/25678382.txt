This is a business that can only survive on making customers’ lives miserable. I’ve been a Simple client for some time after closing PNC. It’s always been just “out of the way” and has never caused problems or cost me money unfairly. Which is why I’ve been waiting for them to either be acquired by a bigger, horrible bank or go under for some time.')
