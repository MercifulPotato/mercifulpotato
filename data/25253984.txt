I&#x27;ve been to-the-letter in terms of compliance.  Nearly everyone I know hasn&#x27;t been - they often say &quot;well, yeah, but I know I haven&#x27;t got it so it&#x27;s OK&quot;, or similar.  Some are just flat out deniers.  It&#x27;s not everyone - obviously my experience is only anecdotal - but I think that would explain a lot of it, plus it not really being a lockdown in the true sense.')
