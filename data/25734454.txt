Item(by='Steltek', descendants=None, kids=[25742206, 25738148, 25735523], score=None, time=1610392093, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732862, text='I use xterm because I&#x27;m too lazy to switch, I guess.  It was never bad enough for me to switch and it&#x27;s present virtually everywhere, so I don&#x27;t need to bother installing my favorite niche term (kind of like sticking with bash when zsh was indisputably more awesome).<p>To the best of my knowledge, one downside is the text rendering is synchronous.  Read a character off the tty, try to display it on the screen.  It&#x27;s fine until you go and cat &#x2F;dev&#x2F;mem or something like that.  Many GNOME-ish terminals use vte which drops frames if it can&#x27;t keep up rendering.<p>I also run into problems with bad display managers or DEs that don&#x27;t load ~&#x2F;.Xresources or ~&#x2F;.Xdefaults (looking at you Debian gdm).')
