I&#x27;ve never had a situation when someone asked me to work extra. In every job I&#x27;ve ever had I was expected to get things done, and no one ever cared when I do that as long as I do it by a deadline, or by a sprint review, or by a demo day, etc. More often than not it was me who were setting those deadlines for myself, just because I&#x27;m ambitious, and I like to impress others, and I like being promoted. Besides, I could never work 9-5. I usually accomplish little in terms of actual work during those hours, and then get into the zone late at night, without any distractions. That&#x27;s when I usually feel most productive. Another thing is, I either work on something I love, or I work for a very decent salary. In both cases, I feel fine working extra hours.')
