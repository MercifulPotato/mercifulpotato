If there was a staffing explosion, it just wasn&#x27;t evident in town. Redmond and the rest of the 405 corridor? Yeah, maybe. But not so much Seattle itself.<p>By contrast, the &quot;Californication&quot; period (say, 87-94) and the tech boom actually took place in the city itself. Keep in mind that in the 87-94 period, Boeing and UW were still the two largest employers in Puget Sound. Companies like Microsoft were &quot;good&quot; for the economy, but they weren&#x27;t quite the behemoths that they became as the tech boom happened (and, coincidentally, as I left :)')
