Item(by='nanomonkey', descendants=None, kids=[25377171], score=None, time=1607625972, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373831, text='It&#x27;s interesting to see so many people complain that it&#x27;s hard to <i>hire</i> Clojure engineers, when I&#x27;ve had the exact opposite problem...trying to find a Clojure shop to join. They are few and far between, and the few that are hiring say that they will take folks that are new to Clojure, but then are baffled when you don&#x27;t know how to idiomatically solve whiteboard problems.<p>Clojure remedies all of my problems with previously used languages (Basic, C, Java, ObjC, Javascript, Python), in that it allows me to remove boilerplate and create layers of abstraction that are appropriate for problem solving.  It&#x27;s also a fairly opinionated language, preferring functional programming methods that work with how I like to solve problems.  This is refreshing, as it feels like I can bypass all of the style wars that I encountered with Python., and the verbosity of C&#x2F;Java&#x2F;Obj-C. No longer being told to rewrite functional code as an object, by an engineering manager that only ever writes imperative scripts.<p>Lastly I now love writing front end code in Clojurescript...something I never would have expected.  Reagent and Re-frame are a dream for large complex SPAs, which while I dislike in principle, seem to be the trend in cross-platform GUIs.<p>And it makes programming fun again!')
