SIP just defines a set of actions that Apple thinks no user, including root, should <i>ever</i> be able to perform. Consequently, disabling SIP empowers root users to do whatever they want, which is <i>exactly</i> what root is supposed to mean! You&#x27;re still protected by the standard UNIX permission system—just don&#x27;t grant root to software you don&#x27;t <i>absolutely</i> trust!<p>Security is all about layers—but in the case of SIP, the security comes from delegating control away from the user in favor of Apple. If you&#x27;re a power user, I&#x27;m not convinced this is necessarily good, because you&#x27;re giving Apple almost absolute trust. What if <i>they</i> get compromised?<p>And, if you&#x27;re the sort of person who would want a de-Apple-ified version of macOS, I would think you&#x27;d have <i>already</i> disabled SIP.')
