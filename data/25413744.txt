Item(by='the_only_law', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607922116, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25413597, text='I look at a lot of retro computing stuff, old engineering &#x2F; lab equipment, old telecom stuff, etc. I tend to look at things and wonder “what can I make this do”, “how can I interface this to something more modern”, “how can I make this thing do what I want, against its original intended use”, among other things. I do this irl too but my eBay feed tends to be curated with things a bit more feasible.')
