I have a few terabytes of data on S3. It costs like $30&#x2F;mo. I have about a half terabyte of data in RDS. That&#x27;s about $40&#x2F;mo, plus a couple thousand a year for the RIs. I run the company myself. I run SES for less than a dollar a month to handle all my transactional emails.<p>If I move this out of AWS, I need that data replicated for redundancy. I need some meaty servers set up, and I need to maintain the boxes that run the storage and database software. I need to build out the observability software that I get for almost free with Cloudwatch. My database instances need to failover appropriately, which doesn&#x27;t happen automatically. I need to monitor disk usage and add capacity as the databases grow. I need to set up and manage whatever firewall setup I otherwise get for free with VPCs and security groups.<p>Managing my own email infrastructure is almost laughable. Spending more than about two and a half minutes on it each month outweighs the benefit of just running it on AWS.<p>My time isn&#x27;t free. I either need to hire someone to build this, I need to learn it and apply it correctly, or find some magic docker stuff that does it for me.<p>Where is the cost savings of moving out of the cloud for me? If I&#x27;m spending all of my time in a SSH session installing kernel updates or diagnosing why my storage cluster is misbehaving, when am I supposed to actually build my product?')
