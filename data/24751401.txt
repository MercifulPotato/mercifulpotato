I use it regularly on my XPS 15 (to play Kerbal Space Program). It&#x27;s called &quot;DRI PRIME&quot;. You have to set an environment variable for starting and application saying what GPU you want it to run on.<p>I am, however, very much looking forward to the new AMD GPUs. Hopefully the RX 6000 series will be near a 3080 in more than the 3 hand picked games in their teaser. Would love to use Wayland on my desktop.')
