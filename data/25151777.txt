Or many. Despite the tens of thousands (conservatively) of dead civilians resulting from direct US military action, the US has not even been accused of a single instance of a war crime. Why do you think that is? Well I&#x27;ll tell you, as someone who&#x27;s been elbow deep into this for quite a few years of my life: international law is an esoteric, negotiable concept, it&#x27;s a guideline, and it relies on consent and the power to apply your view. Kind of like the rules of conduct in a company. You don&#x27;t slap your CEO even if they deserve it, and you don&#x27;t go to an HR that is controlled by them. In the same vein, international relations is the &quot;science&quot; of agreeing on an outcome the stronger party wants and the weaker one can live with. International law is there as a framework but there&#x27;s no accepted &quot;Supreme Judge, Jury, and Executioner&quot; who just presses charges, delivers a verdict, and carries out the sentence in the name of the victim or the planet, and everyone has to abide.<p>A strong enough player is untouchable, they can break a treaty and it&#x27;s up to the others to decide the action... or let it slide. Who do you think has the power or guts to gather the necessary evidence and the international support to investigate the US for war crimes? And if it went through, who has the power to impose any kind of measures against the US? What kind of retaliation can they expect afterwards? Do you really think there are no perks to being the wold&#x27;s biggest superpower?<p>Armchair international politics is a lot more fun than the real thing, I&#x27;ll tell you that.<p>&gt; Countries do not just do whatever they want out of a position of power<p>There is some give and take but for some it&#x27;s literally what they do for a living. The US has openly pressured the EU to do things for decades, from supporting sanctions they didn&#x27;t agree with, to changing Galileo frequencies to something that the US could more easily jam. And they&#x27;ve been doing it on every continent under threat of war, sanctions, or interference. It wasn&#x27;t as a favor between friends, and it certainly wasn&#x27;t in the spirit of cooperation and all those international treaties.<p>&gt; the morality of states (whatever that means, to me the concept is meaningless) [...] so let&#x27;s ignore that<p>A bit of reading comprehension goes a long way. That was exactly my point, that there are no good or bad, no moral and immoral&#x2F;amoral countries. They do what they need to do to stay on top of the pile. Don&#x27;t ignore something because you can&#x27;t parse it. It&#x27;s clearly the best way to form an uninformed opinion and then state it firmly, assuming you have an iron clad case.')
