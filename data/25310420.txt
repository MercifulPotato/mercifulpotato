Item(by='kshacker', descendants=None, kids=[25310846], score=None, time=1607129176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25308274, text='Here&#x27;s what I do: multiple accounts. Switching accounts is easy. One for politics (news, politics, geopolitics, plus other variations), One for finance (options, investing, thetagang, no WSB for those who know), One for Relationships (Relationships, TIFU, AITA) because it is fun, One for bay area (and the only one where I am somewhat willing to disclose my identity), One for health, One for entertainment (all the TV shows that I am watching at the moment), and 2 for my country of origin (one with leftist leans and one with rightist leans since I got banned for somewhat innocuous comments in one of them so I said why not two). I could look up specific subreddits, but I find it easy for one account to focus on a single topic and subscribe to 5-10 related subs on that topic. Based on the need, the feed works perfectly.<p>You can say it is addiction but I would say it is focused addiction. When I am reading about options trading, I am reading about options, investments, dividends and what not - usually there is a purpose and maybe a perceived benefit, and when I am reading about entertainment, it is to track reviews and user comments - same perceived benefit - I could go to IMDB but it is not the same.')
