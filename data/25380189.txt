They are created by choosing a polymer with good optical properties and then thermoforming it by carefully applying air pressure to raise a rounded shape to a dome after clamping the edges, then holding the air pressure constant until it has cooled. Because nothing actually touches the lens portion, optical properties are preserved.')
