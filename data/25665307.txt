They were said, I didn&#x27;t see them prior to deletion, and now as a disinterested party I don&#x27;t have the opportunity to see them and perhaps view Trump in a worse light on account of the things he said that were so appalling they had to be deleted.<p>I say &#x27;not sure&#x27; because in the case of personal attacks, for example, obviously there&#x27;s an extra dimension that it&#x27;s not very nice for the attacked to see it&#x2F;know that it&#x27;s there.<p>But I don&#x27;t really like a nanny ~state~ private company telling me I can&#x27;t have a chuckle at some nonsense that I know isn&#x27;t going to incite me to do anything, or whatever.<p>It is Twitter&#x27;s Twitter to do with what it pleases though.')
