Over just the past year I&#x27;ve gone from &quot;I don&#x27;t see why I wouldn&#x27;t support Mac&quot; to &quot;I&#x27;m not even going to try and build my software for Mac, life is too short to deal with Apple&#x27;s crap.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s been kind of a weird transition. I was talking to someone recently about accessibility between multiple GUI frameworks (QT&#x2F;Electron&#x2F;GTK&#x2F;Swift&#x2F;etc...) and they brought up Mac accessibility differences. And immediately my brain jumped to, &quot;well, who cares if those frameworks are accessible on Mac, because it&#x27;s not like my software is going to be on there. Only the Linux&#x2F;Windows&#x2F;mobile experiences matter.&quot; It was a very strange feeling to have that be the first thing that instinctively popped into my head.<p>And I&#x27;m only one developer, and probably no one&#x27;s really going to notice or care about my decisions, and historically as long as users demand Mac software&#x2F;releases, developers have had to just put up with it, so I don&#x27;t have strong evidence that this is going to be different.<p>But I wonder how long that can hold out before eventually something snaps. Realistically, there&#x27;s no way that Wireguard can refuse to release for MacOS. But everyone else? If you&#x27;re making a game, why would you ever target a Mac build if you&#x27;re worried about running into issues like this? Is the gaming marketshare on Mac really big enough to justify this kind of annoyance and time commitment?<p>I&#x27;m probably naive, but it just seems like at some point developers are going to decide that the only reason to support Mac is if it&#x27;s their primary market. Maybe Apple doesn&#x27;t care, maybe they&#x27;d like us all to move to iOS anyway.')
