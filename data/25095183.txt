Everyone eventually left. Good luck getting anyone to try something a second time.<p>I think the concept shows promise, the execution is OK, and I know how hard something like this can be but the project looks mismanaged. Multiple rebrandings, multiple organizations for different commercial and non commercial purposes, simple bugs that would be found with a cursory use of the tools before release, it&#x27;s like the left hand doesn&#x27;t know what the right hand is doing.<p>I still hold out hope that the project matures eventually.')
