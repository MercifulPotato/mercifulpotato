Sony&#x27;s consolidation is all about getting users.<p>Years back Bandai funded &quot;daisuki&quot; anime, which folded. In fact I worked in the same office as the executive who needed to fold down that division. Daisuki failed due to lack of users, not content. Likewise Sony tried a home spun distribution platform too, and folded it as well.<p>Now years later with all that industry experience in hand Sony is moving in and consolidating.

Sony appears to be making those moves and could establish Japan&#x27;s strongest beachhead in the streaming wars.<p>Japan cannot compete with Americans easy access to Hollywood negotiations, but likewise a Japanese platform should have strong negotiations securing anime.')
