There&#x27;s enough studies looking at this for SARS and influenza- including for the general population - that it is highly irresponsible to err on the side of not using masks even if there&#x27;s no clear evidence for population usage for SARS-2.<p>&quot;Opportunistic data collected\nduring the SARS epidemic in Asia suggested that population-wide use of face masks may significantly decrease transmission of not only SARS but also influenza [3,4,5,6,7]. As part of pandemic preparedness, many are contemplating the contribution wide-spread use of masks could have [8,9].&quot;<p>3.
