I was using Fastmail and had my spam settings set very leniently.<p>Fastmail Support claimed they never received any mail (ie it hadn&#x27;t bounced) but DigitalOcean Support would insist I check my spam folder for the 500th time.<p>Ultimately, I just swore to never use their services, primarily because I... could never log in and actually use their services.<p>I think it&#x27;s fixed nowadays but I wasted so much time on that issue.')
