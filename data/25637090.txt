Item(by='Rury', descendants=None, kids=[25637283], score=None, time=1609790686, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25633774, text='&gt; the ability to independently verify the money supply and being able to transfer money across political boundaries without censorship is probably the most important intrinsic value one could hope for in a MoE&#x2F;SoV.<p>This is opinion, not a fact.<p>The problem with bitcoin as a currency (and arguably all currencies) is that its value isn&#x27;t stable, and can never be, because value is arbitrary and subject to opinion.<p>But if you don&#x27;t agree, just look at how it&#x27;s deflationary. Most don&#x27;t realize it, but deflationary currencies are equally problematic to inflationary currencies in that both deflation and inflation are natural drivers of inequality.<p>Generally speaking, with inflationary currencies, the rich who get richer are those who own assets, and&#x2F;or those who control the money printer. Those who are at a disadvantage, are people without a money printer who hold onto the devalued currency, and those who have fewer or no assets.<p>With deflationary currencies it&#x27;s the opposite. The rich who get richer are the hoarders and earlier adopters of the currency. Those at a disadvantage are those who own other things, and those with fewer or no amounts of the currency.<p>As so, if the world mass adopted bitcoin, society would be no better off in terms of the problems people behold to inflationary fiat... (problems regarding inequality). But that&#x27;s not to say, it wouldn&#x27;t solve some problems as your statement suggests, but it also introduces new problems. As an example, your very argument above could be changed to &quot;the inability to exchange money without a computer is probably amongst the worst intrinsic value one could hope for&quot;. Is it worse&#x2F;better - again, that&#x27;s subject to opinion.<p>In short, the only reason to grab bitcoin, is so you can trade it to someone else later who thinks it has value, which means it only has or holds value because people thinks it does or will - same as anything else.')
