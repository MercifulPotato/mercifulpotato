I agree that this is a problem worth solving. NYC did specifically solve that problem early because people realized it would be a problem, and school lunches (and summer meals) have been available for pickup without actually going to school. Also, no part of solving this problem requires reopening restaurants.<p>I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re willing to nobly sacrifice your life, but what if we could save those 10,000 kids per month <i>without</i> opening back up? What if we could save more lives by keeping essential services operational and non-essential businesses closed with targeted government interventions to keep people fed and housed? Would you be willing to do that?')
