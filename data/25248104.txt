In the case of hiking, the hiker is making the choices and the hiker is the one who will have to live (or die) with them.  In the case of software, too often it is a commercially-oriented application developer making the choices and it is a different person, a user, who must live with them.  The hiker has control over her choices.  The user has no control over the application developer&#x27;s choices.<p>In some ways, the best programs are the ones I write for own use only.  I know the user better than anyone and I have full control over the design choices.  Obviously, choosing not to use someone else&#x27;s software is ineffective as a means of controlling someone else&#x27;s design choices.  Perhaps unsolicited &quot;advice&quot; found in blogs might have some influence though.')
