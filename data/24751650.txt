Between 2007 and 2011, the NYT’s revenue fell by half. It’s only recovered a bit since then. A lot of the paper’s senior reporters are gone, replaced by younger reporters who just aren’t very good. Bloomberg is pretty good these days, so is the Financial Times. I also have to give a shout-out to Jacobin. I’m just about the opposite of their demographic ideologically, but their willingness to acknowledge facts contrary to their narrative is unmatched. I’m also a huge fan of Vox’s podcasts. The online presence is mostly trash, but Ezra Klein, Matt Yglesias, and Jane Coaston are some of the most serious and thoughtful people in journalism right now.')
