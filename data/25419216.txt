I naively assumed that PornHub, as a top-10 site on the web would be immune to such a piece, but I guess I was wrong. How many of the members of the NYT and the Visa and Mastercard boards who created on this outcome watched the videos that are now down? Probably a majority of them, but that wasn&#x27;t enough to stop the moral panic I guess.<p>As a side note, I think Reddit should now tread very carefully. PornHub had a lot more verification in place for people uploading porn, and even they&#x27;ve now been neutered by a hit piece. Hell, Reddit is somehow still in the iOS App Store despite having copious amounts of porn (and yes, underage porn too even if Reddit will deny it). They&#x27;re just an opinion columnist&#x27;s penstroke away from the mob coming to roost.')
