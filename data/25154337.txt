A facility with arithmetic helps with building a pile of concrete examples as a springboard for the leap to the abstract.<p>For example, the usual example of a cyclic group is {0,1,2,3,4,5} with addition modulo 6. Maybe we start with 12 rather than 6 because it is familiar to old people used to analogue clocks. We end up with one example for each size. But we could also give {1,2,3,4,5,6} with multiplication modulo 7. Now the abstract idea of an isomorphism has a concrete example. [0-&gt;1, 1-&gt;3, 2-&gt;2, 3-&gt;6, 4-&gt;4, 5-&gt;5]. And we get a new perspective on generators. {0,1,2,3,4,5} has an obvious generator: 1. We are tempted to view 5 as an extra nuisance generator. But we notice that 6x6 = 36 = 5x7+1 means that 6x6 = 1 in the multiplicative group so 6 isn&#x27;t a generator. And 2x2x2 = 8 = 7+1 == 1 mod 7, so 2 isn&#x27;t a generator either.<p>Viewed abstractly, product groups look dull and easy. The Klein Four group is a product C2 x C2, and has four elements {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)}. Obviously the only set of generators is {(0,1),(1,0)} and there are two automorphisms, the identity and the map that swaps (0,1) and (1,0).<p>Those with a facility with arithmetic might play with {1,3,5,7} and multiplication modulo 8. Or {1,5,7,11} and multiplication modulo 12. But beware, you are venturing into dangerous territory. Which one of 3,5, and 7 is (0,1) and which is (1,0)? You are going to discover that the previous paragraph is wrong. (1,1) looks different from (0,1) and (1,0). It looks inferior and not a generator. But actually there are three minimal sets of generators {3,5}, {5,7}. and {3,7}.<p>Playing with similar examples gives a second insight into what mathematicians mean by isomorphism. The first insight is that names don&#x27;t matter: an isomorphism is what a ConLanger would call a relex = relexification. You invent a new language by inventing new words for the same old stuff. The second insight is that we build compound names, with internal structure. We have primitive names, 0 and 1. We build compound names (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). Then the mathematical concept of isomorphism treats our set of compound names as a mere dust of points, discarding the structure. An isomorphism can as easily map (0,1) to (1,1) as to (1,0) because they are just names, like 3,5,7. A loose notion of isomorphism as &quot;same shape&quot; can trip you up, because the structure of the names isn&#x27;t part of the shape.<p>Knowing your times tables well enough to play happily with simple examples can help learners appreciate the subtleties of advanced math.')
