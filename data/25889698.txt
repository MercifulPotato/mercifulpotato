Code linting forces one to deal with code smells and innocuous errors that can cost a lot to fix once they escape into the field. Consistent code formatting and style are invaluable in (a) reducing cognitive load in picking names, which is a hard problem in computer science, (b) clarifying the structure of the code (you begin to see the forest for the trees, because the trees are mostly uniform) and (c) onboarding or familiarising with new codebases, including new areas of large codebases.')
