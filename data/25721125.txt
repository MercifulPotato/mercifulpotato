I think if you approach cast iron that way, you will have good results.<p>Basically, you don&#x27;t want the pan to look &quot;not-oiled&quot;, and how much effort you need to put into that depends on how much you are removing the existing oil during the cooking process.<p>I think the &quot;looks oily&quot; test is the proper determinant for if the cast iron is in good shape. Trying to develop a &quot;seasoning&quot; layer is likely to just cause frustration.')
