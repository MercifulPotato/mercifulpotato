Anything smaller would mean &quot;giving up&quot; on human spaceflight to the moon or Mars.   Doing it in a single launch is silly, but that thinking was widespread at the time.<p>And a low flight rate was also a given.   Delta IV Heavy only files about once every 18 months, there&#x27;s insignificant demand for anything even bigger.   That was why NASA decided they had to do this themselves, because it would be insane for any commercial company to build a rocket without a market.<p>And expensive was also part of the plan, you can&#x27;t spread enough pork to make it unkillable if it isn&#x27;t expensive.<p>Big, expensive, low flight rate.   Those weren&#x27;t problems, they were requirements.')
