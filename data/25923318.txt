Mozilla, or any of us (yeah, right), could rip out some of the fetaures that advertisers abuse and create a more &quot;advertising-proof&quot; version of Firefox.  \nHeck, we could create much smaller and faster Firefoxes.  But no, there can be only one.  Because reasons.<p>Take out that search bar and they would probably have to kiss the money from Google goodbye.<p>Getting rid of ads and tracking is not Mozilla&#x27;s highest priority.  Keeping online advertising alive is the highest priority because obvious reasons.<p>There is nothing in the contract we have with our ISP that says we must support online ads.  That is the benefit of paying for something.  There are actually terms and the possibility for enforcement.<p>Mozilla&#x27;s ad-supported web has no terms.  None that web users can enforce.
