Item(by='woofie11', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604661018, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998060, text='There&#x27;s a difference between &quot;illegal&quot; and &quot;not legally required.&quot;<p>* RIAA was legally welcome to send a DMCA letter which didn&#x27;t conform to DMCA requirements. Anyone can legally send a legal demand letter saying more-or-less anything, and plenty people do.<p>* Since this letter didn&#x27;t conform to DMCA requirements, github wasn&#x27;t required to take down youtube-dl, but was well within its right to do so.<p>* github wasn&#x27;t required to take down other instances of youtube-dl, not referenced in the letter, and ban users, but github can probably fire customers without cause, so there was nothing illegal.<p>... and so on.<p>RIAA may or may not have a legal leg to stand on with the DMCA anti-circumvention stuff, depending on what exactly Google does, and I haven&#x27;t dove into the system in enough detail to know. I don&#x27;t think Youtube implements DRM, but perhaps it does and perhaps youtube-dl circumvents it. That should be between youtube-dl and RIAA, nor between RIAA and github.<p>My own opinion is RIAA can&#x27;t have it both ways. If they don&#x27;t want people to copy, they should use tools designed for that: iTunes, Amazon Music, etc. If they want to use viral networks used for sharing personal videos, they should respect that those networks are designed for, well, sharing. If my mom uploads a video of my son playing with her to Youtube, yes, family members might want to download that if she&#x27;s okay with it.<p>The friction here is that centralized media, whom decentralized is disrupting, wants to now use decentralized media (and by &quot;decentralized,&quot; I&#x27;m talking from a social perspective -- anyone can publish versus a few people can publish -- not a technology one).')
