A few points I really disagree with:<p>1) It puts way too much emphasis on the ISA being a driver for performance. People have been making this claim against x86 forever, going back to the 90s when RISC chips started putting up some very impressive performance numbers. Lots of talk about how the x86 ISA was out of runway. This period existed fo a grand total of about 4 years (94 thru 97) until the Pentium II hit the market, which allowed PCs to start cutting into the workstation market. AMD creating the x86-64 extension handled the addressing limitation well too, letting it flourish in the server space as well.<p>2) The author seems to think Intel or AMD cannot make SoCs because of their business model. This really isn&#x27;t the case, and both companies have slowly been moving more &quot;stuff&quot; on package. AMD is already there with the xbox an playstation chips they manufacture. AMD&#x27;s chiplet approach would be particularly adroit at exploiting this. I get the feeling both AMD and Intel would <i>LOVE</i> it if PC vendors started demanding SoCs. And while the M1 has lots of little speciality processors onboard, both AMD and Intel have more robust processor I&#x2F;O. That&#x27;s by design: The M1 isn&#x27;t designed for the person who needs a gazillion PCI-E lanes for storage and networking (the M1 is likely has half the PCI-E lanes as consumer Zen2&#x2F;3 cpus and 1&#x2F;4th to 1&#x2F;8th compared to Threadripper and EPYC)<p>3) Glosses over the fact that one of the greatest challenges in computer architecture is coping with the so-called &quot;memory wall&quot;: there&#x27;s a growing latency chasm between cache and memory. Apple cleverly mitigates this by using very fast, low latency memory (LPDDR4x 4266 MT&#x2F;s vs DDR4 at 3200 MT&#x2F;s in x86 CPUs). But beyond how many MT&#x2F;s you&#x27;re operating with, I would love to see some latency figures. They likely blow your typical consumer DIMMs out of the water. Both AMD and Intel wok around this limitation with larger caches and smarter prefetching, but that only gets you so far. edit: And I would wager much of its impressive performance figures comes from Apple&#x27;s approach to addressing the memory wall. Memory latency benchmarks seem to strongly favor the M1 over both AMD and Intel CPUs.')
