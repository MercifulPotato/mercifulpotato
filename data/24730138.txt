A modern PEM electrolyzer has an efficiency of around 80%.<p>&gt; All in all, methane would be a saner, simpler target<p>I kind of agree, but this actually the same thing. To synthesis methane, one uses the water and electricity to create hydrogen with an electrolyzer and then add CO2 through hydrogenation to create methane. Advantage of methane is of course the higher density and it&#x27;s a bigger molecule that is easier to store.')
