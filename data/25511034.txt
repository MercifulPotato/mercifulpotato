Item(by='Barrin92', descendants=None, kids=[25511575], score=None, time=1608670007, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508176, text='<i>The game tries so hard to be cool â€” to come off as crass and edgy, to talk tough and play like some kind of anti-capitalist anarchy generator. But you lean too hard into that act and it will always come off more like a desperate pose than anything honest</i><p>It&#x27;s so true honestly. The game has the intellectual depth of a Che-shirt or that Kendall Jenner Pepsi commercial.<p>What the game reminds me of is Mark Fisher&#x27;s point about how we&#x27;ve lost the ability to imagine new futures, because Cyberpunk is the opposite of a futuristic game. Cyberpunk&#x27;s notion of sexuality in the future is basically bolting a penis or vagina onto the opposite sex, everyone&#x27;s driving around in retro-looking cars or motorcycles, nothing about it is actually novel other than the surface level aesthetic they&#x27;ve put on it, which has been virtually unchanged for four decades. The author is right that the most actual cyberpunk aspect of the game is in fact the development and sale of the game itself, like some sort of unwitting piece of performance art.')
