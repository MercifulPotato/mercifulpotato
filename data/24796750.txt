I recently bought a new car from a non-luxury brand that&#x27;s quite popular in the US, and a few days after buying it I was a bit surprised to realize that its &quot;dynamic cruise control&quot; and &quot;lane keep assist&quot; features amount to roughly the exact same thing as Tesla&#x27;s current Autopilot offerings. I am still shocked at how <i>under</i>sold these features were, both by the dealers and the car&#x27;s literature. I was driving for several days before I realized that, in addition the the dynamic cruise control I was familiar with, a simple button press could get the car to steer itself to stay in its lane.')
