Item(by='strogonoff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607465924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25349178, text='Comparing to XM3, I find it strange that AirPods Max don’t fold. I mean, it seems insignificant, but it does really take away from portability and convenience, which are (since for stationary listening I can get high-quality, made-in-Germany reference monitors at the same price!) among the main attractions.<p>The only feature I find worth considering AirPods Max for is, unexpectedly, the 5.1&#x2F;7.1 sound. If it is <i>truly</i> done properly (which I doubt, but promo materials hint at something there) then I have to admit, I don’t have the room for a proper setup like that, so this could be an accessible way to try working with surround sound.<p>Suspiciously, nothing is known about the codec and connectivity in general. If new AirPods are limited to kbps-starved AAC&#x2F;SBC, like AirPods Pro, that’d be very frustrating. I know, diminishing returns, but I don’t want yet another sound reproduction system “optimized” for streaming at Apple Music bitrates (especially if it’s 7.1). Sony’s LDAC aside, something approaching 600 kbps like aptX—or, absent that, at least an external audio in!—could make the price almost seem acceptable.')
