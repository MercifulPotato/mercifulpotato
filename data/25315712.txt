I also agree that &quot;the average explainability of a deep net is lower than the average explainability of a linear model&quot; (whatever that sentence means), my point is that it&#x27;s extremely hard to pinpoint what explainability means, because the usual characterization of &quot;you can fit the model in your head&quot; is extremely subjective and brittle.<p>I&#x27;m all for more research in this field. Heck, I&#x27;m all for more research in <i>any</i> field, but because our definition of &quot;explainability&quot; is so primitive and unrefined, arguing that we should build ethical or regulatory frameworks on top of it seems premature.')
