Germany were previously increasing fairly alarmingly in November, but seem to have been able to slow the increase down, if not get it heading down again.  France had a large spike in November, got it under control in December, but are on the rise again (though under a new lockdown&#x2F;curfew as of today).<p>The problem now in the UK is the winter pressures are at their worst, we haven&#x27;t even seen the impact of Christmas relaxation yet, and we&#x27;ve just exceeded the peak number of covid inpatients seen in the first wave.  We&#x27;re going to start seeing hospitals closing to new admissions soon (diverting to other nearby hospitals) as they hit full capacity.')
