However (and this is partly a function of it being a democracy), there&#x27;s not much rhyme or reason to how the capital is allocated with regards to plans for actually growing the tax base to a point where the US will be able to service the future debt.<p>The cynic in me wants to say that the government acting like this is merely democracy reflecting a public that finances their lifestyles with debt, without plans for increasing future income to service said debt.')
