I think the &quot;fake it till you make it&quot; worked great for me here.<p>Obviously there are limitations to this - not sure most people can just move to a new city - but perhaps the principles can be applied ---&gt; put yourself in an environment (like going to a meetup) where no one knows you and act like a socialite')
