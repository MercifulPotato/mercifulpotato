I was applying Feynman&#x27;s idea to writing, if you can&#x27;t explain something simply in plain English, you really should rewrite it to reach a wider audience.<p>&gt; I hate seeing advice like &quot;use simple, reduced vocabulary&quot;.<p>Sure, and if articles are written &#x27;normally&#x27;, for people with English as a second language, that means that they will learn more English words when they encounter new ones.<p>However &quot;I&quot; is one person, and an author wants to reach the widest audience, with the lowest common denominator.  I don&#x27;t understand much German or French, for example, but an article written in simple German or French is much more accessible to me (the lowest common denominator).<p>Writing is about reaching all of your audience.')
