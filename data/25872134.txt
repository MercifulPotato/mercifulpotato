You get an uuid from somewhere, probably external code that you cannot even look at. The uuid comes stringly-typed, let&#x27;s say as json. Then you have no chance to know what type it is, you can only assume it is the correct type that you expect.<p>Just putting &quot;550e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-446655440000&quot; into a person colum does not make it a person id.<p>If you get instead &quot;order-550e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-446655440000&quot; as a typed-uuid, you know for sure that this is not a person id. It is an order id. Somebody made a mistake somewhere. You also know that you probably have to look in the order DB to debug what it actually refers to.<p>&gt; but to use it throughout your db eats up tons of space from both text encoding the id<p>You dont need to put your uuid in this format into the db. You can add&#x2F;remove the type before&#x2F;after accessing the db.')
