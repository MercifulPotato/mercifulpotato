I was struck by just how much pointless, low-effort papers there are in this domain. People have been researching about bug prediction for over two decades now, and judging by the paper quantity, this isn&#x27;t a niche area. Yet how many organizations do actually employ those systems in real-world? Can&#x27;t comment on industry, but I haven&#x27;t found a single open-source program that does that [1].<p>Now I know &quot;most papers are pointless&quot; is a common complaint in science, specially in my area of focus- machine learning. But I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that the situation is particularly worse in software engineering related academic research.<p>[1] I saw Mozilla attempt it, but not sure if it&#x27;s currently in use.')
