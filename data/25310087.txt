I&#x27;d guess ads sent via API to be shown on unofficial apps would be less desirable than ads on the official app (which has known behaviors that reddit can document). Maybe the price would be lower or they&#x27;d only pay per click?<p>Do any other APIs include ads to be shown to the end user? It&#x27;s an interesting idea!')
