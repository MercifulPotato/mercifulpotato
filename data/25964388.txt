I don&#x27;t know the specifics of custodianship around an executed option and what collateral the buyer&#x27;s broker is responsible for upon execution, but it&#x27;s probably equivalent to buying 100 shares.<p>With respect to it being possible -- if RH denied options holders the right to execute they&#x27;d be prosecuted and fined an enormous amount. There is quite literally a contract that says the buyer has the right to acquire shares in a certain scenario -- the buyer&#x27;s broker responsibility here is simply to facilitate, and is in no place legally to deny that right.')
