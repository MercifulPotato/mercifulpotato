Once they switched to their own scheme, I didn&#x27;t notice any problems with maintenance.<p>With tileserver, it is more interesting. The full one (capable of generating raster tiles on demand) still needs ancient node.js (v10, soon to be eol), which can be a problem. The light one runs OK on the current stack.')
