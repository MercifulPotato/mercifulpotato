The state changes he suggests makes the button grayed out&#x2F;outlined which is the default &#x27;unselected&#x27; state for most applications. Tesla has it right. When NOA is activated, leave it blue, indicates that it&#x27;s active. When it&#x27;s deactivated, pressing the blue button disables it, showing the outline. I think the call to action <i>should</i> be to disable.')
