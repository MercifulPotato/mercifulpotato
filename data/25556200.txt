If I am not leaping to the wrong conclusions from your user name, then I know who you are and I&#x27;m the original author of that backgammon game :). I worked with your Dad to publish it back in 1990 or 1991. And yes, we got complaints all the time about die rolls favoring the computer player. At least as of a few years ago you could still find some archived usenet threads where we tried to put those to rest by discussing the architectural features you alluded to, as well as publishing some multi-million roll statistical distributions.
