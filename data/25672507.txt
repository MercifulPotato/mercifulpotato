They didn&#x27;t even scratch the surface. These buildings, the senators etc are all symbolic. They are <i>expressions</i> of the power relations, not the <i>originators</i> of it. Even if they do say stuff under threat, that would not have a real effect. It would be overturned by the Supreme Court or whatever.<p>There is no way to make Trump win this way and actually get obedience from the institutions of the country. They would just not recognize Trump, even if somehow senators, under duress, said he won.<p>It was 0 rods of the 7. Power is not in the buildings. It&#x27;s in the network of interests of powerful people in the background across the country.')
