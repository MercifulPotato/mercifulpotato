Thanks to extra $600&#x2F;$300 that the feds have added to federal unemployment, those that lost their jobs received in many cases significantly more that they were originally making, especially those making around minimum wage. At the same time, there are fewer avenues to actually spend that money, and the result of all of this is increased personal savings.<p>No, shoplifting is not increasing because people lack cash. Rather, people do it because they can, as the justice system declines to prosecute and punish people for it. Crime rate is significantly up, and for property crime it&#x27;s even worse than stats imply, because people don&#x27;t bother reporting, as there&#x27;s no point -- you can see that by comparing car theft rate to other property crime. Car theft is much higher, because people report most of them, as they need police report for insurance claim.<p>All of this is, of course, <i>entirely unsurprising</i>.')
