Bitcoin uniquely offers a way to spend money without the government knowing about it. Ransomware, moving money out of China, buying drugs online were all extremely difficult without bitcoin. Of course Bitcoin isn&#x27;t completely anonymous, but it can be. Buy bitcoin with cash to a new wallet and then send anywhere.<p>Gold is just the physical version of that. Just like all money is made up, the value of bitcoin and gold are pretty much imaginary.')
