Jim is the temporary manager while Michael is gone, and he tries to combine several staff birthdays which are close together into one big celebration. It backfires terribly.<p>When Michael returns and Jim expresses his relief, Michael explains that he made the same mistake Jim did once and explains that the decision to celebrate the close birthdays separately is a very deliberate one. He also implies that Jim is very much on the same trajectory as him.<p>He then makes a &quot;That&#x27;s what she said&quot; joke randomly, and Jim basically replies &quot;Uh, what?&quot; and Michael explains that he makes dumb jokes often to just break the tension.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty lucid moment for an otherwise often opaque character, but does imply that Michael&#x27;s quirks are a result of his staff and not in spite of them.')
