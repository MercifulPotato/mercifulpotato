It wasn&#x27;t expensive or anything. Keyboard is fine, touchpad is fine. But when i boot on it GUI and start VScode <i>things works</i> but starting a chromium on top of that brings a warm feeling to you... and it is not a metaphore. In general Pi 3 was a bit too slow. With Pi 4 everything could be &quot;fast enough&quot;. I&#x27;m waiting for more devices like this. But I prefer the format of a little bit more expensive Pi-top than keyboard i need to plug to monitor.<p>For this I would elect to buy naked Pi 4 and keyboard I would like and just wire everything together. If you wanna do stuff on it imho Keyboard feeling good is important.')
