As an aside, coming from a Linux&#x2F;Windows background and having partially moved to Mac recently, I observe the same of the Mac community.<p>For instance, when Big Sur launched, there was a tiny little utility that did nothing but change the color of the menu bar, and they wanted something like five dollars for it. Lots of stuff like this on Mac, I find. Popular FTP clients and text editors and disk utilities and stuff like that, they all cost money. The equivalents on Windows are more often than not free-as-in-beer. Just an observation.<p>But yeah, surely AmigaOS would benefit from being open source and free software in 2021, like EmuTOS or RISC OS Open. Unfortunately the ownership of the core parts of the OS has fallen into less than optimal hands (Cloanto...) and&#x2F;or is still encumbered by patents or rights issues. So it goes. There is AROS though of course.')
