I had hoped you would give me the benefit of the doubt that when I said weight you would take that to mean some sort of levelized metric.<p>The people that do these studies aren&#x27;t as dumb as you seem to think they are nor are the type of confounding variables you are expressing foreign to them. Not even study can get exactly the quality or quantity of date it wants, that&#x27;s why its a good idea to look at multiple studies and examine large-scale trends and repeatably, which is the type of studies I linked.')
