I find it to be a game changer for me.<p>The fact that my laptop, Switch, iPad, and several other devices can all share a charge has made my life much easier.  I can just sprinkle a few of them throughout the house and never be without power.  Before it was always a hunt to find a cable, or I had to be in [x] room to charge [y] device because that&#x27;s where the charger lived.<p>Plus, I can charge my MacBook on either side, so that&#x27;s basically life changing on its own. :)')
