A good phone is not a good laptop and the corpses along the way more or less prove that.<p>A phone will run a benchmark faster than a laptop for a couple minutes. Keep it under pressure for an hour - say, render a 4K video with a couple layers - it&#x27;ll have nowhere to dump the excess heat.<p>There is one way to really pull it off, however - when plugged, the phone hands over processing and RAM to the docking station (maybe via an image transfer from one hypervisor to the other), but there is very little to be gained here - coordination between the two, the way Apple already does it between macOS and iPhone, is a great experience. If the hypervisors keep the memory image in sync, say, every second copying dirty state to the phone, you can even unplug it without risking much.')
