There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about bio-polymers.<p>First of all bio-polymers is nothing new and revolutionary. The first plastics where bio-polymers like bakelite made from cellulose. The only reason we started making polymers from oil is because it&#x27;s a rest product from the oil-industry and thus cheap but the inherent properties of polymers are the same whether they come from oil or plants and they typically don&#x27;t break down in nature. The only positive thing with plant based polymers is that they could to some degree be considered carbon neutral.<p>But there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding that keeps spreading because we inherently think bio-polymers should be bio-degradable because they are made from organic material. There is one bio-based polymer in particular, PLA that is actually said to be bio-degredable and used in paper cups but this is in industrial facilities and not in nature where the degrading process is at lest 70 years under optimal circumstances.<p>And there are more problems with polymers then just the fact that they don&#x27;t brake down in nature. They contain toxic and endocrine disrupting chemicals like BPA.')
