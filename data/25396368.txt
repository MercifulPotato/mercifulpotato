Speech is bought through marketing. The wealthier and more get more of it. This is inherently undemocratic, as constituents don&#x27;t have equal political influence.<p>Dogmatic arguments suck.  Is Android&#x2F;Apple better?<p>We don&#x27;t live in a democratic utopia.  Instead, belief in democracy and associated values has provided maximal value creation and competitiveness generated by knowledge economies when compared to other current operating models.<p>That half the country is willing to dismantle what&#x27;s responsible for their quality of life would be funny, if it wasn&#x27;t the joy of dictators everywhere.  They can point to the absurdity of mob rule as half of us bite the hand that feeds. Clearly, something is already broken.')
