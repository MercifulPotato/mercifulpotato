It&#x27;s an incorporated company that has to follow normal AML&#x2F;KYC laws like other onramps. You don&#x27;t have to go through Namebase to get HNS. Also, you can buy HNS with BTC without KYCing on Namebase. You can&#x27;t sell or transfer the HNS without KYCing but you can still register names and transfer the names to other wallets without providing any passport info.')
