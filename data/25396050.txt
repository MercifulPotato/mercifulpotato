It&#x27;s a pretty good paper, but 2 major flaws that I think should be corrected.<p>From the paper:<p>&gt; Both of the above calculations may overstate the loss of remaining life in that they assign the remaining life expectancy based only on age, without taking into account that COVID-19 deaths are disproportionately occurring among those with compromised health status.<p>So their 11.7 average years remaining ignores the <i>critical</i> bit of information that we know this person died of COVID. It is extremely unlikely that if you took 2 80 year olds, one who died of COVID and one who did not, that if neither got COVID they would live to be the same age. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it was a 10x difference. While they do mention this and add some caveats (a good thing), I think because it completely changes the conclusions of the paper, they should have gone with a range and not a 11.7 number, which seems very improbable.<p>&gt; Avoiding 1.75 million deaths or 20.5 trillion person years of life lost would be valued at $10.2 to $17.5 trillion<p>Then they take the 11.7 figure from above and multiply it by the estimated average value of a year of life. Again, there is at least an order of magnitude difference between a year of life at age 90 and a year of life at age 30, for most people.<p>Finally, although my ~3.5 number is much closer to the truth than 11.7, there is a difference between life expectancy and &quot;healthy lifespan&quot;, aka &quot;healthspan&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6136295&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6136295&#x2F;</a>). Healthspan is a newer concept but I expect will be the primary term in a decade or two.<p>Thank you for providing the link, a good read.')
