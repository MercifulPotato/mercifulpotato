But his ideas were simple. Each idea in its own card and a flat structure, so that ideas can be composed in many ways. People tend to overthink how to implement this, and forget about the basics.<p>In my case, I just use one Org file per card. I don&#x27;t use internal links. I prefer search (ripgrep) and index files, where I list sequences and entry points to topics. This also allows restructuring my Zettelkasten more easily once new ideas emerge, or once I realize my old ideas were wrong.<p>In other words, I am trying to go one step further by decoupling cards (ideas) from links (relationships).<p>I do use external links, and in particular DOI links to publications. But I keep these in footnotes. Hence, my zettels look really spartan. It&#x27;s just plain text plus footnotes.<p>Aside from Org and Markdown, TiddlyWiki is pretty neat. It&#x27;s pretty good for transclusion. That can also be achieved in single-file Org Zettelkastens &#x2F; wikis.')
