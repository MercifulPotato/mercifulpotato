They are saying that the move to renewables might make the grid less stable over the next few years though, so worth thinking about perhaps.<p>Frankly, I find nowadays I can&#x27;t do much without an internet connection anyway... Maybe we should put ~5 second batteries into desktops just to sync disks and power off safely.')
