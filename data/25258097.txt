On the other hand, I&#x27;m also a little more open to randomly taking a call outside of when I&#x27;d normally be in the office.<p>Right now working from home is a bit different. For example, almost everyone I work with could also be working from home, so all of our meetings are online. That&#x27;s a bit of a benefit. On the other hand, it&#x27;s not possible to do most forms of in-real-life recreation right now (gyms&#x2F;food&#x2F;movies&#x2F;social gatherings) because it&#x27;s not safe. So stuff gets more stressful and boring than it would normally be.')
