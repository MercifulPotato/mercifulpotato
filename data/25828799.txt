Below, I would like to have a while loop that grabs the magic numbers every 10 minutes and plots them.<p>I know how to do it with two separate scripts and saving intermediate numbers to a file, but it would be great to be able to do it within a single Jupiter notebook. However, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a straight-forward way of doing it.')
