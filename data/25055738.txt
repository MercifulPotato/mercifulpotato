I think randomly-chosen representatives could be a workable solution.  It might be awful in some ways, but the House would then be a reasonably accurate representation of the full population.  And if they did anything nonsensical, there&#x27;s still the Senate which would presumably still be elected in the usual way.<p>I&#x27;ll bet people would take more interest the quality of public education for the average citizen, at least.')
