I think I was projecting myself too much when saying that YouTube doesn&#x27;t help me. That depends on how I use YouTube, but I don&#x27;t want to indict the entire platform because I happen to use it suboptimally. There are so many ways to use YouTube that didn&#x27;t immediately pass my mind, like for DIY or sharing family videos. On the other hand there is a lot of other content that is easy to get into, but which I cannot apply to learning skills or about people. Just because some people might have issues being too distracted by media that is really easy to reach doesn&#x27;t mean that people more disciplined can take advantage of the same media for their own benefit.<p>I was more meaning about being distracted. A lot of times it feels like browsing sites with a lot of updates is something I do when there is not immediately anything else to do. But that&#x27;s an individual issue. If I am going to rectify that problem, then I need to ask what I would be doing instead, and do that, instead of falling back to whatever happens to be in reach. Sometimes I apply a rule of only using YouTube for X hours if I know exactly what I want to watch ahead of time, instead of using the recommendations to watch something I didn&#x27;t necessarily know or care about but looks like an enticing rabbit hole to fall into from the presentation.<p>I do enjoy using YouTube as a platform, I just need better viewing habits.')
