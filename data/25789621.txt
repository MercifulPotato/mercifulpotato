You will treat them with cooking waste (and cereals and ground seashell) and they give you deep orange eggs. Chances are you can save to-be-killed chicken for free, some local farmer gave us a dozen (they&#x27;re not productive enough for exploitation but still can have a healthy life). IMO the important thing (as always) is DIY: understand how it&#x27;s done, do it right. The degeneracy of industry for a big part a byproduct of insane scale.')
