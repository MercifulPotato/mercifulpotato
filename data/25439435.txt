Having said that, as a superpower, the US requires a relationship with Russia.<p>It turns out that the CCP is vastly more dangerous than Russia ever was, making our relationship with Russia even more important. The CCP has been in a cold war with the US since the 1950s when Mao said, &quot;hide our strength, bide our time.&quot; Mao had a falling-out with Russia because Russia wouldn&#x27;t declare a joint military war for ideological reasons on the US on multiple occasions in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s. (The CCP developed nuclear missiles mainly to attack the US.)<p>Xi is literally an ideological clone of Mao, even though Maoists jailed his father and made Xi do child labor in a work camp digging ditches. To protect his immediate family, they live in Australia and Canada because it&#x27;s not safe to live in China.<p>The real Mueller investigation should have been into the Biden family, who was involved in influence peddling to the CCP and Ukraine. And the Clintons, who were bought by the Saudis. (There is indisputable proof online, and neither family has ever denied it. Biden&#x27;s &quot;I love my son.&quot; is not a denial.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;joe-biden-politics-business-ukraine-subpoenas-b5245760245d5dee3e011f0df5e1868e" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;joe-biden-politics-business-ukrai...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2016&#x2F;jul&#x2F;07&#x2F;fact-checking-donations-clinton-foundation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2016&#x2F;jul&#x2F;07&#x2F;fact-checking...</a><p>Trump&#x27;s foreign policy is widely acknowledged to be the best in almost 70 years. Whereas Obama is compared to Jimmy Carter, Trump is compare to Reagan. (Don&#x27;t confuse what&#x27;s best for the US and the free world with what Europeans whine about. They don&#x27;t even pay for their own defense.)<p>AMA.')
