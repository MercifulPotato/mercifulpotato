Disabling other people&#x27;s screenshot capability so someone can be made to believe that their message will disappear is absurd. If you want a message that disappears, tell them in person and pat them down for a wire. Also there&#x27;s nothing wrong with simply screenshotting licensed content. I&#x27;m allowed to do so for my own personal use. If someone is distributing licensed content that they are not licensed to do so, that&#x27;s a matter for the courts.')
