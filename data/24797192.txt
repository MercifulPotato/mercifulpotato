This means the minimum amount of material for each part. This means the strongest &#x2F; weight materials, and manufacturing methods that reliably achieve it.<p>For metal parts, this means forgings, which are 3x stronger than castings. The forging process is also pretty reliable compared to castings. Forging is also expensive, the only thing more expensive is a hogout from a billet.<p>In order to be usable for critical airplane parts, a 3D printed part would have to have the strength and reliability of forgings - and of course be cheaper.<p>BTW, on my hot rod engine I replaced all the moving parts in  it with forgings, and the bell housing is a steel forging, too (stock is cast aluminum), because I like my feet.')
