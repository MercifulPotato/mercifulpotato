Item(by='huac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611028535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25828754, text='PSLDX does not dynamically adjust the leverage between stocks&#x2F;bonds as a typical risk parity strategy would. Not that this is necessarily bad, this fund has a consistent exposure to a duration trade, buying long term bonds and paying short-term borrowing rate. over the last 40 years or so this has been a fantastic trade, as interest rates dropping both raises the price of bonds, propels higher equity values, and lowers the cost of leverage.<p>the downside to this particular fund is the extreme turnover in the fixed income component (only suitable for tax-free accounts) and the interest rate risk; the fund could underperform SPY in a world with increasing interest rates (which is where many traders believe we are now)')
