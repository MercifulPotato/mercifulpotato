Even if we didn&#x27;t know it, the valuable part was the problem solving, and the candidate could display good communication skills by explaining the language features you were not familiar with. \nThis is much better than picking a language that you don&#x27;t know (happened several times that someone picked python, and when asked to write a class said &quot;I know how to write classes in java&quot;. We switched to java, no problem.)')
