I&#x27;ve for example used C++ functionally, brought Objective-C and Erlang ideas into C++ and so on when I was dominantly programming in C++. During that period, I also made a scheme-dialect interpreter in C because for some of the things we wanted to do C&#x2F;C++ were too hard boiled.<p>More recently, I&#x27;ve brought CSP into Javascript through sweet.js so I can write go-routines in JS, and along the way also brought Mozart&#x2F;Oz&#x27;s &quot;data flow variables&quot; a.k.a. promises as native to JS (again through sweet.js).<p>I&#x27;ve also run a short fun &quot;course&quot; at my company called &quot;no spoon&quot; where the participants build a stack-based language in JS and implement many defining features of many other programming languages .. including all the above.<p>So what I&#x27;m trying to say is that you don&#x27;t need to lament that you can&#x27;t use a language that you learnt in your day job. New ideas in languages are always worth learning no matter what language you work with on a day-to-day basis.')
