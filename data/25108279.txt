Apple has always been at the forefront of extreme usability (kids using iPads, seniors sending iMessages) and the internet has a lot of toxic stuff that needs to be kept away from many non technical users (for my parents&#x27; computer, I rather have this ping home to Apple with hashes of apps they open than them being exposed to tons of malware). That said they really need to work on the privacy aspect..')
