Other GPS maps will send you to my house on a road that hasn&#x27;t really been passable for 30 or 40 years - if you make the mistake of not telling it to avoid dirt roads. But, if you tell it to stick to paved roads, it&#x27;ll have you park about 2 km away.<p>I have no idea how to fix this, except to suggest that they update the maps that the GPS relies on. It&#x27;s such a remote area that it&#x27;s not a priority for them. Every year we get a few people who think that GPS can&#x27;t be wrong. Maybe if one of &#x27;em dies and someone sues they&#x27;ll get around to updating it.')
