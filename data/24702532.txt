The lucky few get rich with the millions gambling away their fortunes in the hopes of making it big someday.<p>&gt; In effect Amazon takes at the minimum of 65% of the product cost as itâ€™s revenue.<p>&gt; Even worse is that returns are almost always borne by the seller...Amazon goes so far as to charge the sellers for the selling fees, the ad costs, the returns costs and outrageously even the disposal costs for returned items. Sellers lose up to 200% or more of the product cost on every return.<p>At some point something has to break and people will start leaving for other ecommerce platforms...right?')
