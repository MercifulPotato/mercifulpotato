And of course any number of countries of any political persuasion where such laws are meant to stifle and are exercised for suppression of viewpoints.<p>I don&#x27;t have an answer to this. However we define it, some people&#x2F;groups genuinely <i>hate</i>, without cause reason or empathy, and they genuinely provoke and exercise violence. Inasmuch as we try to get to a root cause of the problem, I can understand why well meaning people can attempt to define precursors of violence and suffering. I just haven&#x27;t seen it done well yet :-&#x2F;')
