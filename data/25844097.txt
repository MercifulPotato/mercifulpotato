Given the bad faith actions of Gebru already (and apparently she&#x27;s at least partially the source here from the other reply to your comment) it makes sense for Google to clarify with the response they gave (and in that response Google also did not mention the name of the employee).<p>This issue is way too heated for real productive discussion on internet forums. It&#x27;s obviously tribal, flamewar bait, with a massive undercurrent of partisan politics (and perceived partisan politics on the side of the person you&#x27;re disagreeing with).<p>I found what Gebru did earlier to be wrong, my prior is that the behavior here by the employee is also likely to be wrong. I&#x27;ve been generally disappointed in the level of discussion from the political fringes (both &#x27;woke&#x27; and pretty much the entire GOP at this point). I find a lot of overlap between this Google AI ethicist community and critical race theory woke politics.<p>I suspect in the end when all the details are out Google will be in the right.<p>Without waiting there&#x27;s no point for all the arguing that&#x27;s going to go back and forth in these comments.')
