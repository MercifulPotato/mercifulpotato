My trackpad also stopped working.<p>For the GPU, I took it to a repair shop here in the Bay Area. They were able to quickly diagnose and sent it to another shop in the area that specializes in it. Was told it was a simple soldering fix. Apparently a guy makes his living doing this since he knows exactly where to solder.<p>GPU issues aside, I think the submitter wanted to draw attention to the fake charger posting about a hotel fire. It sounds like a much more interesting story than this battery GPU issue.')
