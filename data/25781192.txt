Those large outlets based in the cities were where I (living in rural SW Ontario) gained my understanding of what was going on with the United States response to 9&#x2F;11.<p>I&#x27;m not making this up. They maintain well-organized archives and it&#x27;s easy to search, filter by date range, section, and sort. For example, &quot;Bush WMD&quot; search between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2011 returns a wide variety of perspectives and types of journalism: some straight reporting of the news, some press releases, and some opinion columns from varying perspectivesâ€”some in line with what you&#x27;re claiming is the entire stance of North American media, and some not. Those sections are not all equal in their &quot;truthiness&quot; (another fun term from those times, if you recall).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;search?dropmab=true&amp;endDate=20111231&amp;query=Bush%20WMD&amp;sections=World%7Cnyt%3A%2F%2Fsection%2F70e865b6-cc70-5181-84c9-8368b3a5c34b&amp;sort=oldest&amp;startDate=20010101" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;search?dropmab=true&amp;endDate=20111231...</a>')
