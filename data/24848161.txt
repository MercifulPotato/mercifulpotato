Actually, I tried to use SDL_image and while the page for the package exists on wrapdb[0], it has no versions listed and so building with SDL_image fails. Source builds on windows for SDL2 fail because it presumes a UNIX-style build and fails looking for &#x27;unistd.h&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;ve found the real &#x27;one true solution&#x27; for my needs to be conan + meson. Conan includes a build script that supplies pkg-config files to Meson for dependency handling, and with conan you can use the gigantic repository of packages along with bincrafters for an even gigantic-er repository of packages. I have not yet found a package I needed that wasn&#x27;t on either conan center or bincrafters. And on Linux I can download the source to build if I really want to, but on Windows I&#x27;m happy just downloading the binary .lib files.\nAnd it&#x27;s so easy to use. cd build &amp;&amp; conan install .. &amp;&amp; conan build .. is all you need to download and compile everything.<p>Before this setup I used vcpkg with cmake and I&#x27;m never going back to that. Yet before vcpkg I used ExternalContent, which I would also never go back to. Ergonomics are extremely important with this kind of thing. I think that&#x27;s why cargo is a huge hit in this space.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wrapdb.mesonbuild.com&#x2F;sdl2_image" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wrapdb.mesonbuild.com&#x2F;sdl2_image</a>')
