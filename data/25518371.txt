Spotify does.<p>I play music all day while working and I&#x27;d love to listen to more artists but most times, I&#x27;m stuck in the routine between my Release Radar on Fridays, Discovery Weekly on Monday, and Daily Mixes during the rest of the week. I add songs I like to a variety of personal playlists and sometimes I start a &quot;Song Radio&quot; for a song I like. But even then, I just end up getting the same songs Spotify seems to think I liked only because they&#x27;ve already played them to me over and over. Part of me wonders if their algorithm favours songs that costs them less in royalties...<p>Playlists made by real people seem way better than any Spotify playlist, but they are difficult to discover. I&#x27;d love a feature that recommends me playlists from people that share my music tastes. One example, is a playlist called &quot;Sexy Bath&quot; by Nicoleta Tataru.')
