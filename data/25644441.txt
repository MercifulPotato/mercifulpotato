Item(by='BlueTemplar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609846364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25633483, text='&gt; color palettes are mostly a thing of the past<p>&gt; With HDR and wide gamut on the horizon, things are moving even further away to ever requiring any form of dithering.<p>My impression is that, if anything, the almost total dominance of sRGB (in the consumer space) is coming at an end in the digital mediums, on one side from the generalization of wide gamut and high dynamic range transmissive LCD&#x2F;LED screens, and on the other end the rising wave of both (higher frequency) black &amp; white and color e-ink. (And I&#x27;m still hopeful for the resurrection of transflective LCDs, like in Pebble.)<p>So I would expect dithering to come back, either to avoid banding on lower bit per color displays, and&#x2F;or &#x27;add&#x27; colors to lower color gamut ones.<p>For instance, my 2009 LCD is a 8bpc wide gamut one (and fairly high dynamic range too). So if I were to take full advantage of it (leaving sRGB), I would require dithering to avoid banding.')
