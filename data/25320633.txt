Consider this scenario:<p>Act 1: When I&#x27;m not paying attention, my friend says, &quot;hey, do you mind if I go through your address book and contact all your friends and family and ask them to be my friend too? If you consent, say, &#x27;what&#x27; or &#x27;huh&#x27;&quot;<p>Act 2: When I&#x27;m not looking, this friend goes through my address book and spams all my contacts with whatever they&#x27;re selling under my name.<p>What would you advise me to do after that? You&#x27;d probably say, this person is not your friend by most definitions of the word, you should cut them out of your life and ask them to not contact you anymore.<p>To which I may say, but this friend is well connected, they might be able to get me a job in the future. (Although I&#x27;ve never gotten a job or even a lead through LinkedIn personally.)<p>What would you say to that? Probably something like, they&#x27;re abusive and deceitful, whatever they have to offer, they&#x27;ll probably damage your life more than they&#x27;d help you.<p>And that&#x27;s why I closed my account and added a &quot;delete on sight&quot; filter for their emails.')
