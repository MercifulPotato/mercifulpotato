In reality this is complicated as you need to assign probabilities to (1) when liquidity event can occur (2) real value of your equity at the event (3) discount rate.<p>While estimating probability distributions is probably beyond what one can do without detailed inside knowledge (and even then), it&#x27;s useful to think of a number of stories, eg: target_co will ipo in 3 years at 2x last raised value, target_co will ipo in 5 year at last raise, target_co will be acquired at 0.1x last raise in 8 years (what is the overhang?); let&#x27;s say all at equal probabilities. For discount rate you can think of alternative places where you could work (eg. alternative_public_co will grow at -10, +20, +30% yoy with equal probability) + time value of not being able to liquidate (let&#x27;s say another 10%).<p>This will give you some range of numbers to consider.')
