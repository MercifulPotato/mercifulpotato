We both live in our respective countries.<p>The company is an American Delaware C Corporation via Stripe Atlas, Each of us own 50%. We are very small with no funding, started this year, less than 20K MRR.<p>We have tried numerous accounting firms in trying to figure out how each of us can get paid from the company, but this just doesn&#x27;t seem easy.<p>We spoke with numerous accounting firms and they said setting up a Canadian subsidiary (which costs hundreds of thousands of dollars) is one potential outcome.<p>Has anyone dealt with this before. This is just a side project for the time being, but it seems impossible to legally get the money out for small side projects on the Canadian side.')
