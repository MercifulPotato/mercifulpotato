Used to be you needed heavy, big and <i>hot</i> multi-killowat HPS lamp installations for the best indoor farming, but not anymore!<p>I set up a small experimental indoors farm myself, and I used cheap LED lamps you can get anywhere, three different temperatures, interspersed on a custom frame above the plants.<p>I realized I know nothing about soil, because it turns out there&#x27;s more to it than just dumping it in a pot. Soil composition and density are really important, moreso than the pH (that a lot of people focus on) in my experience. I would&#x27;ve definitely fucked up with a hydroponic setup that I first considered. Soil is much better and we really don&#x27;t appreciate it as much as we should. It&#x27;s literally the source of life.<p>These plants needed more root aeration, the first batch was terribly small, but still pretty good. Second batch was much better thanks to a custom soil&#x2F;pebbles setup (soil in the center, pebbles around the <i>fabric</i> pot), then I realized the lumen output needed to be much higher for perfect results. I wanted to try some COB LEDs, which output more lumen, but I could not find any (and importing would take too long and cost way too much), plus I really wanted to see what simple SMD LEDs could do.<p>So I trashed the whole thing in favor of custom Tipi style tents for individual plants with the LED lamps spread all around and above. Not the most efficient use of space, but it turned out to be the best for growth.<p>~2 months from seed to harvest, electricity cost was laughably low (~$20 <i>total</i> per plant) and heat generation was practically non-existent. I also had plants outdoors, tbh the sun-grown tomatoes tasted better, but the other greens were just as good grown indoors.<p>Still not sure if LED production is environmentally friendly or sustainable, but it sure is revolutionary.')
