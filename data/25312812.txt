(thus saving you the manual work of posts like this). I appreciate this would (i) require a code change and (ii) would shift the HN model from individual threads based on 1 URL submission, but just thought I’d suggest it to the HN brains trust.<p>In other news: Keep up the good work that you do on HN to give this online community ‘structure’.')
