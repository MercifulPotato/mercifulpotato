The former can often wait 24 hours; the latter cannot wait at all. Medicare data does not capture that at all - it only captures the categorical, &quot;surgery type.&quot;<p>e.g., someone has a run of the mill cholecystitis that needs to come out. It can go when there&#x27;s an opening in the surgical schedule, or tomorrow morning. That&#x27;s an &quot;emergency&quot; - it came in through the ED, wasn&#x27;t elective.<p>Then there&#x27;s the person w&#x2F; chole that looks septic and you&#x27;re afraid they&#x27;re going to perf or already have. That person is going to the OR <i>now</i>.<p>Under Medicare coding, both of those are lap choles, CPT 47562. This doesn&#x27;t control for that at all, except in the broadest of ways.<p>Also, a 65yo surgical candidate and a 99yo surgical candidate are wildly different. 99yo isn&#x27;t going under the knife for anything other than immediate threat of death or unendurable pain. In the lap chole example above, I&#x27;m going with a trial of abx in the 99yo unless he&#x27;s absolutely about to perf; 65yo, sure, let&#x27;s take the gallbladder out - once he&#x27;s progressed to sx chole, odds are really good it&#x27;ll have to come out within the next two years. I think most surgeons would rather do it at 65 than 67.<p>Looking at the 2x2 of 65, 99, emergency, and EMERGENCY, you capture an incredibly large variety of severity and risk.')
