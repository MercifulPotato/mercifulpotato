I believe you can retro fit an SD card reader in place of the disc drive.<p>On the plus side, it does have 8 outputs, which is handy for drums as you can send different samples to different channels and effects.  It has a distinctive sound due to being 12 bit and having good filters that you can tweak over midi.  It&#x27;s somewhat similar to a W30 keyboard but in a rack mount and without the sequencer or SCSI.<p>You can &quot;cheat&quot; with the sample time by making multiple virtual copies of sounds and having them automatically play forward and then reverse in a loop.  There&#x27;s no time stretch as such but it&#x27;s possible to split a drum break in that way, assign a virtual sample to each beat and push and pull the tempo.<p>Not sure I&#x27;d recommend anyone buy one over just getting software these days but I have it, and it&#x27;s fun to use occasionally in a retro way.')
