Item(by='dvt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603137055, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24829635, text='&gt; Discord is a successful company.<p>I&#x27;m bearish on Discord (as I was last year). Discord didn&#x27;t win, it&#x27;s burning money and nitro is (currently) not saving them -- just how their previous attempt at monetization (the store) didn&#x27;t either. Alternative narratives won&#x27;t make this fact true. People seem to conveniently forget about XFire, and the many other &quot;gaming chat apps&quot; that preceded it. Why Discord <i>appears</i> to have won is because it&#x27;s free.<p>We&#x27;ll see what happens when the money dries up.')
