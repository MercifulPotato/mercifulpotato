Elsevier and other such journal publishers rely on business models that drive up the cost of education, reduce access to knowledge, and skew the incentives of researchers - in short they make humanity collectively dumber and we all suffer for it. It would be in everyone&#x27;s best interest for researchers to switch over to publishing in free journals, we&#x27;d be good, but that won&#x27;t happen so long as the free journals are labelled inferior to the paid ones, and thus researchers are penalized for bucking the system.')
