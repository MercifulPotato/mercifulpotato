The writing is damn good, the character development is on point, it&#x27;s not forceful (no pun intended) or disingenuous in trending social themes, cinematography is amazing, great casting, it&#x27;s immersive in keeping to canon. It&#x27;s something you can point to and say, &quot;That&#x27;s Star Wars&quot;.<p>One could only wish those two get a shot at making the full lengths.')
