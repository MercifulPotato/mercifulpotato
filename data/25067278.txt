Some of us want a long term relationship. The fact that you&#x27;ve become good at meeting lots of people and starting relationships with them is proof you are not even remotely achieving the same goal.<p>My goal. Meet one great person, be with them for a very long time. Ideally for life but lets say 10 years. At 10yrs I&#x27;d have 6 to 7 relationships my entire life. If you tell me, &quot;it&#x27;s easy. I have a few new relationships a month&quot; you haven&#x27;t achieved the same goal.<p>I too can achieve the different goal of sleeping with lots of people but I choose not to because that&#x27;s not my goal.')
