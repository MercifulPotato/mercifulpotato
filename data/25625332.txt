Anything else is icing on the cake.<p>The only reason python seems slow as an implementation language is because it was traditionally slow; the reason it was traditionally slow is that cpython, the only major implementation, is slow.  Common lisp, for instance, is similarly dynamic (moreso, in fact), also is also generally natively compiled by itself, and is quite performant.')
