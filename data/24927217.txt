Given the diversity issues in the tech industry, it is important that we continue the work of making conferences more inclusive, particularly to those from marginalized backgrounds</i><p><i>&gt; In particular, I was concerned that if only partial information became available, the anti-CoC crowd might jump on this as an example of problems with codes of conduct more generally, or might point at this as part of “cancel culture” (a concept I vehemently disagree with, since what is referred to as “cancellation” is often just “facing consequences”)</i><p>You wouldn&#x27;t advocate scrapping the entire criminal justice system, just because one innocent person was convicted. A little more nuance is useful here as well.<p>Every community has its set of guidelines, either explicit of implicit, intended to foster the community&#x27;s purpose. If I go to my neighbor&#x27;s party and behave like a jerk, and insult the other guests, there&#x27;s a very good chance that I won&#x27;t be invited back. If I start posting &quot;dank memes&quot; continuously on HN, I&#x27;m eventually going to find myself banned. As the author himself said, <i>what is referred to as “cancellation” is often just “facing consequences”.</i><p>In this case, I have no idea why the committee came down hard on the author. I saw the relevant portions of his talk, and didn&#x27;t hear anything rude or objectionable. I think the committee got it wrong in this instance, but that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone in future should be allowed to be a jerk, and not face any consequences.')
