None of them violated anything, and appeals are still progressing 2 months later. 8&#x2F;12 unsuspended - 4 more to go.<p>What was especially sad was that I used tweetdeck to improve my security - can use the account without sharing my password. However, twitter penalized me for trying to improve security by using it as a discovery mechanism for my remaining accounts.')
