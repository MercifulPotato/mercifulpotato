Usually, when I&#x27;ve done interviews, I&#x27;ll try to throw a wrench into the question and see how the candidate reacts if I suspect they&#x27;ve seen the question before.<p>Though in both cases, I think it&#x27;s on the question asker (either teacher or interviewer) to make sure that questions change up frequently enough and aren&#x27;t easy to study without having genuine understanding.')
