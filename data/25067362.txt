Actually there’s a third: the Dropbox iOS app cannot reliably run in the background, so mass uploading is only possible when the phone is plugged in and the screen switched on with the app in the foreground (e.g. overnight) - but this is the fault of iOS.<p>Is there an alternative you’d recommend? I also use Dropbox for its cost-per-TB and Linux client.')
