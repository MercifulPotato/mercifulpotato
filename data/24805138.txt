Yocto&#x2F;OE gets a bad reputation as overly complicated, especially because a lot of people are doing this with hobbyist boards where they just want blinkenlichten. Yocto is definitely not easier for quick spinup on weekend projects.<p>However, if you&#x27;re doing this full-time, and you want to do anything remotely complicated (you will), and especially if you have multiple products (you will), you start yearning for OpenEmbedded. It takes some time to learn, and the abstractions are hard to understand outside-looking-in, but it&#x27;s well worth the effort.')
