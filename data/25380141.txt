I purchased the Xbox Adaptive Controller with the one-handed joystick attachment, and I&#x27;d like to make my game more available to people that have a different situation with regards to mobility.<p>If you have a physical disability and there are certain configuration options that help you enjoy a third-person game, I&#x27;d love to hear from you.
