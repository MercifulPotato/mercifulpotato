I&#x27;ve had good experiences with SQLBoiler [0] on the other hand. I haven&#x27;t used it in for anything in production, but it&#x27;s been a breeze to use in a couple of personal projects, and it handles complex SQL queries much better compared to GORM.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;volatiletech&#x2F;sqlboiler" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;volatiletech&#x2F;sqlboiler</a>')
