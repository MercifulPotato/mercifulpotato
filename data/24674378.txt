I know that a lot of people are saying that it changed their lives and in fact, it helped me to understand how far I could push my mind and body to its productivity limits, which helps me be productive today. However, as mentioned in some of the other comments, it makes you angry and I have lost many friends and closed many doors socially. I also would not say that I was actually more purposeful in my daily activities. Meaning, I may have been able to produce more mental and physical output but like you mention, I would fixate on lots of unnecessary things that ultimately put me behind in what I wanted to accomplish over the course of a year or even who I wanted to be as a person.')
