The Evil Martians blog posts were really helpful in getting started.<p>I have to say though, it&#x27;s extremely un-railsy and the N+1 problem is hard to solve without creating heaps of extra loader types. The overarching issue is that from the front end perspective all queries are equal, where in fact some are much more expensive than others. I end up spending most of my time optimising the query resolvers to perform well for the set of queries the front end actually makes as it&#x27;s not feasible to optimise for all possible outcomes.<p>The front end development experience was made marginally better, but it created far more problems than it was worth. It&#x27;s harder to debug, it&#x27;s harder to isolate performance problems, and the Rails documentation and battle-tested experience (not just todo apps) detailed in blogs and on stackoverflow is thin.<p>Unless you have a really good reason I would steer clear for now. Better to spend your time solving business problems than wrangling an immature framework.')
