If you forcefully throw an object out of the back of a moving car, its speed at the moment you throw it would be the speed of the car + the speed of the throw. Simple and intuitive enough.<p>But when you involve near-light speeds... So, if you&#x27;re moving at 90% of the speed of light, and you have a lightbulb in your vehicle, what would be the speed of the photons coming out of it? Logically, it would be 190% of the speed of light. But apparently that&#x27;s not how it works. So how the hell does it work then?!')
