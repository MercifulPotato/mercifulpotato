Some of them are particularly jarring. For example, if you look at the screenshot of the system settings in the announcement, the pictures with two lines of subtext are above the ones with only one line despite them being the same size. It might seem minor but the situation repeats everywhere.<p>I understand it might not be a priority of the project but it leaves me with the feeling of something left unfinished and makes KDE completely unusable for me.<p>Edit: I feel like I need to edit my post because I am unnecessarily negative. Fixing the visual might actually be a huge task and I think KDE is getting better every release. A huge thank you to the team for the effort they pour into developing free software.')
