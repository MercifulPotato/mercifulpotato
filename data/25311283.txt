That&#x27;s over 16 bits.<p><pre><code>    0.9999999999999999999999999999999\n    1.0000000000000000000000000000000\n</code></pre>\nCounting the number of different digits has no useful meaning.  The example you cite has two results that differ by 1 part in 10 quadrillion.  If you have a good reason care about the precise implementation of hyperbolic functions to that level of precision then you don&#x27;t rely on whatever you happen to stumble on in some version of nodejs.')
