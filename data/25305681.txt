With hacker news being father to the right than twitter and reddit, and more center right than my facebook feed.<p>One conclusion is hacker news exists in a right wing bubble.  The other is that twitter and reddit exist in a left wing bubble.  Given that the median voter in the last election voted for Biden, but just barely, and maybe voted for a republican senator.  And even the people arguing her being let go was justified are probably pretty center or center left.  I would guess your &quot;elsewhere&quot; exists in a ideological bubble that is much stronger than the one hacker news exists in.')
