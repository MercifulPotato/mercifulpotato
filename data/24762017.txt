If your company is using analytics like this, it will be almost impossible to remove personally identifiable tracking information from website or mobile app platform.<p>This means it will become a nightmare to remove the user tracking information from every system and system logs.

I see some efforts by Apple, but than the larger app eco-system still rely on trading privacy for some free apps or utilities will be hard to go.')
