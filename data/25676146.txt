Certainly I don&#x27;t support anything like that - but then, I&#x27;m Canadian, I don&#x27;t support people being armed in general.<p>&gt; The same argument would apply to all riots caused by disinformation regardless of if I recognise the disinformation as false rather than true.<p>You make a fair point about the misinformation from a purely argument-logic standpoint (both classes of events being spurred on by some amount of misinformation).<p>The greater gestalt of my argument is that it&#x27;s asinine to consider any side of the mainstream media in the USA to somehow not be a biased source of misinformation, malicious and deliberate or otherwise. You can pick your side, Fox or MSNBC or anything else, and get the bias you &quot;prefer&quot;, but no matter what you&#x27;re getting bias, denial of reality when it&#x27;s inconvenient for the narrative, and propaganda designed to spur you into particular thoughts and actions. If you&#x27;re going to get mad about it for this event, if you&#x27;re a principled person, you should have been mad about it for prior events too, even if the results don&#x27;t run in favour of your own priors.<p>We can fight about the particulars of the situation, or work together to understand how we&#x27;re being manipulated into arguing about particulars instead of looking at who&#x27;s manipulating us, how, why, and in what overall direction.')
