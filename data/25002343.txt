Consumer inflation is bad for the wealthy. It means wages are catching up and making the amassed wealth less valuable. If Bill gates is worth 100 billion and you go from 20k to 40k yearly wages then the purchasing power of his wealth has halved.<p>The only way his wealth can keep up with inflation is by employing workers which means he has to pay the increased wages. So he ends up worse off than if we had deflation and he could just sit on money.')
