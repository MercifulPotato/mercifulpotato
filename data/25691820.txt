A science-literate public.<p>It&#x27;s crazy to me that so many students don&#x27;t know about sci-hub because educators are careful not to mention it in any official settings, but from more private settings it&#x27;s apparent that _everyone_ is using it.<p>This also sometimes leads to (small?) differences in academic performance, where the sci-hub-oblivious students can&#x27;t factor in a highly-relevant paywalled article in e.g. a presentation because they couldn&#x27;t access it.')
