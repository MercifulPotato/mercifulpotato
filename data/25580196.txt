I have addressed some of your points below.<p>1. It looks like it wasn&#x27;t a good idea to use Pinterest as an example link, haha. I think Pinterest is mostly a social network for discovering interesting links from the web, this is more of a tool that people would use to share important links with each other, instead of messaging apps (which is how most people I know share links with each other).<p>2. Hmmm, I&#x27;ve got mixed feedback on that, but I think the best thing to do would be to change it to white with maybe black or red text in the foreground.<p>3. You&#x27;re right, the bookmark icon is for further filtering, something you&#x27;d use if you&#x27;re browsing someone else&#x27;s board and like a particular link you&#x27;d want to read later.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind answering a question of my own, do you think you&#x27;d actually find a use for this and actively use it?<p>Thanks a ton for all of your feedback!')
