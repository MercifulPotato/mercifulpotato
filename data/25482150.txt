Building a fast and efficient core is not the same thing as building one that scales well.  I’m sure that Apple is capable of making an effective 8- or 16-core machine, but it may not be as simple as just adding cores. Look at the recent AMD machines’ complicated core organization for examples.<p>As far as I know, other than Graviton and other very new N1 designs, there haven’t been many big ARM systems at all.')
