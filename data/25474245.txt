It’s immigration laws and culture that drive them into grad school, not the privilege of teaching undergrads.<p>Loads and loads of parents of international students push their kids into grad school because they want them to climb the ladder to the upper echelon. They don’t know how to accomplish this in the corporate world because that ladder is more like a maze of <i>culture fit</i> dead ends. Then it’s the immigration laws which make this path extremely risky (getting fired and losing your visa, then having to go home).<p>So the focus is on school, which they already know how to do well at. As long as you stay in academia, you can safely maintain a student visa. It’s your foot in the door. And then when you graduate with an advanced degree you’re much better positioned to get a long term visa leading to a green card.')
