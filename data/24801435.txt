Or maybe it depends on what level you&#x27;re trying to achieve.<p>If you want to become a good piano player, the feedback mechanism that corrects your playing should actually come from listening yourself. A large part of the challenge in becoming a good player is figuring out what to listen for -- this is also why you need a teacher, because you simply do not hear your mistakes yourself in the beginning.<p>Of course here I&#x27;m mostly referring to musicality, and not just whether you&#x27;re hitting the correct notes. When learning the piano one usually starts with the latter, but I wonder if you make piano more game-like it causes you to underdevelop your own feedback and reward systems, leading to more problems at a later stage.')
