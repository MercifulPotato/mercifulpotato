Someplace like California, where petroleum is really heavy and needs a lot of energy to extract&#x2F;refine, uses roughly 13kWh of natural gas, electricity, etc, to deliver one gallon of gas (page 5).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ww2.arb.ca.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;classic&#x2F;&#x2F;fuels&#x2F;lcfs&#x2F;ca-greet&#x2F;lut-doc.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ww2.arb.ca.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;classic&#x2F;&#x2F;fuels&#x2F;lc...</a><p>Most of that 13kWh is natural gas, so you can&#x27;t use it directly in an EV. It can be used to generate electricity in a high efficiency natural gas power plant though, which would provide ~6-7kWh to consumers.<p>By avoiding extraction&#x2F;refining&#x2F;transportation of petroleum and the associated natural gas&#x2F;electricity used in those steps, we can instead use that to generate electricity, which would power an average EV at ~250Wh&#x2F;mile roughly 25 miles.<p>In places where petroleum doesn&#x27;t need as much natural gas for extraction, that figure is lower, but the idea still applies.')
