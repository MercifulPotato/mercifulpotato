(Even in the case where the charger can&#x27;t supply the watts the device wants, you could accumulate some energy in a small battery large cap and charge intermittently). But I suspect the reason it hasn&#x27;t been done so far is liability - there are bound to be a few devices that don&#x27;t play ball and blow up.')
