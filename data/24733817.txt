Google says there are 328.2 million Americans. Do the math.<p>It&#x27;s amusing for someone arguing &quot;science&quot; to be unable to multiple two fucking numbers.<p>You are saying 1,148,700 deaths is okay, that people are &quot;panicking&quot; for no reason. A 40% increase in death rate (the CDC says there were 2,813,503 deaths in 2019) seems like a pretty reasonable reason to &quot;panic&quot;.<p>Trying to save a sixth of a Holocaust seems like decent public policy.')
