It is definitely not dying, it&#x27;s just an opinionated, fairly niche language - it&#x27;s not Go or TypeScript. It solves certain problems well and has some uses where it really shines. It&#x27;s not a silver bullet, though, and it definitely requires serious learning&#x2F;unlearning to get really good at it if all you know is the  mainstream imperative&#x2F;OOP style.<p>Clojure works well for those who buy its rationale: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clojure.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;rationale" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clojure.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;rationale</a>')
