In general, however, through research, one can begin to divine a glimmer (or more) of the future direction of the underlying.<p>In that situation, someone with a reasonable guess at the future could absolutely murder uninformed arbitrageurs, right?  It is my expectation that &quot;correct&quot; pricing of the options should fold in information about both the expected volatility and the direction of the underlying.')
