This moment in the beginning draws you into the movie and then you have the intense effect of immersion throughout the film, and in the end the unreal scene where Ellie touches the universe bubble. It warps up leaving you with a perfect quality of awe and wander. The whole movie is a perfect trifecta of trifecta’s.')
