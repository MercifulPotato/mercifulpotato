Consumer electric rates were set by law<p>2. Utilities were obliged by law to provide whatever electricity consumers demanded at that rate<p>This meant that utilities had no choice but pay whatever Enron demanded and resell to consumers at a massive loss. This ridiculous catastrophe was entirely a construction of the electric regulatory framework.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have any resemblance to what I proposed. What I propose is more akin to how gas pump prices vary every day. Note that there are no laws setting the price or distribution of gas. When there were (back in the 70&#x27;s) the result was LOOOONG gas lines. The Enron fiasco and the gas line fiasco are prime examples of what happens when government tries to centrally plan pricing and distribution.')
