Part of this is they run the trains slower than they can go which gives plenty of ability to go faster if needed to meet the schedule. The schedule in turn is carefully designed so that where trains they all meet at the same time, thus ensuring you can switch trains and so you wouldn&#x27;t want your train to go faster even though it could in theory.<p>There are two good ways to run a good transport system: a carefully planned timetable so that you always know when your train arrives, and once you get on all your connections are easy to make. The other is as fast and frequent as possible, you never know when your next train will arrive but it will be soon enough that you don&#x27;t care anyway.  The second is somewhat better, but vastly more expensive.')
