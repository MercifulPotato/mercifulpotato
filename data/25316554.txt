I am not sure how to precisely describe my interpretation of &quot;end-in-itself&quot;. But here are some more things I would consider to have intrinsic value: Other food, clothes, fuel&#x2F;oil&#x2F;gas, building materials, consumer goods, etc. Some things like gold have some intrinsic value (for jewellry and electronics) and some extrinsic value (demand just for investments). You might say cash has some intrinsic value since it can be burned or melted down (but  it&#x27;s barely anything compared to the extrinsic value). Then you have bitcoin which literally has no intrinsic value at all, only extrinsic value.')
