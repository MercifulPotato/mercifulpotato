What most fail to grasp is that being a monopoly is <i>not illegal</i>. It&#x27;s only illegal to use monopoly power to harm consumer welfare.<p>In this case integration between services is a pretty strong defense against this. Facebook can argue that consolidating the infrastructure allows them to deliver each product at a lower cost and&#x2F;or higher quality than if it was served independently.<p>If the court accepted those facts, then Facebook would have a ironclad argument against being broken up under the consumer welfare standard.')
