She’s brilliant, and I want her to get credit.<p>Her name is Monica Thomas. Her dance company is called Mad King Thomas. Here is her brand new Twitter account: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;onetruebonc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;onetruebonc</a><p>Her sense of humor is captured by her choice of the song “Do you love me”, which is a winking but still charming reference to the fact that this is a PR stunt to get us to love scary robots.<p>Dancers and choreographers are poor, and struggle to build careers. A public acknowledgment of something of this magnitude would be so impactful, and would require so little from Boston Dynamics. I wish they would do it.<p>They could even brand themselves as helping artists, could be good for their image.')
