Then you can install modules as you like and if you want to start fresh, just throw away the read-write fs. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done in the past.<p>It would be nice to be able to build a new read-only filesystem in incremental mode: given a compressed filesystem and some new uncompressed data, incorporate the uncompressed data without completely re-doing all the work.')
