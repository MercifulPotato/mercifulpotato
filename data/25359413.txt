Regular printed text can be understood by humans and machines alike, while QR codes are completely useless for humans. Most QR codes seem to encode URLs, and it wouldn’t exactly be a technical marvel if your smartphone camera was simply able to spot printed URLs and offer to follow the link.<p>There are places where QR codes make sense though, and at least it seems like people have stopped putting QR codes on billboards, advertisements, etc.')
