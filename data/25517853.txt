It doesn’t change the mental model, though.<p>For example, it makes perfect sense for an empty inline-block to get aligned to the text baseline, while an inline-block with text also gets aligned to the text baseline. That is precisely what ”vertical-align: baseline” means: align this element’s line of text to the surrounding baseline. If the element <i>doesn’t contain a text node</i>, the inline-block <i>does</i> align correctly, but by default <i>does not have a size</i> unless explicitly specified.<p>And if there’s something in CSS that is to be avoided unless necessary, it’s specifying things explicitly.')
