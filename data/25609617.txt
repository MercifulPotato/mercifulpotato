You’re confusing the owner of the distribution channel and the manufacturer of the device. In Apple’s case, it’s the same company. In Android’s case, it is not. You are further confused by the difference in channels available to each platform for installing apps.<p>Apple allows one channel. It owns that channel. It is responsible for the content on that channel.<p>Android had many channels, and Google’s App Store has the same apps banned, but an android user can simply use another channel.<p>Since Apple is responsible for the apps in the Chinese App Store, they’ll remove apps that expose them to liability. Google does the same.')
