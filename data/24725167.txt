You can act politically without being aware of that fact, that just means you&#x27;re not conscious of what&#x27;s driving your decision making.<p>Most politics and also culture expresses itself tacitly. By requiring some sort of conscious intent you&#x27;re actually ignoring what is arguably the vast majority of political interaction. For example casual sexism and systematic mistreatment of women was just &quot;normal&quot; but nonetheless political. Of course the people doing the subtle discriminating don&#x27;t like to think of it as political, because that implies responsibility for action.')
