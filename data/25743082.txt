The reason we can&#x27;t explain consciousness isn&#x27;t because it complex or because there are too many variables for us to track and predict, as in the case of the lottery machine, but because we haven&#x27;t decided what we mean when we say &#x27;conciousness&#x27;. Pretty much any component of consciousness one may think of can be explained in isolation as a simple material system. Self-reflection, continuity, response to stimuli, etc.<p>When people talk about magic, they are referring to the strangeness of subjectivity, and what it is at a very fundamental level. I think a better analogy is being a Greek philosopher and trying to understand what matter is. No tool at the time can measure things in a way that would meaningfully lead them to an answer, nor did they have any theories where matter could be related to something they could study. So when we are confronted with the same situation, I think it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to assume that we, like them, are missing a massive piece of the puzzle. Calling it magic feels kind of right when it&#x27;s something so large and consequential.')
