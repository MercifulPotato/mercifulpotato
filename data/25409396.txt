Using your pet&#x27;s and parent&#x27;s names may meet all the criteria of high entropy but be easy to guess by someone who knows you.. Using a poor key derivation function means more guesses. That is why you should always use scrypt or bcrypt. So you make a simple password you will not forget, but use scrypt to convert this into a very long string and then use that string for AES256 encryption of the data.')
