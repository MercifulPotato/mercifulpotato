I had the one non-alarmed car as a teenager in the low density suburb.  It was broken into in the quiet residential driveway.  In the city and the high density suburb, I have only ever had false alarms.<p>Maybe the answer is to give the user the option to arm the alarm or not when exiting, with equal friction (i.e. separate &quot;lock&quot; and &quot;lock+arm&quot; buttons on both the door and the fob).')
