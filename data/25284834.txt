And wouldn&#x27;t the relevant comparison be whether it outpaced the growth of the tech sector in the last 20 years rather than whether it&#x27;s bigger than ever? Like if MS is 10x bigger now and the industry is 20x bigger then that would indicate to me that maybe they didn&#x27;t choke out competition using monopoly power.')
