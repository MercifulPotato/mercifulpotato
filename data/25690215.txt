I don&#x27;t live in the US but I would&#x27;ve voted for Trump. I have my reasons, I liked a lot of the stuff he&#x27;s done and I very much disliked other things.<p>That said. Storming into the capitol is not something that comes out of an &quot;extremely poor judgement&quot;. If you have any kind of respect for democracy you don&#x27;t storm into one of the most important public buildings in the country. There&#x27;s absolutely no excuse for that, just as you can&#x27;t kill a person out of an &quot;extremely poor judgement&quot;. It&#x27;s a no-no. It goes beyond any red line you should not cross.<p>I truly hope everybody who got inside get to be prosecuted for insurrection.')
