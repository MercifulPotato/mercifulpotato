(It seems likely that the default &quot;OS&quot; will be based on the Xous microkernel that they&#x27;re writing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;betrusted-io&#x2F;xous-core" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;betrusted-io&#x2F;xous-core</a>)<p>Since the main processor and crypto accelerators are all contained in an FPGA, the adventurous could change the balance of CPU features that are available. It only has a single CPU core partly because of the massive crypto accelerators, from what I understand, so someone could eliminate those and have a multi-core CPU if they wanted. With 20% of the FPGA still free, it might be possible to stick in a second (maybe smaller?) core anyways? I&#x27;m not sure.')
