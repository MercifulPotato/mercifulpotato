(Like Uber eats is in my area.  Right now.  When we&#x27;re having an online lunch meeting, and the management bought everyone lunch for the meeting in the form of Uber Eats vouchers, and several people cannot get their food because the drivers can&#x27;t talk to the servers for a couple of hours so far.)<p>Who has time?  I do, when I&#x27;m on a date.  Takeout isn&#x27;t the same.  (When you&#x27;re married, you can get takeout and take it home, but that&#x27;s... kind of lame.)<p>Also, when it&#x27;s bad weather (hot&#x2F;cold&#x2F;rainy), takeout leaves me with the question of where I&#x27;m going to go to eat it.  Not to the park when it&#x27;s 35 degrees (whether Farenheit or Celsius).  In my car?  That gets old.  At home?  Where?')
