If they didn&#x27;t, the economy would literally cease to function. Oil rig workers, miners, lumber workers, fishermen, roofers, pilots, farmers, even truck drivers have significantly elevated mortality rates.<p>You&#x27;re completely right.<p>&gt;The reality is that there are many jobs that require a sacrifice in terms of health and safety. Until we&#x27;re living in a post-scarcity economy, they always will. We can do things like make those jobs as safe as practically possible. Or make sure workers are aware of the risks before they sign up.<p>I disagree. The point I am making is that we must make that illegal. We should require the employers to solve that problem. All of these have known hazards that which can be solved. We simply decide that we let employers profit off it. That&#x27;s wrong.<p>&gt;But, it&#x27;s unrealistic utopian thinking to believe that no one will ever be asked to sacrifice their health or safety for their job.<p>There are some exceptions that obviously do need to exist. Military or law enforcement for example will have harms in their life that are by definition.<p>I look at your list of examples of higher mortality employers and I agree they exist, I even understand what makes them dangerous. Truck drivers for example is simply the Diesel Exhaust. Electric semi trucks is a thing now, but HEPA filters have existed for how long?<p>There&#x27;s a fix for every single one of those industries.')
