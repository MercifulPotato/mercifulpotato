For example, let&#x27;s say you start organizing by project. Pretty soon, there&#x27;s overlap between projects and you end up re-documenting. So you can abstract the information into a more general framework and reference it within the project files.<p>This has additional benefits for efficiency, (DRY) and also usually gives you a result which is generally easier to share with the public, if for example your project file is too personal or too deep for easy reading all by itself.')
