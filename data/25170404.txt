The difference happened when I was 22.</i><p>Yeah I think I get what Derek is saying. However if I was his friend, I would also be unsatisfied by this answer. It feels like Derek should know what he&#x27;s asking and is being obtuse.<p>Likewise<p><i>&gt; It’s not how much you have. It’s the difference between what you have and what you spend.</i><p>is in a real sense very true, but it&#x27;s also vacuous. The more you have, the less effort is required to have a big difference between what you have and what you spend.<p>In my opinion Derek&#x27;s friend was probably framing this question in the sense, &quot;How did you end up with so much?&quot; and not, &quot;How did you end up with such a great burn rate?&quot;')
