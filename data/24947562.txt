I learned probably 6-7 <i>big</i> things about Postgres reading it that I didn&#x27;t know before.<p>I won&#x27;t list out those things, because, I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t be relevant to most people reading this comment. :). But, there are a couple things I noticed that I <i>do</i> want to mention:<p>&gt; There were these edge cases in there, where it’s kind of like less safe. And Postgres was there, and it had a reputation of being just rock-solid, consistent, and more strict with your data<p>&gt; &quot;... I never had that moment where I’m like “Oh, Postgres, you screwed me over.”<p>This is a huge deal, and, IMO, <i>the</i> reason to choose Postgres over MySQL.  MySQL has some <i>horrendous</i> defaults.  You can make things a little better, but, AFAIK, you can&#x27;t even get to where Postgres starts out of the box.  Most of that consists of MySQL being extremely permissive with what it allows you to do in your SQL.  Many of those things are non-standard, and some are quite unsafe.  Postgres not only \nprioritizes safety, it keeps the application developer honest.<p>It can be a little complain-y, but I&#x27;d rather have my database complain than do stuff that could lose data.  One great example is when you try to stuff more characters into a text field than it can accommodate.  By default, MySQL just truncates the string silently; Postgres just doesn&#x27;t allow it.<p>&gt;  PostGIS is a huge one. It’s a whole geospatial database.<p>This is the other point I want to call out.  I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of working with PostGIS before.  The main thing I&#x27;d want to say about PostGIS is that, although there are issues working with geojson and GIS in general, PostGIS doesn&#x27;t exacerbate any of them.  Generally speaking, PostGIS is about as pleasant to work with as a geospatial database can be.')
