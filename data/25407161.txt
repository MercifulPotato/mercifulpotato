The keybinding is Ctrl-X O, but if you don&#x27;t want to remember that - and who could blame you - you can use the focus command, e.g. `focus cmd` will get you back to the command window, or `focus src` will get you back to the source window.<p>The display isn&#x27;t really buggy, it&#x27;s just the debugee output messed up the terminal. You can redraw it with ^L, or disable the tui while it&#x27;s running. You can toggle it with Ctrl-X A, or just `tui enable` or `tui disable`.<p>I quite like the tui, the windows are configurable (use `show tui` and `show style`), and you can display more than just source, there&#x27;s also registers and disassembly mode, e.g. `tui reg general`.')
