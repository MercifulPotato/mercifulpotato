The parent wants the project to do that so that s&#x2F;he does not have to fork it him&#x2F;herself.  In other words, the parent wants someone else to do work, for free.<p>Free Software is about the freedom of the user - freedom to distribute, freedom to study, freedom to use, freedom to modify.  Somehow people have managed to pervert this so that it not only means &quot;free as in free beer so that I can use it&quot; but even &quot;free beer so that OTHER PEOPLE can do work that I want done, for free.&quot;  There is absolutely no entitlement to this.')
