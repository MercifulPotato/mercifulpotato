Everybody who takes part in it thinks they&#x27;re doing good, but all it achieves is that people stop trusting their institutions. Environmental doomsaying is seen by many as an entirely noble pursuit, but all it does is make climate science skeptics. The pandemic has seen a few big ones. &quot;Masks don&#x27;t work&quot; was an obvious lie being spread around Feb&#x2F;Mar, people would get called out in public for wearing them. The truth was that they actually do work, it&#x27;s just there was a massive shortage, and hospitals needed them. &quot;There is no food shortage&quot; was one in my area (and a lot of other places). I contract with a large grocery chain, and I know for a fact that there were major shortages, but officials figured lying about it might stop it from getting worse. 9 months later, and look at how many people have a complete distrust for these institutions now.')
