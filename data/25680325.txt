Not a bad idea on the accountant, but finding (a good) one is indeed the hard part. How do I even vet that? I hate &quot;hiring&quot; for something I don&#x27;t know a lot about. As for tax benefits, my understanding is I will save ~4,500 on self-employment taxes (because I pay myself 100k... $130k-100=30 difference... social security caps at around $130k), plus no longer pay medicare 2.9% on anything past 100k. Additional taxes include state payroll things like UI, but it&#x27;s not a lot. So it could be worth $10,000+ in saved taxes to be an S-Corp instead of a Sole-prop.... was my conclusion.')
