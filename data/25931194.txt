It&#x27;s actually necessary to have inequality of outcomes otherwise you have no incentives for improvement. An example of a society with very low inequality is old-school communism where most people are equally poor - it&#x27;s clearly not a good thing.<p>What is bad is extreme inequality where a lot of people are in poverty. I think most people would agree that poverty is a bad thing that we should try to reduce.<p>It&#x27;s quite possible for poverty to decrease and inequality to increase at the same time. The old &quot;a rising tide lifts all boats&quot; analogy. It just means everyone is doing better but the wealthy are  seeing more relative gains. If the whole pie is growing, it&#x27;s easy to see how everyone could get more pie even if it&#x27;s not distributed equally.<p><i>edit</i> If you disagree please state why. Drive by downvotes do not convince me that I&#x27;m mistaken, they just lower my opinion of the average HN user.')
