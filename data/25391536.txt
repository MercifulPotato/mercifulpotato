My friends were struggling with DOS and autoexec.bat&#x2F;config.sys and IRQ settings and sometimes didn&#x27;t even have sound cards (still remember when my friend&#x27;s birthday gift was a sound card lol), playing 320x240 resolution games.  Meanwhile I was gaming away at 640x480 256 colors, with 16-bit stereo 22khz or 44khz sound.  Yeah, we didn&#x27;t have quite the same selection of games, but we had some damn good exclusives.  Bolo, Escape Velocity (and everything else from Ambrosia), Marathon, Battle-Girl, Realmz, so many others I can&#x27;t remember the names of.')
