These are the same techniques we use to address fraud in industry.<p>- Temporal discontinuities are sharp spikes in the rate of vote tallying. There’s many of these, and <i>huge</i> ones in battle grounds after the media blackout.<p>- Spatial discontinuities are when adjacent precincts are wildly different (in a way unlike similar nearby differences).<p>- Similarity discontinuities happened in two forms: 1. similar races didn’t have similar voting patterns; 2. similar precincts behaved differently.<p>All three occurring together, and in “critical” races like Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, is a <i>very</i> strong indication of fraud.<p>I think you’re asserting your opinion as objective fact.')
