There&#x27;s nothing wrong per se, but I have my doubts about how easy you can find replacement parts if something breaks in, say, a year or two.<p>If you really depend on your data and want it to be safe, i&#x27;d recommend spending the extra money and either getting a proper nas (synology&#x2F;qnap) or go the proper diy way (aka an x86 box and truenas&#x2F;unraid).<p>you really don&#x27;t want to be in the position where you absolutely need your data but the replacement parts are two-weeks far in the future because they&#x27;re travelling via snail mail or worse, relying on 2nd-hand spare parts off ebay.<p>edit: not to mention, the gigabit ethernet port is a bottleneck. you would probably hitting the bottleneck even by using four rotational disks.')
