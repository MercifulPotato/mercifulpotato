Or to bring you closer to the example, you could say P(causation | correlation) = 1 to say &quot;It is almost certain that causation exists if correlation exists&quot;.<p>You can alter the right-hand side, but then you have to stop saying &#x27;almost certain&#x27; because everyone assumes that means a measure one set.<p>So, for instance, you might believe that P(causation | correlation) = 0.8 across all human chosen distributions. You might well be right since adversarial distributions are so rarely chosen, i.e. there is a meta-effect where humans are choosing interesting queries in the first place.')
