More and more, people are experiencing relationships through the lenses of their online personas. The online world is different from the offline world, and it works by different rules, but it is very much real. A conversation in chat is no different than a phone call, and we don&#x27;t say that phone conversations aren&#x27;t real life.<p>You bring up a good point about people behaving differently in in-person conversations and even perhaps being more willing to change their minds. I think there&#x27;s a lot of truth there, but I think it comes from thinking that our online personas aren&#x27;t real and from being physically distanced from the effects of what we say online.<p>It never occurred to me that my sarcasm online would be a factor in a friend&#x27;s suicide, but now I live with the consequences of not understanding the very real effects of the things I said.')
