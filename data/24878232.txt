Each power station design is different in some way.<p>Imagine a commercial small sized, modular nuclear power plant, produced at scale.  Nuclear subs, and aircraft carriers already have a version.<p>&quot;Building new nuclear energy is very clearly too slow to achieve that.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d disagree, it is, as usual politics getting in the way of science, not the engineers or physicists.  If the financial incentives are there, it would be solved very quickly.  Fission isn&#x27;t fusion, and the physics and engineering is well understood.  Not directly comparable, but look at what SpaceX has achieved in 20 years in terms of design and engineering.')
