Why must one be &quot;normal&quot;?<p>Why can&#x27;t it be a virtue, not to care about fashion or clothing ?<p>Why should it be considered more virtuous to have &quot;other hobbies&quot; ? I&#x27;d argue the other way around that I&#x27;d prefer &quot;the salary people&quot; to find other jobs, if you don&#x27;t love what you do, then you&#x27;re doing the wrong thing.<p>One of the great things about this field, used to be that even if you don&#x27;t have great social skills, you can still be useful to society, great idea to ruin that so that all the &quot;normies&quot; can feel more welcome.')
