Item(by='cycloptic', descendants=None, kids=[24949172], score=None, time=1604118443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24949116, text='&gt;Wayland protocol is much more restrictive than X&#x27;s -- things like screen capture and window managers don&#x27;t work because the APIs they need aren&#x27;t present<p>This is not quite true. There are protocols for these things in some implementations. You&#x27;d want to keep compatibility with these because otherwise you&#x27;d have no reason to be supporting Wayland. Keep in mind either way you&#x27;re talking about using a specific compositorâ€”it doesn&#x27;t matter if the APIs aren&#x27;t present in the protocol. In this situation you&#x27;d re-use one from another implementation or add another private protocol extension. That&#x27;s always been what individual compositors are encouraged to do. It&#x27;s no different here.')
