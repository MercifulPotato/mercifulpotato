If you&#x27;re actually doing a bunch of different ad-hoc aggregations (which is what SQL was designed for) then yes, query parse time is irrelevant. If you&#x27;re using an RDBMS as a glorified key-value store (which is what most web applications tend to do) then it&#x27;s very possible for pkey lookups to be the majority of your queries. (My point isn&#x27;t really about performance, it&#x27;s about SQL not being designed for that use style in general).')
