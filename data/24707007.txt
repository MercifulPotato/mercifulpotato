My daughter is only 2 but I&#x27;ve been compiling these tips as &quot;learning hacks&quot; to present as soon as she&#x27;s ready since before she was conceived! I was also introduced to software development through &quot;hacking&quot; some 20 years ago and immediately fell in love (ms frontpage websites made in school and hosted on free hosting servers that injected banner ads.. my first ever hack was getting rid of those pesky ads with a bit of js back when &quot;js is a dead technology, don&#x27;t use it&quot; :D) Ive since believed the thrill of &quot;hacking&quot; is the best intro into programming in that it&#x27;s like a sort of gamification of logical thinking where you need to beat the game by finding and exploiting the weaknesses. Best of luck and please continue sharing your experiences!')
