The difference in taste is dominated by two factors: variety and time of harvest.<p>Most industrial fruit is harvested long before it&#x27;s ripe and ripens artificially in warehouses.<p><i>This</i> is the main factor that determines taste as this is the process in which taste develops. The longer the process, the more time the produce has to collect and store the relevant substances. Artificial ripening only takes a day or two compared to weeks for naturally grown food.')
