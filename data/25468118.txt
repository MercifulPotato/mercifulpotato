I quit my last job right before lockdown, and since then I&#x27;ve been building my own products and doing freelancing to stay alive.<p>While it&#x27;s arguably more stressful, it&#x27;s at least good stress. Everything you do is about making a good product and making money. There&#x27;s no politics, just users and clients. The act of software development turns into the craft that you wanted it to be at the corporation&#x2F;startup, instead of monkey work with little to no stake in the outcome. I&#x27;d rather be poor than waste my life.<p>Another good thing about it is that I decide when the product is finished. Every time I&#x27;ve gotten a job at a startup, I built the product in about a year then was forced to stick around for the endless revisions, updates, new features, etc. It seemed like work for the sake of work. What happened to the lazy developer trope? I believe 90% of it is superfluous, and the main product + good marketing is what&#x27;s actually important for revenue and satisfying users.<p>A dog-walking app should be finished in a few months. The end. It&#x27;s not like the software somehow erodes over time (unless you keep screwing with it and adding stuff). If the users are happy, just cash out already.<p>Finally, you decide who you work with - as a partner, not an employee. That changes the dynamic a lot. You can say when you&#x27;re done, and you get a real stake in the outcome.<p>Since the coronavirus, working as an employee in software has lost its lustre. You don&#x27;t get the big beautiful office with bean bag chairs, you don&#x27;t get to socialize, you don&#x27;t learn anything, and you sure as hell don&#x27;t control your hours.')
