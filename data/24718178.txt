They are good as a form of gate-keeping but bad because I too have found myself deciding not to post a comment in case it got down-voted to oblivion. In fact I debated whether or not to post <i>this comment</i> for those same reasons.<p>I try to take down voted comments on the chin (and one of mine at -4 was absolutely warranted) but at other times it can be dis-heartening to see a comment being down-voted for no apparent reason.<p>I guess the answer is to not be too vain &#x2F; overlly bothered about my Karma points but just as a highly upvoted comment feed the reward centres so do down votes in a whole different way.<p>Oh, and responsible and thoughtful use of down-voting rights please.')
