It’s too often this line of thinking that is used to remove civil liberties.<p>I take a different view.  We are actively having an open debate and that is a good thing.<p>YouTube is not part of our government, they are like a magazine or tv station of the past and they can and IMO have the right to choose what content they allow or disallow and this is totally fine and has nothing to do with free speech (in the legal sense)<p>Now if we past a law that stated I can not speak my mind about covid that would be a law that IMO violates the 1st amendment.<p>But what is happening today is not bad it’s just one company making a decision on it’s own.<p>A separate question for the legal system to probably decide is whether YouTube as part of Google is acting as a monopoly to abuse its power.  But I do not think anything about YouTubes decision as a business to not allow certain content published is anyway a matter of our 1st amendment rights... hopefully my perspective isn’t too poorly received - but thankfully you can down vote me, or up vote me and I don’t have to worry about being throw in jail for posting - happy hacking')
