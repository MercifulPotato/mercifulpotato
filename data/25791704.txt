Many families have non-negotiable expenses, particularly around healthcare. Even for those who don&#x27;t, going lean will be a huge shock and a downgrade in quality of life. It&#x27;s only reasonable such people will object. Much like I myself could survive on 20% of my income, but I wouldn&#x27;t be happy about it being forced on me.<p>&gt; <i>Automatic sending wealth to capital instead of labor is another issue, perhaps better viewed as capital ownership being centralized as the actual problem.</i><p>That&#x27;s the underlying issue. Not the fault of automation per se, but of the thing that drives it. It serves to highlight my point: anti-automation arguments aren&#x27;t really about automation itself.')
