There are occasionally some in which the surveillance technology is used against the heroes, but even in some of those, the heroes tend to somehow get access to the infrastructure, and use it to turn the tables.<p>Before surveillance was a thing, a variation that was ordinary in TV shows was for the heroes to break very important rules&#x2F;principles they were sworn to uphold.  For example, roughing up suspect, or even expressly denying them some procedural right gratuitously, almost as if the show was trying to condition people that those rights aren&#x27;t actually rights for some <i>other</i> kind of people.<p>The rules were in the way, and the heroes cared and were tough, and did what needed to be done, to fight the bad thing.<p>It seems a dangerous idea, in a society based on people buying into admirable rights and responsibilities, but from what I&#x27;ve seen even casually and anecdotally (as a techie, not a humanities researcher or social scientist), the idea seems to have been drip-fed for most&#x2F;all of our lives.  So long, I couldn&#x27;t guess whether it was an idea that already resonated strongly with people, and media just pandered to that, or it was planted&#x2F;nurtured by media.<p>This famous speech starts later in the progression towards a much worse situation, but seems like it might be relevant: &quot;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;First_they_came_" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;First_they_came_</a>...&quot;')
