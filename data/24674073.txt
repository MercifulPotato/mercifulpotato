Most places won&#x27;t let felons get a foot in the door in the first place. Unless not-checking that box is a criminal offense, lying about your qualifications hasn&#x27;t stopped some of the highest offices in the US being filled, so while it&#x27;s easy to say &quot;don&#x27;t check the box&quot;, it&#x27;s just as easy to say (and just as unrealistic, unless you have a time machine), to say &quot;don&#x27;t be a felon&quot;, to somebody that already has the conviction. Which is to say, it isn&#x27;t really helpful.<p>More realistically, the (un)likelyhood of a felony conviction going unnoticed on a background check means that whether or not you check the box, if the employer does a background check it will become known, but some places don&#x27;t run the check and some don&#x27;t actually care about the results but they&#x27;re required to run the check.')
