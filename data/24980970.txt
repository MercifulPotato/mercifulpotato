If you search that on any search engine you get very generic reviews from PC Magazine, Tech Republic, etc.<p>Or if you want to find a list of good wordpress plugins...the lists you get are so generic, written probably by someone who doesn&#x27;t even use wordpress.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve found products and reviews written by individuals who take the time to launch a single product or two much more informative and personal than the generic nonsense that has been pushed to the top by SEO masters.')
