Use Free software, so that devices develop user-empowering features instead of being locked down.<p>2. Firewall all general Internet access from a device&#x2F;VM, and let it talk to local network devices only.<p>3. Firewall the device&#x2F;VM from accessing most of your network, allow Internet access (ideally through a VPN), and inspect the hardware to make sure there aren&#x27;t microphones or cameras.')
