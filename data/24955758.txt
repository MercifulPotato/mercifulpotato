(And some would leak indefinitely) Thus, people got used to sharing these around and not caring about the original message.<p>Now it&#x27;s near-instant as the message delete operation sends a Google Cloud delete API immediately. But people still share these around without knowing that. We don&#x27;t know where those links originated so it&#x27;s both a disclaimer and a mirror.')
