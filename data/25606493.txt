Also the article is missing a clear red line - I felt myself skipping multiple paragraphs and not missing out on any content.<p>I would be very much interested if the writer could re-write their vent into a powerful message.<p>This might also be a chance (regarding the &quot;healing journey&quot;) to re-work the happenings and bring the &quot;this is what happened!!!&quot; into a &quot;THIS is what happened&quot;, in the same way an emergency-centre operator deals with emergency calls. Focus on the facts, not the feelings.')
