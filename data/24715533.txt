It sequesters carbon, isn&#x27;t too terrible for the environment (it just sits there in the ground), and it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re going to run out of landfill space any time soon[1]. I&#x27;m all for recycling if it&#x27;s a net positive in terms of resource consumption, but I don&#x27;t see the appeal of recycling for the sake of recycling.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;transcripts&#x2F;739893511" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;transcripts&#x2F;739893511</a> &quot;Thomas says we probably have thousands of years of landfill space left in the U.S. And even hardcore environmentalists reluctantly agree that, yeah, we have a lot of space left.
