Item(by='cbozeman', descendants=None, kids=[25937052, 25937260, 25936523], score=None, time=1611794111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25935674, text='It wasn&#x27;t David vs. Goliath. CNBC, Financial Times, WSJ, etc. can&#x27;t tell you what it really was, because they&#x27;re beholden to all these Wall Street types. They don&#x27;t get <i>stories</i> unless their relationships are cordial.<p>This was arrogant idiot billionaires vs. autistic retards of the Internet, and the arrogant billionaires in this case (Melvin Capital) <i>had the chance to walk away</i> when they got their $2.75 billion capital injection. They could have closed their position out and taken a relatively moderate loss compared to the total destruction of the fund that they&#x27;re going to be facing in two days.<p>The reason no one on CNBC is framing it that way, is because while Melvin Capital is the face of the short sellers, a <i>lot</i> of people piled on after Melvin Capital, but no one else piled on with the level of idiocy they did. So if you actually call it like it is, and remind everyone that a 139% short on a company is literally the most fucking retarded thing in finance ever, then you incur the wrath of a lot of wealthy people who are pieces of shit and will use their money as weapon.<p>The problem is, the arrogant idiot billionaires have been assfucking not only the American people, but a good portion of the world for so long, that they&#x27;re not used to someone spitting in their face, so they doubled-down. Unfortunately for them, <i>they</i> forgot that when you go up against the Internet as a collective, you always... <i>always</i> lose. No one fights the Internet and wins.<p>And they&#x27;re going to learn that this Friday.')
