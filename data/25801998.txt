If one were to go with the former, their solution will always be compared against the hypothetical much better one using the latest shiny framework&#x2F;componenets used by FAANG. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you made the right choice, because for you to prove you did, you have to again rebuild the application using the FAANG framework and compare the profiling&#x2F;scalability numbers.
