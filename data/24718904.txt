The Julian Assange saga is about hacking, privacy, three-letter-agency overreach in the tech sphere, etc.<p>And every possible iteration of that has been hashed and rehashed to death at this point - Assange is a hero and should be pardoned, Assange is a traitor and should be punished, Assange is guilty of sexual assault, Assange was framed, Assange is being tortured, the entire trial is a farce, Assange is a Russian stooge, Assange is a CIA stooge, Assange is a hologram meant to distract you from Epstein, insert rant about the American military industrial complex and war crimes here.<p>Is there so much new and interesting intellectual content to be gleaned from Assange&#x27;s hearing that we need to milk it every single day?')
