But the Cold War and the boogeyman of Communism meant that that was weaponized against them while the struggle was ongoing, and whitewashed from their history as they became mythologized afterwards. Unfortunately things haven&#x27;t changed much today - &quot;Black Lives Matter is Marxist&quot; is one of many common tropes used in right wing media where the boogeyman of socialism is alive and well.')
