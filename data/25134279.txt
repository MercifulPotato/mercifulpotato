The crowd-funded approach would have to come with an understanding that you&#x27;re trying to build a better, more private search engine that will leave the payer paying for all those who don&#x27;t and the payer won&#x27;t be able to have a say in anything as we&#x27;d like search results to be flat and even across the board. That means if I search for Coronavirus results, not only do I get the goverment and &quot;Official&quot; sources, I should get everything that I&#x27;m looking for and refine as needed.<p>The second approach is obviously big money but if you have big money coming in, big money will give You one of two options; Do as they say or they withdraw funding leaving you back at option one and having to downsize.<p>Rocks and hard places people. Not much else you can do there. Unless you take a Pilled.net approach.')
