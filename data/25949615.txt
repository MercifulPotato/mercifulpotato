It would violate Twitter&#x27;s free speech rights to force them to do otherwise?</i><p>Well, I don&#x27;t particularly care for a corporation&#x27;s free speech rights. I think it&#x27;s better for citizens to have free speech rights, not corporations. Besides, I don&#x27;t think Twitter&#x27;s free speech rights are in danger or would be in danger if they were forced not to censor people. They could still print whatever message of their own (Twitter&#x27;s) they want, exercizing their free speech. They just wouldn&#x27;t be able to exercize censorship.<p>Same way I want net neutrality from ISPs, I want it from social media.')
