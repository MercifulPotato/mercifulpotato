Although I have to admit Acquiring Xilinx is much bigger news.<p>Judging from watching the Financial News and reading analyst&#x27;s comment for years. My feeling was that their Job was not to push for hard question or an honest answer. Their job is to push whatever interest they had with the company. So a spin for better long term prospect and downplay risk.<p>I was happy with the Enterprise results ( +116% YoY ) until I read this<p>&gt;Revenue was higher year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to higher semi-custom product sales and increased EPYC processor sales.<p>Semi-Custom is definitely PS5 and Xbox.<p>Basically I still dont see EPYC making enough inroad in the Server Market. And this is worrying, while the Stocks, Reviews, Hype are all going to AMD. No Results so far have shown Intel is hurt or AMD is making big gains in market shares and revenue shares.<p>The only good part I guess is Ryzen Mobile contribution to Computing and Graphics segment.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24906314" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24906314</a>')
