They offer content from many different magazines. I got some free credit during the early phase. Even though I wasn&#x27;t even spending my own money, seeing the amount go down after every article made me realize that none of the articles I read were worth any money.<p>On the other hand, I am willing to spend $80 on a book if it contains really valuable information.<p>One idea I like is spending $x flat each month and then consume as much as I like knowing that the amount gets shared equally among all the creators whose contents I have consumed. There probably are businesses with such a mode out there but I am not aware of any.')
