Government frequently talks about the need to keep schools open to avoid some of those costs; we&#x27;ve recently had rapid release of suicide stats (no rise so far, but lots of caution needed); we&#x27;re v worried about access to other forms of healthcare (London has today said they can&#x27;t guarantee ambo service to home birth delivery that goes wrong) etc etc.<p>People are constantly checking we&#x27;ve got the balance right.<p>But the fact remains: covid kills lots of people and it seriously harms very many others. Those people who are harmed take time to recover and that has long term financial and health implications for them and their families.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rupert_pearse&#x2F;status&#x2F;1342020644247130113" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rupert_pearse&#x2F;status&#x2F;1342020644247130113</a>')
