There&#x27;s a world of difference between adding a feature that&#x27;s obviously different than what came before and <i>looks obviously different</i> than adding one that changes functionality <i>but looks identical to prior usage</i>.  If people learn a language and during that it&#x27;s made clear that assignments can have arbitrary side effects, they&#x27;ll expect that.  If they learned the language and that <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> possible, introducing it at some point is going to mean a lot of programmers have ways of thinking about how control flow works and what happens when you make assignments that is subtly (or greatly) wrong, <i>but only sometimes</i>.<p>As a programmers, what that can feel like is that the language is actively sabotaging your understanding of it.  It&#x27;s not fun.')
