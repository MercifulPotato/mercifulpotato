I sued him in Federal court and won.<p>You didn’t have your code stolen.<p>Your code was free and open, and the header he removed stated that fact.<p>What you had was a violation of your terms of use, and I while I agree the guy’s probably a scumbag, the only issue here is that he was seen doing it.<p>Rest assured, others have done it without being seen, it’s a fact of life for a public code repo.<p>I suggest you:<p>(a) change “copywrite” to “copyright” in your code, since a copywrite is someone who writes stories, and a copyright is a legal term claiming ownership;<p>(b) file a dmca takedown notice with github; I run a hosting service and when we receive those, we take action;<p>(c) move on. Life’s too short, and all he has to do is republish it to another repo and keep you angry and not working on your code.<p>(d) actually file a copyright with your code so that he doesn’t do it then sue you for using his code;<p>I feel for you, but scumbags are what they are and there’s not much you can do about it unless you spend a ton of money to find and file a suit against him that you will probably not win.<p>My condolences.')
