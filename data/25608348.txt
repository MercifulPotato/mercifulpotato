We’ve decided to leverage adaptive learning to turn this process into a game.<p>This fall, we’re releasing a browser-based open world game for highschool students. Kids can choose what topics they want to learn about, and it’s always a short level and a fun game mechanic. Of course, this is powered by our adaptive learning engine in the background. We think technology is best for knowledge acquisition - and teachers are best for higher order skills like analysis and problem solving. Our project-based learning and mentorship network allows students to build on their knowledge by picking mentors and project groups based on topics they are interested in. We&#x27;re going for our first crowdfunding raise this month and we&#x27;re backed by Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari + Chuck E Cheese.<p>We&#x27;re looking for driven people from all backgrounds and with diverse experiences, but here are some key skills we&#x27;re looking for:<p>Marketing, Branding, Customer Support<p>Frontend Engineer - PixiJS, Three.JS or similar<p>Bubble App Developer<p>Game Designer&#x2F;Producer<p>Backend Engineer - Node or Go<p>Instructional Designers &#x2F; Learning Content Creators<p>--<p>Our culture is remote-first, inclusive and evolving (it should always be getting better)<p>No whiteboarding&#x2F;puzzle hiring process.
