And it&#x27;s nice to see a lawyer encouraging people who are not lawyers to read a law for themselves. But freely mixing legal analysis and political opinion, in a snarky format with debunker tone, isn&#x27;t responsible. Law degrees don&#x27;t turn our policy views into anointed fact.<p>The section on &quot;big tech&quot; isn&#x27;t legal analysis.  The fact that a law doesn&#x27;t call out a specific group doesn&#x27;t mean that such a group won&#x27;t specifically benefit, or suffer, in practice. The fact that Section 230 doesn&#x27;t have any language about company size or market share doesn&#x27;t mean the law doesn&#x27;t benefit them, benefit them more than smaller players, or benefit them in ways competitors in other industries don&#x27;t enjoy. There are arguments both ways there. It&#x27;s not all the lawyers on one side, and everybody who hasn&#x27;t read the law on the other.<p>We know which side Mike&#x27;s on. Reducing Section 230 claims to &quot;a narrow set of frivolous lawsuits&quot; was really cringey. Have a look at some of the cases that had folks reconsidering Section 230, back before Trump was even a candidate for president. The whole section where that jab appears is a straw man. I&#x27;ve not met anybody who thinks companies are totally immune from all laws.')
