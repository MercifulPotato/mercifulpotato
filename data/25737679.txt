In that already-rare scenario, the person with access can simply download or record the video anyway, thereby leaking it (with audio and high-resolution to boot). And that&#x27;s with everything working as intended.<p>Chained with another exploit to actually be able to discover someone&#x27;s private video IDs, it would have been worth a much higher bounty.')
