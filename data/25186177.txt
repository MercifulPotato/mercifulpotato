You can blame <i>any</i> human activity on &quot;human nature&quot;. At one time human nature gave us the slave trade, but we still made slavery illegal. Calling it &quot;human nature&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s nothing we can do about it.<p>When I say &quot;structurally enforces&quot;, I mean that it <i>amplifies</i> the natural urge to have more, or do better, than someone else.<p>For example, we might say that someone with $100,000 is fairly comfortable. And perhaps someone who&#x27;s more ambitious might have 10x their wealth. Or, let&#x27;s be more generous: let&#x27;s say 100x or even 1000x. That last would give you someone at $100,000,000 which most folk would agree is pretty wealthy.<p>Bit it&#x27;s a bit much when you end up with someone who has 10,000,000x the comfortable persons wealth. That&#x27;s not human nature: that&#x27;s a structure set up to funnel the wealth that ordinary people have created, to a tiny number of individuals. And I see that as a problem even if you don&#x27;t.')
