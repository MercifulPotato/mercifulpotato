We can&#x27;t even force people to wear masks or lock down, why would we be able to force them to get vaccines? Hell, we&#x27;re not even doing a great job getting vaccines to people who want them. And the business community sure as hell aren&#x27;t going to want any barriers to people traveling. Their primary concerns will be that there is at least the illusion of safety and that they are indemnified.')
