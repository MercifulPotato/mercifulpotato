There are law recognizing people and bestowing honors on them. There are laws which cancel previous laws.<p>There are plenty of laws which have no threat of punishment.<p>But I&#x27;ll set that objection aside.<p>Let&#x27;s go back to CJefferson&#x27;s comment, to be more concrete. &quot;inheritance should not be a right, when the original money was acquired illegally.&quot;<p>Money (at least as CJefferson refers to) exists because of laws, and the way we think of money exists because of laws. Inheritance is a legal concept, enforced by laws. So the right to inherit millions of dollars <i>by your definition</i> exists because of the implicit threat of prison.<p>Thus, changing the law as CJefferson describes doesn&#x27;t necessarily add a new threat of violence - it could change the balance of the existing threat of violence, or even reduce it.<p>Thus, an argument against changing the law simply because laws carry a threat of punishment is really an argument to maintain the status quo for the existing threats of violence. It is not a strong argument against changing the law, which is what I think you meant it as.')
