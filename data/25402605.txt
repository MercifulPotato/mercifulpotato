Item(by='eyko', descendants=None, kids=[25402662], score=None, time=1607813909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25402472, text='I honestly didn&#x27;t notice the author&#x27;s gender until you pointed it out, which led me to check the name. I simply read the article and agreed with most of the points, then came here to see the comments. In fact, I never attach a gender identity to authors or commenters unless something they say nudges me to check their name or username, or unless it&#x27;s an author I&#x27;m familiar with.<p>Having said that, I think it&#x27;s a safe bet to assume that one doesn&#x27;t &quot;only&quot; find such tone policing comments when the author is a woman, because one almost always finds such tone-policing comments on hacker news whenever there&#x27;s an opportunity to complain about tone.')
