OMEMO works fine between those. So do attachments&#x2F;file transfers (not slow at all). Also MAM&#x2F;history.<p>To have OMEMO working between multiple clients but the same user, make sure they’re all running and send a message from each client to your OMEMO contacts so they learn all your different keys and send answers encrypted for all of them.<p>In regards to Matrix. There’s only one reference client at the moment. But once other clients emerge and the protocol gets extended, they’ll probably have the same fate in that many 3rd party clients won’t support all features.')
