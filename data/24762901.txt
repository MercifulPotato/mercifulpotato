The issue here is not the landscape, it is that definition of &quot;acceptable parenting&quot; moved on absurdly.<p>And frankly, rural kids are not more independent. Also, the &quot;skins her knee&quot; thing is strawman. Kids who are small enough to need that adult on tap are not exploring forest alone (say 5 years old). And at the age where rural kids explore forest with dog alone and it is fine for them to get lost, they don&#x27;t get taps in city either.<p>I mean the independence thing very seriously, even you see the same age kid going in city alone as unfanthomable, but even now, they actually do.')
