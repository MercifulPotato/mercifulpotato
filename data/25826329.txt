Item(by='glangdale', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611002178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823700, text='It&#x27;s not obvious how prefetching the next address would make things run that much faster - you don&#x27;t know a given address until you execute the load. That said, there is <i>definitely</i> an extra cycle in your dependency chain to do the XOR, which you might well notice if your linked list is in cache (that extra cycle will show up).<p>We had a discussion on Twitter about some sort of superfast magic prefetcher that may well have been on the M1 which arguably could shave some cycles off list traversal, and there was a theory that an XOR-list would have been a good negative benchmark to prove&#x2F;disprove this, but nothing came of it.<p>The limitation is worse than you say; you can&#x27;t even <i>navigate</i> from an item just by knowing its address (not just remove&#x2F;erase something). So any given iterator into this list has to have 2 pointers (say, the item and its predecessor).<p>It&#x27;s a weird structure. There&#x27;s probably almost certainly some peculiar use case for it somewhere, but I&#x27;ve never encountered such a case.')
