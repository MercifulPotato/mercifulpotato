I&#x27;ve found that Notion&#x27;s strengths for us are when we have a collection of documents that all need to follow roughly the same structure, and we can build a mini database for them - things like blog post drafts for the company blog, RFCs, incident post-mortems, etc. On Google Drive this would be a folder of docs and a template maybe? Not searchable&#x2F;sortable in the same way. Or it might be a spreadsheet with links in? But that might not be great.<p>I could also imagine it working well for task management in small companies&#x2F;teams. I don&#x27;t think Drive has a good equivalent for this.')
