I really don&#x27;t think I overestimate my abilities, I say things like I a jack of all trades and &#x27;x think I&#x27;m great at y and y think I&#x27;m great at x&#x27;.  But still people think especially talented.  I even see quiet disagreement from experts in x or y who are maybe not so keen to criticise me publicly.  I feel the issue is that others over estimate my abilities.  Maybe a case of conflating value (which is real) with ability?')
