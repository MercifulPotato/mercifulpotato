Good job!<p>I have been implementing a pattern matcher for scheme based on the Balland pattern optimized, and every time I see pattern matchers for python I always get the feeling that the code you are replacing have to be truly awful  for the rather contrived pattern matching syntax to be a net win. Compare any of the python pattern matchers to something like trivia in Common Lisp [0] and you see what I mean.<p>How do people use the python pattern matchers? I am genuinely curious. One benefit that I see is that you can build patterns at run-time which could be useful.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;guicho271828&#x2F;trivia&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Type-Based-Destructuring-Patterns" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;guicho271828&#x2F;trivia&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Type-Based-Destr...</a>')
