Like an allowed right of way over private property. Yes, if a you have someone abusing your rights by filling frivolous suits then &quot;it&#x27;s a defence&quot;, of course it is they&#x27;re trying to assert a right they don&#x27;t have.<p>Such needless couching of public rights in an authoritarian way is really offensive to the purposes of copyright, which is granted by the public - the demos - to private parties. It&#x27;s not a natural right, and so yes, under Fair Use there is no right being infringed that a valid claim of tort can be made for; so one does have a right to do those things.')
