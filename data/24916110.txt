Enabling your leisure is not <i>the sole</i> value of work.<p>The GP said:<p>&gt;&gt; I know I could be [...] volunteering my time on a political campaign I believe in, or working to feed the homeless<p>Those are work too.  If you are a certain kind of person, you do those things and value them, and they don&#x27;t enable your leisure time, indeed they reduce it.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for fun either.  Another commenter said:<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; the number one reason I spend my time there—by far—is because it was fun<p>It was fun for them, but I know people who do volunteer work to help others who don&#x27;t find it fun, but do it because they think it is right or essential to do anyway.<p>I think most people do some kinds of work which is not for the sole purpose of enabling their leisure time, at some time in their lives.<p>For example every key worker (nurse etc) who feels underpaid but remains in the job because they feel it is a good thing to do.  Every unpaid carer of their parents.  Every volunteer who delivers food to others during pandemic even when they have become fed up of doing so.')
