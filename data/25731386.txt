Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=[25731446, 25731408], score=None, time=1610383149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25731326, text='It&#x27;s easy to see how pistol whipping someone over a bad drug deal could be plead down to a non-violent possession&#x2F;dealing offense because proving assault and battery is hard when the prosecution only has testimony and circumstantial evidence the prosecution&#x27;s star witness is an addict with a mile long record.  Possession is very easy to prove. A&amp;B, DV, etc, etc are much harder to prosecute (and by &quot;much&quot; I mean &quot;some work&quot; vs &quot;practically no work&quot;) so possession is a good offense to anchor a plea bargain for those other things to.<p>Personally I say release them all and just wait for the bad ones to filter back into the system but I can see why some people are hesitant.')
