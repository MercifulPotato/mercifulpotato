At first I was upset at how much time you wasted on flashy poorly executed effects. Then I realized the entire video is like that. If you&#x27;re going to show only one word at at time, it has to be something short like a 3 word tagline, not entire sentences. It&#x27;s impossible to follow, you have so many cuts, so fast, padded with things like &quot;woah, a browser&quot;.<p>I still don&#x27;t really understand what the app even is. A lot of it is poorly worded, or shouldn&#x27;t be there.<p>&quot;Right-clicking to add a task&quot; is not a feature that should be on the landing page. Unless you mean you can right click a tab that&#x27;s not running your app. Nor should there be things like &quot;Runs in Chrome&quot; - so is it an extension, chrome only?<p>My 2c would be to make things as simple as possible for the user by cutting out ambiguity, and focusing on user stories.')
