I was expecting to be able to click a link and be taken to something akin to a GitHub page, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be possible. Some of the crates link to project home pages.<p>Also, it would be neat if the <i>Network graph</i> page showed which projects were in SPARK, perhaps by using colour.')
