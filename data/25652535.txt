My son is 11 and daughter 8.  Both do Code.org and&#x2F;or Scratch fairly regularly.  Son wants to get into modding Minecraft, but honestly I&#x27;m a little annoyed with how shady and complicated that process is.  Or maybe I&#x27;m just too old to &quot;get it&quot;. I don&#x27;t discourage him from it, but haven&#x27;t been able to teach him that as much.<p>Son also recently bought with his own money a Arduino starter kid off amazon.   You can get an arduino, LCD, servo, LEDs, etc. for 30-40$. We&#x27;ve taken it a step at a time and go through various concepts, etc. For example, I talked to him about &#x27;rubber duck debugging&#x27; (ie explain the program to a rubber duck or plus toy line by line), semicolons, code blocks, etc. This has been great for learning real C and tinkering with electronics.<p>I plan to start them on basic web stuff on glitch.me sometime.  That should let them build simple websites etc. for free.')
