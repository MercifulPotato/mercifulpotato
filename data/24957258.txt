Take, for instance religion; Article 36 of the Constitution states:<p>---[art 36]<p>Citizens of the People’s Republic of China shall enjoy freedom of \nreligious belief.<p>No state organ, social organization or individual shall coerce citizens \nto believe in or not to believe in any religion, nor shall they discriminate against citizens who believe in or do not believe in any religion.<p>The state shall protect normal religious activities. No one shall use religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the state’s education system.<p>Religious groups and religious affairs shall not be subject to control by foreign forces.<p>---[end]<p>Speech, assembly, and protest&#x2F;demonstration are trickier because the problem isn&#x27;t evident from a single article in isolation. Article 35, on its face, seems to protect them:<p>---[art 35]<p>Citizens of the People’s Republic of China shall enjoy freedom of \nspeech, the press, assembly, association, procession and demonstration.<p>---[end]<p>But then there&#x27;s the catch (and this also applies to religion in top of the issues in Art. 36 itself): Articles 51-54<p>---[start]<p>Article 51<p>When exercising their freedoms and rights, citizens of the People’s \nRepublic of China shall not undermine the interests of the state, society \nor collectives, or infringe upon the lawful freedoms and rights of other \ncitizens.<p>Article 52<p>Citizens of the People’s Republic of China shall have the obligation \nto safeguard national unity and the solidarity of all the country’s ethnic \ngroups.<p>Article 53<p>Citizens of the People’s Republic of China must abide by the \nConstitution and the law, keep state secrets, protect public property, \nobserve discipline in the workplace, observe public order, and respect \nsocial morality.<p>Article 54<p>Citizens of the People’s Republic of China shall have the obligation \nto safeguard the security, honor and interests of the motherland; they \nmust not behave in any way that endangers the motherland’s security, \nhonor or interests.<p>---[end]')
