Ideally, this should always be true, but of course the reality is that people&#x27;s jobs often have them working on products they don&#x27;t really care for.  And of course, it&#x27;s easy to get distracted by tech anyway.  Experience also comes into play when it comes to loving &quot;boring&quot; techâ€”it took my around a decade before I was sufficiently jaded that almost all I want to do is write actual business logic.  I still love refactoring, though :)')
