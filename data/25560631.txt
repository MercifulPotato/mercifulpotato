Item(by='laumars', descendants=None, kids=[25561480], score=None, time=1609173887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25560414, text='&gt; <i>Execpt that you entered &quot;[in the Switch]&quot; from your own imagination and it&#x27;s simply not there in my original comment.</i><p>I know it’s not there in your original comment, that’s why it was inside square brackets. That’s a standard way of including context in a quote that otherwise would lack said context. You would see that in news papers and other publications. This isn’t some weird markup I’ve just invented and it’s definitely not a figment of my imagination because the post you were replying to was about the Switch.<p>&gt; <i>Regarding pjmlp post, yes that&#x27;s true, it wasn&#x27;t clear (and still isn&#x27;t) to me from his post, that he specifically speaks about the Switch when referring to &quot;devices&quot;.</i><p>You’re right, it wasn’t explicit. My apologies there.')
