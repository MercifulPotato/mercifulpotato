The real one was destroyed in 1687 when it was being used as a gunpowder depot(!), and then triggered by a mortar round.<p>They&#x27;ve been slowly rebuilding it over the last 50 years, but it&#x27;s nowhere near done. It involves figuring out where each and every block goes, often undoing previous reconstructions. You won&#x27;t be going inside it any time soon.<p>There are gift shops everywhere, of course, but I highly recommend the one at the Acropolis Museum (at the bottom of the hill). It does a great job of putting the site into historical and archeological context.')
