However analysis has been carried out to work out how far from the receptor-binding site the mutations are, and how &#x27;antibody-accessible&#x27; these are, with a few such as . No conclusions are drawn from this analysis.<p>Earlier on in the report (towards the end of page 1), this statement is given `One of these (the N501Y mutation) occurs in the region of the Spike protein, the receptor binding domain (RBD), that the virus uses to bind to the human ACE2 receptor. Changes in this  region  of  the  Spike  protein  can  result  in  the  virus  changing  its  ACE2  binding  specificity  and  alter antibody recognition`.<p>Saying all this, vaccines are designed to create a range of antibody responses, in order to stop this very fear of a single mutation rendering a whole vaccine useless.
