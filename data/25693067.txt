If you are talking about direct incitement to violence: Sure, he did not directly incite violence - he merely mumbled fire in a crowded theater.<p>However, if the question is about impeachement: Yes. There&#x27;s more than enough reason to go through with it. In the broader context of how the President has been lying to his supporters about election fraud, telling them to stop the steal, and that he will never concede. The President is on record trying to strong-arm election officials in Georgia to find him 11,780 votes, the exact number that would overturn the state.<p>No, he does not say that they need to investigate. He wants them to find him the votes because he knows he won it. And that is just what has happened in the past week.')
