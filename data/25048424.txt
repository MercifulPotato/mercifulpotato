Effectively, it sounds like they just chose to not block the sale for something that, in the end, would have made no difference to them (but would have prevented the founder from leaving).<p>Josh ended up better, the employees ended up better, and the investors _really_ didn&#x27;t end up in a worse place (in actuality, they probably now get to write this off as a loss and not worry about it anymore, so maybe a bit of a pro?).')
