Item(by='drewzero1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611774570, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25927189, text='Some states also have &#x27;classic&#x27; registration which (in WI at least) is paid once and lasts as long as you own the vehicle. It&#x27;s more expensive up front than a regular yearly registration, but once it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s done. It also carries additional restrictions befitting the intended operation of a &#x27;classic&#x27; (e.g., owner must also have a regularly registered vehicle, not allowed to drive in January, hauling restrictions if it&#x27;s a truck) which make it cheaper only as a second vehicle.<p>The rules are designed to apply to vehicles being preserved, and are a help to hobbyists who can afford to own two or more cars. They seem to be designed - for better or worse - to exclude people who happen to rely on an older car as their only vehicle.')
