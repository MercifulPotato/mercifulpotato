On some issues it can be extremely difficult to find good faith arguments and evidence on each side of the issue.</i><p>&quot;Good faith&quot;, &quot;bad faith&quot; labeling is not logical, it&#x27;s more of an attempt to apply morality and ideology to reasoning to reject something based on your own preferred beliefs and feelings. Similarly illogical is evaluating evidence &quot;from each side&quot;, this is not how to evaluate anything, there needs to be some base rate to compare the evidence to and all the evidence has to be compared, not just something cherry picked from each side, and not just evidence, known unknowns and unknown unknowns have to be considered too, and so on. It&#x27;s way more complicated than people want it to be.<p>And it&#x27;s very hard to have good logical arguments not full of fallacies. You will certainly never see them in mass media, as mass media needs to influence your opinion, not provide background for making a good decision.<p>Daniel Kahneman in his Thinking fast and slow book wrote plenty on reasoning, check it out if you haven&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll open your eyes on reasoning (I know the book had some crucial things wrong for his theory, but a lot of things throughout the book are still ok).')
