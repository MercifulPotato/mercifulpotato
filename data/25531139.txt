But these two tools may help now or in the future since they are being developed. (I can&#x27;t definitively answer since I&#x27;m not super familiar with either).<p>There&#x27;s a Noteself setup of Tiddlywiki (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noteself.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noteself.org&#x2F;</a>) that syncs with a database and has revision history. You click on the upper right corner of a tiddler to access revision history. The revision UI&#x27;s not very intuitive to start and I&#x27;m not sure how making a public site with revision history available would work though. It also is on version 5.1.21 rather than 5.1.23 of Tiddlywiki, though maybe the maker plans to upgrade in the future. You could ask here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.noteself.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.noteself.org</a>. I just started using it so I&#x27;m not super familiar with it.<p>TW5 Bob <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OokTech&#x2F;TW5-Bob" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OokTech&#x2F;TW5-Bob</a> is being built to serve one or more Wikis for multiple people, but I don&#x27;t know that they have revision history (I could be mistaken).')
