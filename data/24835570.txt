It is not about not seeing the e-mail, it is about sending from the private e-mail. Example<p>You subscribe with `private-XXXX@apple-id.com` which relays to `foo@gmail.com`. Customer support asks you to chat with them from the same ID you signed up. Your e-mail client sends email from `foo@gmail.com`.
