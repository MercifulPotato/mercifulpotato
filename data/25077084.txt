I use it exclusively to contact folks who &quot;touch&quot; my projects repos, in order to get better feedback on the problems they&#x27;re encountering, and better understand their use cases.  But, I also understood this tool would be very valuable to spammers and generally make the quality of life on GitHub worse.<p>I&#x27;m also of the opinion that grabbing people&#x27;s email through the commit history is at least shady if not outright unethical, even if it&#x27;s public. Most folks I talk to don&#x27;t realize that their email is public this way.<p>I tried recently to productize my version of this tool [1], with the caveat that you can only use to contact folks that tough repos you or your organization owns.  It hasn&#x27;t seen much success so far though.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitologie.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitologie.com&#x2F;</a>')
