But I think you&#x27;re underestimating how many targets there are across the US. Both military bases as well as industrial targets. First strike targets would hit Montana and Kansas as both have Minutemen ICBM silos. Omaha would be wiped out since Offut AFB is next door. Louisiana has shipbuilding that would get nuked, as does Wisconsin. If you learn about SIOP, and accept that the Soviets had similar plans, you&#x27;ll understand. The USSR didn&#x27;t intend a nuclear war to &quot;liberate&quot; the USA. It planned to destroy the country, not just its military capabilities.')
