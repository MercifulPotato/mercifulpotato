Could you direct me to how your @ operation works?  This seems very interesting.<p>I recently added quandles&#x2F;racks to mathlib[1], the Lean standard math library.  I think mathlib has some lambda calculus formalization, so it might be interesting adding a quandle instance for your operation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;leanprover-community&#x2F;mathlib&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;algebra&#x2F;quandle.lean" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;leanprover-community&#x2F;mathlib&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;...</a>')
