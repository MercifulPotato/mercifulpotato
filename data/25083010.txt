Once they get into office it&#x27;s house of cards, the advisors giving the same advice, same office machinations. I imagine there is a lot of resistance for wavering from the norm.<p>Obama had election promises to get out of conflicts, close Guantanamo Bay, and so on. Campaign promises reneged and the continuance of Bush era executive power overriding the course of legislation.<p>Compared to Trump Obama looks good, but in reality he wasn&#x27;t really anything special apart from his eloquence and kind demeanor which I am sure Republicans dismissed as Democrats dismiss the qualities of Rep. Presidents. It&#x27;s all just the same shit from different sides, it&#x27;s kind of laughable really.')
