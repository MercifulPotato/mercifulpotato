Ltd. -&gt; Delaware C Corp.<p>• Raising funds by selling PoP.<p>I (we?) would love to hear what led to these overhaul? @mildlyclassic.<p>I&#x27;ve been an advocate for Non-Cellular mobile Internet[1] in India and was eager to see WiFi Dabba venturing into this space, now that broadband seems to be their focus I&#x27;m bit sad although I understand if fighting the oligopoly&#x27;s cheap cellular Internet(coupled with free voice calls) is an unwinnable battle for small startup building the ecosystem(innovative computer networking) from scratch.<p>Then again I&#x27;m excited to see the sale of PoPs, as I&#x27;ve been advocating for monetary incentives in sharing Internet[2] as well. Although WiFi Dabba&#x27;s PoP isn&#x27;t directly related to that, distributing the ownership of network is very exciting. I hope it ends profitable to both the company and its investors.<p>Recent reports said Internet penetration in India is limited to ~40% in Cities and ~15% in rural areas; So obviously there&#x27;s a huge need gap in the country and attempts improve that through existing Internet players has repeatedly yielded disappointing results.<p>My previous startup was involved in VSAT services for in-flight entertainment system through a major U.S. Telecom, I&#x27;ve worked with several talented Network Engineers in the country, I hope some of them get motivated by WiFi Dabba to start their own network startups and bridge the need gap.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;needgap.com&#x2F;problems&#x2F;51-non-cellular-network-mobile-internet-telecom-internetba" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;needgap.com&#x2F;problems&#x2F;51-non-cellular-network-mobile-...</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;needgap.com&#x2F;problems&#x2F;52-sharing-wifi-network-with-strangers-for-money-wifi-internet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;needgap.com&#x2F;problems&#x2F;52-sharing-wifi-network-with-st...</a>')
