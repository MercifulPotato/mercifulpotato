(Gate API keys through a sane login system that uses Google or GitHub for identity)<p>My thinking would be to explicitly *not* ship a supported &quot;product&quot; of any kind, but rather to provide a way to put the raw materials in their current state &quot;out there&quot; from a research perspective and provide users a way to exercise the system and reason about its limits, without letting everyone run off with it. (For example pretraining would happen on the server from uploaded datasets.)<p>In this scenario, the idea would be to let the market come to you, by just putting this absolutely everywhere in its current raw form and *letting the market materialize&#x2F;emerge*. Rationale being, you want to know what the correct next step is <i>from where you stand right now.</i> If the program actually runs, for an interesting definition of &quot;runs&quot;, ie it can actually handle real-world work in a novel way, well, I say that directly translates to it being worth trying because you might get novel answers&#x2F;ideas for where to turn next. IOW, I&#x27;m theorizing that the quality of the answers you would get may correlate with the irreducible complexity of how well the program stands up in practice.<p>Reviewing uploaded data and executed commands may also prove insightful and inspire new ideas for real-world integrations. (Something something view-but-not-share TOS clause)<p>Depending on resource usage, charging for certain API actions, as a way to further ratelimit and not necessarily to make money, may be reasonable - for example doing extensive training (or lots of iterations) or performing tasks that take a long time to complete or scan a lot of input data. (And of course there would be research exceptions to this as well...)<p>Also, tables-in-pptx is now filed in my head a few rows down from &quot;email of a TIFF of a scan of a photocopy of a printout of a fax of another email&quot; :) - that&#x27;s terrible, haha')
