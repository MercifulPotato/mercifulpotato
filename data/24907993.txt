Item(by='ttt0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603810470, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24903209, text='&gt; the issue at hand is the inclusion of youtube links in the readme, which encourages downloads of copyrighted works from youtube.<p>The README file doesn&#x27;t encourage any downloads of any copyrighted works. All examples included in the README point to their own example video. The only thing that comes close to this is that they say that they <i>will not</i> support any services that are violating copyrights. The copyrighted content is used in test cases, that are not meant for users to see.<p>&gt; (i) Does YouTube have &quot;technological protection measures&quot; that prevent downloading? In the case of the AACS controversy, this was a bit more clear-cut: there was a secret key that was cracked, but what exactly is being &quot;circumvented&quot; in this case?<p>What&#x27;s being &quot;circumvented&quot; is the encrypted URL to the content. But it&#x27;s not really circumvented, YouTube decrypts it with javascript. All youtube-dl does is that it interprets the javascript that&#x27;s on their website, just like a web browser does.<p>&gt; (ii) Nowhere does youtube-dl advertise that it&#x27;s to be used to &quot;reproduce and distribute&quot; without authorization.<p>Correct. Not sure what &quot;reproduce&quot; means in legal speak, but youtube-dl doesn&#x27;t even have any functionality to distribute anything.')
