Marie Antoinette is the very image of dislikable aristocracy. Have folks these days really forgotten why she was so hated? She clearly was unable to perform in the role of arguing for the french people. She was utterly divorced from their problems due to wealth disparity. If people have forgotten why she was hated, we are due for some truly violent times. This is not good: the US ruling class is the very image of pre-revolution wealth disparity, complete with Pelosi eating ice cream out of her two massive fridges during a pandemic. I&#x27;m no particular critic of Pelosi in particular, but my jaw hit the floor when I saw her make that video. How can you be this oblivious about how you come off to people?<p>The book itself is excellent, btw, this is purely a question for the editor of &quot;nybooks&quot;. Editor: stop pretending that people forgot why the rich are hated when the poor are starving. We aren&#x27;t at the place where impoverished women take the streets demanding better prices for bread but we aren&#x27;t far from it either.')
