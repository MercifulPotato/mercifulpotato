Some things it does will always be trashy - like fighting tooth and nails to keep Linux desktops and truly-open formats out of European public-service procurement. That&#x27;s still going on, 20 years and 2 CEOs later, and will probably never stop, because screw public interest when there is so much money on the line!<p>But sure, in some areas they behave better now. They had no choice, after losing a whole generation of developers and seeing their cash-cows (Windows, Office, and AD&#x2F;Exchange) under siege from SaaS insurgents. I&#x27;ve still to see something where their efforts are not fundamentally tied to their immediate self-interest, though.')
