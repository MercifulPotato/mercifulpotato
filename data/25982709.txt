I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m wrong, but I don&#x27;t know of anyone that is running a mesh VHF or HF system in the mountains. I always carry my HAM when I&#x27;m out, just in case anyone else is, but obviously that&#x27;s truly local communication and has the downsides that you mention.<p>With a strategically placed mesh network and some solar panels, you could potentially overcome a lot of the downsides of radio because you could target high areas, such as mountain peaks, to help bridge those obstructions.<p>I definitely don&#x27;t disagree that the #1 safety device is a GPS&#x2F;sat phone, but those are prohibitively expensive and most people don&#x27;t have them. If we could get some solar powered radios along ridges, and a decent percentage of people carrying them, I think there could be a very comprehensive mesh network that would work for most needs. Bearspray is already pretty ubiquitous, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be that hard to get people to bring a $30 mesh radio with them as a routine thing.')
