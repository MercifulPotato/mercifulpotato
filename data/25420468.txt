I didn&#x27;t quite understand how the breeding worked and I was trying to breed a particular Pokémon with high stats. I spent many hours figuring out how it works and writing scripts to figure out what I should breed to get what I want, then more hours actually doing the breeding. I was fully engaged and I would consider this video game playing healthy.<p>I&#x27;ve also spent many hours just vegging out. A little of that is fine; it&#x27;s one way I do some thinking. But too much of it and the day is gone and when I stop I feel bad, like I&#x27;ve just come out of a stupor. This, to me, is not healthy, even if I otherwise took care of all my responsibilities.')
