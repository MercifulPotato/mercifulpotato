Having my phone break, one day out of warranty, with a factory defect.  And then being unable to even set up an appointment because that phone was required for 2-factor authentication on my apple ID.  (Which I don&#x27;t even remember having set up.) I lost all data.<p>2. Having keys fall out of my computer requiring losing it for weeks.  After that every article that I&#x27;ve read about how Apple has tried to lock down their hardware and make it harder for independent shops to repair has added to my concern that I&#x27;ll have no options if it dies.<p>3. The Catalina upgrade was bad.  A friend whose whole life was saved to iTunes found he was unable to migrate his extensive collection.  His purchased movies, TV shows, songs, etc was over a terabyte, all gone.  As for me, I was bit by the Catalina and Microsoft Teams don&#x27;t want to play bug described in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;answers.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;msoffice&#x2F;forum&#x2F;all&#x2F;macos-catalina-and-teams-screen-sharing&#x2F;28a38edc-d149-4c32-95cd-95c4d87dbf13" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;answers.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;msoffice&#x2F;forum&#x2F;all&#x2F;macos...</a>.  If you look at the thread, people are still reporting problems a year later.  As for me, I cannot run XCode, and can only share my desktop if Teams is full screen.<p>You pay a premium for Apple hardware.  You used to get a premium experience.  The &quot;premium experience&quot; that I have been getting sucks.  And not on hypotheticals, but on actual bad experiences that I have personally had.')
