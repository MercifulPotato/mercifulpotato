If you don&#x27;t think postmodernism has caused serious damage and is a terrible influence on peoples minds in the humanities then we&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree.<p>&gt; Some event with christians and anti-postmodernists speaking<p>Again, I&#x27;m not sure what you think the problem is. Dawkins isn&#x27;t saying Christians should be deplatformed. His tweet was doubtless intended to promote the anti-postmodernists; you can&#x27;t scour every retweet for transitive ideological inconsistencies. Well, maybe people do, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good use of time.<p>&gt; The letter to an imaginary muslim girl<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit cringe-inducing, but it&#x27;s clear what his point was: that women in muslim cultures are subjected to terrible things which don&#x27;t really compare to the problems of sexual inequality in western culture.<p>&gt; Maybe as an old guy don&#x27;t tell a woman that her experience is wrong.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s one way in which we differ. You&#x27;re a supporter of identity politics, one consequence of which is that you believe that the truth of statements depends on who utters them. I am a traditional liberal, who simply continues to follow the tenets of rationalism that were in place before the postmodernist and identity-politics movements took over the minds of most of my generation.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, I guess we don&#x27;t have any common ground here. I agree with pretty much everything Dawkins has ever said. I have no respect for any religious belief in the minds of anyone who has had access to a modern education, and I have no trouble saying Islam is a terrible religion -- you don&#x27;t have to look further than the treatment of women. There&#x27;s no need for nuance here -- all religions are childish.')
