I already knew my way around 3D vector math from my previous work making toy games in school,  but even so it&#x27;s surprising how short and easy the code is.<p>It&#x27;s about ~300 lines of Scala and runs in the browser via Scala.js. The page has a link to the source code. Could definitely be sped up or improved in a myriad of ways, but even as is I think the output graphic is pretty impressive given the input code size and programmer effort!')
