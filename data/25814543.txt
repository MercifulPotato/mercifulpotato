This is way off topic.<p>EDIT: you have edited in some more relevant points, but there definitely is a price that&#x27;s too high. If you had to pair a $35 computer with a $100 display, most people would absolutely find that to be too much in this hobby context. They would have to either have a lot of money, or a lot of passion for a particular project in order to justify that. Most people will find $20 to be reasonable.')
