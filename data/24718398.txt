But it&#x27;s not necessary to inflict extra suffering to show that.  Maybe they had to show the combination of the treatment with tinnitus doesn&#x27;t cause harm but I doubt that.<p>There&#x27;s also an argument where a disease is rare and inflicting animals with it to allows for efficacy testing, but tinnitus isn&#x27;t rare, plenty of human volunteers are available. (I mean, half the people in this thread have already &quot;volunteered&quot; to perform testing of possible treatments on themselves, myself included).<p>Lastly as others have pointed out there are many causes of tinnitus.  The researchers only inflicted one kind of it (I&#x27;d assume it&#x27;s the same kind that everyone hears after hearing loud noises, since these guinea pigs were presumably otherwise healthy), it&#x27;s possible this treatment only works on that kind and is a waste of time for everyone else.')
