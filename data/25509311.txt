Sure, I&#x27;m no founder, nor am I by any means wealthy, but I am grateful for what I have, given I had nothing before.<p>For those who find themselves in a similar situation, I highly recommend the book &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot;; for me, the most important lessons were 1) humility, 2) save money for yourself and make it earn you money, and 3) seek to improve your earning potential. I know it&#x27;s easy to be upset others are given what you need to earn, but frustration won&#x27;t help you retire or achieve your goals.')
