I will consider your advice, but I imagine switching from one password manager to another will only certify me as a genuine and eternal password hater. (Also, a password stored in a password manager is something you have, not something you know, so it&#x27;s completely inconsistent with the principle of MFA. I mean, the reasons to hate passwords just increase as long as I think about it. That probably only hurts the <i>theory</i> of passwords though, not the practice of them.)')
