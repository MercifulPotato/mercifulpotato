Their information throughout is so high that it&#x27;s hard to hold onto anything. That high throughout also makes them valuable for quick syncs and personal conversation. We run into trouble when we try to make it do more than it was built for.<p>&quot;Cold&quot; channels (e.g. documents, tickets) are where important information should go. A single piece of information can be developed and solidified over time. Cold channels are easier to search, easier to catch up on, and easier to onboard.<p>The problem is not with any one channel, but that we expect one channel to handle all types of information.')
