Item(by='scruple', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609956854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25659367, text='For nearly 2 decades, vi(m) (or a vim emulator or integration layer) has been my daily editor.<p>I recently had an interview where I had to use some remote collaborative web application and it was genuinely a horrible experience. The main interviewer (lead for the team I was applying for) was visibly annoyed with me because, for whatever stupid reason, some of the keyboard shortcuts he kept trying to bark at me, as I was working through some truly asinine leetcode-style questions, for things like block indentation were not working on my end and I had to manually tab multiple lines, etc...<p>The entire editing experience threw me really hard and was so distracting that I was fumbling what would&#x27;ve otherwise been trivial algorithm questions for me. Despite my 15 years of professional experience and a deep understanding of their tech stack (which, of course, was <i>not</i> a main discussion point at any stage of my interview process -- one of many red flags for me), if you had watched this you&#x27;d have thought I barely know how to write code.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer is here but I have decided, and thankfully I have the privilege of making this decision, that I am done interviewing for a while.')
