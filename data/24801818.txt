Which is rather common, but arguably a mistake.<p>Virtual memory is what allows for copy on write pages when forking. It is the preferred basis for implementing memory mapped files. It allows for sharing a single copy of shared library in ram, without causing everything to break if one program decides it wants to patch &quot;its&quot; copy of the library in memory.<p>Yeah sure it allows for paging out anonymous memory too, but that is hardly its sole function.')
