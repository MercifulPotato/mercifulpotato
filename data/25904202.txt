I know that a lot of our media is based around the two-sides narrative but it really isn&#x27;t true. Even in politics there are as many opinions as there are people. If you examine your own beliefs you will probably find that you don&#x27;t really agree with everything on &quot;your own side&quot;.<p>It is not people are quiet about their beliefs - just read some of their books&#x2F;blogs if you want to know how they think. Just avoid sites like youtube where people are paid by advertising - there you will only get deliberately provocative content just to get clicks.<p>You UI is interesting but I think you are setting yourself up for hosting arguments rather than discussion. Sites like ycombinator, reddit, twitter, and yes even parlor have the cultures they do due to careful (and often unseen) moderation. I don&#x27;t envy the task you have set for yourself.')
