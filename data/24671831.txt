SR and GR explain the planets&#x27; motion better than Newton and Kepler alone. QM explains pi bonds in molecules like benzene better than classical chemistry. GR compensation is required by GPS satellites and receivers.<p>So it doesn&#x27;t have to be a combination of GR and QM, but it does have to be something which is at least as good as GR and QM respectively in their existing domains of explanation.')
