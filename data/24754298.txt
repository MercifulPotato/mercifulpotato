We just had a democratic nomination cycle where every candidate except the eventual winner (but who at that time seemed down and our) promised to support this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;116&#x2F;bills&#x2F;hres109&#x2F;BILLS-116hres109ih.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;116&#x2F;bills&#x2F;hres109&#x2F;BILLS-116hres109i...</a>. Doesn’t that seem quite left?<p>You’re correct that Sweden, etc., are market economies with welfare states tacked on.
