Maybe from pessimism bias?<p>I observe a lot of HN commenters don&#x27;t vibe with how Apple controls &amp; develops their ecosystem. Yet, instead of go elsewhere, complaining and acting like being oh so very special enough to know how things should be done is preferred; while expecting a major company to just cater to their personal whims.<p>I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s entitlement I&#x27;m witnessing or just people that feel like they have no faith in Apple&#x27;s competition at making anything better than Apple currently has.')
