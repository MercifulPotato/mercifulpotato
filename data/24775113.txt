Solving this type of puzzle takes many resources- expensive ASICs and a lot of electricity to run them around the clock. The name of this puzzle is known as the hash function SHA-256.<p>The article skips the notion of Proof of Work, which is the formal term for the puzzles. And puzzles can take many forms besides finding small outputs of a hash function [1]. The latter is just Hashcash, of which Bitcoin&#x27;s PoW is an instance.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptorials.io&#x2F;beyond-hashcash-proof-work-theres-mining-hashing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptorials.io&#x2F;beyond-hashcash-proof-work-theres-min...</a>')
