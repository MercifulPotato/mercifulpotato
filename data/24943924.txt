A simplified grid geometry is studied, consisting of two negatively-biased coaxial current-carrying rings, oriented such that their opposing magnetic fields produce a spindle cusp. Our analysis indicates that better than break-even performance is possible even in a deuterium-deuterium system at bench-top scales. The proposed device has the unusual property that it can avoid both the cusp losses of traditional magnetic fusion systems and the grid losses of traditional IEC configurations.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1510.01788" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1510.01788</a>')
