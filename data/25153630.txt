Apparently the treatment of the Facebook Content Moderators is also legal. So by your logic, it is OK, because we already have those rules.<p>I don&#x27;t know why you think &quot;love it or leave it&quot; is a veiled threat. What historical use are you referring to? Of course it is abbreviated. You can negotiate with your boss if you are unhappy. But ultimately, nobody owes you anything. Yes, there are the labor laws and so on, but I think if somebody decides to shut down their company, you can not really sue them for your job anymore.')
