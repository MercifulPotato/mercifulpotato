Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607450724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25348299, text='&gt; Commercial aircraft were also totally unreasonable for quite a time after Wright&#x27;s first flight in 1903.<p>That&#x27;s comparing apples and orangutans.<p>This isn&#x27;t a 1903 situation at all - we&#x27;ve launched rockets on a weekly basis for 60 years and operated crewed reusable spacecraft for more than 30 years.<p>This is well known territory. All limitations, possibilities and risks are well known and documented.<p>If you have to make a comparison, choose the Concorde versus Ju-52 or something. But even that&#x27;s flawed because it doesn&#x27;t fit at all.<p>The concerns I mentioned aren&#x27;t going to magically disappear - even a &quot;perfectly safe&quot; (by whatever definition) rocket still has to deal with these. A 30-engine, 122m, 65MN rocket <i>will</i> generate a literally deafening blast and for that reason alone cannot be launched near cities. This is a fact of nature, not just a simple engineering problem or overly cautious safety concern.<p>Same goes for airspace closure, weather on both ends, and simple things like customs and security checks.<p>Starship won&#x27;t have any cross-range capabilities, full stop. That&#x27;s how rockets work and one consequence of this is that bad weather means a scrubbed launch, simple as that. Nothing to do with attitude or &quot;modern America&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s just physics and natural phenomena that exist and cannot be wished away.<p>Again, none of this prevents point-to-point travel from being <i>possible</i>, it just demonstrates that it&#x27;s likely not going to be an everyday occurrence like long-haul flights. A novelty, maybe. Another option for the rich and important, sure.<p>A viable alternative to regular jets, I think not. Time might prove me wrong, but I&#x27;m fairly certain the odds are stacked against regular point-to-point passenger flight service using huge rockets.')
