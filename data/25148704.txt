The majority of articles, opinion pieces and books are a drawn out mess. Like that meme about recipes not just containing the recipe, but a whole story the reader usually doesn&#x27;t care about, how the cook first tried out this dish on his first date with his ex wife, who is the one that got away. The same goes for many books: Simple thoughts are turned into pages, chapters, whole books. &gt;90% padding you do not need to read to fully understand the book. But if you want to publish and sell a book, you can&#x27;t publish an article. And if you want to publish an article, you can&#x27;t publish a tweet.')
