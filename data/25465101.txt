I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;d agree on the causes though.<p>People are still told to go to expensive college. A cheap community college degree in STEM is worth much more than an expensive liberal arts education. A self-taught programmer has more marketable skills than a liberal arts degree holder. The freely available loans made the institutions money hungry, and they grew to absorb all of the new income.<p>We really need to fix education.<p>The post-war &#x2F; post-energy boom is over, and the easy gains that yielded have faded. Today&#x27;s economy is harder. The knowledge economy is not as accessible and requires more training. The US can&#x27;t compete with the cost of manufactured goods as our standard of living and minimum wage are too high. By importing, we&#x27;re moving that negative externality of hard or menial labor to economies that can handle it - bringing them up to our level, but destroying those opportunities domestically.<p>Housing is still affordable outside of major cities. I&#x27;m not sure what to do about the price of housing in major urban areas though. It&#x27;s supply and demand, and wages for the average worker haven&#x27;t increased.')
