Once the pandemic is over&#x2F;simmering, we can expect demand for SFH and interest rates to return to normal, though the interest rate part may take a while.<p>On the other hand, for someone who doesn&#x27;t expect to sell their home for a very long time (or ever), if you can afford your desired home right now, there is no reason not to just grab it and remove all uncertainty from further price increases. Which is pretty much FOMO, but it&#x27;s not necessarily irrational if you&#x27;d rather grab your dream home now than take the chance at getting a better deal.<p>For someone like me who would prefer not to take out a loan that is large in nominal value, even if the interest rate is low, it&#x27;s actually better to wait for interest rates to increase, though you may end up waiting quite a while.')
