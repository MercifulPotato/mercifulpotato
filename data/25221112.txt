It&#x27;s an exercise in futility and frustration.<p>Even keyboard shortcuts which are defined often don&#x27;t work, and many areas cannot be navigated at all without the mouse.<p>It&#x27;s the main reason I&#x27;ve resorted to writing my own debugging aids for my application, the other reason being that I aim for cross-browser compatibility beyond Firefox and WebKit, and while IE has excellent debugging tools (with Visual Studio installed, much superior to anything else, IMO), browsers like Opera 12 and Netscape have hardly anything available.')
