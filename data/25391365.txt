Yes, we did.<p>A good example of a bad faith argument is repeatedly employing the motte-and-bailey fallacy by making positive claims, and then when asked to support those claims with evidence, shifting the burden of proof to your opponent by equivocating between statements of the form &quot;there was no X&quot; and &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence for X.&quot; People often do this unintentionally because they are confused about the difference between object-level claims and statements about the evidence for object-level claims. But one begins to suspect bad faith when this distinction is explained and then ignored, and the behavior repeated.<p>Of course there is no test for bad faith and people can be both confused as emotionally involved so they repeat themselves. Which may be the case here, I&#x27;m not a mind reader.')
