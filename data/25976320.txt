We live in an age where this can be a matter of life and death.<p>It is standard practice in India to cut off Internet access in places where there are riots or riots expected to happen or for some nebulous “national security” concern. <i>In fact, India tops the list of countries with the most Internet shutdowns in the last few years (you can check this out online).</i><p>In one state (where wired broadband penetration is quite low), mobile Internet access was <i>disabled for several months</i> even during the pandemic!<p>The government and its law enforcement agencies do not know of other ways to handle these and resort to more of a “control and crush” mode.<p>Maybe certain circumstances lead to certain decisions. What’s more shocking is that there’s no transparency on why access is blocked, who got it done, when the block will be lifted (and for what reasons). A democracy cannot thrive when the ruling powers along with law enforcement hold everything as a secret and don’t appreciate questions from the citizens.<p>It’s sad to see India becoming more closed and authoritarian.<p>Internet Freedom Foundation (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internetfreedom.in" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internetfreedom.in</a>) fights for digital rights in India.
