You’ll never achieve perfection, but each iteration should get better.<p>Do something simple. Create a terminal weather app. Separate the “client” and “backend” into separate processes simply for the complexity of it.<p>Have the client end process commands, send requests to the backend, and render results.<p>The backend should receive commands from the client app and send back responses.<p>I’d suggest staying away from HTTP and try to use a pipe between the two processes and come up with your own protocol.<p>Bonus points if you make the api non-blocking and the client has to query the backend for results.<p>Add artificial delays. Add artificial failures. Add logging. Switch to protobufs. Create a distributed backend. Send messages over a queueing&#x2F;task system instead of a bare pipe. Dockerize it. Simulate hundreds of clients. Go nuts.<p>Taking a silly simple application and making it overly complex is a good way to learn because you’re not burdened by the complexity of the problem, but instead the burden is on the thing you’re tying to learn.<p>Practice practice practice.')
