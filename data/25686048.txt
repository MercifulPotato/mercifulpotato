That&#x27;s not a grey area.<p>In the case of Sci-Hub what part of the ToS do they violate? The message cites counterfeiting, which doesn&#x27;t seem to apply (unless that&#x27;s a translation issue?). And if Piracy is a violation of their terms then why are there plenty of piracy torrent websites with Twitter presences still [2]? At least apply it evenly.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TwitterComms&#x2F;status&#x2F;1266267447838949378" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TwitterComms&#x2F;status&#x2F;1266267447838949378</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TwitterSafety&#x2F;status&#x2F;1323868590047744000" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TwitterSafety&#x2F;status&#x2F;1323868590047744000</a><p>[2] Not linking directly, just search for the pirate bay, eztv, or any other torrent site.
