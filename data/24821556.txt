Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=[24821830, 24823889], score=None, time=1603059388, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24819254, text='A farm.<p>Room to roam, largely self-supporting due to our own forest for heating and building, own water well, own waste water facilities, no building permit needed for farm buildings, own land to grow whatever we please. My children get to grow up in the countryside, where city-dwellers have empty syringes and crack heads on their doorstep we have elk, deer and wolves. Where they hear police sirens at night we hear owls and foxes. Meanwhile we have a gigabit glassfiber connection feeding into a rack I built which houses enough cpu and storage to be mostly self-reliant on that front as well - no external cloudy services for me, thanks.<p>The more independent we get, the less money we need. I just built a new 230mÂ² barn which will be used partly as a new stables, partly as a veterinary clinic (my wife is a horse vet). On top of that barn I&#x27;ll put enough solar panels to make us mostly electricity-neutral through overproduction in summer (which will be fed into the grid) which will be another step towards self-reliance.<p>If you&#x27;re mechanically-inclined, have two left hands (I&#x27;m left-handed, get it?), not afraid of some honest blood &amp; sweat and able and willing to take up such a project you won&#x27;t regret moving to the countryside and taking up farming, part-time or more.')
