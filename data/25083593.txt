Tablets are becoming general purpose computing devices.<p>You&#x27;ve referenced Apple specifically in relation to all this.<p>Note that Apple&#x27;s official position disagrees with you, as seen in their lawsuit against Epic, and their claim that iOS devices are more like app consoles than general purpose computing devices.<p>The most worrying part here is that we&#x27;re already sliding into a world where we&#x27;re accepting these walled gardens as general purpose computing devices, when the manufacturer is stating definitively that they do not see it this way. The limitations we&#x27;re imposing on ourselves is a shame.<p>(EDIT: to add, I&#x27;m on my third iPad now and continue to be very happy with them. I&#x27;m part of the problem.)')
