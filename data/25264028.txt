I’ve been the victim of both Chinese and American IP theft with my startup as well except I had issues with Apple, not Amazon. It is a sign of your success. Perhaps start using words like “genuine”, “original” of “not a cheap knockoff” in your product descriptions. Unfortunately, IP theft is a big deal and we can’t really touch China.')
