No thanks. Keep --help short and concise and then have a separate man page with all the details. Don&#x27;t just ignore standards and conventions because not all operating system agree on them.<p>The languages of the the argument parsing libraries listed (Go, Node, Python, Ruby) is also kinda suspect when many such tools are written in C.<p>&gt; Use symbols and emoji where it makes things clearer.<p>Eww. And the example is pretty bad too with a number of meaningless icons.<p>&gt; By default, don’t output information that’s only understandable by the creators of the software.<p>Except people with post the default output if they are having problems and having all useful information here saves having to ask for it. Also, don&#x27;t underestimate your user&#x27;s abitlity to understand stuff.<p>&gt; Use a pager (e.g. less) if you are outputting a lot of text.<p>&gt; A good sensible set of options to use for less<p>Stop right there. If you going to automatically use a pager, at least use the preferred one the user has specified in their environment. $PAGER is even mentioned later in the environment variable section.')
