The two sides are living in completely different realities. There can be no discussion between them when the claim is &quot;My side is truthful and your side is full of lies.&quot;<p>Anyone making the claim that his side is the side of truth and justice and the other side is the one of delusions and falsehoods is not looking for healing or reconciliation. He is in search of either total domination of the other side, or divorce, or worse.<p>The question is: do you think your side will be able to totally dominate the other side? Is it possible to totally dominate 75 million Americans who view your domination as something evil to be opposed, possibly violently?<p>It seems you&#x27;re betting it is, and your side will pull it off.<p>Though I wonder: what is this confidence based upon?<p>Your side controls the institutions and the cities. What happens when the people outside the cities simply stop listening to what the cities and the institutions say? What happens when the media and academies and federal government can say whatever they like, but everyone outside the metropolises simply starts to ignore them and make their own rules?<p>This is the real problem with Balkanization: once the dialogue breaks down, everything else starts to break down after it.')
