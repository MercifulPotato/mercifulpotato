Every single line of code we&#x27;ve written is open source, since day one. There are no periodic \ncode dumps, no prototyping in private, no open core with paid extensions. We accept patches from the public. Our company is 100% bona-fide open source.<p>We&#x27;ve been profitable for 2 years, and our profit margin continues to grow. We published our Q3 financial report last week:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcehut.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020-11-11-sourcehut-q3-2020-financial-report&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcehut.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020-11-11-sourcehut-q3-2020-fina...</a><p>This doesn&#x27;t include our part-time consulting arm, which is also 100% open source and generates similar revenue.<p>It&#x27;s still early, and we&#x27;re still small. We did not take on any outside investments, either. But the model works. You CAN make money in open source.')
