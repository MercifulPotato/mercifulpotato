Some work should be put into making it way more intuitive. Having to remember what every flag means (which is different in every app!) is not intuitive at all.<p>By default there should be some sort of intelisense auto-complete which can also provide guidance on what on earth all the flags mean, and maybe eventually it could tell you what it expects to do before you run the command. For most users otherwise it ends up being &quot;paste in this command you googled with a load of random flags you don&#x27;t understand and won&#x27;t remember&quot;')
