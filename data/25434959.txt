The only two people on that corner are the cameraman and the reporter, and given their equipment and press-badges, it is very obvious that they&#x27;re media. (Not &quot;little blogger on random website&quot;. Its obvious that they are big-media, ABC 7 to be specific).<p>-----------<p>It should be noted that Trump was clearing the area to give a press briefing. The press belonged there, if only to cover the President&#x27;s new announcement in a few minutes.<p>The protesters had a right to be there too (but I realize this is a harder point to sell to conservatives and am willing to keep this as an aside). But it was clear that Trump chose to clear this particular group of protesters as an intimidation factor. There was no need for Trump to give a press briefing in this location (when he was already giving a briefing from the White House). Trump knew there were protesters here and wanted to physically intimidate them with a police clearing.')
