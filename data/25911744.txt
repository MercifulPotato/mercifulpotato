I&#x27;m a long time-user (a decade at least) and according to the site &quot;Your message stats: 11,298 forwarded, 27,539 eaten. You have 172 spamgourmet address(es).&quot; I haven&#x27;t had too many problems with the service, mainly the problems are with third-parties that block the spamgourmet.com domain but there are alternate, more obscure domain names that can be used (such as @xoxy.net IIRC).<p>There are plusses and minuses to SG, but it&#x27;s free as in beer and if your Perl and ops chops are in good shape the code is available for self-hosting. The hosted service does not support bringing your own domain but has other nifty features that might appeal to HN power users. Worth a look if you&#x27;re in the market for this kind of thing.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spamgourmet.com&#x2F;index.pl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spamgourmet.com&#x2F;index.pl</a>')
