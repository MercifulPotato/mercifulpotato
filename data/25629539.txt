I&#x27;ve definitely been there, too.<p>Aside from all the good and valid comments about reducing scope and shipping an MVP, I&#x27;d like to raise another point which may be controversial (or even wrong), but still worth raising:<p>Would it have been different if you had used Rails? A few of the problems you mention (rich text editing, validation, and to some extend, pdf exports) are very easily solved in Rails. Take rich text editing: It&#x27;s literally a couple minutes to use ActionText. Or validations &#x2F; forms, there&#x27;s really not much work to do. PDF exports are also not too hard via wicked_pdf [1] if you&#x27;re okay with fixing some formatting quirks later on.<p>I&#x27;ve seen both worlds by writing tons of JS &#x2F; React code myself, and at that time (2016-2018) those problems were almost an order of magnitude more time-costly to implement in SPAs. I remember react-router.. not great memories.<p>Of course, all the points reducing MVP scope still hold, but.. if you could have had all those features (nearly) for free, would you be at another stage now? Who knows.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mileszs&#x2F;wicked_pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mileszs&#x2F;wicked_pdf</a>')
