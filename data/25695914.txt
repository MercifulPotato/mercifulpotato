For instance, if I average 95, 95, and 95, then the average is 95. If I average 94, 94, 94, 95, 95, and 95 and the average is 94.5, does that mean the other half is stupid? Of course not, which is why people who keep saying this over and over are below average. You can tell because they aren&#x27;t saying anything important.')
