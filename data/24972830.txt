Traditional ci hygiene requires that the build runs clean on the developer machine before publishing a change.  But once the build time crosses 10 minutes, people resent waiting and start to run test subsets, and count on the ci server to catch breakage.  Once that becomes normal, breakage is inevitable.  And if commit tempo is higher than a developer can finish a test-run, then it is impossible.  Solutions include patch queues, pr builds, etc. but those are all more complicated than a single stream on head.')
