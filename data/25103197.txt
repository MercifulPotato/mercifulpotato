I was in senior year of high school and one of the colleges I was applying to had a “sleeping bag weekend” where you could sign up to stay overnight with a random CS freshman in the dorms and stroll the campus.<p>I saw someone working on their homework and their terminal had <i>colored text</i> and it blew my mind (I had only ever seen cmd.exe using black and white with that ugly font).<p>The summer between senior year of high school and starting college I installed Ubuntu and googled that program called “vim” that freshman had demoed to me. From there it was just like you say: vimtutor and reading :help pages, and now almost 10 years later I can’t imagine trading Vim for anything.')
