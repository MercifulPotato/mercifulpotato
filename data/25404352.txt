There are things on LinkedIn and Indeed that look good but are just re-routes to knock-off job boards with names like Nevoo and IFindJobForYou, and these are links <i>from</i> what are supposed to be the big names in job searching. Those redirects never take me to the job position, and when I go to look up the company and see if the posting is on their careers page, it usually isn&#x27;t. Other people on LinkedIn have noticed this but the moderator response at LinkedIn says that these redirects are legitimate. The fix is &quot;easy&quot; but the politics to get it to happen is hard, good luck with this one.<p>One thing that&#x27;s caused me a lot of trouble is that people (HR, engineering) don&#x27;t actually read my resume because they have to deal with so many, even after I&#x27;ve gone through the process of making it as easy to read as possible, including constant revisions and peer reviews. They&#x27;ll look at my resume when I submit for a junior position despite having balanced and sufficient experience and just throw my resume in the trash because I don&#x27;t know one piece of tech on their laundry list or I&#x27;m somehow overqualified despite fitting the position&#x27;s experience range, aka I get an email saying that while my credentials were impressive, they&#x27;ve selected another candidate. However, some companies will deny me that junior position and somehow think I&#x27;m qualified for a senior developer role. These are definitely people problems: what assumptions are being made here that I&#x27;m somehow not qualified for a more junior role but somehow qualified for a FAR more senior role? Who&#x27;s making these assumptions? Another people problem.<p>Interviews are a mixed bag. For SDET positions, I&#x27;ve had good interviews since they&#x27;re more on the behavioral side where the interviewers want you to talk about your experiences with software development, and their technical questions are mainly shibboleth tests to ensure you didn&#x27;t lie your way through HR. I&#x27;ve only had one bad SDET&#x2F;QA interview, and it was for a fintech company trying to test me as a senior software engineer when the job would be manual testing and DevOps-like work because the guy giving the interview was a Caltech graduate ubermensch who probably hasn&#x27;t been aware of other people&#x27;s emotions and backgrounds for many years because he&#x27;s been in &quot;startup mode&quot; or whatever. Again, a people problem, but I don&#x27;t think that this one is even solvable.<p>Software dev interviews are honestly far worse: I&#x27;ve had automated code screens where the platform didn&#x27;t support modern language constructs and made simple tasks needlessly complex and I&#x27;m tired of having to play Russian Roulette with interview questions as to whether they&#x27;re Leetcode Mediums or obtuse math-derivative questions. I rarely get to talk to engineers, and when I do, they mostly just say &quot;here&#x27;s your question good luck&quot; and vanish.<p>I had one positive software dev interview with Bloomberg, where it was more traditional and the dev was actually trying to follow my thought process as I solved a problem. This might not seem like it&#x27;s a people problem, but it is: your Leetcode Mediums and your Bachelor&#x27;s in CS are useless if you&#x27;re not going to engage with me and gauge my competency in some meaningful way. If software developers are so overloaded by work, going through resumes, and coming up with non-asinine questions, this looks like a great people problem to solve: introduce a sales engineer-like team that can have its members divided between various engineering teams that can handle non-managerial but people-focused tasks.<p>I could write about the oddities and various people-based quirks of this process further, but I&#x27;m probably getting near the character limit. Really hope that you&#x27;re not trying to make <i>yet another</i> website, OP.')
