I don&#x27;t trust Google to care about backwards compatibility and keep on supporting Webp v1 forever, I would expect them to drop it before even dropping jpeg or png. Especially in this case, where it mostly serves Google and other big web corporations, and not regular users.<p>Mozilla always had the stance that they wouldn&#x27;t just add support for technology that might be just a passer-by technology. I think that was the right choice and I think it is a shame they added support for webp recently.<p>I can even imagine this to be market practice, where they add new stuff, where Apple and Mozilla and newcomers have to chase Google&#x27;s fad of the day, while Google has enormous resources for Chrome. You can call me paranoid, I probably am :)<p>Anyway, if Google Chrome ditches Webp v1 in the next 10 years, I will not be that guy to say &quot;Told you so!&quot;, but I will think it for sure.')
