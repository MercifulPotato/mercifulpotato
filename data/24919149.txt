I have an Indian passport and am in an EU country on a work visa for &lt; 6 months and thus don&#x27;t get a residence permit card. Getting a phone number and a bank account were insanely difficult, as no one wants to accept an Indian passport&#x2F;visa as proof of identity. I ended up getting a (probably illegal?) sim card from a corner store, which required no identification. That makes me wonder how effective these regulations are.<p>As for immigration, applying for visas for every single thing is not fun at all. Canada gave me a 4 year visa even though my degree is supposed to take 4.5 years, meaning I had to collect all documents again, pay the high fee, and risk getting rejected and not be able to finish my degree for just one semester. The application did not get processed for months after that because the government wanted me to provide biometrics at a government run facility, which was obviously closed because of the pandemic(they closed 1 day before I had an appointment booked). It ended up being processed after my original visa expired, which was not a very enjoyable time.<p>US internship visas have restrictions involved saying that I can not go back to the US for full time work without going back to my home country for 2 years. The problem here is I have nowhere to go in my home country anymore.<p>In the past I&#x27;ve had to withdraw applications for internships in the UK&#x2F;EU as they required travel for onsite interviews and my visa didn&#x27;t come through on time. (Bigger companies so they only had a couple of options for onsite days). At least the companies were nice enough to reimburse the visa fees as they are hundreds of dollars for every single visa.<p>Making plans to go travelling with friends(before the pandemic) was always difficult as I was the only one would have to obtain a visa and so needed atleast a month of lead up time. Even then it&#x27;s not guaranteed to come on time so the entire trip would have to be cancelled.<p>Even at the airport, I have been almost refused boarding multiple times despite having all the right documents, because systems don&#x27;t work perfectly. Usually this is fixed by talking to a supervisor or someone else with more authority, in a couple of cases they called the country&#x27;s border police to see if I should be let in.')
