It was to be the result of a massive government&#x2F;industry research project in Japan during the 1980s. It aimed to create an &quot;epoch-making computer&quot; with supercomputer-like performance and to provide a platform for future developments in artificial intelligence. </i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fifth_generation_computer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fifth_generation_computer</a><p>Edit: Oh, I see. GHC was a precursor of the logic programming language ultimately adopted as the FGC&#x27;s core language:<p><i>Shapiro&#x27;s work on Concurrent Prolog inspired a change in the direction of the FGCS from focusing on parallel implementation of Prolog to the focus on concurrent logic programming as the software foundation for the project. It also inspired the concurrent logic programming language Guarded Horn Clauses (GHC) by Ueda, which was the basis of KL1, the programming language that was finally designed and implemented by the FGCS project as its core programming language.</i><p>(Same source as above)<p>Edit 2: Another hint is in the name of the publication this appeared in: *Programming of Future Generation Computers*. A few publications from that time had titles like &quot;New Generation Computing&quot; etc. and the project was launched and managed by the &quot;Institute for New Generation Computer Technology&quot;. So basically everything with &quot;new generation&quot; or &quot;future generation&quot; etc. in its title from that time is likely to have been part of the FGCS project.<p>This is a brilliant little piece of logic programming history - thnanks for posting!')
