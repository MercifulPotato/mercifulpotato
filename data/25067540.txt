I wonder if that option will now be removed. In that case, this would be the time to download and backup all your purchased music.\nMaybe it&#x27;s better to do it on a proper computer too, since Google says &quot;Signing out of your account will remove downloaded music from your device.&quot;, although that might only apply to subscription tracks on mobile - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s completely clear.
