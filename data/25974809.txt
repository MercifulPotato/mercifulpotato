Based on what you&#x27;ve said it does not sound to me, a third party reader, that this advantage is bearing any fruit.<p>This is talking in the abstract of course. If one were in an oppressive authoritarian regime bent on murdering you, one would be both sad and right, but one should also be mad too. So there must exist correct yet sad understandings of the world. But surely if you see people in the exact same situation as you, and you think them fools for being happy. That sounds wrong? Are they missing an immediate danger which your sadness is allowing you to take advantage of or escape?<p>How can an advantage exist which does not lead to action but rather self-harming inaction?')
