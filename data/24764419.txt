Software developers (especially ones have the skills to work for facebook) can work literally anywhere.  Lots of them start their own companies.  There&#x27;s simply no excuse for contributing to the success of companies whose values and actions you can&#x27;t personally endorse and stand behind.<p>Of course I&#x27;m not gonna resent some dude working at McDonalds for contributing to the obesity epidemic, but software developers just don&#x27;t have any excuse.')
