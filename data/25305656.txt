The default fonts (on Windows) were beautifully manually hinted to give a really crisp results without font smoothing.<p>I used to work at MS, and a lot of people don&#x27;t realize exactly how much time, money, and love is put into fonts there.<p>When my team ordered custom fonts, I personally spent a <i>lot</i> of time going over each character pixel by pixel, in combination with many other characters, to make sure everything was perfect. I know other members on my team did the same. It wasn&#x27;t some sort of mandate, it was just some sort of institutional knowledge, or maybe pride, that Microsoft was paying for custom fonts for our project and we were going to make well sure and good that what we delivered to customers was perfect.<p>I know there is a holy-war between people who like MacOS&#x27;s font rendering and people who like Microsoft&#x27;s font rendering, but I hope everyone can respect the amount of pride that both companies put into their work.')
