Before then, MJ was around and used, it is a plant and good pain killer that you can grow yourself. And Nixon stated that is why he was doing it in the White House tapes. For 50 years the WoD was used to justify invading other countries and setting up coups and all that has lead to our current issue with powerful militarized Narco gangs and all the people trying to get asylum in the US. So the GOP created a war to go after people of color and now are using terrible results of their actions to further justify why the GOP should stay in power. And the ignorant voters who don&#x27;t study any history eat that up. What has happened is that enough people have seen through the rhetoric and failed policies and see that the laws have to change to support the evidence.')
