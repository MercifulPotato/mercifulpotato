We’ve specified a prior distribution for the parameter, based on prior evidence, our subjective beliefs about the value of the parameter, or perhaps we used a default ‘non-informative’ prior built into our software package.<p>At first blush the difference is that the Bayesian is using more information. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, if Bayes theorem and its progeny give us useful tools for incorporating that information in our analyses, so much the better.')
