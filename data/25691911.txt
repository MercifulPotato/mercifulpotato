I came to the US in 2000. Back then politics were already bad but now the message is pretty much &quot;The other guys are evil&quot;, &quot;anti-american&quot;, &quot;racists&quot;, &quot;socialist&quot; or whatever. all messaging is designed to put up hard barriers between people that can&#x27;t be overcome. Social networks certainly amplify things but in the end we need more discipline from political leadership to not constantly incite anger in the population.<p>With companies censoring more and more information it&#x27;s pretty much guaranteed that they will also censor information that&#x27;s inconvenient to them. The internet should be open and stay open.')
