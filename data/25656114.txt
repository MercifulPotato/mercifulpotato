I remember trying to input the massive list of hex for Tim Follin&#x27;s 3 channel sound routine that I somehow managed to mistype a part of <i>AND</i> mistype the checksum so that it validated!  Cue instant crash every time and disassembling was beyond me at that point.<p>In the 90s I got an Amiga and discovered the demoscene (basically showing off as mentioned in another comment).<p>Fast forward another decade and bored at my parents after finishing Uni I dragged my Speccy out of storage and managed to get the Tim Follin music routine running!  And found an assembler and did some Z80 assembler demo effects for the lulz.<p>As you said: good times.')
