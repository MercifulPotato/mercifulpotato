Premise- 1st 15 minute hook:\nMoney &amp; image, vs. family. Two philosophy fights: Truth vs. lie. Establishes the motivations of main characters in beginning.<p>2. Characters- Persona representations of real world roles were well researched:<p>The father who risks family stability&#x2F;corporate unhappiness to pursue a startup, the orphan who became angel&#x2F;VC investor, rich&#x2F;connected vs. poor&#x2F;bootstrap founder, the math genius AI founder, the looked-down high schooler&#x2F;univ. dropout CEO, trend-spotting quality of a CEO, the perpetual deceived contract worker in a corporation due to lack of qualifications, the stuck-up ivy-league, the underdog coders vs MIT engineers, the startup accelerator (even has Y combinator colors)<p>3. Jargon- Series is nice enough to explain the common terms for viewers non-technically (if they chose to learn): cold-call, investment round, angel, keyman, hackathon, bug, due diligence, startup&#x2F;friends&#x2F;family analogy, machine learning, AI, etc. Some not explained: burn-rate, conversion rate, ANN, loss function, ransomware...<p>4. Hyped elements- also common on startup world:\n“Follow your dreams”, “change the world”, anyone can try without education&#x2F;skills mentality. Possible but not the norm, low probability')
