In case it wasn&#x27;t clear, the buying one disk at a time aspect is important, because storage needs increase steadily over time, not all at once, so it makes financial sense to buy a higher capacity drive and replace a lower capacity one over a longer period of time, instead of replacing all drives at once and then have most of the extra storage sit there unused.')
