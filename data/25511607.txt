Item(by='uberman', descendants=None, kids=[25512550], score=None, time=1608673290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25510664, text='Yes, sorry my first edit suggested you were the author, but I tried to correct that. Also, while I suspect this is political and potentially about Fauci, that is not clear to me from the one post I read.<p>I still have to question what their interpretation of &quot;analysis&quot; is. If experts are not to be trusted as sources, then where exactly is the author obtaining their &quot;analysis&quot;? Are they suggesting that the way they live their life is by conducting primary research?<p>The only interpretation I see is that the author has a set of sources they trust that produce &quot;analysis&quot; that the author sees as reliable. Their opponent in the argument has exactly the same same thing but from sources that the author does not trust. That certainly is a pickle.<p>Of course, the author would likely see me as &quot;believing in dangerous quackery&quot; but I am dumbfounded.<p>Does the author want me to believe that they consult raw weather station data before deciding to take an umbrella? Since the raw weather station data comes from expert sources can it even be trusted?<p>The reality I suspect is that the author would say:<p><i>I know a guy who forecasts the weather and I trust him because he published some numbers from someplace along with his analysis. Numbers I can&#x27;t really understand and no expert can be relied on to interpret but for some reason, this guy and his numbers have me convinced I am well grounded.<p>Further, I would never trust that National Weather Service, those hacks use experts, charts, graphics, and text and I can&#x27;t be sure they are not fabricating the weather unless I see raw numbers that again I can&#x27;t trust as being correct nor interpret and no one other than &quot;my guy&quot; can either.</i>')
