In the same way heat pumps can’t drive a larger temperature gradient past a point (see AC in the Arizona summer). The 35 or 60% efficiency of the first phase can’t simply be stacked. If you don’t have an industry that uses heat directly, on site (cogeneration), that’s simply the cost of extraction.')
