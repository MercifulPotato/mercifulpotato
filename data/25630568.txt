Cool tech, I suppose, but time wasters. Your release process should be scp-ing and extracting a zip file on the prod machine, or git checkout the files.<p>Ok, let&#x27;s accept that K8s is overkill most of the times. But containerization and CI&#x2F;CD? If you&#x27;ve some experience with it you know it&#x27;s something that takes little time and money to set up (e.g. GitLab CI) and you get tons of benefits - you don&#x27;t need to get super fancy either.<p>To me it sounds like the time waster would be doing what you describe, specially because it&#x27;s so easy to mess it up after you do it a bunch of times on a single day. I used to do that when I started with PHP several years ago (replace scp-ing with FTP and git with cvs or svn) but IMHO it&#x27;s not worth it once you deploy your product live.')
