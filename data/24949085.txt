In Uni, there was a professor who had a very pronounced limp. Whenever I saw him around, it was the only thing about him I&#x27;d notice.<p>In the 3rd year, we had a class with him. After the second lecture, I had so gotten accustomed to him that if you had asked me who the professor with the limp was, I would have honestly replied that I didn&#x27;t know any professors like that. The fact that I had gotten to talk to him and see him teachn so I knew more about him than justn &quot;has a limp&quot; probably played a part.<p>I guess I have no point to make with this anecdote, take from it what you will.')
