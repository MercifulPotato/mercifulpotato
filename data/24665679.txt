It&#x27;s death by a thousand cuts, from engineers and management who have no respect for the user. Off the top of my head, within the past week, I&#x27;ve had:<p>* The wifi slows down to &lt;1mbps every morning. Restarting wifi fixes this.\n* The entire bixby button. It can finally be remapped, but occasional double taps (like using volume in the dark) will still open it.\n* The weather &#x27;Current temperature&#x27; widget updates every two days. Current temperature. Current. Two days.\n* Random notifications to sign up for Samsung services that I don&#x27;t want. You cannot swipe them away. You have to open the app and decline their EULA to get rid of it.\n* Disappearing notifications\n* Needing to reboot every week, or getting slowdowns\n* Only two years of updates (an entire android problem)<p>Obviously all of these problems can be fixed, and many aren&#x27;t exclusive to samsung, but dealing with all of them continuously is just grating. I had been planning to buy a Samsung Frame TV before I heard all this stuff about their ads.')
