Japanese anime fans tend to follow what is currently popular, it is a kind of disposable pop culture for the most part. You see this also with youtube vaporwave artists bringing back Japanese 80s city pop that no one remembers in Japan or if they do they just say “wow that song is so old”. I think the US in recent times has much bigger culture of curating classic pop culture.')
