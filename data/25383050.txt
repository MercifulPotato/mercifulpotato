It&#x27;s transparency in the process, data collection and data that makes for a reliable system.  Masking personal data to the point that the gov&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t even know what the data represents sounds stupid.<p>I mean, your personal doctor collects all this data and stores it.  Why would you not do the same with clinical trial data?  It&#x27;s medical treatment, albeit, experimental medical treatment.<p>And you think the Canadian healthcare system is &quot;so fucked up it&#x27;s not funny&quot;?  Or did you just assume I&#x27;m American?')
