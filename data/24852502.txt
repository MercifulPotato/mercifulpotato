The US has voting directly for the head of state, whereas Canada&#x27;s head of state is of course the Queen, but the PM is selected incidentally to the vote via parliamentary procedure.<p>The Canadian system has you pick your local representative for your riding (MP) and the party with the most MPs, traditionallyâ„¢, gets to make their leader the Prime Minister. The popular vote is irrelevant because the popular vote is not how Canadian elections are &#x27;scored.&#x27; At all, really. Each race is a race for your specific representative. That it&#x27;s correlated with the PM-ship is ancillary, since even a plurality of seats doesn&#x27;t guarantee your party ends up picking the PM. A coalition of two smaller parties can band together and unseat a plurality party for the PM role. A Conservative-NDP coalition (haha) could have installed Scheer as PM after the last selection. A Conservative-Bloc coalition could have done so too. And a Liberal-NDP coalition could have installed Trudeau as a <i>majority</i> leader in the last election.<p>In the US, they have FPTP voting specifically for their head  of state, which is where the rub lies. You have a poll for who should be in charge, but you weight the votes differently depending on which state those voters happen to reside in, and throw some of them away (via FPTP). This is intentional, to ensure that rural states have outsize representation. A good idea? Maybe not, but it&#x27;s no mistake.<p>[edit] Re: the BQ, they&#x27;ve started campaigning not on separatism but on social issues, it&#x27;s cool to see honestly.')
