Guix reinstalls (and take forever doing it).</i><p>Wait, what?  The Guix installer script also stops if it detects an existing installation, and has done so since the initial commit:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.savannah.gnu.org&#x2F;cgit&#x2F;guix.git&#x2F;tree&#x2F;etc&#x2F;guix-install.sh#n297" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.savannah.gnu.org&#x2F;cgit&#x2F;guix.git&#x2F;tree&#x2F;etc&#x2F;guix-ins...</a><p>&gt; <i>You also need to make sure you import keys when installing Guix because security.</i><p>If you are complaining that the installer verifies the GPG signature of a file it downloaded from the internet, I don&#x27;t know what to say. :-)<p>&gt; <i>Doing any package related thing will tell you about a failure to install locale.</i><p>This can happen when your installed locales are from a different glibc than what the guix-daemon was built with.  Upgrading and restarting the daemon will solve it.<p>That said, I think the daemon recently got smarter about it.<p>&gt; <i>Guix should lean into this one major strength and put out an Emacs-centered heavily opinionated installer image that uses EXWM for its window manager.</i><p>The system installer disk image does give you an option to create an EXWM system (as well as GNOME, Xfce, etc).')
