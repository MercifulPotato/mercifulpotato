Fix your fucking interfaces.&quot;<p>If one of the richest companies on the planet can&#x27;t pay to hire good designers, and just pay to buyout a whole ecosystem (ie what they did with AMP), then no one can.<p>Rather, I think your points aside, it&#x27;s a matter of executive direction and attention. Google executives doesn&#x27;t give a damn about good UI. They have all the money in the world, but won&#x27;t spend it on proper improvements to UI and product interfaces.<p>You can argue until your face is blue that the people at Google are great, very talented, but unfortunately ... if the execs don&#x27;t buy into it all these talented designers&#x2F;engineers are just twiddling their thumbs and making design mocks that will never see the light of day.<p>Or as the saying goes: have their product cancelled once they make it a good product.')
