They stuck with rear wheel drive, and used fantastic inline 6 engines until CAFE regulations pretty much made them unfeasible.  They lost me and become a marketing company when the model names started being what i would call “un-german”.   With the model, you used to know what you got.   325t? 3 series, 2.5l displacement, has a turbo.  540ci? 5 series, 4.0l, coupe.   Sometimes in 2007-2011 timeframe, the number no longer corresponded to what the vehicle was.  330 was a 2.0l turbo, 335 was a 3.0l turbo... they just couldn&#x27;t put smaller numbers on the model.   Thats marketing, thats not what I want in my very precise driving machine. Its been a downhill slide ever since. But thats what the masses want and buy... so whatever. Also they dont make a manual M5 anymore, ultimate driving machine my ass.  Their maintenance has always been a gate-kept rip off though.')
