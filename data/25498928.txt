I practice stalking techniques to get closer (which has a much better cost&#x2F;reward ratio to buying bigger lenses) but if you can fill the frame with a bird you can get awesome shots that just aren&#x27;t possible otherwise. Currently I&#x27;m shooting at 600mm, and I definitely want a teleconverter to get up to ~800mm. After that the prices get truly insane so I think I&#x27;ll just have to find some bigger birds at that point.')
