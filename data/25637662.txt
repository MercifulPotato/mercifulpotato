When I complained that the clicks i got weren&#x27;t real people, they blamed the landing page. I was advertising to 3 keywords &quot;free astrophotography data&quot; and the landing page was 0 ads, 0 popups and a link to free data to download.<p>They charged me for the ads, I complained to credit card company and did a charge back and they never followed through...<p>in fact, they offered me more credit to try advertising more.<p>For the life of me, I&#x27;m not sure how you can pay for 1,000 clicks to a very specific keyword and not have a single person download anything. The download was also valid for any user type.  If you were on a mobile device, it showcased data that you could see on your mobile phone vs requiring a tool to download XISF or FITS data - it allowed you to download the high res image(s) in native iOS&#x2F;Android formats.<p>Beyond the improbability of landing page being junk, Google analytics didn&#x27;t fire for the majority of the traffic and twitters response was &quot;the landing page may be too slow&quot;<p>the landing page was &lt; 1 second  load times even within the twitter iframe nonsense.<p>anywhoo... the same ads on facebook, bing and google all had 75% click through and downloads but there were still a ton of clicks that had no analytics, no web time, didn&#x27;t load anything in web analytics that we got charged for too...<p>the whole thing seems like a scam')
