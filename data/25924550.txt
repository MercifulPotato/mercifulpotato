In the 1960s and 1970s left wing militias and terrorism was a pretty common thing. A great example of this is the Weather Underground, who ended up bombing a lot of people. Whether or not you’d call these groups “militias” or “terrorist groups” probably depends on who you ask, but they certainly were armed.<p>It’s gotten a bit mixed up lately, but historically left wing militias made more sense than right wing militias. Left wing groups are usually in opposition to this form of government and therefore have a lot of things they’d like to change with force if necessary. Historically right wing groups usually wish to preserve (to whit, <i>conserve</i>) things as is, which usually doesn’t require militias per se. Anti-government right wing militias are historically speaking, kind of weird, even though they’re the norm since Ruby Ridge or so.')
