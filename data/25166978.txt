Nope! Dead on arrival. In 2020, Slack or Teams or anything similar is literally useless without a mobile app.<p>Feature matrix says animated emojis will arrive &quot;never.&quot; lol!<p>I remember the days of native chat clients like Skype and AIM. I remember how Linux and Mac platforms were basically half-clients compared to Windows. It sucked.<p>Electron applications like Slack and Spotify work everywhere, exactly the same. And if you think about it, that&#x27;s why something like chat and music apps would prioritize ease of cross-platform deployment over perfect efficiency. They&#x27;re not particularly demanding, and they are most valuable to <i>people</i> when they&#x27;re ubiquitous. If Spotify isn&#x27;t in every device I own it loses a great amount of value.<p>Nobody&#x27;s sitting at their Activity Monitor staring at the RAM usage of Slack or Teams. In reality, performance is <i>fine.</i> It&#x27;s just chat.<p>(Interestingly enough, I&#x27;ve never found a music application that skips tracks more quickly than Spotify, even for locally-stored music. It&#x27;s just instant with no gaps.)')
