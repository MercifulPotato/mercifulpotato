However, there&#x27;s nothing stopping the US (or any other government) from restricting both the collection of such data and&#x2F;or government use of that collected data.<p>What&#x27;s apparently missing is the political will.  Which points to the larger problem in the US -- sewers of filthy lucre flowing through the political system.<p>If you get rid of the necessity for all that money with strict public funding of elections, along with resources to allow all citizens to express themselves <i>on an equal footing</i> with everyone else, we&#x27;re more likely to get a government focused on the needs of constituents rather than the desires of big money contributors.')
