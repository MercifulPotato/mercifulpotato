But judging from the other comments, I&#x27;m the only one with that assessment.<p>I&#x27;m my opinion, the secret sauce that makes Intel dominate certain industries is software. And it has been for some years already.<p>If you need really fast mathematical number crunching, e.g. high frequency trading or realtime audio filtering, then you need MKL, the Intel math kernel library.<p>If you want to further reduce latency with parallelism, you need TBB, the Intel thread building blocks.<p>Raytracing? Intel embree.<p>Once you are locked in that deeply, the raw Intel vs AMD performance becomes meaningless. You only care about how fast the Intel libraries run<p>So a CEO with experience building high performance low level software seems like an amazing fit.<p>Edit: And I almost forgot, the Intel compiler used in pretty every PC game to speed up physics. Plus some people have seen success replacing GPUs with icc+avx for huge deployment cost savings in AI.')
