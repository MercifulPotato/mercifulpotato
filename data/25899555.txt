Wake up and move on. I live my life knowing the baseline is coffee maker at macdonalds, and I&#x27;m fine with it. They can recruit people like your dad, no one has a life right to be rich and successful and it&#x27;s fine to fall down and start again. My dad is rich enough, has a doctorate and a small business, and I spent my entire teenage years decoupling from my parents to be fully independent and ready to weather any storm. Sometimes it means finding girlfriends to share rent, having a weekend job, moving to a smaller city where university is less prestigious but nearly free, etc. When I realised taxes would take most of a meager salary in France with barely any tangible benefit, I burnt half my life savings (3 years of full time job at 2000 euros per month) emigrating to a tax-free jurisdiction...<p>When did this event happen to you ? When you were too young to be already split from them ? I really hope you wake up, find a stupid job, cut all debt that are not legally mandatory, and bounce back. There&#x27;s no dirty job, nothing is beneath you and being independent is the only objective you should have. Having this attitude, btw, is 90% of whatever job interview you&#x27;ll have to do.')
