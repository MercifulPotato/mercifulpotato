Each tile has a value and a growth function.  Each player can select a tile and make a move and accumulate the value of tiles they own, or split the difference with an opponent to try and claim a tile.  To knock a player out, claim their home tile and be rewarded with ownership of all their assets.  To win, be the last player standing.<p>I played a square-tile version of this game somewhere and can&#x27;t find it anymore, so I figured I&#x27;d build it for myself.')
