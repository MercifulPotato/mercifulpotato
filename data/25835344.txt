There is a confusion between <i>incremental</i> torque, which does get reduced (as correctly noted in the above) but only because the <i>increments</i> get reduced, and <i>stall</i> torque or <i>holding</i> torque, which in almost all cases do not. The latter are the ones that people generally care about, but because they read about a reduced <i>incremental</i> torque, they get the misconception microstepping creates some torque compromise.<p>But a full-stepping motor <i>also</i> has bad incremental torque for small displacements; by disabling microstepping you&#x27;re just forfeiting the option to command them.<p>If anything, microstepping lets you run even closer to the motor&#x27;s torque envelope, because you&#x27;re less likely to induce a dynamic stall by either exciting a resonance or letting the stator&#x27;s magnetic field get too far away from the rotor angle.')
