I feel sad for Aung San Suu Kyi and all freedom fighters who have sacrificed their whole life and family to better Myanmar.<p>My personal experience is Myanmar is a wonderful country full of a wonderful people, and vibrant culture, despite living in the shadow of ethnic violence and a brutal military regime.<p>It’s hard to say how this will play out. For many here it’s a mystery why military did this, as they already had power over state business, 25% military appointed legislature, control of courts, etc. and the benefit of hiding behind fake democracy to get foreign investment. So people are confused as to what their motive is, as they already had the best of both worlds.')
