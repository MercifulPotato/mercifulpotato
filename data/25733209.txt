If we assume the defendant is guilty, why should he be allowed to get off with a sentence that&#x27;s 29 years lower than what it should be? If we assume that the defendant is not guilty, is it fair to force him to pick between a fair trial and potential 30 years of prison or 6 months without trial, given that even someone that&#x27;s not guilty would most likely take the deal and this perverts the course of justice by essentially jailing people based on mere allegations without a trial?')
