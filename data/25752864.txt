Specifically, NTSC compliant video. Since it was analog, there were severe consequences of color choices. Red was just a solid NO. On an 8-bit 0-255 scale, white was limited to 235, and black was limited to 16. The reasons for this are beyond the scope of this chat, but that limited range has still stuck with me. I never use #000 or #fff and opt for #111 to #eee for my limits. Seems like a decent enough compromise in web graphics.')
