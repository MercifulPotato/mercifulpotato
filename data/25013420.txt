A previous employer had replaced a bunch of ancient HP LaserJets (we&#x27;re talking LJ4s.. they were <i>old</i>) with these really nice Phasers. They printed fast, the output was gorgeous, and the drivers didn&#x27;t suck. The replacement was facility-wide, so there were around 20 of these things.<p>A month later, IT was tasked with re-replacing them for everyone but marketing overnight. Literally overnight, as in, we&#x27;re paying overtime for this. The boss didn&#x27;t know what was happening until a week later, but it was a fire drill of an intensity that you usually don&#x27;t see outside of a full outage.<p>It turned out that, while the Phasers do generate gorgeous hardcopy, the wax-like prints, can, with some effort, some skill, and a sharp knife, be popped off the page. A customer figured this out and had been effectively stealing service by way of paying invoices with numbers quite literally pulled off the page. The old Laserjets were placed back into service everywhere but the marketing group.')
