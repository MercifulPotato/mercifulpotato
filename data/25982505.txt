It&#x27;s clear their highest priority was to avoid admission that they were running out of money. They didn&#x27;t want to trigger a bank run or shake the confidence of their newly acquired users, so they tried to obscure the message as much as possible. As a result, the popular narrative assumed some sort of evil conspiracy theory.</i><p>What I don&#x27;t get is, why is the fear of a bank run relevant? It&#x27;s a startup and most people seems pretty YOLO about using it. I don&#x27;t know anything about investor sentiment so I&#x27;m genuinely curious - I thought the SIPC covers the FDIC equivalent for RH accounts that show any semblance of trading.<p>In this frothy market where a bunch of investors barely do due diligence, having collateral problems from <i>too many</i> customers joining too fast sounds like one of those rare &quot;great problems to have,&quot; as evidenced by the line of credit they just got extended. Even with the added risk, investors are probably lining up. I was surprised that the CEO didn&#x27;t go down that line of reasoning for the marketing effect.')
