I&#x27;m fairly senior, and once we&#x27;ve got past the brainstorming stage, the ideas have flowed forth, and the direction is, if not clear, then at least aspirational, I often get given the job of breaking ground.<p>Here&#x27;s how I think.<p>I model interaction between distinct parts. I have a mental model of how X fits with Y, how X can affect Y, and how Y can in turn affect X. I&#x27;m not doing it with just X and Y, I painstakingly build this mental model[1] over as much of the problem space as I can, and having done this for many years now, I can cover a fair amount of ground before the complexity gets beyond my ability to model. It <i>takes a while</i> to create this, and then when some middle-management type wanders along, taps me on the shoulder and disturbs the concentration, and it all comes crashing down around me, I am less than best-pleased. Bonus points if it&#x27;s just to &quot;touch base&quot; or &quot;remember we have a meeting in 2 hours time&quot;, or ... you get the picture.<p>Why do I expend this enormous mental effort to gain such a fragile and ephemeral state ? Because I can mentally throw boundary conditions at it and &quot;see&quot; how things will react. It&#x27;s how I deal with inherent complexity of large systems, and a couple of hours of mental effort can prevent me spending a week coding down a dead-end path. It&#x27;s happened often enough now that even my line management understand it&#x27;s worth the time - there&#x27;s been plenty-a-meeting where I go in and say &quot;yeah, I know we wanted to do &lt;insert X&gt; but I think there&#x27;s a problem when Y and Z come into play under conditions A, B and C. I think &lt;insert option gamma&gt; is a better route even though we didn&#x27;t think so at first&quot;.<p>Sometimes you really do just need to be able to be left alone and <i>think</i>. As someone who used to own the company before he sold it, and who&#x27;s done pitches to VC&#x27;s and other investors, I can quite categorically state that (for me), the slides, presentations, and client management is nowhere near the level of mental investment. Nowhere near.<p>Just my $0.02<p>---<p>[1] It&#x27;s not visual, I have aphantasia, it&#x27;s more firing-condition-based.')
