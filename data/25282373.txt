Item(by='nonbirithm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606946971, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25263868, text='&gt; In Matthew Walker’s book Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams, the neuroscientist is blunt: “The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life span.”<p>I find it sad that people are still quoting this book. Many claims in this book have been debunked online[0]. The misinformation may even cause people to get too much sleep causing different kinds of issues.<p>As for me, this has caused me to come back with an impression of &quot;we don&#x27;t really know why we sleep.&quot; I wish there was a definitive source of information on this as popular as this book, but which is actually reputable. Now I just end up doubting my sleep patterns, waking up naturally and still being left unsure why I feel tired.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guzey.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;why-we-sleep&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guzey.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;why-we-sleep&#x2F;</a>')
