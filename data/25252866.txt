Item(by='ajxs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606737214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25251494, text='&gt; It encourages shorter names...<p>I can&#x27;t remember my source right now, however I recall a study which indicated that having more descriptive variable names contributed more to the overall perception of code quality and legibility than nearly all other factors. If I recall correctly it was a study into code quality metrics commissioned by a large company. This strongly echoes my own experience. Naming variables like you&#x27;re paying by the letter contributes heavily to making the job of understanding the code on a line-by-line basis much more difficult for other people.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, when I write in C&#x2F;Ada&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Perl I stick to 80 columns. When I&#x27;m writing in OOP languages I usually limit myself to 90, and definitely less than 100.')
