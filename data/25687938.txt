But the issue is not about margin on some specific upsell, rather the question is about the entire margin on the whole business. Can Tesla make as good or better cars as competition for lower prices, and keep this advantage for a while? Very much possible. Will their advantage be 10x, like the current market cap suggests? In my opinion, <i>highly unlikely</i>.')
