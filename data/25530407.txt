Standard Stockfish is pretty bad at playing this variant for both white and black, and can be defeated by most competent humans. Great link at the bottom as well for anyone interested in chess programming (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chessprogramming.org&#x2F;Main_Page" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chessprogramming.org&#x2F;Main_Page</a>)')
