Jupyter does not appear to allow path prefix-based url schemes, so the above wont work. That means, you can use &quot;&#x2F;&quot; and the default-host, and you&#x27;re good for your first instance. But what about the next instance? Now you need two different domains somehow supported. Unclear how this works, because unclear whose &quot;problem&quot; it is. It isnt clearly an NGINX problem, or a Jupyter problem, or a k8s problem, but a problem nonetheless. NGINX docs on multiple distinct host based ingress is thinner than that for base usage cases.<p>I do appreciate your post, but I think my point is that solving 80% of the cases isn&#x27;t sufficient to make the case for adhoc k8s-usage-by-default on desktop. I&#x27;m sure I can make the above work (e.g. for group or Prod usage), but to make that effort worth it, there has to be a reason to do it. When I have an alternative of running two &quot;docker run&quot; commands for adhoc usage, i&#x27;m not sure if it is.')
