Does the fact that &quot;...blood samples from a cohort of more than 2,000 clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers...&quot; might seem to indicate a near-constant exposure to SARS-cov-2? That might increase the chance that the individual is re-exposed and thus his or her immune system has continual &quot;boosts&quot;. It seems noteworthy and something worth investigating. Would this apply to the population at large who do not risk continuous exposure?')
