Rights can be infringed regardless of whether the government or another entity is involved, if it&#x27;s done the right way (Edit). In this case, the constitution does not mention any right to broadband internet. It does guarentee rights under the first amendment which could be applicable here. The same way that corporations could restrict that right would likely be used by the government - contract law and a service agreement. This is similar to the government placing restrictions on people when they sign up for the military (Edit). The government also has a conflict of interest when it comes to things like surveillance.')
