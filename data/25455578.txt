But just the <i>concept</i> of programming is not something most people even grasp what it is.<p>I stumbled upon a nice way to show people what programming is the other day.  However, it requires the person who asked the question to be engaged.  If they only see programming as a trade of wizardry and a way to make money they may tune you out.<p>But my latest analogy for people who as &#x27;what is programming&#x27; is to put a rock on a table and say &#x27;teach this rock to go to the store write down every single step including getting off the table and opening the door&#x27;.  They may get a bit angry and I will tell them a computer is no smarter than a rock and it will do exactly what you tell it.  You need to be very explicit in what you tell it.  If something goes wrong like you end up in the bathroom instead, something is wrong in the instructions and you have to fix it the rock cant.  Now I am sure this analogy will fail on someone at some point.  But it has worked on a few people I tested it on.  My job is to pretend to be very stupid and then ask &#x27;what sort of instructions do I need&#x27;.<p>That is just the <i>simple</i> style of programming.  Add in callbacks, async, events, injection models, and SQL in there and people nope out.')
