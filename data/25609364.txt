The suspended tab just shows a Great Suspender icon, so it takes up ~0 RAM. I&#x27;ve whitelisted certain domains and sites (eg Messenger apps).<p>I know there are a ton of extensions aimed at this problem, including OneTab (which will collapse many tabs into a single page of links), but TGS works the best for my workflow.<p>I also use Session Buddy to periodically backup my current window&#x2F;tab state, which I find more reliable and powerful than the default tab-restore functionality.')
