He hasn&#x27;t really succeeded, in the &quot;popular&quot; sphere (although he&#x27;s still delaying the Biden transition from starting, which is bad for the entire country), but if the race had been a bit closer his claims of &quot;well overturn the results on a recount&quot; might ring truer, especially if news organizations weren&#x27;t able to call the races.<p>Also worth mentioning that, while I can&#x27;t find the full clip of the quote anywhere, some of the reporting on it seems to imply that the question she was responding to was if Biden should concede <i>on election night</i>, and the answer was under no circumstances. That really strains the whole &quot;disputing democracy&quot; thing.')
