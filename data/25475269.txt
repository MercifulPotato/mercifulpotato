On top of whatever other taxes they&#x27;re paying. Which is probably <i>not</i> what you wanted if you have a 22% marginal tax rate on people making $50,000, right?<p>What you really want is to forget about the phase out and just combine the UBI with a flat tax, so that the people making less money are paying the same marginal rate instead of a <i>higher</i> one than people who make more money.')
