This modification was seen occurring in multiple locations, so maybe not a single linage change. Maybe more like an increase in probability that one nucleotide would &quot;flip&quot; in multiple organisms, with enough organisms at hand.<p>The spike itself attacks&#x2F;props open ACE2 receptors, like those found on your eyes, and is mostly encoded using ~39 some odd nucleotides borrowed from a South Asian fish. Plotting the number of &quot;words&quot; repeated in the genome (~30K nucleotides) yields a phi-like curve, with the words&#x2F;codons in the spike occurring more statistically significantly than others.<p>The mutation is not expected to cause more severe cases, but is more infectious due to more spikes needing to be neutralized to fend off the infection. In bloodstream plant lectins have been shown to be effective at this, as well as llama nanoparticles.<p>All of this is Googlable using the right key terms.<p>Fish DNA in the spike: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dnascience.plos.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;20&#x2F;covid-19-vaccine-will-close-in-on-the-spikes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dnascience.plos.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;20&#x2F;covid-19-vaccine-will...</a><p>One nucleotide changes number of spikes: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;29&#x2F;coronavirus-mutation-science&#x2F;?arc404=true" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;29&#x2F;coronaviru...</a>')
