If I loan the share to someone else and they sell it then it is still only sold once.<p>In my opinion it&#x27;s more likely that people were either selling naked calls (which would convert into an IOU for stock) or that people were selling shares that didn&#x27;t actually exist on the open market.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about settlement to verify the latter claim, but there are some reports of shares taking an excessively long time to settle. Those kind of irregularities should probably be more closely investigated.')
