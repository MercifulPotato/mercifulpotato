We had a server who literally lit someone on fire. I had drug addicts who didn&#x27;t show up for work, causing a panicked chain reaction among all the other people from their halfway house. Half the cooks were violating some sort of immigration or labor law.<p>It&#x27;s fine. Most criminals are fine most the time.<p>What&#x27;s your alternative? If you go to jail it&#x27;s just for life because creampuffs can&#x27;t handle sitting near someone who did something bad? Why is society comfortable with white colar criminals working when they cause more damage (both to the companies and to society as a whole)?')
