The winters here are relatively mild, but we do get blizzards now and then.<p>I tried studded tires, but found they didn&#x27;t help much.  Black ice is rare here compared to layers of snow and slush, which don&#x27;t give studs much to bite into.  For me, three inch tires with an open tread pattern at low pressure -- plus an upright riding position that distributes weight evenly between the wheels -- gives me the most confidence.<p>Regarding the cold, I&#x27;d say windproofing is most important, and expedition-style mittens are well worth the investment.  You won&#x27;t need much insulation (except maybe at the extremities) once you start generating body heat.  Multiple top layers, each with their own full length zipper, will let you regulate your temperature without getting off the bike.  That&#x27;s especially helpful if you have long climbs and long descents.')
