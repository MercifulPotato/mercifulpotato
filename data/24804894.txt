How much improvement wasn&#x27;t measured, but it&#x27;s one of the reasons they&#x27;re testing for tinnitus in the phase 2a study.<p>Otonomy&#x27;s OTO-413 drug (to fix the ribbon synapses in the cochlea) also seems really promising (results are due out next month). However, for their phase I&#x2F;II study they&#x27;re not testing for tinnitus and are actually excluding patients with &quot;bothersome tinnitus&quot;. I&#x27;m hoping they see the same thing as Frequency and that some patients report improved tinnitus. These two drugs together (regrowing hair cells and ribbon synapses) seem like they could be a good one-two punch against hearing loss and tinnitus.')
