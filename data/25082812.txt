To be perfectly honest,  if Apple shut down their Macbook factories and got out of the computer game entirely, and everyone flocked to Linux, it would be several painful years before Linux would be as usable as MacOS is today.<p>This is why I try out Linux every few years, and file lots of bug reports when I run into issues (mostly in applications - the core Linux kernel is solid). I&#x27;ve even contributed code to Linux apps that I don&#x27;t intend to use right now.')
