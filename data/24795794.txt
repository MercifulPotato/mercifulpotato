Particularly I avoid Google.<p>My main email is in my own domain(s) (paid in intervals of ten years) with gandi.net.<p>Using Duck duck go everywhere I can.<p>I have an Android phone by necessity and because there is no real alternative. I download all my pictures and store them with pCloud instead. No G-drive or Dropbox, as I can&#x27;t trust these services at all.<p>My Gmail account is used for things that can get spam.
