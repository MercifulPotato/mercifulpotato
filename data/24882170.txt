The PC did not have comparable graphics and sound to the C64 until the early 1990s and to the Amiga until the late 1990s.<p>Sure, you could - at any point in time - get a good frame buffer card from e.g. Matrox and a good sound card from e.g. turtle beach or Gravis. But the baseline targeted by most software was a SuperVGA du jour and 8-bit soundblaster (Adkins compatible!). 16 bit sound became common only at the end of the 1990s, whereas the Amiga had 14-bit capable sound in 1985 (required a trick, but was there all along).')
