In short, track changes is really intended for a single round of changes on top of a base document, not for permanently tracking the changes on a document over its entire lifetime:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;view-previous-versions-of-office-files-5c1e076f-a9c9-41b8-8ace-f77b9642e2c2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;view-previous-ver...</a><p>Now maybe a Word expert will come along and tell me how to do it properly. :-) But even if they do that sort of proves my point, which is that Word is a large, complex piece of software and even if it hypothetically supports some feature, doesn&#x27;t make it intuitive or easy to use in that way. (Or that you won&#x27;t hit a bunch of corner cases when you try to use it.)<p>I do stand corrected about the find-replace formatting, so thanks for that. But on the other hand, I don&#x27;t think it really contradicts my point either.<p>To be clear, I do think Word serves its user base! For low- to moderate- tech savvy users, it&#x27;s does exactly what it needs to. And I&#x27;m not saying everyone should switch to Markdown. But for those of us who have the technical chops to go beyond it, there are some real advantages to working with other tools that shouldn&#x27;t be discounted.')
