Item(by='wenc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606849793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25267337, text='&gt; When I visited Pittsburgh last year, I only found one (!!!) downtown.<p>To be fair, my impression of downtown Pittsburgh (that is, the golden triangle -- this was a few years ago, so things may have changed) was it didn&#x27;t have much residential density. Things seemed relatively quiet after 5 and the area didn&#x27;t seem to have much foot traffic. I  also was given to understand most Pitt and CMU folks (the intelligentsia of the city) don&#x27;t tend to live downtown. I did manage to visit a comic book store.<p>Brick and mortar bookstores do require a certain amount of foot traffic to be economically feasible. Although Amazon Prime is hard to beat for sheer size of inventory, below MSRP prices and fast&#x2F;free shipping, booksellers still have a few cards up their sleeve. The booksellers near me that were doing ok pre-COVID had great browsing experiences (well-curated collections, nice furniture and adjoining cafes) and frequent book events by authors. Sadly with COVID these advantages were lost. (also, I hate to say this, but customer service in a bookstore generally doesn&#x27;t really make or break it. I rarely interact with the staff.)<p>Since March, I&#x27;ve bought a couple of books from Bookshop.org out of principle. The books were pricier (closer to MSRP), shipping was more expensive and slower, and there was no other value-add, but I knew I was paying their true sustainable economic cost.<p>I guess the real problem isn&#x27;t that Bookshop is expensive, but that Amazon is so cheap (and convenient).<p>(also, despite what purists say, Amazon&#x27;s b&amp;m bookstores are actually really good -- the curation is excellent because it&#x27;s based on analytics. So Amazon is encroaching on b&amp;m booksellers&#x27; territory in that way too.)')
