Now when I have to access positional memory I see it in my mind and it doesn&#x27;t feel artificial at all. I can walk through places I&#x27;ve been and remember small environmental details if I focus on them, which is very convenient when I get lost (I have no sense of direction). It&#x27;s real in a way that it never was before, which is not dissimilar to what we&#x27;re talking about.')
