You can have been influenced by Rand as a teenager, grown out of it by the time you became successful, and still be in that list, and you can also be part of that list if you were influence by it after becoming successful.<p>Also, objectivism is objectively incorrect, and unlike rationalism is an anti-materialist ideology.')
