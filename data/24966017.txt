I feel hooks are very powerful but I think they are only a refinement on a fundamental problem which is handling reactivity in your view layer is always going to have issues. I would guess you kind of hit on something similar by having your localized Redux states.<p>Something I&#x27;m looking at right now is Effector. It encourages many smaller stores and allows for handling of effects quite easily. The smaller individual stores avoid the performance issues that people bring up often with Redux and I feel the API is more fluent, avoiding some of those boilerplate concerns, some of which are admittedly addressed by Redux Toolkit.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how my time with Effector is going to play out but I suspect it is at least the right idea. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a similar library came out that was embraced more by the community')
