I did not mean to suggest there are no issues with wild bee populations declining. There certainly are.<p>My gripe is these articles like to quote decrease numbers observed by bee keepers. And they mislead people into thinking these are the same numbers scientists are observing in wild bee populations. They are not. I can&#x27;t find anything on studies of wild populations declining this much, but I&#x27;m willing to be corrected.<p>Even here you are quoting as much as 70%, but I&#x27;m willing to bet you got this number from one of these purposely misleading statistics. I think it is important to understand that mono crop farms, with crops that depend on pollinators, work closely hand in hand with commercial bee keepers.<p>Collateral damage from mono-crop farming practices (destruction of habitat, mass chemical application) is not the same, and when media confuses the two, or borrows statistics from numbers beekeepers have observed in their hives, it only serves to confuse the topic.')
