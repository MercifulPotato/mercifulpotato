I did not mean to suggest there are no issues with wild bee populations declining. There certainly are.<p>Also it&#x27;s important to note that anything we call a &#x27;wild&#x27; honey bee now is just a descendant of a once &#x27;domesticated&#x27; variety, originally brought over by European settlers. So if you trace it back far enough, protecting &#x27;wild&#x27; bees is sort of funny since it is an &#x27;artificial&#x27; element we introduced to our environment in the first place.<p>My gripe is these articles like to quote decrease in numbers observed by commercial bee keepers. They mislead people into thinking these are the same numbers scientists are observing in the overall wild bee population. Again, in America, something we introduced in the first place. They were not native.<p>I think it is important to understand that mono crop farms, with crops that depend on pollinators, work closely hand in hand with commercial bee keepers. I have never seen this explained to people by any of these articles, probably because it does not server their agenda.<p>Collateral damage from mono-crop farming practices (destruction of habitat, mass chemical application) is a big problem, but not being honest about the the history, and purposely hiding the large role commercial beekeepers play is not helpful.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;honey.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;honey-in-history-colonial-america" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;honey.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;honey-in-history-colonial-america</a>')
