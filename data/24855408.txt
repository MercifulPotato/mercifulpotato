Its always going to be there but reducing this should be a goal.<p>Most of the billionaires are first generation and waiting for the rich to die to spread wealth is not going to help anything economically (estate tax is a drop in the bucket compared to the GDP itself just growing a couple of percent).<p>&gt; 2) Focusing on small business vs large corporate. Literally making policy that favours smaller companies be it lower regulation, taxes etc. But you have to actively help the up and comers to disrupt the market vs protect large interests.<p>This will make it very difficult to compete globally in the capital intensive industries. Would this be coupled with nationalistic trade policies as well?')
