I recently interviewed three candidates in a row that described their tests in this way, and I thought it was odd, and now I see many people in this thread doing it also.<p>I would call this a functional or behavioral test.  For me a key aspect of an integration test is that there&#x27;s something &quot;real&quot; on at least two &quot;sides&quot; - otherwise what is it testing integration <i>with</i>? Is this some side-effect of a generation growing up with Spring&#x27;s integration testing framework being used for all black-box testing?<p>(I will not comment about how often I see people referring to all test doubles as &quot;mocks&quot;, as I have largely given up trying to bring clarity here...)')
