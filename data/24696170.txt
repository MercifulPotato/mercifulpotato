Many people of non-African origin do win such sprint and marathon contests. I suspect what you are really trying to get at, in as few words as possible, is a typical the racist trope: that Africans excel in mindless physical sports, while being inferior in the intellect. However, for example, the physical sport of swimming (and many other sports) is dominated by caucasian people. Given this, it would be wrong to ascribe any over-arching superiority of Africans in sports, or even of any sport category.<p>That there are physiological differences between groups of people is not in doubt. However, that does not necessarily translate to any culturally meaningful broad characterizations. Fitness in any endeavour requires a complex mix of talents and skills. I&#x27;m surprised to see such simplistic, pseudo-rational arguments from HN members.<p>Edit: Fixed typos')
