It’s enormous, sitting on its side in what looks like just a few feet of water. It’s close to the shore, maybe a thousand or 1500 feet out. A temporary information placard had been put on the fishing pier explaining what it was.<p>At the time it was all in one piece, but you could see them attaching the lifting equipment along the length, and it was clear it was going to be cut into pieces.<p>It must take an enormous amount of work to build an internal framework that can support the cut section being lifted from the side. I’m not surprised it’s taking so long so salvage.')
