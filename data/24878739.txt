They are the ones lacking critical skills and ability to understand what goes on Fb, etc<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t see why this is so controversial. Younger people do stupid stuff on their phones, but they&#x27;re more open to learning from their mistakes<p>The older generation has a more inflexible mindset and hasn&#x27;t been on the internet&#x2F;social media for longer (most of them, which is probably not so much the demographic here, even for older HNs commenters)<p>I see how a lot of people behave today and it&#x27;s how I behaved and felt for a good amount of time. But that wasn&#x27;t on the hate melting pot of Facebook, it was on more spread out and on more niche sites.<p>Or spoken in other words: some things are better left on a pub brawl table not as a hard statement on social media.')
