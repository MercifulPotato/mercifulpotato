Here I feel that your gp argument breaks down in the absence of such an absolute. If indeed, we cannot prima facie trust that unions work in their members ( and their students&#x27;) best interest; why shouldn&#x27;t we use the troubles of unionized education ( or unionized policing...) as a caution against a possible bad outcome?<p>Perhaps I misunderstood; and this has just been another internet argument for the wind .')
