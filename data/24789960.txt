If you are self-employed, yes, you can take a home office deduction, but not if you are a W2 employee.<p>The US <i>used</i> to have an &quot;unreimbursed employee expense&quot; itemized deduction, but even then there was a pretty high floor (had to be more than a couple percent of your total income) so most people couldn&#x27;t make use of it. That deduction was eliminated in the 2018 tax law.')
