Unique or thinly traded luxury items have value that can&#x27;t really be known until they are sold, which is why capital gains are taxed at the time of a sale. I&#x27;m thinking of a rare coin that might be $75,000 or $100,000.... you can&#x27;t know the value until it goes up on the auction block. Same thing applies to real estate, antique cars, artwork, etc.')
