CircuitPython took MicroPython and built a hardware abstraction layer on top. It makes hardware level access more standardized and you can take your project to a different microcontroller board. CircuitPython only supports a limited number of boards.<p>If scripting for microcontrollers become more mainstream, it can enable new applications and use cases that do not require a forced firmware re-flashing to change the code.')
