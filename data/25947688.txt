I think it should target a 1-2% steady inflation forever both to encourage spending and to replace lost coinage.<p>At the same time, inflation should not be a spending power advantage. By distributing inflation among miners, you don&#x27;t give disproportionate advantage to any one group like governments currently enjoy. I view this as more fair and it removes the incentive to attempt to change inflation rates in the future.')
