Any individual can easily create a website and publish whatever they like. It costs maybe $100&#x2F;year and takes a couple of hours for an inexperienced user to set up a Wordpress blog with manually-moderated comments. Nobody&#x27;s speech would be censored if Section 230 were repealed.<p>Instead, platforms would be treated as though they had consciously decided to publish every publically-available comment&#x2F;file upload&#x2F;post&#x2F;etc. That would probably mean manually moderating everything, and rejecting a lot of it for capricious reasons.<p>But honestly, I am not convinced that that would be a bad thing. It would certainly encourage more people to create their own publishing mediums, and it might help break up the titanic oligarchs that currently occupy the market.<p>Put it this way: I would happily give up sites like HN to remove the business model that makes mass-scale social media viable. Sites like Twitter and Facebook have inflicted unconscionable harm on our collective humanity, and they have demonstrated a complete inability to self-regulate.')
