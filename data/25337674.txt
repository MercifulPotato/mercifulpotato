If a purely cost driven race to the bottom is inevitable, it already would have happened. I think what’s going on right now increases the competition for roles that some people may have previously had a geographic advantage over others in obtaining, but I don’t think this means that advantage is gone, nor do I think it’s a zero sum game. There may be some downward wage pressure, but if cost was your only motivator as an employer, you were probably already hiring remote teams in low cost markets.')
