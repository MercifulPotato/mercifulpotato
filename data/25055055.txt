For us, we cheated a little bit on many services and just take a dependency on IServiceProvider to get at other services at runtime. This allows for any service to talk to any other service without worrying about some monster CTOR hierarchy. We used to try to keep things &quot;correct&quot; in terms of dependency chain, but we have found that the real world is a lot easier to work with when you permit circular dependencies between services and maintain 1 big flat collection of them. This is basically microservices but without the RPC ceremony and associated nightmares.')
