Something a bit more quantitative then them not seeing null errors in their dashboards anymore. At least give us some sense of the measure? How many null error did they see before and what about now? What about other kind of errors? Did they see an uptick elsewhere as a result? What about developer productivity, was that impacted? Etc. This would have been a great opportunity to gather some real data about it.')
