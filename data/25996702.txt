Especially considering the back pay for people &quot;not hired&quot; should be close to &quot;a Googler salary&quot; and not &quot;our last stimulus check&quot;.<p>Which is to say, this is barely a slap on the wrist, par for the course on government actions against Google.

At the very least, the taxpayers should be getting something back from all the years the DOL had to waste dealing with this case.')
