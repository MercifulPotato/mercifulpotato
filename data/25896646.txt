Natives aren’t thrilled about higher property taxes and the sprawl. The farther out you go, the more conservative it will get. In the Bay, people aren’t worried about property tax but rent.<p>All your favorite places are too crowded (Austin or Bay, pre Covid). Those non aggressive drivers in Austin are all on Ambien or pot and driving 15 mph below the speed limit, which just enrages the other drivers. Houston is more of a Nascar experience. Dallas actually has made road progress, if you don’t have ptsd from the last four decades of nonstop construction. Your neighbors will all be moaning about their toll bills though.<p>Drive IH-35 between DFW and Austin and you’ll get what a low-service State govt is all about.<p>IMO, all this talk about CA culture - the vast majority moving to TX aren’t BA natives. They’re folks who came for the money and now they’re moving on. They weren’t that welcomed here, they won’t be that welcome there. That said, most Austinites aren’t natives either. It just worked until it got ridiculous (which is function of your arrival date).')
