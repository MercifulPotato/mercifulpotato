One has the power to spend vast sums on advertising to attract new users, maintain a clean brand image with PR, monitor non-users&#x27; actions across the internet and beyond and algorithmically manipulate the emotions and beliefs of its users, etc.<p>What power do you or I have to justify splitting the moral responsibility with them 50&#x2F;50? More education is always a good thing, but it&#x27;s too late to tell 1.62 billion daily active users (Q3 2019) &quot;You should know better&quot;. Facebook has become too good at what it does.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer is.
