Due to the store policies, missing that slot would result in another, potentially very expensive, delay.<p>Now, marketing is a significant part of the budget and you really want to sync your marketing campaign with the release date. Postponing the release by a few weeks is almost guaranteed to damage the sales drastically, to the point where it could kill your game before people even have a chance to learn about it.<p>You&#x27;re late. So what do you do? You release all of your fixes in a huge day-0 patch. It&#x27;s still better than the alternative.')
