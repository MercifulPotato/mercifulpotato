I don&#x27;t need to listen to anyone but Trump himself to realize he lies constantly and has only a rudimentary grasp of how government and society functions. His history in popular culture speaks for itself. So what is going on with the 70 million people who can&#x27;t see that plainly? The only conclusion we can reach is &quot;he says the quiet part out loud&quot; and that resonates with a lot of people. &quot;They are sending us murders and rapists&quot; was an early example that has stuck with me. Perhaps it is not a charitable view but nearly every office holding member of the GOP lined up to lick his boots after he said thousands of things like that.<p>As near as I can tell, Conservatism is deader than disco.')
