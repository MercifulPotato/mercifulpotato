Item(by='ziaddotcom', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610714083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25765316, text='I think I know what you meant, but in America Anglo-American would either imply White non Hispanics (as opposed to White Hispanics or White descendants of French first speaking people who were white) or it would mean virtually anyone born in America or elsewhere whose first language was English and is now an American citizen. In any event, virtually all 2nd generation  American undergrads would fit the latter definition, and the former definition would not imply a racist scholarship by your definition, but a prejudice against non anglophone white people and non anglophone non whites alike. Given that Harvard and its scholarships almost certainly assume near native proficiency in English, I&#x27;m not sure if you argued my point or yours more effectively to be honest.')
