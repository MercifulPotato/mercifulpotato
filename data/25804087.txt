The first attempt gives you a random choice in {0, 1}. The second attempt gives you a random choice in {0, 1, 2}. The third attempt gives you a random choice in {0, 1, 2, 4}. The fourth attempt gives you a random choice in {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}. This goes on until a ceiling in the number of attempts or a set wall clock time is reached.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Exponential_backoff#Example_exponential_backoff_algorithm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Exponential_backoff#Example_ex...</a>')
