So, Protobuf lets you convert to&#x2F;from JSON, so that your service can expose a JSON API while maintaining Protobuf schemas and never dealing with a JSON parser directly.<p>The implementation is based on Protobuf&#x27;s existing reflection features, so if you are already compiling with that enabled, the JSON implementation does not add much code bloat on top of that.')
