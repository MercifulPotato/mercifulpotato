Is the stack size specific by any languages? Many language&#x27;s compilers will eliminate variable assignments as an optimization. Since I can view a stack trace in some of those languages, then would that make that not an optimization? Like, if I just inserted `let x = 3;` in the middle of my function, but never used `x`, it would disappear from the compiled code. If I look at the stack trace, I wont see my `x` variable. Is that an optimization or a semantic language feature? Does it matter?')
