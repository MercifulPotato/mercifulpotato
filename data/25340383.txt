You know this is wrong. You don&#x27;t have to be a part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it&#x27;s too late.<p>That&#x27;s literally it. When I hear &quot;disgruntled former employee&quot; I think of phishing for credentials or threatening former coworkers, in this case the terms &quot;whistleblower&quot; and &quot;civil disobedience&quot; seem more appropriate.')
