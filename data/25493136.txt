They have bespoke innovative protections at the hardware and hypervisor level, as well as an actual security CPU (as opposed to TrustZone on Androids, which is always swiss cheese in one way or another). This is largely possible because Apple are building their own silicon (none of the other silicon vendors are anywhere near as competent in this field).<p>I say this as an Android user. Apple only gets hit with all these exploit chains because they are immensely valuable single target. All the Android phones are worse, it&#x27;s just that hacking Android doesn&#x27;t pay nearly as much (and that market is much more fragmented).<p>Additionally, Google&#x27;s public bug bounty project for Android is dysfunctional and run by contractors without the slightest clue how to handle the reports.<p>On the other hand, since Android is a more open ecosystem, you can make simpler architectural guarantees than you can on iOS. For example, on a rooted Android you can set a long boot-time-only passphrase for full disk encryption which guarantees data security at rest, which you can&#x27;t on iOS or non rooted Android (they force you to use your regular unlock passphrase, which isn&#x27;t practical to make long, and in Apple&#x27;s case isn&#x27;t used for FDE, though Android is moving in that direction too). But none of that will save you from NSO runtime 0days, just from police seizing your phone and getting data out if you turn it off.')
