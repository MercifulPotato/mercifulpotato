Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[25830270], score=None, time=1611032142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829992, text='&gt; If we instead built long term competence within public institutions, including competitive remuneration and career development like training programmes, there wouldn&#x27;t be a need to have a door between the private and public sector quite as much in the first place...<p>That sounds great in theory, but the problem is that many of these leadership roles if not elected directly are nominated by the president and therefore they are political in nature and those politics can flow down through the organization.<p>For example the FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is resigning this week.  Would he have resigned if Trump was reelected or would he have been re-upped for another term?  Is Biden obligated to find this Republican a job somewhere else in his administration?  Is Pai just supposed to retire at 48 years old? Can he go back to working for Verizon like he did for a period earlier in career?  How many other people at the FCC have or soon will leave the agency due to the change in leadership?')
