Let me rephrase it to help you understand.  Before cryptocurrency, all ledgers were stored in a central database where the admin of that DB could modify or delete anyone&#x27;s currency.  I assume you understand how cryptocurrency works, but to reiterate, the DB is distributed, and if anyone deletes a particular transaction on their server, they will be out of sync with the rest, and their copy rejected as invalid.<p>Some sort of distributed validation mechanism could conceivably be created which avoids any single point of control for a piece of content.  And in fact you could use the BTC blockchain as a proof of concept - post a message with your transaction that gets encoded in the blockchain.  It now becomes impossible to delete or modify.  It is essentially uncensorable.  You could delete it from your copy of the blockchain, but the real blockchain is the consensus of all nodes, not your particular copy.')
