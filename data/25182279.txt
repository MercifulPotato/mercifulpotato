With a decent set of speakers, you can feel the sound. There&#x27;s some nice headphones out there, but they can&#x27;t replicate the way some good bass feels through a set of decent speakers.<p>I can see the comparison system working alright for some things. It&#x27;s just not a replacement for listening to something on hardware and if I were out to spend some money on a good set of speakers, i&#x27;m going to want to listen to them in person first.')
