The only problem is that in order to detonate a thermonuclear bomb you need a nuclear bomb to ignite the Fusion reaction first. Civilian&#x2F;Generative Fusion can never be weaponized the same way nuclear fission has been. Fusion only occurs under the most extreme temperature and magnetic conditions, if they vary even slightly the fusion process stops instantly and you get no energy. We can barely get a energy positive fusion process working in a reactor with all the best tech in the world. Barely. It cannot and will not ever be weaponized the way you think.')
