If there&#x27;s a bug in all of this it&#x27;s in laying out very clearly how to ease into this. Especially in a world of hosted email providers where everyone is using Exchange, Google Email, and even cPanel to host email for organizations, and none of them have a big incentive to support this.<p>EDIT: On thinking about it, I&#x27;d think this would have more chances if they phrased it as an augmentation of email&#x27;s capabilities rather than an email killer.')
