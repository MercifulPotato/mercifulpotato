He&#x27;s been trying to help you make more pragmatic decisions but you&#x27;re dug in on insisting he doesn&#x27;t understand you, so you can&#x27;t see that you can do something much better.&quot;<p>- &quot;My manager is upset that I deliver extra features for our business. I think he&#x27;s a control freak and he doesn&#x27;t understand how much I do.&quot;\n- &quot;No, your manager sees that you keep doing one off favors for whoever asks, at the expense of slowing down the critical work that the team has committed to. Your manager works very hard to push back on the business and keep your roadmap clear, and you keep sabotaging it for the team.&quot;<p>- &quot;My manager doesn&#x27;t appreciate how many bugs I fix in our system. He keeps saying something that I don&#x27;t think high level enough but I just think he&#x27;s an asshole.&quot;\n- &quot;No, your manager recognizes that if all you do is fix bugs you will never rise in your level, and as someone who&#x27;s considered a senior engineer, he needs you to step up and help the team figure out why they have so many bugs to begin with, and then work to solve those at root level. Also, your boss has a hard time fighting for a raise for you every year because his boss just says &#x27;oh that guy just fixes bugs, no growth&#x27;&quot;<p>These situations are super common. In each one, the employee is better off trying to understand what the manager is seeing and why they are suggesting something different. But when the employee has their head up their ass and starts from the point of view &quot;everything I am doing is right and my boss just doesn&#x27;t understand&quot; they are screwing themselves, likely the team, and are way more in the &quot;oblivious underperformer&quot; category than they realize.')
