Try to be clear, concise, and get to the point real quick.<p>Here are some of my learnings and anecdotal incidents I have experienced so far. Still learning and recalibrating as I go on.<p>Try following BLUF[1], a military communications acronym — “Bottom Line Up Front” — designed to enforce speed and clarity in reports and emails.<p>We, especially in the eastern culture, tend to weave stories and try to form a connection before hitting the point. When it comes to team communication, either in emails and other forms of communication, it is better to reverse it -- start with the important points and then, if needed, weave the stories to make it clearer and empathetic.<p>However, just knowing the tips&#x2F;tricks isn&#x27;t enough, communication (more aptly writing) is a habit that becomes better with more practice.<p>One common suggestion I advise my team is, &quot;I cannot read your mind, you have to tell me. The same goes with the client&#x2F;customer -- ask them, talk to them unless you can read their mind.&quot;<p>If you work for a Startup or any Company for that matter, how do you think the founder or the C-Suites know what you did. Make it a habit to write weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly reports and email them. I guarantee you that it will come to pay you with compound interest in the future.<p>Here is a scenario. You just joined a new company. You report to a few at the top and work with a few under you. You have to gain the trust of those below you and prove to the ones above. If you are someone who wants to &quot;prove it&quot;, do beyond your call, and wants to go the extra mile, what would be an ideal step besides the usual work you have to do.<p>Try this (I think I read this on Seth Godin&#x27;s Blog[2]). Write a regular report of the accomplishment of your team, and highlight the people under you -- include their names and what they did that help you, and the team. The tops know what&#x27;s happening and can take decisions without having to read your mind or setting up &quot;meetings&quot; and &quot;catch-ups&quot; which most will forget as soon as they are over. When in writing, they will likely mark it and act on it appropriately.<p>For those Individual Contributors (IC), I would still suggest doing something similar. Others, including your managers, friends, colleagues cannot read your mind. You might be one of the best programmers and you can prove it with code but imagine supplementing that with some form of communication on your gotchas, tips, tricks -- people love to hear those.<p>I was once in a team, big enough, and we had just one DevOps. He was rather silent, talks to very few people, the corner guy. But I was intrigued by the short and clear emails he sent when things are going to go down, backup, etc. while maintaining everyone&#x27;s DevOps needs without much sweat (or is it). I began talking to him often and he was friendly, eager to tell me interesting things. He was also a regular documenter and writes some of the best documentation of what he did, why he did and was pretty much future proof. Almost none knew about that but he continues the routine. That documentation soon became a way to onboard new recruits when a new account was started for DevOps for enterprise customers earning $100Ks in the first few months of operation. By the time he left or close to it, that department was pulling in close to millions.<p>If you are in the lower rung and believe no one listens to you, despite you being smart -- think again. You have writing as your weapon. One of my career advice is, “Imagine yourself already advanced in your careers a year or more, then start acting and doing the roles you would do by then.“ If you are asked why you do something better because that is above your pay grade, you are in the wrong company.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BLUF_(communication)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BLUF_(communication)</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sethgodin.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sethgodin.com</a>')
