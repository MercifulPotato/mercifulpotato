Those two are only the same for the pre-seed phase of a startup. It&#x27;s also unlikely that any people are employed before some investment round has been raised.<p>Once some investment is raised, the money comes predominantly from the investors and not from the founder. At that point the risk for the founder is mostly gone.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there is no risk at all for the founders, just that it&#x27;s concentrated in the pre-seed phase of a startup.<p>&gt; This is none of the employee&#x27;s business to assess founder&#x27;s risk exposure<p>If you are asking me to join your very-early-stage startup, you can bet your ass that I&#x27;m going to probe you on your risk exposure.')
