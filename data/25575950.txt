Snowden isn&#x27;t a whistleblower. He leaked stolen materials then fled to a hostile country.<p>Multiple IC whistleblowers were allowed to testify against the President in the last 4 years, all without punitive punishment (although the Trump&#x27;s tried). Snowden could have chosen a different path. His impressive control of his own narrative seems to have most of this community fooled.')
