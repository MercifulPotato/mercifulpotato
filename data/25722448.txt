Item(by='mehrdadn', descendants=None, kids=[25722546, 25724276, 25722492, 25722554, 25722836], score=None, time=1610325562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25722367, text='&gt; Stripe and Twitter are pretty clearly the latter.<p>They might be the latter, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider it obvious. Regarding social media, we&#x27;ve gotten to the point where even US Visa applications ask for social media handles (and I understand they consider it as a negative datum if you don&#x27;t provide one). And we&#x27;re also at the point where some companies won&#x27;t provide you with respectable service unless you @ them on social media. Regarding payment platforms, generally people expect them to be quite neutral, since getting locked out of the financial system is not exactly going to lead to a great life in the modern digital economy.<p>I don&#x27;t know at what point these cross into &quot;utility&quot; territory, and I&#x27;m willing to entertain the idea that they might never do so, but I find it quite debatable and very much <i>not</i> clear.<p>(Note: None of this is to opine on the reactions to this particular incident. Just commenting on the more general idea.)')
