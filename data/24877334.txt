No I’ve written rather large scripts that were robust but had no need to be written in a programming language.  If your gluing programs together shell script are literally designed for that.  If you’re doing lots of arithmetic and huge amounts of variable logic then, yes, you should switch to a programming language.  Each tool has its place but I’ve seen people with this attitude spend a day writing a program in python to solve a problem we could do with a couple of shell functions in half an hour.')
