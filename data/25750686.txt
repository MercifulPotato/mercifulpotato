During the pause, work with law enforcement to identify those specific posts that satisfy the <i>Brandenberg</i> &quot;imminent&quot; criteria, mark those as redacted, then return to service. Leaving open possible further work with law enforcement to share a feed and tie in redaction by future judicial decisions. I&#x27;m hoping I missed where it says that Parler was offered this choice and turned it down.<p>I&#x27;m even more troubled by the continued &quot;let them eat cake&quot; dismissive ennui of the chattering classes to the natural-world plights of the most radicalized members of the Trump supporters (and for that matter, to BLM supporters&#x27; plights treatment by other chattering classes), as they&#x27;re pretty much at the &quot;nothing left to lose&quot; stage. Having been not simply ignored since the 70&#x27;s onwards, but jeered at, derided, and mocked, instead of rehabilitating their life situations, has driven them into the arms of malign ideologies that openly lie to them fealty will improve their lot in life, when no other ideology will have them.<p>Just like in my enterprise work with my clients, when I hear extreme dissatisfaction, that&#x27;s an opportunity for me to listen, empathize, then work together iteratively to solve problems. Instead, the US treats such expressions as opportunities to suppress. That only guarantees the pressure builds up elsewhere you cannot predict (in enterprise work, it often manifests as political chits being called in, and budget found where none was found before to completely pivot away and build the users&#x27; own solution, however imperfect it may be).<p>The US treats many of its have-nots (all along the political spectrum and not just along one vector) like it treats its prisoners. Brutalize with platitude-laden inaction instead of rehabilitate. It&#x27;s no wonder the nation manufactures a dictatorship-loving consent.')
