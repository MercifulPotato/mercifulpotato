It&#x27;s hard to publish data with semantic markup and understand the schemas (or even the benefit of using them). Nobody is writing FOAF or any other RDF&#x2F;OWL by hand.<p>In order to bootstrap the process, authorship tools need to produce semantic markup automatically on the behalf of users. Unfortunately the content silos do not want to do that. They&#x27;re happy to keep the data to themselves and run Snowflake &#x2F; big data queries on them all day long. They just don&#x27;t want you doing the same. It&#x27;s no benefit to them if your friend or interest graph escapes their hold.<p>This is a difficult chicken and egg problem.<p>A good angle of attack might be for the distributed web folks to take an interest. ActivityPub, Mastodon, and Matrix&#x2F;Riot&#x2F;(whatever they rebranded to) would be beneficiaries of schema ingestion. The more they can mark up the data they produce, the more useful it becomes. A tooling ecosystem can grow around semantic data.<p>Technically open standard APIs in a distributed web are already semantic, it may just be that their schemas don&#x27;t map well to queryable triple stores. But that&#x27;s just a transformation away. RDF is just a format for expressing your ontology in an open and compatible way others can reference and build upon.')
