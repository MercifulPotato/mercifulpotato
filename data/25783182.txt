Google Fit would be the natural place for me to aggregate all that, so I&#x27;m sold on the utility of that. Sadly I think it&#x27;s at risk of being Google abandonware. I don&#x27;t recall them ever having added functionality, but I recall at least one time functionality disappeared (they removed the website where you could view your data). The app seemed to keep getting simplified over time.')
