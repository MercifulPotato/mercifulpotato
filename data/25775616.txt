The chat box allows players to type things like &quot;&#x2F;roll 1d6&quot; or &quot;&#x2F;roll 2d12&quot; to simulate rolling dice (in these cases 1 6-sided die and 2 12-sided dice). I quickly tried &quot;&#x2F;roll 1dNaN&quot;, crashed the chat, and we went back to physical dice for the rest of the session.')
