They&#x27;re mostly rip-offs.<p>Having interned&#x2F;worked in three INGOs (Save the Children, World Concern and UNICEF) for a total of ~2 years, and having a family member who have worked in a well-known French NGO (ACF International)for 3+ years, I have to agree with this assessment.<p>That&#x27;s why when I donate money to charities, I&#x27;m very selective and make sure the charities I donate are NOT affiliated with religion (ahem, Save the Children and World Concern) or any political agenda (UNICEF). The truth in INGOs is that they need constant stream of funding and sometimes, they make up&#x2F;exaggerate stuff to help drive the donations.<p>Worse is, when you actually work with people in NGOs, you&#x27;ll find there is a stark difference in pay and benefits between foreigner (usually white or English speaking) and the local&#x2F;native employees although the latter are the ones who know much more about the actual problems. Regional directors in UNICEF come and go every two years or less and they always can&#x27;t wait to get out of the shithole third world country that they are supposed to be helping about. They and their fellow (foreign) workers are also paid very well with car, housing and children education benefits (all of which I&#x27;m not opposed to, but I&#x27;m sure as hell that they cannot find an equally well-paying job with their degrees and credentials in their home countries). Plus you never find these regional directors and management people at work (meaning, they show up to work like maybe once a week if we are lucky; no, they are not in the field working, which is left to the native employees of said INGO).')
