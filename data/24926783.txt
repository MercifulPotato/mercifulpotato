Item(by='bawolff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603941329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24926637, text='So i only skimmed the presentation (It is an hour long).<p>&gt; You don’t have to call out or reference the original speaker at all and say they’re wrong<p>I disagree. His talk is essentially a direct response to the other presentation. He is assuming context from the original presentation (A very famous one in this space from what I can pick up). Without explaining the context, his presentation would make less sense to those not as familiar with this particular tech scene.<p>Its not like he&#x27;s saying the other person is an idiot or something. He actually compliments the other speaker multiple times.<p>&gt; You can give your reasons why notebooks are good and even tackle common criticisms without picking apart their talk specifically<p>If your goal is to talk up notebooks sure. If your goal is to respectfully disagree with the widely accepted dogma, then you should make direct reference to the work you are responding to.<p>&gt; Why would you say something negative about a peer’s work on stage<p>Making provocative statements challenging widely held beliefs is literally the job of a keynote speaker.<p>Not that anyone should really consider constructive criticism of an argument the same as saying something negative about the person making them. Personally, I think it&#x27;d be pretty passive-aggressive to demolish someone&#x27;s work without doing the courtesy of referencing the work you are arguing against.<p>Edit: At the same time, I&#x27;m very sad to see you being downvoted. You make a reasonable argument that deserves to be debated on its merit, not downvoted imo.')
