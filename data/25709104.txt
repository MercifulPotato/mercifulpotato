Say I run a forum and I want to take down a post that&#x27;s calling for a mosque to be blown up. Should I need to hire a detective to discover the identity behind the account, file a lawsuit, serve that person some papers, and wait for the case to make its way through the courts? Do I need to leave the post up while that&#x27;s taking place?')
