For one, it would make things hugely more expensive and logistically challenging to implement continuous voting. (And I&#x27;m not even sure what you mean by continuous - every day, week, month, year?)<p>Circumstances change all the time but many decisions need to be made at a single point in time. And once taken are difficult to reverse. That&#x27;s how life is, in a world where time moves in only one direction.<p>Finally, no, your argument for a supermajority does not follow from your first paragraph. And quite obviously people can change their mind in both directions while still keeping a simple majority in favour. So your logic is all over the place.')
