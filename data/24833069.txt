Many propositions wishing to avoid this issue require some small super majority in the legislature.  That is the standard practice for giving &quot;the legislature more flexibility&quot;.   Requiring 87.5% is new and it is so high to be completely impractical avenue for change.  Claiming it is about flexibility is the type of dishonesty we need to remove from politics.')
