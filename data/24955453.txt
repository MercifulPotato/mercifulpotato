If it doesn&#x27;t get fixed, well, you don&#x27;t have to be a reliability expert to be worried about this one:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;wayland&#x2F;wayland&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;159" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;wayland&#x2F;wayland&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;159</a><p>I have probably chased ghosts deep inside GTK from this one alone for multiple full time weeks, to no avail. There will eventually appear a rather harsh teardown post of some of the major mistakes in the implementation (and that alone, no xml business), wayland-server might not improve, but future designers should be able to stumble upon it.<p>I think to get further with the discussion we need a sort of list of what mechanisms we consider mechanisms, and how policies project over them. Not to be disrespectful, but my budget for engagement is thin, pandemics, sorry :-&#x2F;<p>The politics stuff - so I have some logs that precedes the formation that are quite incendiary and outright vile, but there is enough shit flinging to suffice to stop at there being good reason why I wouldn&#x27;t consider getting closer than bayonet range, and why the post was obtuse enough to discourage most #metoo and discard me as an idiot who knows nothing. The tech stuff matters though and that&#x27;s only what I want to see. A protocol and not marriage as if from &#x27;the war of the roses&#x27;(1989).<p>There is a fourth option that might materialise, but that&#x27;s for then.')
