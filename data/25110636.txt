I never could get the hang of the Horizontal &amp; Vertical spacers or the Layout Managers in Qt, so it&#x27;s a static layout.<p>There are quite a few &quot;pages&quot; in the application which appear or disappear when required. Those are all QWidgets which have their own static layout.<p>The doughnut chart showing materials available on a planet is a dynamically created web page shown via a QtWebView widget.<p>There&#x27;s an Overlay Widget which is basically a QWidget with transparency, with the main window being hidden then called up via a global hotkey - I use Python ctypes to enable the global hotkey, calling the Windows API to enable that functionality.<p>And the underlying databases used are sqlite3 via SQLAlchemy.<p>It all works very nicely.')
