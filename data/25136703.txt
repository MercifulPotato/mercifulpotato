Try it for yourself. Run a song through an allpass filter. It&#x27;ll sound the same. In fact, speaker systems of all kinds do crazy things to the phase of signals, and nobody cares (what we care about is frequency and transient response).<p>The same is not true for radio. There, corrupting the phase relationships corrupts the data (for many systems).<p>Phase is relative, but our ears don&#x27;t care about relative phase <i>either</i> (at least as long as you don&#x27;t stick nonlinear filters after, then it starts mattering, but usually in audio things are fairly decorrelated anyway so it only matters in quite specific cases).<p>Here is an example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;marcan42&#x2F;status&#x2F;1282685645731672064" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;marcan42&#x2F;status&#x2F;1282685645731672064</a><p>Demo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;zwegner&#x2F;status&#x2F;1282859889447116809" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;zwegner&#x2F;status&#x2F;1282859889447116809</a> (interestingly, you can hear the change in Twitter&#x27;s low quality encode, but it goes away at higher qualities, so it seems their crappy AAC encoder <i>does</i> care about relative phase :-))<p>It&#x27;s counterintuitive how little our ears care about phase across frequency bands. This is not true for other kinds of signals.')
