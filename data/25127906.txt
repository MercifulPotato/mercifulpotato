(And he sure as hell ain&#x27;t gonna be able to get a copy of Photoshop 6 to run on Windows 10.)<p>&gt; Apple is one of the most capitalistic companies out there, they want you to buy new stuff and they&#x27;ll try everything they can to force users to upgrade sooner or later<p>That&#x27;s not wrong, but s&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Adobe and the sentiment is still true. I suppose he&#x27;ll save money if he gets a cheaper-than-Apple PC laptop, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s gonna avoid paying for Creative Cloud.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helpx.adobe.com&#x2F;x-productkb&#x2F;policy-pricing&#x2F;exchange-product-language-os.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helpx.adobe.com&#x2F;x-productkb&#x2F;policy-pricing&#x2F;exchange-...</a>')
