These are <i>minimum</i> figures, but if the four-engined airliners used in transoceanic flights were actually built to have no more reserve power (above the minimum necessary to keep flying) than the 133% you are quoting, they would have always have been less safe from engine failure than contemporary twin-engined airliners (which, in practice, always achieved the 200% reserve), as they, just like the twin-engined aircraft, could not have tolerated any more than a single engine failure - but then, ETOPS would either not have been necessary, or should also have been applied to four-engined airliners. ETOPS is primarily about the risk of <i>two</i> engines failing (and secondarily about range with one engine out.)')
