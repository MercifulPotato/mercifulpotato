Item(by='scythe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603837699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24911109, text='&gt;There is a huge number of people on this planet wasting their mental energy (computional power) on a board game where the same amount of energy can be expended into building new ways of curing cancer or whatever important problem.

You can&#x27;t put all of your efforts into working to keep people alive so they can... put all of their efforts into working to keep people alive, etc. All value systems are ultimately circular or unjustified, but the latter is IMHO superior since it&#x27;s more honest.')
