Her life is going to be a <i>lot</i> harder than that of a typical person, and of course it has been and will continue to be tough on her parents.<p>But this isn&#x27;t about parents killing their existing children, it&#x27;s about allowing future parents to make a choice whether to bring someone with possibly very severe disabilities into the world.')
