Item(by='throwanem', descendants=None, kids=[24827813, 24828777, 24831230], score=None, time=1603122788, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24827127, text='I can&#x27;t see the Lowes page right now, but Home Depot is a comparable retailer, and a store near me (but not the one I usually go to) looks to stock a couple of absolutely bottom-tier corded 3&#x2F;8&quot; drills, plus a broad range of light and medium corded hammer drills with 1&#x2F;2&quot; chucks. The broad niche between those, of general-purpose 3&#x2F;8&quot; and 1&#x2F;2&quot; light and medium drill&#x2F;driver tools and impact drivers, looks to be pretty universally filled by cordless tools. (Which makes sense, given the razor-and-blades or inkjet-and-cartridges business model to which battery-powered tools lend themselves.)<p>I wonder if corded drills might be more common in the UK because your higher mains voltage means less current is required for a given power output. With conversion losses, you can&#x27;t realistically pull more than a horsepower out of a typical 120V&#x2F;10A circuit without risking a breaker trip, even if there&#x27;s nothing else connected to the circuit. That makes a corded tool potentially much more of a pain to use than a battery-powered one, so even if the corded version would otherwise be much more cost-efficient, it still may be a tougher sell in the US.<p>I&#x27;ve heard the same power limitation described as a reason why electric kettles basically don&#x27;t exist here, although since kitchen circuits are typically rated for higher current than most others, I suspect the absence of good electric kettles may have more to do with steeped tea having been displaced by drip coffee in Americans&#x27; morning cups.')
