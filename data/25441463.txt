But also, a lack of regulation or oversight can have a lot of consequences. A good example is the Greenfell tower tragedy - fire protection authorities in the EU have warned for years about these claddings and materials, and in the EU there are not stricter regulations. And they save lives.<p>So, when regulations do not work for your advantage as a normal citizen, maybe the problem is not the existence of regulation but the lack of democratic representation and integrity in your government and the bodies it creates and controls.')
