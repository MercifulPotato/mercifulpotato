I&#x27;ve been managing this rack for a decade. I occasionally go to the datacenter to swap out a machine that is end of life, and I go every 3-6 months to swap out a failing drive or two. I&#x27;d estimate I spend &lt; 20 hours a year at the datacenter. Everything else is almost 1:1 with what it would take to manage that using AWS.<p>Obvious anecdata here, but it&#x27;s not hard to run a redundant physical infrastructure that is low maintenance. Obviously bad luck is a thing, but with the correct planning and setup, physical infrastructure isn&#x27;t that big of a deal for most web businesses.')
