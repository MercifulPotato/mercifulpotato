What I&#x27;m saying is the current costs should come down in the UK. It has a ruthless courier marketplace.<p>Amazon is either eating the costs (possible, granted, but odd as they don&#x27;t do it for other countries) or have got costs so low to clear that they&#x27;re not charging customers for them. Â£12 to clear a small package is obviously way over the actual cost incurred by the delivery companies.')
