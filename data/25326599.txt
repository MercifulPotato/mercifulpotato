Uninformed opinions will argue this because they&#x27;re just that... uninformed. I&#x27;m sorry but no one who has studied economics will believe this there&#x27;s zero evidence to support the idea a low-level of inflation is bad. There&#x27;s only crackpots and idiots who don&#x27;t have economics degrees, or even enough math to understand the fucking equations (which aren&#x27;t hard but also don&#x27;t always provide intuitive results).<p>In general, without some form of inflation, you end up with a deflationary spiral because people stop spending and the economy seizes up. No one will spend money if just holding it makes it more valuable. It then becomes a race to horde as much as you can for as long as you can. It&#x27;s also, quite uhhh... perplexing for me, to not increase the money supply when populations are increasing; because, they&#x27;re increasing the value of the money by increasing demand for it.<p>Central banks are the result and answer to reckless unregulated financial markets crashing, being manipulated, and destroying lives... Oh shit, kind of sounds like bitcoin, doesn&#x27;t it? Everyone does this &quot;central bank boogeyman&quot; and thinks it should go away but they all absolutely ignore why they exist in the first place.<p>There&#x27;s a ton of quality stuff to be debated in regards to economics-- this is not one of them.')
