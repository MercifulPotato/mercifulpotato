I don&#x27;t completely believe that.<p>Trusting in people&#x27;s good nature alone has never worked. If the community doesn&#x27;t implement some mechanism to control the activity it doesn&#x27;t want, then it will be done. You can refuse to believe that if you want, but I think you will find that belief challenged by reality.<p>Not coincidentally, a mechanism of control for dealing with undesirable behavior is exactly what this whole Twitter thing is about in the first place. Since we&#x27;ve agreed that people here are not inherently better than the general populace, what makes you think that HN is more immune to this sort of thing than a community like Twitter or reddit?')
