The premise here is to accumulate knowledge for the sake of knowledge itself. In my experience this isn&#x27;t productive, takes time, and is not going anywhere. There is a reason you forget things you read about - you don&#x27;t really need them and your brain does you a favour by forgetting.<p>For me - a better alternative is to only seek and store knowledge about things you are currently working on, and organise it by project. And if you read something that is actionable - do it and forget about it. Ideas are also fine, but if you have more than 3 then it can be a sign of procrastination.')
