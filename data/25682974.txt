I guess for PC and larger consoles you could use larger memory cards that might be cheaper to make. But anyway, it&#x27;s still a problematic approach since it eats into the margins unless you increase the price of the game, which most game publishers try to avoid.<p>I really like Nintendo Switch cartridges, I prefer to buy physical copies when I can, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a future in them. I kind of wish someone would make &quot;smart cards&quot; that just gives you access to the game online. Since there&#x27;s so many essential updates to games these days, that&#x27;s almost what cartridges are anyway.<p>You forgot the reference link btw.')
