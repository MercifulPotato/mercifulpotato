That ability alone is valuable and hasn&#x27;t existed until now.<p>I spent some time working in a relatively-unknown but high volume clearing bank.<p>Banks can and do move billions instantly, and have done so for years through SWIFT and ACH. It takes literal seconds for a confirmation to pass through different clearing networks around the world.<p>Even today, we&#x27;re seeing banks improve their correspondence networks with each other.<p>For example, you could have a Transferwise Account where you receive USD and convert to GBP.<p>If you wanted to move that to a Monzo account, you can do so instantly as Transferwise and Monzo have accounts either with each other or in the same institution.<p>The bank debits and credits each counterparty immediately.<p>At the end of the day, it nets its position, then sends its report to the central bank, netting positions between other participants.<p>Looking at crypto from the outside, I really don&#x27;t see the added value based on existing infrastructure.<p>It seems more like a proof of concept rather than a viable long-term asset.')
