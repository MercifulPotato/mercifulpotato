Because of the pandemic, I used ETS&#x27;s new (and temporary) at-home testing option. Someone from ProctorU watched me through my webcam the whole time, and it felt totally invasive and creepy.<p>But, what else was the ETS supposed to do?  For a high-stakes exam like the GRE, I don&#x27;t think &quot;trust people to not cheat&quot; is a viable option. That isn&#x27;t to say these remote proctoring solutions will necessarily prevent cheating either (and having now used one of these services, I think cheating would have been relatively easy), but it at least should make test takers think twice.<p>I think we can all agree that an in-person exam would have been better, but the state of the world made that untenable.')
