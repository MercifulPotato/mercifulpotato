But I mostly agree with her points...<p>Some of my most memorable experiences were staying at hotels that featured vivid colors, like the Blue House in Penang and I wish I was not renting and could decide on the colors I&#x27;d want in my space. Dull neutral colors might make decoration easy but it certainly doesn&#x27;t make it sexy.')
