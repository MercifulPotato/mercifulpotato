What that takes the form of isn&#x27;t always obvious even to those who know me. Some are making mock fun with me over the fact my Tesla is nearing three years as I do tend so swap nearly every other year if not earlier.<p>However from my 17 Volt to my 18 Tesla 3 I am now only considering BEVs, I really cannot reason myself back into a petrol powered car. With motorcycles there is no real alternative if you want to travel. For the most part they are still in &quot;Leaf&quot; tech with only dipping their toes into liquid cooling the pack and or motor. Worse is that most are useless for commuting as they don&#x27;t have storage space or wind protection; protection which would improve their aerodynamics.<p>Late 2021 promises to have a much wider selection and 2022 should be a watershed year for EVs. Car wise I would love a good four seat convertible option. To me the EV power and open air travel were just meant to go together, too bad VW doesn&#x27;t see fit to bring back the Beetle in that form as both previous incarnations were ideal for EV')
