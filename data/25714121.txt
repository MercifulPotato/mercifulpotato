Americans went to protest their elected officials and broke into the hallowed halls of insider trading. By contrast the events of the past summer are infinitely worse where Americans invaded each other&#x27;s neighborhoods and burned down and looted local businesses<p>It is disgusting how government is worshipped like it&#x27;s some kind of holy and sacred piece of society. It&#x27;s filled with the biggest crooks and criminals in the world.<p>Their lapdogs in the media assist them in covering up the worst crimes in human history. These are the folks who will take lobbyist money and make regular people suffer.<p>The alleged insurrection of last week is an escalation over the BLM and gun control and Kavanaugh protests that preceded if. Some of those saw protesters barging into offices and even the main chambers. In this case the protesters were more violent. Despite that the death toll is lower than the summer&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t remember anyone at fancy California tech companies shedding a single tear for David Dorn. Politicians have repeated incendiary rhetoric against the police which has seen police stations burned down and good men like David Dorn killed. In Seattle there was an actual occuption turned into an autonomous zone in which murders took place. Tech companies continue to allow the rhetoric associated with those movements to trend and get boosted by their platforms because their employees share the same politics. That is the only reason.<p>This sanctimony about the sacred democratic process is cover for the fact that tech companies won&#x27;t police the criminals in their own political faction. For all you know under some of the antifa masks are some devops and UI engineers. I would not be surprised to hear that some AWS team members have burned down a gas station somewhere and gotten away with it. If you work at some of these places you know you&#x27;ve overheard a lot of participation.<p>What we have here is one group of arsonists and looters working in private corporations who are turning a blind eye to their own crimes and the crimes of the people under their own banner. Rand Paul was mercilessly beaten by his neighbor but vile and toxic rhetoric from people has been retweeted millions of times with quips like &quot;I don&#x27;t agree with what his neighbour did but I understand it wink wink&quot;. If you bring this up with team members you&#x27;ll hear &quot;Rand Paul? Fuck Rand Paul&quot;.<p>Steve Scalise was shot by someone. Who radicalized him? Did he emerge in a vaccuum? Could it have been the various &quot;republicans are evil and are in league with an enemy hostile foreign power&quot; rhetoric that went on for much of 2017 and 2018? Or is it that suddenly Facebook and Twitter have no liability for the guy who shot Steve Scalise?<p>If this was a serious and sincere effort by the tech companies we would have seen it earlier. Instead it&#x27;s coordinated and unidirectional and frankly they picked the least outrageous violent political event in the last 4 years because of the hype that has been surrounding it thanks to the amplification of it. They are writing &quot;we banned person X because we INTERPRET Y to mean Z&quot;. The plain words can&#x27;t be taken into consideration because they&#x27;re exculpatory so even the policing is subjective and opinionated. Post hoc ergo propter hoc therefore we are doing this. Anyone who criticizes us is a terrorist.<p>The war on terror was so honest and effective right? Congratulations on supporting the war on domestic terror. If these global megacorporations that control the flow of thoughts into the brains of most people into the world are mere &quot;private companies&quot; this is a perverse view of reality. These are much more powerful than any government on the planet in terms of their ability to influence, and they are insincerely applying enforcement actions to protect the arsonists and looters in their own employee base.')
