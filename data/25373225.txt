I&#x27;ve had a little exposure to bank&#x27;s competence from the inside 20 years ago (large UK bank, mortgages), they couldn&#x27;t find their own arse with a torch, arrows, diagrams and a PhD in arse-finding.<p>&gt; &#x27;ll just rephrase things to something less offensive: you&#x27;re not &quot;hurting&quot; yourself, you&#x27;re limiting yourself, sometimes with drawbacks not everyone is able&#x2F;willing to endure.<p>That&#x27;s much more accurate. We can agree, however consider that that &#x27;limiting [my]self&#x27; means limiting my exposure to ads, abuse of my CPU, tracking, most dark patterns, nag screens, malware and more. The tradeoff&#x27;s very ok for me, and I&#x27;ve experience the web on both sides. Oh yes it&#x27;s worth it! (for me).')
