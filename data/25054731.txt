Also, commenters that are actually shadowbanned (which is a thing that happens, to be clear) show up to users who choose to have them appear. These users can “vouch” for your posts if they look reasonable and get you unbanned. So you’re not completely out of luck if you end up in such a situation.<p>Also, usually asking the moderators though email works as a way to get your questions answered.')
