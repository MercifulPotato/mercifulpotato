You did good work for the community -- they wanted the link to the trailer as quickly as possible and you engineered a solution to give them that.  They said &quot;thank you&quot; in return.<p>I understand the &quot;anyone could have done that&quot; or &quot;they could have just waited 3 seconds longer&quot; arguments... but you actually did it, and did it 3 seconds faster than anyone else, so they got a better &quot;product&quot; and you got some internet points.  Not a bad deal, in my mind.  It&#x27;s almost a little heartwarming.')
