The first is cause for celebration; the second just means that instead of struggling to afford a home, they&#x27;ll struggle to afford <i>anything</i>.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the second is closer to the truth.  Homebuying is close to where money is injected into the economy: when the Fed drops interest rates, mortgage rates drop, the home price you can afford for a given income goes up, and housing prices go up to compensate (particularly in land-constrained areas like Vancouver or the SF Bay).  Other industries like food don&#x27;t go up until that money has had a chance to circulate through the economy and make it to the average food buyer.  I&#x27;d expect to see large increases in the CPI over the next decade, with housing last decade being a harbinger.')
