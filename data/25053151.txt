My wife has an 8GB MacBook Pro and I&#x27;m always shocked by how many open tabs she keeps in Chrome and how many Office documents are open at any given time.<p>My 16GB MBP is constraining sometimes and the next one will, doubtlessly, come with at least 32GB. Until Apple can do that, I won&#x27;t use an ARM-based Mac as my daily driver.<p>As for the 8-core, it&#x27;s 4 beefy ones and 4 low-power ones. Load will shift from one kind to the other according to usage patterns. This is how they achieve that 20-hour battery life.')
