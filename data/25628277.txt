Ultimately a requirement for academic labs is that you need to find a way to pay for your own research, because there just isn&#x27;t money otherwise. Schools provide some startup funds to early career professors to get things going and equipment purchased, maybe a few salaries covered for a time, but the expectation is that they start securing their own funding themselves by writing grants to funding agencies calling for research in certain areas. This is why most Principle Investigators (PIs) are in their offices writing grants and keeping up with calls for proposals from funding agencies, and not in the lab toiling over experiments; gotta keep the funding coming and everyone under your wing employed. In my experience when PIs failed to secure grant money, at that point the lab had already spooled down and there isn&#x27;t any more salaries to pay, and they usually just transitioned to a teaching professor role or a more administrative role in the department, covering their salary through those efforts rather than grant funding.')
