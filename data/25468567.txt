Part of that coordination is that the sender measures 2 classical bits of information on their entangled qubit and transmits those two classical bits to the receiver. Then the receiver uses those two bits to perform certain operations on <i>their</i> half of the entangled qubit pair in such a way that their qubit is now exactly the same as sender&#x27;s original qubit. As you can see, there&#x27;s no way to use timing in this, other than the timing of the classical bits being transferred.')
