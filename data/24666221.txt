I love self-service being available on my terms.<p>This shouldn&#x27;t be the <i>only</i> option; &quot;self-service or no service&quot; is not my goal, but I appreciate the fact that 8 self-service lanes can allow a lot of customers to check out without waiting and in an affordable fashion. (Customers are paying for all the labor in any enduring company.)<p>The checkout-free store (like Amazon Go) is of course even better than a self-checkout in terms of customer experience.')
