They perceived that women who used more feminine language are more hirable than women who used less feminine terms. There was no difference for men. As for likeability, the managers perceived that women who used less feminine language were significantly less likeable than woman who used more feminine terms. Men who used more feminine language also were perceived as more likeable than men who did not.<p>It seems we might infer that &quot;likeability&quot; is considered important in &quot;hireability&quot; for women <i>but not</i> men. What I like is that there should be other ways to test this hypothesis that don&#x27;t involve cover letters.')
