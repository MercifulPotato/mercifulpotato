I use org-mode for some notes and sometimes open-junk-file (that I discovered in in Spacemacs). What I miss is a tool that will help me keep some notes encrypted at rest but will allow me to search filenames _and_ content. nb seems to support searching, and encryption, but not the two in combination.')
