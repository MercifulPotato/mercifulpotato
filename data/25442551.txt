From my observations, the right-wing love trickledown. Curious if you could provide me an example where right-wing are against this.<p>The reality is that the economy is very complex. At the same time as &#x27;trickle down economics&#x27; you had hyperglobalization from china&#x27;s free trade zones and adoption of capitalism. You had global egalitarianism greatly increasing the supply of labour. You also have the reality that trickle down economics never fully implemented.<p>How can a study control for all of these gigantic variables? If the study cannot, they cannot come to any conclusions.<p>Lets step back for a second and look at globalization alone. When china implemented capitalism and their free trade zones attracted heavy foreign investment whose goal was to obtain cheap labour in china. Every big corp moved there, remember nike and their slave child labour? Or for that matter all the others as well.<p>Factories dont exist in north america anymore except for costly transportation markets. In order to attract those jobs back, you must compete with the tax rates of those places with very low taxes. globalization means tax rates must reduce.')
