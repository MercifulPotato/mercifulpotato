Item(by='thewebcount', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602801219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24790343, text='&gt; Most prominent example is Youtube, where there is an option for an ad-free experience which is decently priced. And yet, the adoption is very low and you still see people complaining about ads on Youtube all the time.<p>For me, this is similar to why I won&#x27;t pay for the New York Times subscription, either. I mainly only do stuff on both sites when I find a link to their site. I don&#x27;t go to their site to do stuff on my own. Why would I subscribe to a site that I don&#x27;t go to on my own? I do subscribe to ArsTechnica, for example, because I go there frequently.<p>Furthermore, I might not mind ads, but the ads on YouTube are very obnoxious. There&#x27;s no intelligence, so you get weird situations like watching a 2 minute ad before being able to watch a 30 second video. Or ads cutting off the speaker mid word. Who thinks that&#x27;s a good experience? If they can&#x27;t get that stuff right, why would I pay them?<p>And on top of that, I find YouTube&#x27;s &quot;Hey did you know you can pay us money now?!?!?!&quot; pop-ups all over the page to be obnoxious enough that I have decided I will never pay them any money.<p>Were I a regular visitor who wasn&#x27;t so off-put by their ham-fisted advertising, I might have considered it, but now they&#x27;ve made going to their site so unpleasant I just avoid it if I can, or hold my nose for a few minutes when watching something with ads. Then I get away from their site as quickly as possible.')
