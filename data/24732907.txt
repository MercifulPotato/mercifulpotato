You are stating what personally meets your criteria.  You are mis-stating my position though.<p>I&#x27;m stating an absolute position - that you don&#x27;t know a thing until you have proved it to yourself.  Its kind of self evident.  Its so self-evident that people think they know it.  But they don&#x27;t realise that watching something in a video or on TV is not evidence.  Its the illusion of evidence.  It kids people into thinking they &#x27;know&#x27;, but the truth is that they have beliefs.<p>You are expressing a practical approach.  This is interesting too - you want to get as much solid info for the effort.  You are taking a pragmatic belief system approach to navigating reality.  Your practical approach, doesn&#x27;t need facts or truth.  It is happy to have things that are useful or not - its about utility.   At least this is proactive.<p>I&#x27;m stating a fact - that you don&#x27;t know a thing, until you have verified it personally.  Knowledge and what qualifies it as such to any individual - is a point that is missed by most.  I&#x27;m stating something about truth and how we know it or not.<p>You also say:<p>&quot;having to prove everything from first principles before accepting its validity is a huge waste of time and effort.&quot;<p>I agree.  I&#x27;m not saying that you should do that.  I&#x27;m saying that people need to recognise when they are believing something on the basis of no evidence that they misunderstand as evidence (ie seeing something on TV), and when they have verified something personally.<p>I&#x27;m fine to say, that I don&#x27;t know.  Many things.  The shape of the earth.  That viruses exist.  I know there are theories (sphere, flat earth, viruses, microsomes) - but I&#x27;m not going to mis-represent the state of my knowledge.  I simply don&#x27;t know.  I haven&#x27;t been in space, I haven&#x27;t verified it myself.  I haven&#x27;t seen a virus.  I&#x27;m not going to pretend to have knowledge that I don&#x27;t.  I contrast this with others who say they &#x27;know&#x27; when they are kidding themselves and others.<p>Anyway, I think Magritte said it best:<p>&quot;Ceci n&#x27;est pas une pipe&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Treachery_of_Images" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Treachery_of_Images</a>')
