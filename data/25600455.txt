Whether those words are negotiation tactics for the hiring process, or language to suggest for a prospective employment agreement, ContractPatch helps developers defend their own interests.<p>Instead of a reactive strategy requiring individual developers to negotiate, a proactive solution might be better.<p>Create a certification for employers as open source friendly based on their employment contracts. Make a website where developers can see if the company they are looking at is certified open source friendly. And it will likely be more effective if recruiters start hearing from a lot of their prospects that the company isn’t being considered because they are not certified.<p>This will likely go further than requiring individual developers to have to negotiate it as a one off every time. There is power in collective action.')
