But it&#x27;s possible to hit this button again and re-enable Cloudflare forwarding temporarily if we find ourselves under attack, so I figure this is a good option.<p>Without this enabled, attackers know what your backend IP address is, so even if you enabled it later, they could continue to DDOS your IP directly, without doing a DNS lookup.<p>You&#x27;d only get what you want if you both re-enabled this <i>and</i> switched to different IP addresses.')
