Did a 4 hour stint once myself years ago.  Couple of dudes went the next day and got in and out.  Voting on the proper day is usually fairly easy enough.  Most employers work with you to do so.  One time it was a 1 hour wait on election day.  Few years later it took less than 20 mins total from parking going in and driving off.  All at the same location.  Early voting locations have a secondary issue as they usually have an amalgamation of several districts.  So the biggest hold up is making sure you have the correct ballot.  As depending on where you are at you may have a different ballot per precinct.  I may be in district &#x27;xyz&#x27; for this congress man but not on the ballot for the mayor of the city because I do not live in a city.  That sort of thing.')
