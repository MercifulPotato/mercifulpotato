Nothing techy.<p>Today I work remotely for a company based in California, but previously I&#x27;ve worked at several local firms, largely B2B, contract and full time. We are actually moving somewhere out west, for non professional reasons.<p>For my particular slice of the Midwest:<p>Pros:<p>- Local jobs do exist, especially around a few urban centers<p>- Your wages go further here, especially if you earn a coastal salary<p>- Maybe local companies are a little more WLB oriented<p>Cons:<p>- Local jobs are largely around a few very specific industries (ag, insurance)<p>- Your org might run a little differently than you&#x27;d expect coming from the valley (dress codes, non technical leadership, older tech and older deployment practices)<p>- less &quot;to do&quot;, and fewer takeout options<p>Nothing too unexpected, and you have the same pros and cons of normal remote work. Lot of freedom, limited social interaction.')
