It might even be easier than back then if you consider using mesh wireless technology.<p>Smartphones aren&#x27;t the internet. They&#x27;re regulated endpoints within a restricted network which is itself connected to the internet. Just because these extremely limited little devices we carry in our pockets had their access cut off, and just because a lot of home users can&#x27;t just open a browser and start browsing without talking to their neighbors, doesn&#x27;t mean the internet can&#x27;t successfully route around it. It just takes time and effort.<p>I still believe the quote to be true.')
