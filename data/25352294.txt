I got paid to play cocktail hours, charity events, contra dances, and folk festivals. These were once in a while gigs, netting me usually 100-150 on average. I took home 3k total over years of doing this.<p>To record would&#x27;ve been a whole new world. Either shell out a years&#x27; plus worth of performance wages to get an album made, or use my coding gig to prop it up. I decided I am only good, not great, and meager streaming revenue and occasional $20 buys couldn&#x27;t be worth it.<p>In summary, play music for fun. If you see anyone making a decent wage off music, great for them, but unless you&#x27;re prodigious or attractive or well connected, it&#x27;s a 1% craps-shoot.')
