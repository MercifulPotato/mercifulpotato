I&#x27;m rather on the &quot;minimal language core&quot; side in this discussion and I think it&#x27;d be better to not start adding more things in Julia Base and stdlib.  At least not right now, to avoid accumulating &quot;dead batteries.&quot;  There are some non-trivial things to figure out for a composable data-parallel interface.  For example, what the data collection interface should be to support folds over them?  I&#x27;m using a minimalistic interface defined in SplittablesBase.jl for this but it&#x27;s not wildly used outside my packages.  So I&#x27;m not super confident that it&#x27;s enough yet.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaFolds&#x2F;SplittablesBase.jl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaFolds&#x2F;SplittablesBase.jl</a>')
