Rather, Twitter said it experienced a technical glitch which caused some 600,000 accounts including those of some Democratic politicians—not to be auto-suggested when people searched for them.<p>&gt; The problem grew out of Twitter’s efforts beginning more than a year earlier to remove or down-rank low-quality and harassing accounts. What apparently happened was that large numbers of these disfavored accounts had inter acted with the Republican politicians’ accounts. This caused Twitter’s search system not to auto-suggest the Republicans, the company said. The malfunction, which never had to do with bias against politicians of either party, was fixed within 24 hours. 40 But the claims of partisanship related to the episode have continued to echo years later.<p>So, they&#x27;re not shadow-banning anyone, but they&#x27;re shadow-banning. Nice gaslighting.')
