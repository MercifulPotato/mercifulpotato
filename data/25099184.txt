But the emerging isolation&#x2F;depression in my social circles due to governmental restrictions starts to worry me. A vaccine could help obviously; however atm it feels more like the carrot in front of the donkey.<p>So what do you think are some paths to go now that provide people some sort of &quot;social life&quot;? I thought about starting an online community project, though it&#x27;s just a vague idea and personally, I&#x27;d prefer ideas which don&#x27;t involve additional screen-time.<p>(Creative approaches on how to get the pandemic under control without sacrificing even more social life are appreciated as well).')
