If that works, you&#x27;ll also &quot;come out ahead&quot;. But it usually doesn&#x27;t, I guess. For taxation, you might consider stock market investments a similar thing &quot;oh sure, I spend money here, but by doing so I stimulate the economy and I get dividends from my shares&quot;. Of course, they can&#x27;t just declare themselves shareholders of other companies and send in the cops to collect money, that&#x27;s a state-level privilege.')
