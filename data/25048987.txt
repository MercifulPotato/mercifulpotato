Item(by='darekkay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605031660, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25048465, text='&gt; I want my personal history to be the truth, not some convenient fiction.<p>I am mostly using the Git history when going through past changes. Why does this line do X? I just git blame this line and see exactly what happened. This is the time I really hate all those &quot;oops, fixed mistake&quot; and &quot;forgot this change&quot; commits. I don&#x27;t care about those things, even if it&#x27;s the &quot;truth&quot;. They&#x27;re just useless and distracting. Doing an amend&#x2F;rebase&#x2F;squash would have been perfectly fine in such a scenario. I have written more about rewriting Git history here [1].<p>&gt; In a team environment, somebody always insists on using rebase and then invariably they push a rebase to master and hijinks ensue. I wish there was a fork of git with rebase disabled.<p>That&#x27;s why shared branches like master are usually protected, so you cannot push an alternative history.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;darekkay.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;git-rewriting-history&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;darekkay.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;git-rewriting-history&#x2F;</a>')
