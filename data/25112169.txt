Especially if you are in this state. On your girl sorry man pretty shitty to do it the day after your birthday. But the reality is she is gone, women rarely come back get it in your mind that she is gone and free yourself from it. I know that is easier said than done, but the point is to get back to happy and hanging onto that is not going to get you there. Shit if you have to hire escorts every damn day until it makes the though of her fade. Seriously you need to do something to make that fade, do not hold onto hope there. Focus on your job, make it the #1 priority, ensure that you have done a good job there before you move on to other things such as browsing the web. Finally find an interest, get involved in it, and meet people with similar interests, try to avoid sitting in the house alone until you feel like you have found balance and are comfortable in your own skin sitting alone at home. As I tell everyone in this situation, my contact info is in my HN profile, you can ping me if you just need someone to talk to, sometimes strangers are the best people to talk to.')
