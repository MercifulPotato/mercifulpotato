I could blubber about it not having power conjunctions or self intervals or whatever if I wanted Golang to be J, which would be a similarly moronic roster of complaints. In reality golang is a basket of compromises like any other programming language. There&#x27;s vastly more good stuff built in it than Haskell, despite Haskell being older and more theoretically amazing, so they must be doing something right.<p>His only criticism that resonated with me was go get defaulting to head, which befuddled me when I first saw it, but that&#x27;s a compromise too; one oriented to the large codebases that golang is designed for. It&#x27;s actually a pretty good compromise compared to the propeller head Haskell dork <i>&quot;Things break backwards compatibility in Haskell, and the users just update their code because they know the library author did it for a reason.&quot;</i> -aka this appears to be a statement from an academic wanker who obviously never had to ship on a timeline in <i>his entire fucking life.</i>')
