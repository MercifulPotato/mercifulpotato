I’ve visited Rome a few times and most of the areas in the video I know quite well, it was really fun to see a visualization of the old buildings. The Pompeii theatre blew my mind!<p>I wish they’d done the pantheon though. I know it wouldn’t be as impressive as the other renders – Forum Romanum was amazing – but I’d love to see the front of it intact with the gold ornaments and what not. Great video nonetheless!')
