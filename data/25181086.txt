(and I say this even though I&#x27;ve got a friend boycotting them because he says their hiring practices are outright racist)<p>I&#x27;ve got stuff from them, even large quantities of stuff. I leaned on them for special pricing seeing as I was spending thousands of dollars with them, and got some traction with that: moderate extra discounts and price breaks. I didn&#x27;t like the candy thing, so I told them not to do that. They stopped doing that.<p>They badgered me to see if everything was okay. I got phone calls while I was making livestreams, stuff like that. I told them not to do that: in fact, to never speak to me again and I would call THEM if I wanted to get anything else. They stopped badgering me.<p>It&#x27;s been maybe a year now. Not a phone call.<p>I did also tell them not to send me postal mail advertising either, because I will just recycle it. They have not honored that one. So: their service extends to listening when you tell them NOT to badger you for more sales, and they listen ALMOST completely.')
