What you have deacribed is not at all how Target operates.<p>You&#x27;ve inverted the dependency of the relationship. People don&#x27;t buy Nabisco because it&#x27;s at Target; they go to Target because it has Nabisco products, hopefully for cheaper than other stores.<p>Thus, stores absolutely pay for every item of inventory that appears on their shelves except for some new products that might have special consignment arrangements.<p>Suppliers do not pay for better shelf placement. Stores determine that based on sell through and margin; the products that generate the best overall revenue get the best placement on the shelves.<p>Suppliers will pay for in store marketing, like displays, etc. This is usually a separate term for which no money changes hands or which offsets part of the invoice. They may also pay stores for analytics, but most stores provide that for free since it is in their interests to have better selling products.')
