It reminds me of the “HTTP server in one line” which essentially executes a pre-made HTTP server that’s part of Python’s standard library. Writing glue code that is small is a sort of expected feature. Writing one without depending on your stdlib is what’s hard.<p>Edit: just checked on one of my projects. Looks like about 600 lines of C for an HTTP server that only uses stdlib’s memory allocation and string manipulation functions as well as socket IO. For an additional 20 or so it works over HTTPS. That was rather difficult to write and I’m sure has at least two bug I am not seeing.
