Then people just don&#x27;t know how to take care of them. I had a neighbor that left their dog outside for hours barking. such a nuisance for no reason, and that dog must have been living a miserable life. we keep breeding chihuahuas that no one wants, pitbulls that can&#x27;t be adopted, and some of these pure breeds like bulldogs are just miserable, other pure breeds have health issues.<p>Cats we&#x27;re already talking about.')
