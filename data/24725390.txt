It&#x27;s wrong that anyone should have their domain ripped like that because a large company willed it, but there is no self awareness they are being given the same treatment they want to impose on others.<p>And as far as censorship goes, its completely non obvious that Facebook&#x27;s Oversight Board is completely different than the Real Facebook Oversight Board. As chair of Real Vice Oversight Board, they&#x27;re ethically in the wrong even if they shouldn&#x27;t be censored.')
