But there does not appear to be evidence that this happened.<p>Instead, they have collected evidence that she allegedly downloaded some data from the state with peoples&#x27; information on it. It&#x27;s not clear how good their evidence is, but this is pretty different than what they alleged earlier, and different than what the warrant was for, so it looks like Florida prosecutors are fishing for any sort of crime they can stick to her.<p>Jones says she had been asked to manipulate COVID data as part of her responsibility of running the FL COVID dashboard, which she refused to do. When she was fired, she started her own dashboard, and criticized the integrity of official dashboard data, which upset officials.')
