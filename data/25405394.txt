But then she should have been more thoughtful and opted for not reporting the story at all, like it&#x27;s usually done. If only Fox news is reporting it, the news is easily ignored by liberals. If Bloomberg starts reporting it, even if ends up with a counter, it&#x27;s still seen by a lot of liberals, some of whom may be able to spot what&#x27;s going on.<p>From a Chinese court point of view, her intentions were pro-China (she&#x27;s working for Bloomberg afterall) but still she could be charged for negligence. Hope it&#x27;s just some jail time and not a death sentence.')
