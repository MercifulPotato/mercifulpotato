I&#x27;m not sure how much the old brain affects it or at what age it cuts off. But people that put in the time or are in the right environment can pick up a language in months. Polyglots do it all the time, and they aren&#x27;t geniuses, they just found methods that worked for them and have fun with it.<p>I just don&#x27;t think there are popular good methods out there. The most successful is complete immersion, but that&#x27;s extremely hard to be in that situation. Most people want to learn a language for fun. People first default is to rely on Duolingo but everyone I talked to don&#x27;t learn anything from it even after using it for hundreds of days.<p>I get by with Anki, but definitely helps to have native speaker nearby to help and practice.')
