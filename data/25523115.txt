It tried to _implicate_ the architecture as a tool of facism, which is a bananas theory to me.<p>&gt; &quot;Even more problematically, the techniques of fascist architecture (or music or film or graphic design) may in fact be so powerful that they transcend history and even geo-politics: this is not just a “Nazi problem” we can relegate to the past. These tools work for fascists, but non-fascists are tempted to use them as well.&quot;<p>But it was a style of the times that a facist adopted. That, oh god, may have come from america!<p>&gt; &quot;Further complicating the story, the influence actually runs in multiple directions: in addition to admiring Haussmann’s Paris and classical Rome, Speer was a big fan of L’Enfant’s monumental plan for Washington, DC — so where are the roots of the problem?.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;As Dietmar Schirmer has noted, much of the best architecture from the period — whether in Berlin, Paris, or Washington, DC — employs the “Stripped Classicism” favored by Speer.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;But perhaps we need to feel the shock and try to push back on the awe: even if these structures are glorious, do we endorse the beliefs they embody?&quot;<p>Well thanks for trying to cancel 1940s architecture, and warn me away from admiring the very art you brought to me in this article.')
