Like in Amazon, I see this as a web extension that could be super useful like honey.  I wouldn&#x27;t use honey nearly as much if it didn&#x27;t integrate with Amazon, but it does so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.<p>I know that&#x27;s a ton of work, not a minor suggestion but it would be super cool.')
