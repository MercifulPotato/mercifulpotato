He said at stop lights the only reason he knew which was green and which was red was because of the layout.  But when he went to states with sideways lights, he&#x27;d just wait until the people behind him honked until he figured out which was red and which was green.<p>But as an electronics teacher, it was extra problematic, because resistors are labeled by color bands.  So he would constantly quiz us on that by randomly asking us what the resistance was, because he needed to know for his own projects!<p>He also said a lot of warning labels on woodshop equipment was bad because they depended on being able to tell the difference between R and G.<p>I learned very early in life that any UI that uses red and green as a differentiator is bad.')
