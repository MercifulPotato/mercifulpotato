Item(by='bhupy', descendants=None, kids=[24679254], score=None, time=1601820347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679061, text='&gt; I mean, in theory, democracy ensures that inefficient leaders lose office, except that reality rarely lives up to theory.<p>It&#x27;s not just replacing inefficient leaders that&#x27;s an important mechanism for &quot;efficiency&quot;, it&#x27;s also restructuring organizations. Democracy, at best, just means that you have different leaders, but the mostly the same set of bureaucrats operating the same programs. Private enterprises, on the other hand, allow us to whole-sale replace entire purveyors of goods &amp; services with entirely different structures of organization in a manner that&#x27;s difficult to reproduce for a monolithic public monopoly.<p>Imagine what retail would have been like if, instead of Sears being essentially replaced, we just elected a different set of leaders to run the same organization.<p>&gt; IRL, the business models of most major tech companies are pretty impervious to most inefficiency.<p>When a business is unable to collect enough money to continue operating, it goes out of business. Almost no major tech company has been able to continue operating without either sustaining themselves, or collecting investment.<p>&gt; Most of their leadership is beyond the reach of shareholder discipline too. Monopoly makes a good moat.<p>Sure, and monopolies are bad for the same reason. But most industries aren&#x27;t run by monopolies. You only hear about the ones that are, because they&#x27;re so noteworthy.<p>&gt; Sure &quot;some&quot; mechanism exists for them to go out of business. That&#x27;s about as useful as the ballot for creating efficiency.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true at all. You can count on one hand the government programs that have gone defunct in the last 60 years. The number of private enterprises that have gone bankrupt, defunct, or M&amp;A’d out of existence over the same timespan is almost countless.<p>You&#x27;re 100% right about the banks and bailouts, though. That&#x27;s not a private enterprise problem, though — that&#x27;s a &quot;our government is doing a stupid thing&quot; problem.')
