Even though I probably watch more Twitch streams than YouTube, I still wouldn&#x27;t consider paying for the Twitch equivalent because YouTube has so many useful videos (tutorials, lectures, historical photage, interviews, seminars etc.), while Twitch is 99.99% entertainment. I use the ads on Twitch as deterrence to get me back to watching something of substance instead.')
