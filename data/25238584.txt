The convenience can&#x27;t be understated, especially as it&#x27;s not really apparent until you start buying a lot from a site like Amazon.<p>I didn&#x27;t realize I hate shopping in a physical store until I started using Amazon. You spend 99% of your time either wandering through aisles trying to find what you want (which they usually don&#x27;t have) or waiting in the checkout line.<p>Neither of those things apply to online shopping. The biggest hassle when shopping online is having to login and navigate to dozens, if not hundreds of different websites, re-entering your personal info each time. But a site like Amazon is the Internet equivalent of a department store that has everything, so you only have to login once.<p>Even if Amazon&#x27;s prices are the same as physical stores, or even a little more, the time I save not having to drive in traffic and waste walking around a store or standing in lines still makes it worthwhile.')
