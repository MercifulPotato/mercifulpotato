So when you &quot;rotate&quot; a four-vector, it actually follows the surface of a hyperboloid rather than a sphere, which means that <i>rotation has a discontinuity</i> at Θ = π&#x2F;4 (in normalized units) and the vector escapes to infinity! Only massless objects can travel &quot;at the speed of π&#x2F;4&quot;, everything else can only approach but never reach that speed.')
