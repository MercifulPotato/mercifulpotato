Here is why :<p>Not really. I&#x27;m going to use some vaguely marxian terms here because it&#x27;s the only framework that applies both to centrally planned economies and market economies, but I won&#x27;t be using any explicitly marxian theories, correct or not.<p>So, let&#x27;s say that a member of the capitalist class (shareholder) sees their profit drop or even go negative as a consequence of the misallocation of the resources.<p>This reduction in profit without any benefit anywhere else means that the capitalist cannot increase their amount of capital. Assuming a more or less fixed rate of profit otherwise, this decrease in the amount of constant capital means that the amount of variable capital (labour) necessary to produce the same commodity is going to be higher, which means that it will cost more labour to buy and produce.<p>It will also mean that it is less likely that the capitalist class will increase variable capital, which would increase the monetary price of labour as demand increases, which means that wages are depressed for non-producible items such as land even at the same profit rate.<p>Finally, it might push the capitalist to reduce their profit rate in order to catch up to the competition, which might in turn push them to reduce their profit rate as they have more of a margin, which can lead to various crises down the line.<p>In the end, in capitalism, everyone pays for the errors of the shareholders, perhaps even more than the shareholder class themselves.')
