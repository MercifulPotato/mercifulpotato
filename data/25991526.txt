The article doesn’t answer this question or even indicate whether they tried. So there’s no real reason to report on this other than to link the cultists and hn_throwaway. Actually, the reason is that more students will read the article trying to learn about this cultist thing and hn_throwaway’s recent activity that made them popular among kids.')
