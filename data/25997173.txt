I think all the great work you’re doing on this is at risk of being diminished by pushing the DataDog comparison so hard when really there is (currently) no comparison in my view.<p>Not to say you won’t get there, but why not shout about your current strengths right now (if you’re going to talk about the product) and not necessarily where you <i>hope</i> to be.<p>I only make this point because the “open source DataDog” headline just spins me off in the complete wrong direction as a newcomer and I end up confused and somewhat underwhelmed. With better positioning this wouldn’t have been the case!<p>That said, the project looks v interesting so keep up the good work and I hope you take my constructive criticism in the way it’s intended!')
