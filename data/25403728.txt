I think my brain has become somewhat immune to visual lag effects. The one issue I have had is that one of the monitors on USB-C (HDMI connected monitor has always been fine) seems have some sort of bug waking up sometimes, that I can only solve by powering it off and back on. Irritating. Not sure if it&#x27;s the monitor or the Mac. I&#x27;d say the Mac, as I never had this issue with the MBP.<p>Also, the colour profile&#x2F;difference between two identical monitors, one connected on HDMI, one on USB-C was startling. No idea why... I had to spend 20 minutes with Apples advanced calibration tool get them to match up. Even selecting the same colour profiles on both monitors gave a staggering difference in colour representation which I found very odd.')
