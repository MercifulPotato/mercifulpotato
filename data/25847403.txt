I&#x27;ll stay in C&#x2F;C++ until its ready then - I look forward to not needing to prototype in one language and implement in another, but for now the biggest motivator is how easy it is to do spectral&#x2F;cepstral things in MATLAB (bit of a pain to write windowing code in C++, hard to test, and easy to get wrong).<p>Why COM (and is it actually COM, or is it COM-inspired like VST3)? It&#x27;s a bit of a pain to interface with it from hosting languages (C is much more straightforward, particularly when worrying about C++ exception safety and garbage collection).')
