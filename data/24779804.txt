They just have to convince a fresh college grad or visa applicant to sign say a 2-year contract, and that person may not realize quite what they&#x27;re signing until they&#x27;re put on a project<p>Edit: I wasn&#x27;t trying to disagree with you if it sounded like I was. I meant this as &quot;in addition to what you said&quot; not &quot;instead of what you said&quot;')
