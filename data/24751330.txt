A reversible circuit has exactly as many outputs as inputs, assigning one output pattern to every input pattern and vice versa. That means each input can be reconstructed from the output; no bits are lost, so reversible circuits will not give off heat from bit loss. Furthermore, reversible circuits can simulate standard logic functions and can therefore be used in any computer.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanscientist.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;computers-that-can-run-backwards" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanscientist.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;computers-that-can...</a>')
