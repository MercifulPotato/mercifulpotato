Not sure how to get there.<p>IMO the democrats did themselves a big disservice by having such popular alternatives to both trump _and_ biden.<p>eg: yang was popular, sanders was popular, harris was popular. People wanted their candidate to be running for president, and were left with re-evaluating who they&#x27;d vote for (trump or biden) when their favorite was cut.<p>I really think the presidential election needs the following reforms:<p>Electoral votes map to popular vote in each state.<p>Runoff voting allowing parties to run multiple candidates without fearing the dilution of a &quot;leader&quot; (eg One could have voted &quot;Yang, Sanders, Harris, Biden&quot; and still be generally assured their vote benefitted their party.<p>Minor parties such as green + libertarian need to be invited to debates.')
