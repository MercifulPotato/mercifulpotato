They have higher life expectancy, and get to spend more time with their children. The reason for that is that they have the better bargaining position when it comes to the division of labor, because they have the wombs. Basically men have to offer to provide for them in exchange for women bearing their children. Some other aspects of physiognomy, too, like body strength - basically nature decided some of the division of labor for us long before humans gave it a conscious thought. Like it would have made little sense to send the women out to defend their village against neighboring tribes, while the men stayed at home to nurse the children.<p>The one place where they historically had the shorter end of the stick is the high risk of dying in childbirth. Things have improved much with regard to that, though.')
