Apple end-to-end encrypts your health data, so I trust their stewardship more than most other companies (including Garmin, who recently fell victim to a ransomware attack). And IMO Apple does a superior job supporting their previous-generation devices: They&#x27;ll replace an old Watch battery for a low, fixed fee, and to my knowledge they generally make new watchOS features available to older devices.<p>But I&#x27;ve worn my Garmin Fenix 5 Plus for the last couple years, and there&#x27;s no way any existing version of the Apple Watch could replace it for me:<p>- It has a transflective LCD display that, while not as pretty as Apple Watch&#x27;s, is brilliantly visible in the brightest of daylight.<p>- The battery lasts more than a week when not using GPS.<p>- It communicates with all my bicycle accessories over ANT+, so I don&#x27;t need to take my bike computer with me to record a short ride.<p>- It has a button-operated user interface, so it&#x27;s still perfectly usable when I&#x27;m sweaty and in the middle of an activity.<p>- It has a nearly indestructible sapphire crystal.<p>I was eagerly following Apple Watch Series 6&#x27;s release. But given that they still haven&#x27;t fixed their battery life, it&#x27;s very likely my next watch will be a newer Garmin.')
