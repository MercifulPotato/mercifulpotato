What can I _not_ do with Rust, Go, Java that I am allowed to with Nim, Python, or C&#x2F;C++? What license or restrictions on distribution of my work product is prevented with any of them?<p>Too many people forget or are not aware that good C&#x2F;C++ compilers used to be commercial and expensive, they were independent in idea only and evolved today to be independent of any commercial entity. If I wanted to develop performant executables I may have had to purchase an expensive compiler, and abide by its license. If anything, languages are far more independent today than they were.')
