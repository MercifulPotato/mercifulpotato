Item(by='tempestn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609045318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25548843, text='The nice thing about the mRNA vaccines is that while that tech hasn&#x27;t been used in an approved vaccine before, it has been used in other treatments, and there&#x27;s no real mechanism for there to be long term side effects. The vaccine and the proteins it causes to be produced are only in your system for a limited time period.  Long term side effects are more of a concern for medications that are taken on an ongoing basis.<p>Currently if I had the choice I&#x27;d go for the Pfizer vaccine hands down, given the superior efficacy in testing.  (That said, beggars can&#x27;t be choosers, so I&#x27;d take any approved vaccine I could get...)')
