Any classification system has false positives and false negatives. That&#x27;s just the starting point: whatever system is built will need some process for handling (or not) the bad classifications.<p>Furthermore, in this specific area, the &#x27;true&#x27; boundary depends on the cultural position of the specific viewer. What you call porn, I might call an instructional breast feeding video (to cite a specific example that caused a lot of headaches for facebook, some years ago). So there is no single &#x27;correct&#x27; classification, meaning that the boundary must be porous. Wherever you set the boundary is going to piss off some people; eventually you&#x27;re left just trying to find something that works OK for most of your stakeholders. It is, by necessity, a compromise.<p>Finally, abuse is basically unavoidable on large-enough platforms. People ABSOLUTELY search for the loopholes and push the boundaries, constantly, anywhere they can. So not only do you have a hard classification problem with a subjective boundary, you have a hard &#x2F;adversarial&#x2F; classification problem. (Engineers build bridges to withstand occasional earthquakes. Software engineers have to build bridges to withstand constant terrorist attacks.)<p>So, it&#x27;s a fundamentally hard problem, with no single optimal solution. It&#x27;s easy to get in a huff, and much harder to do the actual work. This, to me, looks like an educational carveout getting abused, and nothing more. The loophole will likely get closed as it gets attention, which is kinda just how these things work. Abusers find new ways to get around the existing systems (because it is fundamentally impossible to predict every edge case), and the people building+running the systems eventually notice and react.<p>But let&#x27;s step back and consider your alternative explanation... Somehow allowing nude yoga videos is a power trip on the part of the moderators, which will help them obtain one more step on the stairway to world domination? Come on.')
