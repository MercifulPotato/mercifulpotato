The whole reason the notion of free speech exists is that people should be able to say things that other people don&#x27;t like. Saying that we&#x27;d be able to have free speech absolutism if only people didn&#x27;t say or do X is just &quot;X is unacceptable speech&quot; in disguise. If you exclude &quot;bad&quot; speech, freedom of speech is easy!<p>This thread originated with a comment saying it would be ideologically inconsistent for Pirate Bay&#x27;s mantra to be &quot;information wants to be free&quot; and still remove schematics for 3D printing guns. My point was that a non-absolutist free speech stance is not inherently contradictory.<p>I&#x27;m not really interested in a full-throated debate about tech giants&#x27; moderation policies right now. But since you seem to think the censorship is unilateral and one-sided, I&#x27;d invite you to search through Twitter histories and see who was speaking out about FOSTA-SESTA, or Tumblr&#x27;s NSFW ban. You&#x27;ll find it was opposed mostly by libertarians and leftists â€” while the conservatives now wailing about censorship (and, in fairness, corporate liberals) didn&#x27;t make a peep.')
