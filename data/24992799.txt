I can guess who&#x27;s who from position reports, but seeing the tail number leaves no ambiguity.<p>There are also some smaller facilities that use ADS-B to monitor traffic, but aren&#x27;t networked into the national ATC radar system.<p>Aviation events will also setup their own temporary control tower, and frequently use ADS-B as an aid for sequencing traffic. (Again, without access to the national ATC radar network.)<p>For folks who need privacy, there are a couple options that already exist - UAT privacy mode or private Mode S addresses. Though notably, both of these are only available options for domestic flight within the US.')
