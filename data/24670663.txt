How often do people refactor their designs and links? In PyCharm, I can do Regex search&#x2F;replace and it gets the job done if I ever need to change the template (which hasn&#x27;t happened in last 4 years). Not a single minute spent on searching for the right framework, reading docs, setting it up, dockerizing the app, and perhaps even building CI&#x2F;CD for automatic deployment.<p>Simple is better IMO. Just calculate the ROI and time spent on it and in next 10 years how often you&#x27;ll be changing stuff in terms of template or links (Neither should change - Design is not fashion and links should be relative).<p>I also have complete 100% control over the page. I adapt it for a particular content if its got more pictures and less text for example. It&#x27;s so easy and beautiful. There is a kind of zen-like aspect to it.')
