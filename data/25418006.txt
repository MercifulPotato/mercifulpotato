When people say spare me the philosophy, they mean they want to get down to business in a practical way, which they know is possible.<p>Sure, the scientific revolution had a major part of it but a lot of stuff was invented bottom up for practical reasons, as agricultural tools, construction methods, military equipment and not derived from the musings of monks and barons. Rather it was the philosophers who looked at these things and tried to put a theory behind it.')
