I came away from this article even more confused as to what&#x27;s been going on.<p>I used to be a maintainer on Xfce (though it&#x27;s been a decade since I was active), and I&#x27;ve been worried (as a user) about the &quot;upgrade path&quot;.  Porting (if you can call it that) from X11 desktop environment to Wayland compositor (etc.) is a <i>huge</i> step to take, it seems, and Xfce&#x27;s current core team doesn&#x27;t seem interested in going in that direction (I don&#x27;t blame them).<p>As a user, I want to just keep using Xfce until the heat death of the universe.  As someone who might get involved in Xfce development again, I worry that any work I&#x27;d be doing on the X11-based things might be wasted time in the long run.')
