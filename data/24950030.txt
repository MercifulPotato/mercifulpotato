For example, they had huge problems with defective welding and large forgings that weren&#x27;t up to spec and had faked QA testing documentation which caused big delays. Then the regulators went back and looked at the old plants from the original wave of nuclear building, and they had the same problems. It&#x27;s just that French nuclear wasn&#x27;t so well scrutinized back then, possibly for political reasons.')
