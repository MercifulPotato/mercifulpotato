Or have they just realised they may have just stopped the business model that has kept search engines free?<p>Even if you think the business model survives, how is this even close to chilling? So you get competitors in its place. How does that hurt democracy?<p>What hurts democracy is Media companies lobbying for laws that suit only them. Giving them money for their content won&#x27;t make them produce actual news.<p>If they want to be paid extra for listing, then that should make them rank lower. That&#x27;s how business works - their news  is more costly, and therefore of lower value. This law smacks of protectionism.')
