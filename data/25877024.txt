Targeted advertising is &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; at best and calculated harassment of your target (micro-)demographic at worst. Neither of those extremes and largely nothing in the middle in between them is actually good for growing a brand.<p>I have a slow burning boycott of companies that target me too directly, and if trends continue I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if that becomes a more general boycott&#x2F;movement&#x2F;backlash among the populace.<p>Advertising can be reformed if we regulate the business models without killing advertising as a whole. It should be as easy as a reboot to pre-DoubleClick&#x2F;Google advertising best practices that served reasonably well for a century or more.')
