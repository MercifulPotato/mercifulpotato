However a mandatory (welcome) part of my role is mentoring, coaching, call it what you will.  I need to listen to junior members of staff sharing their woes and it&#x27;s a two way flow of ideas, they often share, or overshare their difficult life moments, and at that point, I hang up my &quot;mentor&quot; role and just listen, I&#x27;m not their manager, I&#x27;m just their colleage, in fact, their friend.  Empathy, as I said is guessing, but I do everything I can to do my best guess')
