Look at how opening or closing a single large factory [...]<p>The standard objection, I think, is to refer to the economic history of Argentina, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there.<p>Here&#x27;s a satellite image of an area near Chincoteague. This is a small town in coastal Virginia with a healthy but not skyrocketing tourist economy. In other words, it&#x27;s the kind of economy most of our small cities &quot;should have&quot;. It also happens to be next to a major government Space Race-era facility.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.postimg.cc&#x2F;QtsGMbrL&#x2F;chincoteague-trails-end.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.postimg.cc&#x2F;QtsGMbrL&#x2F;chincoteague-trails-end.png</a><p>In the <i>green</i> circle is the original town of Chincoteague. It is built and designed like a town and like many towns in beautiful areas it has generally resisted transformation into something more like a city. Again, pretty standard Americana. It has a simple road layout, a mixture of development patterns, and is not too hard to navigate on foot.<p>In the <i>red</i> circle is Trail&#x27;s End, a parody of a caricature of the epitome of a suburban cobweb. It is full of mobile homes and cheap plaster houses crammed as close together as county zoning rules allow. It exists because local municipalities and their constituencies did not want to accommodate housing demand within their usual town fabric. This pressure builds up and, eventually, some land development agency gets hold of a big parcel and chops it up in to what you see here.<p>The ongoing &quot;carcinogenesis&quot; of such developments ossifies municipalities. The layout and design of streets within and leading to the red circle is actively hostile not only to walkability and the adoption of transit, but also to the development of a connected regional culture, due to the access-limited (access both <i>to</i> and <i>within</i>) design:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.postimg.cc&#x2F;qR8KspYh&#x2F;trails-end-closer.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.postimg.cc&#x2F;qR8KspYh&#x2F;trails-end-closer.png</a><p>This is by no means unique to northeastern Accomac County! It repeats in nearly every metro area in the United States that hasn&#x27;t either banned it or surrounded itself with swamps (NOLA, Miami). It creates neighborhoods that everyone can survive in but nobody wants to live in. It creates an exclusion zone separating the city from the countryside, and the farmers from the city. Worst of all: it is practically <i>impossible to reverse</i>.<p>We will live with the Trail&#x27;s Ends of the 20th century for decades if not centuries, and they will still be inaccessible, unwalkable, petrified replicas of Stepford, CT, with more mobile homes and fewer gardens. Why? Because we didn&#x27;t want our Chincoteagues to change.<p>We <i>all</i> have skin in the game. We only have one country -- don&#x27;t mess it up.')
