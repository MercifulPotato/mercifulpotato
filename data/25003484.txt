Item(by='mshook', descendants=None, kids=[25003630], score=None, time=1604621124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25002811, text='Here it&#x27;s almost impossible to slip an anonymous ballot.<p>The ballot box is made of transparent plastic (something like [1]), and you don&#x27;t slide the envelope in it yourself. The slot is blocked until an official pulls a lever to let it go through.<p>So you put the envelope by the slot, if you keep holding it you will be asked you to let it go (so you can&#x27;t cleverly hold multiple of them while it looks like one). They&#x27;ll check again who you are and if you can actually vote and so on. If all is good, an official will pull the lever.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpg.fr&#x2F;content&#x2F;images&#x2F;product&#x2F;09812-00J_1_xnl.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpg.fr&#x2F;content&#x2F;images&#x2F;product&#x2F;09812-00J_1_xnl.jp...</a>')
