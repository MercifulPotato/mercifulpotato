These are not alternatives at all. I can absolutely trust Apple to act in my best interests in some regards while distrusting them in others.<p>I do trust Apple to make a good effort to keep malware off my device, a better effort than I could ever hope to make myself. I do trust them not to spy on me to target ads.<p>But I also know that Apple has a business interest in keeping software off my device that is not malware. I don&#x27;t trust them to act in my best interest where it conflicts with their best interest.<p>I also know that their interest in tightly controlling what software goes on my devices creates an opening for authoritarian governments to take control. If and and when end-to-end encryption gets banned, who decides whether or not I can still use Signal? Is it going to be me or is it going to be Apple?<p>This is definitely not a simple question of trusting Apple or not trusting Apple.')
