Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607546823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362960, text='&gt; To anyone willing to invest a few hours of his time, he&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s quite obvious this election was rife with fraud.<p>And yet none of the president&#x27;s lawyers have actually brought forth even 1 claim of fraud before a judge, despite their rhetoric. Every time when actually in court, they have shied away from claiming accusations of fraud.<p>So no, not only is it not obvious that the election was rife with fraud, it is in fact extremely obvious that no real amount of fraud has taken place at all (only using &quot;real amount&quot; instead of &quot;any at all&quot; because I&#x27;m certain that you&#x27;ll find 1 or maybe 2 people somewhere who have stolen maybe a dozen votes).')
