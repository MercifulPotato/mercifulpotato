All of the major social media companies are now facing politically-motivated attacks, where political actors are attempting to undermine confidence in the neutrality and efficacy of moderation, ad allocation, and recommendation algorithms.

There are plenty of other solutions to this problem. I personally think that this is sufficient to make Ethereum interesting.<p>&gt; I think that&#x27;s just false equivalence.<p>What is false about it? My statement about how Linux was perceived in the early-mid-90s is definitely true.
