In the past the government has bribed and manipulated these specifications to be weak to attacks that only the government know about. Everyone follows these specifications and writes in the backdoor for the government.<p>The problem with this is that people are now wise to it and don&#x27;t trust government specifications or organisations like the nsa who have been caught poisoning the well.<p>A larger problem with this is that the gov cant use all that juciey data for its own purposes without revealing the backdoor that was in every encryption in use, kinda awkward.<p>The new strategy is more blunt if you use encryption you are expected to create two keys for it one for your own use and one you send to the government.<p>This is a nice position for the government to go from a position of absolute power but no way to use it to a new status quo where the population are expected to snitch on themselves and continuously present them selves to the government for arbitrary judgement.<p>Now you may think to yourself well if the whole point is to stop people using encryption to do bad shit what stops them from just using encryption and not sending the government a key? That&#x27;s a great question, fantastic! and one the law doesn&#x27;t have to answer, the point is the gov want to peep and they can give them selves that right.')
