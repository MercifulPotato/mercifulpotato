Sure, in the case of independent contractors the money is coming out of someone&#x27;s pocket, but in most structured companies (which is what GP is talking about), the money comes from the people making and pushing the product. In real terms, <i>the employees</i> are the ones paying the bill.<p>&gt;Taken to its logical conclusion the alternative would mean that nobody is entitled to make a decision about anything without taking a referendum on the matter.<p>That&#x27;s literally just an argument against democracy, which we have, as a society, come to the conclusion is a generally good thing. (Well, fascists disagree, but society also has opinions on them.)<p>&gt;Reasonable people will be interested in informed input from the people they employ, but it should not be surprising that in the end the painter you hired doesnâ€™t get a vote on the color you want your bathroom.<p>You&#x27;re conflating the relationship as a client and the relationship as an employer. You get to tell them what color paint to use, but not what type of ladder or brushes to use, or whether they&#x27;re allowed to use the bathroom, sit while working, or eat lunch.')
