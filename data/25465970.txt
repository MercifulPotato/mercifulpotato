People often judge by the outcome while the value lies in the journey. The point of dreaming of something and trying to reach it is what you learn and realise about yourself while doing that. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you choose to abandon your dream because you&#x27;ve found a new direction, new vision while working on it, you know more now and you&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that achieving that dream really wouldn&#x27;t buy you anything worth what you&#x27;ve already gained by going through the process. Conversely, if you set your dream, work for it and finally achieve it but really learn nothing new of yourself to give you a clearer, better vision of your life, have you just wasted all the time on what was supposed to be the pretense for forcing yourself to go through stuff?')
