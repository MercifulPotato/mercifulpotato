Indeed the URL I got from Google, has another URL imbedded in it &quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lh3.googleusercontent.com&quot; which is probably from Picasa or Google Photos cloud.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.fr&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@48.6850276,2.0047107,3a,75y,276.24h,1t&#x2F;data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipPl5KzRbCySD1-ptnqKmKhBEyHChaBX5AsClsGp!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPl5KzRbCySD1-ptnqKmKhBEyHChaBX5AsClsGp%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya160-ro-0-fo100!7i6080!8i3040<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.fr&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@48.6848456,2.0040998,3a,75y,49.21h,58.05t&#x2F;data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgGxIvqBLTLvR-PvYSYkNjw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192')
