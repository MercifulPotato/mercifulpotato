I was also very happy with the quality of the courses - I don&#x27;t recall any module being sub-par.<p>While I didn&#x27;t personally feel like I needed support, there were others in my tutor groups that did, and it was apparent that the level of input from tutors varied wildly - I recall one that offered weekly 1-on-1s for anyone that wanted, and another that took days or even weeks to respond to any query whatsoever.<p>My wife is now studying at the OU, and her more contemporary opinion echos everything I said above.')
