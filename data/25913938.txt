Worked for a MS subsidiary, on an online game for xbox and PC. Developed on windows, using visual studio and deployed on azure, used TFS for bug tracking. All of the above costs were tracked rigorously, and charged to the project. Most frustrating was complying with the visual studio licenses across the board, with no assistance from the licensing team. We had an account manager for all of the above but my understanding is that he was more of an auditor than anything else.')
