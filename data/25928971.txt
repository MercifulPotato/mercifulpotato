Somebody working there does this.<p>It happens everywhere. My sister went to buy a car, with her husband tagging along. She couldn&#x27;t get a sales person to talk to her. She had to go away and come back without him.<p>My wife cannot be seen in a certain car parts store. The counter guys will &quot;see right through her&quot; and talk to the man behind her in line when it&#x27;s her turn.<p>Not quite &#x27;institutional&#x27;, its certainly cultural.
