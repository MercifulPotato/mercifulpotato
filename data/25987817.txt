And I actually <i>do</i> think the physics degree was majorly helpful in the approach Elon takes to solving problems in new fields. Elon is smart, sure, but not the smartest person ever. You have to credit the physics approach for much of that (and a combination of tough life growing up and extended family that provided a safety net that enabled risk-taking... the latter part could be scaled but the former shouldn’t—and may have contributed to some of Elon’s flaws). The good thing is that undergraduate physics education can be scaled to a lot of people (and aspects of its approach to solving problems adopted by other fields).')
