I.e. product_name_django.<p>A quick look at trending projects in python and swift on github seems to confirm that.

Is there anything other than memory or doc with indicating meta to quickly discern what is what?<p>db48x commented on a top-level doc like this, do you use something like that? Perhaps a readme provides this?<p>Can you tell me anything about issues &#x2F; tickets? For example, I commonly use github issues on a per-repo basis, on some projects that&#x27;s a problem because they go together.<p>However on a monorepo like you&#x27;ve described, perhaps a lot of tagging would be needed to classify what goes to what.
