Burn-in reduces bias at the cost of variance (since you have fewer points in your final estimates).<p>My intuition is you want to be somewhere in the middle of the tradeoff. You want to tolerate some bias -- use burn-in to get partway but only partway to the stationary distribution. Here&#x27;s a paper that advances this way of thinking: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;~ngoodman&#x2F;papers&#x2F;LiederGriffithsGoodman2013NIPS.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;~ngoodman&#x2F;papers&#x2F;LiederGriffithsGood...</a>')
