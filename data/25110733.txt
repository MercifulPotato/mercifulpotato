Saying &quot;well, we just took it off the shelf&quot; may work for a small-potatoes business, but not the largest public company in the world.<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s like the Nuremberg Defense of software.<p>Any protocol (or tool in general) is appropriate for certain situations, and inappropriate (in this case, vulnerable) in other ones. You shouldn&#x27;t suggest that others must bend over backwards semantically to try to pass the buck away from Apple, because Apple is responsible for using the protocol. Saying &quot;Apple&#x27;s protocol&quot; indicates that Apple made the conscious choice to use that protocol, and that Apple has ownership of the consequences of using that protocol.')
