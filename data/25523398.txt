For instance, if I tried to use `actix-web`, then using `reqwest` and `tokio` felt like pulling teeth.<p>If anyone&#x27;s got minimal code lining up a web framework (any one, not stuck to actix) with some reqwest, I&#x27;d be thankful to look over it. Just some trivial stuff so I can add an API gateway that proxies a specific API.')
