I mean, it&#x27;s often the case (as I&#x27;ve found in my own research) that even relatively unsophisticated heuristics will often nail the global optimum for a good number of problems.<p>Here&#x27;s one particular example: I tried what is essentially a greedy heuristic on a physical design problem (a problem where we design a device such that an excited wave within it best matches a specific shape). I had earlier showed that solving the general problem is NP-hard.<p>The objective value the greedy heuristic returned? .589. It took &lt;100ms to compute this.<p>Now, I rewrote the problem in a way that was amenable to a mixed-integer convex problem solver (which involved some somewhat-complicated reductions because the problem isn&#x27;t easily phrased in this way). Put it on Mosek (which is a pretty fast solver) and let it run.<p>The globally-certified optimal value (to &lt;1%)? .587. Mosek took <i>two and a half hours</i> to find this.<p>So, tl;dr, the problem was &quot;hard enough&quot; that a branch-and-bound solver took a long time to solve, but still &quot;easy enough&quot; that a basic heuristic might as well have nailed the global optimum.<p>-----<p>I think the reason such papers keep popping up (and I see them around surprisingly often) is that people really don&#x27;t realize how good basic heuristics really can be!')
