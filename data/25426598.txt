The point is if there&#x27;s a less complex way to solve the problem, then it&#x27;s still causing non-essential (aka accidental) complexity. Even if the simpler solution is ugly, the more complex one is still introducing non-essential complexity. If we claim that every single thing we do with the code is part of the &quot;real world problem&quot;, then we&#x27;re throwing up our hands in the air and giving up on the problem of complexity of software. It&#x27;s a naive and simple justification that&#x27;s very comfortable for us, but doesn&#x27;t amount to much. I really recommend reading the No Silver Bullet paper and Mythical Man Month. Fred Brooks explains those things very well.')
