Item(by='mchusma', descendants=None, kids=[25187693], score=None, time=1606144451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25187159, text='I strongly disagree with this.<p>I cannot think of a valid utilitarian argument allowing willing people from getting a vaccine.<p>First, vaccines have an extremely high success rate, 33% of vaccines make it through all trials to approval. 50% after phase 1 is complete.<p>The worst vaccine side effect ever is widely considered to be the swine flu vaccine from 60 years ago, where 1 in 100,000 got GBS (a bad disease).<p>If we knew with 100% confidence that this vaccine was tied for the worst, then if you are over 65 it would be about 1,000x better for you to take this &quot;bad vaccine&quot; versus not.<p>Each successive trial lost us a lot of time, and very little confidence gain.<p>The reality is we had many groups all independently find a vaccine that worked in Q12020. It&#x27;s only the government ban on their use that allowed the pandemic to proceed like it has.<p>Right now in the US, the FDA has said it is not even planning to MEET on the Pfizer candidate&#x27;s approval for 3 weeks. Just insane. Then, the CDC says it needs 24-48 hours after FDA approval to authorize it&#x27;s release. Why can&#x27;t the meet right now? Why can&#x27;t the CDC pre approve release? Or be in the meeting and give simultaneous approval? Or be on a phone alert to give approval within 1 hour?<p>The most likely answer is that in a nationally declared pandemic, any vaccine produced by someone who has gotten a vaccine approved in the last 10 years can sell and distribute (cash only no insurance) vaccines without approval. Require them to collect data on its usage and efficacy. Wait until normal process to require people to be vaccinated.')
