It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re going to lose any real part of their user base. Short of a press release from google confirming the behavior, the average user is not going to go through the hassle of finding a replacement provider and then changing every email address associated with every service they use (if it&#x27;s even possible for the service) all for some nebulous and impossible-to-confirm conspiracy theory put forth by tech experts and security experts that don&#x27;t get listened to even when there is proof. And it&#x27;s not like other companies and services would take a stand by ceasing to offer service to customers with gmail accounts- that&#x27;s an incredible way to lose a vast portion of your customer base.<p>I wish it weren&#x27;t this way, but I just can&#x27;t see that bringing down gmail. Especially not when every google service requires a gmail account- probably the same one most people have had for years.')
