Taxi drivers must be guaranteed a base pay, be insured, certified, so on and so forth. At any given time dozens of taxis can be seen queuing up for their right to a ride with no one taking them. Those drivers are all being guaranteed a very high rate and they all drive Mercedes Benz.<p>We had Uber for a short period and consumers loved it. The taxi medallion cartel got together and pressured the Danish government to push on Uber. The government complied with hefty fines. Uber left.<p>Now things are back to what they were: hundreds of taxis idling somewhere in Denmark to protect the cartel and no one taking taxis because it&#x27;s literally 50 dollars for a 15 minute ride. It sucks. Everybody hates it except the taxi services. I really hope this isn&#x27;t what happens in the States.')
