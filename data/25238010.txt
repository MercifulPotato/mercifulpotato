Like say a removable USB drive so you can use it at multiple computers, or you want to run some from an SSD but others are ok running from a larger slower disk. Or maybe you just want to run them directly off the network. &quot;Installation&quot; is just a copy operation from one media to another, &quot;uninstallation&quot; is just a delete operation. In other words: there is a minimum of abstraction, the application is a single file and performing the same operations you do on any other file to them does exactly what you think it does and the application is stored exactly where you think it is stored.')
