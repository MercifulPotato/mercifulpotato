Frogs are living creatures with an instinct to live, and heat stroke is bad for survival.  It&#x27;s no different from wandering into the desert sun - you cannot thermoregulate your body past a certain point.<p>&gt; The legend is that if they&#x27;re submerged in hot water and heated slowly enough, the brain starts having problems due to the heat before the skin gets too uncomfortable.<p>By that logic people will stay outside and freeze to death from hypothermia which eventually causes people to believe they&#x27;re hot while literally freezing to death, even though <i>long</i> before that happens any functioning human being would say &quot;I&#x27;m cold and need to warm up now!&quot; before suffering any significant health problems.<p>It&#x27;s a fucking dumb legend and regurgitating it does humanity a disservice.  I am aware it is a common saying and what it means.  I just wish people would think more before repeating everything they hear.')
