I&#x27;ve had significant difficult my entire life but I didn&#x27;t know why until recently. Being bipolar has a severe impact on every aspect of my life.<p>In relation to work, it&#x27;s just painful. I need accommodations to handle a 40-hour work week. I need a regular schedule. I can&#x27;t be on-call during the night because I take medication to sleep; I can&#x27;t even walk properly during that time. I have days where it&#x27;s better to one day off than spend a entire week being unproductive.<p>Despite all of this, I&#x27;ve managed to be as productive as my non-disabled coworkers because I am good at what I do. I know how to cope with my symptoms but I can&#x27;t cope with having to do it the same way everyone else does.<p>And it seems like no one else can cope with me either. Not being able to be in the on-call rotation causes resentment. Being randomly sick is disruptive. So many people think I&#x27;m off having fun while I&#x27;m actual at home trying not to kill myself. (I deal with suicidal thoughts quite frequently, never attempted.)<p>This is all made worse by being unable to explain to my coworkers and managers why I need these accommodations. My dad thinks I&#x27;m demon-possessed. I&#x27;m not exactly keen on finding out that one of my coworkers has the same belief. My friends know, because I can afford to lose friends. I can&#x27;t afford to lose a job.<p>It&#x27;s a damned if you do, damned if you don&#x27;t situation.<p>Needing accommodation was a major factor in losing my last job. I was transferred to a department where I couldn&#x27;t be promoted due to my limitations and then let go at the earliest opportunity.<p>Edit:<p>Forgot to mention I also have a milk allergy, can&#x27;t have caffeine, and can&#x27;t drink alcohol. This severely limits my ability to go out with coworkers.<p>Sit-down restaurants that advertise handling allergies don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve gotten extremely sick from every one I&#x27;ve tried to eat at despite being extremely clear that I&#x27;m sensitive to cross-contamination.<p>Fast food is hit or miss. I can&#x27;t even trust Starbucks to use coconut milk instead of regular milk when I ask for it.')
