E.g. - as a silly example - &quot;make dinner&quot; usually means &quot;Prepare and cook an evening meal&quot;. But if you have a project called &quot;dinner&quot; it <i>might</i> mean &quot;build and compile &#x27;dinner&#x27;&quot; An AGI should be able to understand the difference, and ask for clarification if it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Eventually you end up with subtextual and implied communication - e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m fine&quot; can mean two completely opposite things depending on tone of voice and the contents of minutes-to-years of previous conversations.<p>All of this is many orders of magnitude harder to handle than &quot;Bedroom lights off.&quot;')
