It only matters if that show is a deal maker.<p>So it basically needs to become a cultural phenomenon or attract a hardcore base of fans. Anything else just wastes bandwidth.<p>I doubt Netflix can predict with any certainty which show that will be in the same way that VCs can’t pick which of 100 companies will IPO for a billion. So they just invest in 20 of the better ones.')
