It&#x27;s not to claim that the game is therefore produced in a careful way. Certainly not an accurate way! It&#x27;s just saying you shouldn&#x27;t take offense at any details in it (accurate or not). Like, &quot;we probably had someone with the same ethnicity&#x2F;religion&#x2F;gender as you and they were fine with it&quot;. It&#x27;s fall out from the original being set in Palestine, which they called &quot;The Kingdom&quot; in an attempt to bypass offense.')
