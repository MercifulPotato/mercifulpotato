Item(by='rekado', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606474671, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25224024, text='&gt; I found that flipping back and forth between the lilypond &quot;source&quot; and the rendered result was too slow.<p>I found Frescobaldi to be a decent compromise in that regard as it serves as a decent Lilypond editor while keeping the rendering of the score up to date at the same time.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m going to experiment a little more with tighter Emacs and perhaps Org mode integration.  I don&#x27;t care for the <i>full</i> score at all times, so using Lilypond as a server and sending it only short snippets to be displayed in an Org mode babel buffer might be a viable option.<p>(I know that you can tell Lilypond to skip time and only start rendering after some offset, but I&#x27;d rather not have to keep adjusting that offset number all the time; it also doesn&#x27;t work so well for pieces with different odd meters.)')
