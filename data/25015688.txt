Occasionally I&#x27;ll have a need for one column with multiple words, in which case I&#x27;ll make it the last column and it poses no parsing problems as I include the header always and then can just parse the last column as rest.<p>This means you need to be restrictive on the types in your data—which I&#x27;ve always found helps with a lot of other things anyway. No commas, no tabs, no newlines, no quotes—none of that is allowed in a value, and then you have nice clean data ready to parse, that is URL friendly, etc.<p>Of course, when I send my data back out into the world, need to &quot;compile&quot; it to CSV, as almost no one uses SSV.<p>&gt; CSVs have no types, everything is a string.<p>I think this will be solved in the next 10 years or so. We&#x27;ll have something that&#x27;s like Schema.org meets DefiniteltyTyped. A &quot;Common Tongue&quot; for types, with a Wikipedia like community and an easy syntax to extend at the last mile for defining your own dialect to suit your worldview.')
