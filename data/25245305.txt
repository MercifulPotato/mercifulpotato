Here are some thoughts.<p>First of all, the video uploader is promoting a competitor to YouTube. This is not disclaimed clearly.<p>The video goes over criticism to the CIA, which are fair enough. But it takes some things as axioms, for example, that only the US are interfering&#x2F;meddling in the world. He presents it as &quot;the US is the bad guy and the world would be fair without the CIA.&quot; Which also is a form of propaganda.<p>It&#x27;s a bit n√§ive to not see this as anti-government propaganda. The crude reality is: true democracies never existed, and influence between countries is as old as society.<p>About the &quot;censorship&quot; itself: Youtube&#x27;s goals is not the same as the authors, why would they promote something that is not what they want to be? They have a huge infant audience, they want to be advertiser-friendly. This is not something hidden or unknown.<p>They did not delete the video, but they shouldn&#x27;t promote it. No fault in my eyes.<p>And at the same time, the buzz around saying &quot;my video is being suppressed&quot; get more views and is even a badge to prove the content &quot;hits where it hurts&quot;. Just like rock bands in the 80s&#x2F;90s would go after being censored or considered 18+ just to sell more.')
