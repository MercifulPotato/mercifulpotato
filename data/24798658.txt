Fun, but nothing amazing (though it did spoil all other social drugs for me - what&#x27;s the point of getting high if it&#x27;s not at that level?)<p>Then 10 years ago (so in my 40&#x27;s) I took it again at a bush rave. At the time I was in a deep clinical depression, regularly feeling suicidal, fighting alcoholism, it was a tough time. During the trip, I saw a vivid vision of a version of myself as I could be if I got my shit sorted out and sobered up. I really liked that vision&#x2F;version of myself, and it stuck with me afterwards (unlike most of the stuff on acid trips).<p>That vision became my beacon. It took me another 5 years or so to work through the depression with therapy. I still struggle with the booze (but it&#x27;s much, much more manageable now, and no psychotic episodes any more, yay!). But knowing that there was a &quot;healed&quot; version of me, and what that looked like, and that I could be that person. That was powerful. Literally the light at the end of the tunnel.<p>So yeah, that&#x27;s my &quot;hallucinogens helped my mental health&quot; story :)')
