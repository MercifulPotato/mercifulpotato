Examples: Climate change is a hoax, or Obama is a muslim from an African country.<p>I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of people who I met who blatantly make the above statements as if they are matter-of-fact... Because they watch the media that perpetuates these myths, every single day.<p>So, the vitriol towards Obama comes from a fraction of the media that will stop at nothing to destroy him.<p>(And, before someone goes and says that &quot;the liberal media does it too,&quot; remember that the rest of American media does not openly contradict established facts to forward a political agenda.)')
