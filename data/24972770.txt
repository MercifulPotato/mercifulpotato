(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;picnic.chat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;picnic.chat</a>)<p>When it comes to our most precious relationships, we believe that today&#x27;s messaging apps are doing the bare minimum to bring us closer together. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re building a 10X more rewarding group chat experience.<p>We are a small team based out of London (UK) on a mission to make the world better friends. On the back of a successful beta launch of our flagship app, we just this month closed a Â£2m Seed round from some of the world&#x27;s top VCs (not yet publicly announced). Our founding team includes engineers from Google, Monzo and Skyscanner while our advisory board includes the originator of Dunbar&#x27;s number, Snapchat&#x27;s 1st Engineer, Bumble&#x27;s Chief Brand Officer and many more.<p>We&#x27;ve been using React Native from day one, and while it has gotten us very far very quickly, we&#x27;re starting to hit some of the roadblocks that should be familiar to anyone who has worked with React Native. We&#x27;re now looking to hire someone who has a deep understanding of the underlying platforms (iOS and Android), to help us implement native components where performance and user experience matter most.<p>If this sounds like your kind of thing, read more about who we are, what we&#x27;re doing &amp; how you might fit in here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;teampicnic&#x2F;Senior-Mobile-Engineer-iOS-Android-React-Native-c893fbf044d44a63aaf14eec65b18453" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;teampicnic&#x2F;Senior-Mobile-Engineer-iOS-...</a>')
