But it could mean that lower-quality and easier-to-collect experimental data would be all that’s needed to get a good structure. Some applications, such as the evolutionary analysis of proteins, are set to flourish because the tsunami of available genomic data might now be reliably translated into structures. “This is going to empower a new generation of molecular biologists to ask more advanced questions,” says Lupas. “It’s going to require more thinking and less pipetting.” &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;<p>Mohammed AlQuraishi: &#x27;&#x27;&#x27; “I think it’s fair to say this will be very disruptive to the protein-structure-prediction field. I suspect many will leave the field as the core problem has arguably been solved,” he says. “It’s a breakthrough of the first order, certainly one of the most significant scientific results of my lifetime.” &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-03348-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-03348-4</a>')
