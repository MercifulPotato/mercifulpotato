That is the service that I need now, not all this shiny crud.<p>I&#x27;ve been a Dropbox user for 12+ years.<p>I imagine it as buying a car 10 years ago because it solved all your mobility needs (shopping, occasional longer trips, dropping kids&#x2F;family members to their events etc). You wander into the garage 12 years later and you have this monstrosity with five wheels, built-in backseat crayons, 20-feet long, flippers, and just two functional doors.<p>I don&#x27;t need that. I certainly don&#x27;t want that, and I&#x27;m actively looking to move away when my annual renewal comes up.')
