But after a while you will learn to recognise the smell of astroturfing and even otherwise, they are refuted by commenters. More likely that there are fanboys that come with irrational arguments rather than astroturfing in these forums.<p>The greater harm of these content marketing bullshit is it pollutes Google search results. If you search Google for some mainstream enough technical terms, all you get is shallow information, poorly written, posts on bullshit sites.<p>I&#x27;d like someone to make a search engine for authentic programming related websites and blogs, even if hand aggregated.
