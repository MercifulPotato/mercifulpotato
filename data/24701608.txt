I get it, you hate anti-covid measures (I read your other posts), but most of the &quot;common old&quot; coronaviruses are wildly different from the SARS-2 virus, 67% of genetic difference represent hundreds of years of evolution; the only &quot;similarity&quot; they have is belonging to the same family of coronaviruses. It is like saying, yeah we share 99% of genes with monkeys therefore we are the same thing.')
