I could not quickly find stats on the battery life for the latest and greatest Clevo NH57ADS, but – since they use a desktop CPU in it – I do not expect it to be that great.<p>If I were to apply your logic, I could then declare that my POWER9 2U blade is a portable device <i>ahem</i> laptop (technically, I can carry it around as well as keep the blade on my laps, yes) that surpasses any other known laptop in terms of hardware configurability, and Linux compatibility will be even greater, too.')
