Item(by='wongarsu', descendants=None, kids=[25820621], score=None, time=1610968641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25820375, text='In Europe kettles typically use around 2300W, since homes are typically wired with 16A breakers (and you don&#x27;t want the kettle to pop the breaker as soon as you add another device). But US homes are wired similarly, typically with 15A breakers. So you get kettles that typically use 1500W, much less than the European equivalent.<p>Sure, you could use powerful kettles in the US on a 20W outlet, or on a 230V circuit, but nobody is going to do that. A typical kettle that you can just buy and plug in wherever is less powerful in the US just because you use halve the voltage but don&#x27;t wire for double the current.')
