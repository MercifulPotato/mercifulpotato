I&#x27;m delighted thus far, I love not having to reinvent the wheel every time I start a project or add a feature.<p>I&#x27;m probably keeping React&#x2F;Next.js as my primary working tools for the front-end nonetheless, but that&#x27;s just me because I feel highly productive with them and I&#x27;ve become accustomed to the decoupled client&#x2F;API architecture.<p>I can see the merits of SSR with templating as seen in RoR or Python, and I&#x27;m happy to have that tool in my belt. But conversely I also think it&#x27;s worth for pretty much everyone to learn React (or Vue, Svelte, or what have you) because they do open different possibilities in UX engineering and app architecture, and the market is quite hot for them too.')
