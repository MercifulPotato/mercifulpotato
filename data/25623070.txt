We used Matlab, but then the polling of the license server got more and more aggressive(or we were unlucky). Just when you want to work on the 8h flight the thing popping up and saying &#x27;need to connect to the internet&#x27; is not fun. Now we had a volume license(I think). And it needs server access every 10 times you <i>run</i> a script. Try making software which wants to use the Ethernetport with something else, it is just annoying.
