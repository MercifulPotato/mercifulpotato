Write a function to load just a header.\n2. Unit test the function with a header.\n3. Write a function to do the RLE decoding.\n4. Unit test the function with some data.\n5. etc.\n6. Start assembling the pieces.\n7. Unit test the whole thing.<p>Meanwhile, you tried to write it all in one monolithic function, and so now you&#x27;re testing the whole thing (hopefully with a unit test) and you&#x27;re staring at the debugger (or worse, some printf output) wondering what little mistake you made. Maybe if you&#x27;re brilliant, like Carmack, you beat me to the finish line. But most of us are mere mortals.')
