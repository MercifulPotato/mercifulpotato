It&#x27;s a very elegant solution, actually, and I have created a nice integration between my datacenter-hosted resolver and nextdns.io as the adblocking upstream DNS.<p>This only works for the subset of devices which use the local DNS. If they use any of the well-known techniques to avoid that filtering it&#x27;s completely ineffective.<p>&gt; Since we&#x27;re talking about it, though, it occurs to me that you could quickly do a DoH lookup to every single new IP that initiates a new connection, outbound, from your network - and then block all IPs that answer your DoH query.<p>It doesn&#x27;t solve the CDN problem: CDNs will route traffic based on the hostname and blocking them will have a degree of collateral damage which most people can&#x27;t work with. Setting up your own HTTPS proxy avoids this.')
