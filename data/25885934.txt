I&#x27;ll bet you there are at least half a million people staffing courts in the US, maybe even a full million, and probably an equal number of law enforcement officers, and that doesn&#x27;t get to public and private attorneys which is probably another million.<p>Which means something like 1% of the population of the US is probably involved in just administering the laws of society.<p>Now, maybe for a society where the limits of how people interact is communication you could get away with lower overhead. But that&#x27;s going to be a constant factor of the same underlying dynamic.<p>Also, we&#x27;ve done the same damn thing with freedom of discourse that we have with almost every other liberty in the US: we turn it into a thought-stopping cliche and glide on treating it as an indulgence rather than investing in thinking about the limits, edge cases, and responsibilities.')
