If technology &quot;wants&quot; and &quot;has a will,&quot; who cares if a Tesla kills someone, or if lots of people lose jobs, or if our society sleep-walks into a surveillance state. It&#x27;s all just pre-ordained. Are you a Luddite, man?<p>But this feels like a blunt debate. Whether to be an optimist or a pessimist doesn&#x27;t feel like an interesting question. The interesting question is <i>what to build</i>, in a million different details. That&#x27;s where the devil lies. Believing in technology doesn&#x27;t absolve us from the consequences of the decisions we make in birthing it into the world.<p><i>So</i> much energy has gone into both sides of this debate, and it&#x27;s been utterly useless, and all the while our Ubers and our Airbnbs and our Waymos have continued locally optimizing the new world. I wish Kevin Kelly and Jaron Lanier and others like them would get more actionable about the big picture.')
