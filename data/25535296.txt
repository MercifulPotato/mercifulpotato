We stopped using Macs while I was still doing it and it was back in like ~98 when we moved for real to digital studios. Depending on what we were doing the only thing the Macs gave us were bigger purchase and support bills. What Apple had going for them was history so people didn&#x27;t know as much about how to support the setup if it wasn&#x27;t Macs. The non-Apple software was just fine and the hardware, at the same price point, way better.')
