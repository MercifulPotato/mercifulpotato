I think that one&#x27;s the closest Slack has to fixing threading&#x27;s problems though - if you&#x27;re aware of it being a potential issue, you can at least highlight it.<p>It&#x27;d be good if there were an &#x27;active thread(s)&#x27; thing that appeared on the right side or something (at the bottom of what is the the thread panel when one&#x27;s open, I&#x27;m imagining though. Easy to ignore, but when you&#x27;re checking if there&#x27;s new messages in your main channel you&#x27;d also see if there were new thread activity.')
