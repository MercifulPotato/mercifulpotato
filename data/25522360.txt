Same boat here. In principle Mac App Store could have been a really wonderful thing, I think Apple in the 00s had a real opportunity to do a great service to their users by creating a unified, solid and flexible licensing system for all devs (and then offering a fully optional vetted software store beyond that). Unfortunately they didn&#x27;t do that and the MAS sucks. There is no upgrade system which is just absolutely fucking insanity. There are huge restrictions on useful functionality, so it can never be a one-stop place. The licensing and Apple ID management is a total fucking mess too, can&#x27;t consolidate or transfer licenses like just about every previous Mac system in existence, all sorts of normal concepts like vol or other discounts are a pain&#x2F;non-existent. I have an old iTools account, and I&#x27;m not even allowed to change the primary email address!<p>The MAS experience, and Apple&#x27;s online service experience in general over significant time, is just miserable, completely unnecessarily too. Maybe they&#x27;ll fix that someday, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a priority so here we are :(.')
