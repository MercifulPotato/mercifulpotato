Perhaps this is a regional thing, I&#x27;ve never experienced (and have no wish to) what the US EMR market is like.<p>Some complaints&#x2F;feedback I did receive from doctors and clinic admins while working for an EMR vendor:<p>1. Your system is buggy&#x2F;unintuitive and we hate using it.<p>2. We&#x27;re not upgrading or moving to your new system because of 1).<p>3. We&#x27;re moving to competitor X because they have Y feature.<p>4. [conversely] We came from competitor X because their EMR is slow&#x2F;buggy&#x2F;lacks features.<p>5. We signed up because the docs&#x2F;office assistants liked [hero feature] in the sales demo.<p>So yes, 0 mentions of the word &quot;software&quot;. However, all of these are directly related to the software itself. There&#x27;s a reason flashy new companies can swoop in and steal some market share (at least where I am). Even more importantly, there are many tech-related reasons why some companies start floundering and drop out of the market:<p>- bad foundations (most EMRs were created by doctors with limited dev experience)<p>- rampant tech debt driven by feature-driven development<p>- lack of knowledge about testing&#x2F;CI<p>These are not theoretical problems. More than once, we incurred regulatory fines and SLA penalties in excess of the &quot;cost of doing business&quot; threshold. After a pretty major patient data screw-up, upper management even relented and gave the dev(ops) team time&#x2F;money to clean up their act. Regulatory and bureaucratic inertia may insulate health IT companies from software engineering issues, but there&#x27;s a limit to everything and they can sure as hell bleed.')
