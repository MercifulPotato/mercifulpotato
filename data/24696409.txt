The US isn&#x27;t well-regulated on that front.<p>In France, not only is the local loop (and much of the network) shared, when Orange came to install fiber in our apartment they had to install four fiber ports + wires in the same cable, so we can switch to any the other major 3 operators painlessly (or, we could if any of them had fiber in our building).<p>The infrastructure-sharing regulations, as well as aggressive anti-trust action, is why France has one of the best internet coverages in the world at one of the lowest prices, 15 years after the public telecom operator was privatized.')
