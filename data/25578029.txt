I don&#x27;t think there are any examples of pure capitalism.<p>I don&#x27;t typically speak of pure capitalism when discussing the topic. Most of the time when people say they want to change away from capitalism they are actually talking about the current system. Often when they talk about ending capitalism they are actually talking about slightly increasing the mix of socialism.<p>But there is a strong sentiment that our current system is inherently broken due to the level of capitalism it currently contains. I would argue that it&#x27;s the best system we&#x27;ve ever had. By that I mean the mix of capitalism and socialism we have in the western world. All the varying mixes that exist have been wild successes compared to any historical systems. Also noting that changing too fast could be dangerous.<p>Much of the language is used inaccurately, something I&#x27;m very guilty of, so it is hard to assess what change people are hoping to achieve. I&#x27;ve heard a scary amount of poorly thought out claims that we have a suitable replacement for our current mix of capitalism and socialism. I&#x27;m afraid that could lead to similar problems that the Soviets faced. I could be wrong so all I call for is caution.')
