It&#x27;s not supported by Rockbox, but I&#x27;m perfectly happy with the last official firmware. The OLED has deteriorated, but it&#x27;s still fine indoors (it was almost impossible to read outdoors from the get-go).<p>The battery lasted around 14 hours when it was new, now I&#x27;m getting roughly half of that. I seem to remember someone on the now defunct anythingbutipod.com replacing the battery, although they had to break the player apart to get inside.<p>Even the damn plastic clip on the back still works!')
