As I understand it, this would be covered by the car&#x27;s insurance, right? If so, Tesla shouldn&#x27;t be locking the chargers (Maybe Tesla would need to verify insurance before allowing supercharging then). But if it doesn&#x27;t, or if the car is uninsured, then I can accept Tesla not wanting to be held liable for the damage to their station or other owners&#x27; cars for batteries that might have undetectable damage.')
