It’s going to take a while to figure out how to secure our networks&#x2F;devices  well, but it feels like a model that pushes more of the configuration to the device will be more secure and more universal (since more and more devices will be LTE connected)<p>The model where you by default have access to everything inside the network if you can just get a connection behind the firewall never seemed all that great to me. If we can’t assume that any connection from the local network is authorized anymore, maybe it’ll push us to make servers&#x2F;services more inherently secure, and accept&#x2F;reject connections based on actually authenticating the user&#x2F;device connecting to it.  But then again, I’m not a professional so I may be wrong.')
