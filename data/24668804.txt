CME is open 23&#x2F;5 already.  EUREX has extended their trading hours into the Asia shift in the past few years, I think 20&#x2F;5.  Many other European and Asian derivatives exchanges have extended trading hours over the past decade.<p>Most equity exchanges are only open or liquid during local business hours.  US markets are open longer, but generally illiquid and there are fewer protections outside of &quot;market&quot; hours.<p>I think for equities, nobody wants to be a market maker 24&#x2F;7 without a sufficiently wide spread to protect them from news events such as the death of an executive.  So even with 24&#x2F;7 markets you&#x27;d probably see very poor conditions outside of core hours.  With derivatives, there&#x27;s more interest in never sleeping.  The world is a very interconnected place and less hinges upon a single person&#x27;s death.')
