IT is the operation of information infrastructures by major enterprises. And the timeline was 30 years. Laptops were very, very, very uncommon 30 years ago!<p>Cloud computing isn&#x27;t just shared servers - it&#x27;s a shared application infrastructure. It&#x27;s extremely different from the old mainframe model.<p>I have to say I do think that operations could be better without new silver bullets, but the scale and pressures on IT and business operations in general are dragging them to a precipice. Things are now so complex and demanding that at some point we may well see major organisations fray and disintegrate because they just can&#x27;t run themselves anymore. Something close happened with the cyber attacks on Maersk and the NHS a few years ago - but from what I&#x27;ve seen it&#x27;s quite possible that someone big will get themselves into such a tangle that they suffer a complete operational breakdown without an attack.')
