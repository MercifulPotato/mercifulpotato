Perhaps the career you&#x27;re persuing doesn&#x27;t give you the sense of purpose you might want. Maybe you need to do some soul searching.<p>Don&#x27;t dedicate the next ten years of your life to a meme. Instead why not spend that time persuing something meaningful that you love doing. There&#x27;s no point in spending ten years doing something you hate just to end up doing nothing. If you want to just dick around, take a vacation. If you can&#x27;t do that, then persue a job where you can.<p>I know I get extremely bored after about two weeks of vacationing. I can&#x27;t imagine spending the rest of my life doing that.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;G6eVVrTjNcY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;G6eVVrTjNcY</a>')
