In infinite dimensions there is no way to have a Gaussian measure on just an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. It needs to be embedded inside a bigger infinite dimensional space and then you can have some relative measure.<p>So you do not look at just a Gaussian integral, you look at a quotient of Gaussian integrals.<p>Perhaps there is a similar idea. Perhaps there is some sort of renormalisation that would make neural networks work better. Even if your neural network is infinite dimensional it still makes sense to talk about some surface relatively.')
