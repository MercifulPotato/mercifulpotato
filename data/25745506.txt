The answer isn&#x27;t to force diversity because that just imposes costs and inconvenience on users just as much as it hurts providers.<p>In a sense in a situation like this you can consider the customer to be essentially all of us as a group. Therefore as a group it makes sense for us to negotiate terms with the service provider, hence I think there&#x27;s a reasonable role for government to regulate. After all our elected representatives are there to do exactly that - represent us and our interests.<p>Honestly I would prefer minimal or no regulatory intervention. I don&#x27;t think the degree of any harm being done currently is sufficient to make imposing regulation worth the risks of getting those regulations wrong and making things worse for users. I think the degree of any current abuses are relatively trivial from a user perspective, however I do accept the basic principle that regulation may be necessary and appropriate, and companies like google need to know that and act accordingly.<p>In reality I&#x27;m a Brit and these are mainly US companies, so it&#x27;s mainly up to you guys, but I&#x27;m sure the EU and other governments, should look at this.')
