(Hint: they don&#x27;t).<p>ADD: It was an issue a long time ago.  Benchmarks like SPEC are actually much nicer than real server workloads.  For example, running stuff like SAP would utterly trash the TLB.  Curiously, AMD processors can address 0.25 TB without missing in the TLB, much better than Intel.')
