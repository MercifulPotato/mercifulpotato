Item(by='jasonpbecker', descendants=None, kids=[25826537], score=None, time=1610998622, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25825492, text='&gt; With the release of Apache Arrow 3.0.0 there are many breaking changes in the Rust implementation and as a result it has been necessary to comment out much of the code in this repository and gradually get each Rust module working again with the 3.0.0 release.<p>This appears to be an issue with Arrows implementation hitting a new major version and the Rust libraries not yet being compatible with the newest versions of Arrow. That&#x27;s not something specific to the Rust ecosystem. It&#x27;s not like a new version of Rust broke this project.<p>But even if it had, maintenance is always hard and the health of a project is better measured by how long it takes to be working with new, major, stable versions after widespread community adoption of those new, major, stable versions.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Arrow 3.0 is the most commonly used implementation-- it may not have even reached that milestone.')
