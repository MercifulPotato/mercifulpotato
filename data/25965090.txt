But the total volume of available vaccine limits the possibilities for the EU. If the total volume of the UK would be avalailable for the EU it would be a drop in the bucket. And I really don&#x27;t get all the &quot;race&quot; reporting, it&#x27;s highly unlikely that vaccination speed differences between one to 3 months  will make any difference in mortality.')
