Doesn&#x27;t that imply that he <i>was</i> potentially in danger, or taken &quot;out of commission,&quot; and it&#x27;s reassuring that he&#x27;s not dead or in jail?<p>This sort of conversation would never take place if a high-profile US executive like Bezos, Musk, or Gates disappeared for months after criticizing the government, and reappeared without making any mention of it. People would be freaking out and we would already have 500+ investigative journalists on the case, articles all over the place, widespread speculation... In China, it seems all of those are disallowed.<p>If anything, this seems to be pro-China hypocrisy, not the other way around.')
