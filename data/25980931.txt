But now you also have the entirety of the global economy dependent on your software.<p>That is a bad analogy,  MS takes years to change the core because it require INSANE levels of backwards compatibility.  Apps written for windows 2000 still work and need to work today...<p>This would not need to be the case with this type of system,  there are a whole host of political reasons why the system is built the way it is, part of it is the desire to control it (and in this case the wrong people where doing things they were not suppose to)<p>I am sure you will call that &quot;conspiracy&quot;, but the reality is that the investment system is setup to be slow and opaque not because of the need for backwards compatibility, or security it is that way so the &quot;correct people&quot;  control it plain and simple')
