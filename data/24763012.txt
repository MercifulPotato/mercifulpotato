But that&#x27;s the vast majority of the time, so mostly it&#x27;s fine.<p>It is when anything out of the ordinary flow needs to be done that it becomes impenetrable and often leads to data loss (or at least, an irrecoverable state which requires restoring from backup).<p>I&#x27;ve been using source control over 30 years now, with the vast majority of those years being on distributed source control systems (starting with Sun&#x27;s teamware in the mid-90s). git is the one and only where I have had to adopt the practice of making a tarball of the current working dir before any nontrivial operation. And I end up having to use that backup every so often as git gets into some irrecoverable state of confusion.<p>Some of the comments in this and other git threads suggest (and I&#x27;ll believe it) that if I were to dedicate substantial time to become an expert in the implementation detail and inner working of git, it might be possible to avoid these irrecoverable states. Ok.<p>That right there is an indication of a massive user interface failure.')
