Marginal cost of developing App Store is nearly zero per app.<p>99.999% of apps don&#x27;t get any marketing from Apple at all. Apps get lost in the crowd and the poor search that still struggles with obvious keyword spamming and rip-offs. Actual app ads are charged separately.<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t increase your reach. They merely let you through an artificial barrier they themselves have created. I hate it that as an iOS user, I&#x27;m sold to you as Apple&#x27;s product.<p>I can see manual app review getting costly, but Apple somehow doesn&#x27;t wage war against free-to-user apps, nor they put limits or fees on excessive app releases. They&#x27;re only upset when someone else makes money without giving them a cut. It&#x27;s not about recouping Apple&#x27;s costs, but increasing Apple&#x27;s <i>profit</i>.')
