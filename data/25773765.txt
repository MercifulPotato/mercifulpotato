I&#x27;m not a heavy wifi user, mostly I want openwrt.<p>I&#x27;ve had several openwrt routers.  Before this one I had a tp-link wdr4300, then an archer c7.  The wrt1900acs has pretty fast, full-featured hardware.<p>I run firewall + adblock + privoxy + vlans.  Because it has a USB port, I&#x27;ve added a USB GPS dongle so it does gps-based ntp time.<p>At first openwrt was a little daunting, but it has really grown on me.<p>One great thing about it is that the entire linux distribution is basically read-only, and all changes you make to your machine are in an infrequently-written overlay filesystem.   If you back up &#x2F;overlay&#x2F;upper you will have all your config changes in a small tarball.  All operations that do continuous writing like logfiles go to ramdisk, so it&#x27;s easy on the flash and reliable during power failure.<p>Another thing is that if you follow the instructions, it&#x27;s actually pretty straightforward to build openwrt for your specific configuration.  I cut out the package manager and compiled everything I wanted into my image (or out of it, I turned off ipv6)<p>With a simple setup, you don&#x27;t even have to bother with the gui.  The config files are pretty simple and you can edit them directly.<p>I&#x27;ve also put openwrt on some network switches and once I got vlans going, my network got a lot more manageable.<p>I have a vlans:<p>- normal - machines can route to internet<p>- restricted - machines boot and have local dns - can get out (updates) only through the proxy<p>- test vlan - can&#x27;t get to anything<p>the network switches are mikrotik and also running openwrt.<p>I have retired a rb750gl and rb2011ils, and now everything runs on a rb2011uias and a rb3011uias-rm (11 port)<p>I love the rb3011 - the rack mount tabs can be rotated 90 degrees and you can attach it under a shelf.<p>The two switches have SFP, and I can&#x27;t help but think I should start messing with fiber.')
