Sadly by repeating it enough people have started to actually believe it, and repeat it without looking at the evidence of the real world.<p>A cheap pair of jeans, adjusted for inflation was ~$150 in 1980. Now you can get one for $10. Did no one wore jeans for 40 years? Meat, it has never been so cheap IN HISTORY to buy meat, and if the trend continues, next year you could buy even more meat with the same money! (adjusting for inflation of course) Are you not gonna eat for a year?<p>That is not even talking about tech, were a cheap laptop 20 years ago adjusted for inflation was over $1000 and now is $300.<p>People prefer things now not later, that is why if you offer them $50 today instead of $100 in 10 $10 monthly payments most people pick the $50. The same thing happens when buying stuff. Sadly evidence is not as marketable as propaganda.<p>So as I said, nonsense.')
