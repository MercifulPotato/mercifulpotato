Item(by='Fej', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605159260, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25065823, text='&gt; Not much of it actually helps me.<p>Neither do TV or movies for the most part; there are many examples of high art in those formats but the most popular examples thereof are hardly at all intellectually gratifying, educational, or otherwise &quot;helpful&quot;, as you put it (a good descriptor). It&#x27;s entertainment - it&#x27;s there for fun, and in many cases, it&#x27;s there for the sake of art. (That&#x27;s not to say that e.g. popcorn flicks don&#x27;t have any artistic qualities, just that they&#x27;re aiming for the former, not the latter.) The issue is more in the ways that YouTube tries to keep you watching, like the other massive social media sites.<p>No one else, ever, has had a platform where an independent video creator could start with a handful of viewers and build up to millions, and even potentially make a career out of it. No, it&#x27;s not common, there&#x27;s a ton of work involved with no immediate payout, and it requires at least a bit of luck with the dreaded &quot;algorithm&quot;, but it&#x27;s <i>probably</i> more merit-based than what we had before, and that&#x27;s a wonderful thing.<p>(I&#x27;m not entirely certain about that last bit, hence &quot;probably&quot;. How merit-based was&#x2F;is TV and film, precisely? I just find it hard to believe that they&#x27;re better than YouTube, given the quantity of quality creators on it who could never find a slot, much less an audience, on any other platform or format that has ever been.)<p>With regard to the ubiquity: given the lack of competitors, apparently the capital requirements are so high and the lock-in effects so strong that there aren&#x27;t any companies willing to give it a go. The closest thing we have, Twitch, filled a niche that YouTube wasn&#x27;t technically capable of at the time, grew large enough before YouTube decided to try to enter that market so Twitch was able to acquire those same lock-in effects, and was bought by Amazon who provides the capital to ensure a smooth experience (Twitch prior to the acquisition was far more prone to performance issues).')
