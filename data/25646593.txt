Material science has improved dramatically, even since the 90s.  We now have oils that don&#x27;t break down for years, even under extreme temperatures, and tolerances within engines are tight enough that oil can go 10,000 miles without meaninful gasoline contamination.  Also, rust-proofing, rubbers, and plastics (!) are much, much better.<p>2. Solid state electronics have replaced mechanical systems.  This is a big one: vacuum lines were a nightmare, carburetors were fickle, distributors wore out, etc.  All of these systems have been replaced by maintenance-free electronic versions.<p>3. Better computer-aid modeling.  This is kind of a good and bad, since now components aren&#x27;t overbuilt like in the 90s, but they are also less likely to be underbuilt.<p>There are absolutely manufactures who still make unreliable heaps, but generally, reliability has improved.  Most of that reliability comes in the form of less maintenance: no car needs the valves adjusted every 30k miles anymore (except maaaybe exotics).<p>Jay Leno likes to joke about how cars used to come with 90 day warranties in the 70s.  90 days!')
