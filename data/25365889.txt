Speech is not absolute, and the US has limits set by the courts. This is a reasonable one and it&#x27;s very narrowly limited. The United States and Japan are probably the two best countries when it comes to defending freedom of speech. Keep in mind, China has freedom of speech in their constitution, so the law doesn&#x27;t have much by itself.<p>2-&gt; This is a civil violation. The FBI poster before movies says it&#x27;s criminal, but it&#x27;s very rarely persued as such (unless you&#x27;re Kim Dotcom).<p>3-&gt; Civil, not criminal<p>4-&gt; Reasonable limit to speech and it&#x27;s specific. You have to threaten specific harm to a specific person (or group in a specific time frame). There&#x27;s a lot of very complex case law here, test for &#x27;call to action&#x27; ...  a lot of it going back to the Red Scare<p>5-&gt; Like publishing Trump&#x27;s tax returns? That&#x27;s a federal crime by the way.<p>6-&gt; Obscenity has some very specific and narrow definitions (see #1). Although people like to throw around the &quot;I&#x27;ll know it when I see it,&quot; there are certain tests to determine obscenity in the US.')
