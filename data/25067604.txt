I remember the first thing I did was to back up all my mp3s, but after that I used to stream many other songs and that worked just fine. I found everything that I was interested in on there.<p>At least for me it was a good music streaming service, had all I ever needed.<p>Now I switched to YT Music. Not sure how that&#x27;s any different. It still plays most of the music I had bundled up in the playlists I created over the years and that&#x27;s fine I guess. It seems a bit easier to find live sets from festivals with YT Music so that&#x27;s a plus.')
