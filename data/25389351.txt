Modern peripherals also contain only the barest of firmware in ROM and need the drivers to actually upload their operating firmware.<p>No matter how many cores the CPU has or how fast they&#x27;re clocked they&#x27;re not going to make all that IO faster. They also can&#x27;t run a hard coded 10ms sleep faster than 10ms.<p>Even once you get into a booted kernel and PID 1 you&#x27;re still going to wait on IO to get daemons running. If you&#x27;ve got services (in systemd parlance) waiting on Networking you can have totally variable wait periods depending on local network conditions.<p>SSDs and parallel starting of daemons has improved boot times a lot over the past decade but there&#x27;s still hard minimums just based on booting up low level crap before the kernel turns things over to PID 1.')
