It sounded interesting and I wanted to try, but the website didn&#x27;t allow to create an account for the free tier specifically. Instead it was like: create a general account, and if your usage remains below X it is free, and as soon as it goes above X you agree to pay. With no way to cap usage, i.e. no way to cap spending.<p>In other words, the only way to access the &quot;free trial&quot; is to give a blanket promise to pay unlimited amount of money if something goes wrong.<p>There is no way I would agree to that, so I just closed the browser tab and forgot about the whole thing. That is, until this debate reminded me of it.<p>For an online service, implementing the cap should be quite simple, so if it is not available, I am going to assume this is intentional.')
