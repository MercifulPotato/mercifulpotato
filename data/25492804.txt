Basically when it does not cross into legal criminal fraud as defined by law you can&#x27;t call it a fraud. Same as with taxes, especially corporate. One can be and idiot, creative, fraudster. The middle one is subject to interpretation and the amount of money involved. &quot;Doing very best&quot; does not necessarily mean not lying.')
