Workers, whether they&#x27;ve materially done well through the pandemic, or not, are sufficiently lucid to see that this all has to be paid for. And they&#x27;re the ones who will pay for it.<p>Unlike the author, who is blindsighted by, and even marvels at, the &quot;huge&quot; numbers, unable to see more than a few months down the line.<p>A worker may be in a house that&#x27;s booming in value with a tech salary and buying lots of nice things from Amazon and deliveroo but he can see the world outside.<p>Workers aren&#x27;t atoms spread apart in a vacuum. They know people friends and family who aren&#x27;t doing as well as themselves, or vice versa.<p>So there is no contradiction in terms. Things are bad full stop.')
