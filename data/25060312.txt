Among other things, I write low level mathematical optimization codes that need fast linear algebra to run effectively.  While there&#x27;s a lot of emphasis on BLAS&#x2F;LAPACK, those libraries work on dense linear algebra.  In the sparse world, there are fewer good options.  For things like sparse QR and Choleski, the two fastest codes that I know about are  out of SuiteSparse and Intel MKL.  I&#x27;ve not tried it, but the SuiteSparse routines will probably work fine on ARM chips, but they&#x27;re dual licensed GPL&#x2F;commercial and the commercial license is incredibly expensive.  MKL has faster routines and is completely free, but it won&#x27;t work on ARM.  Note, it works fantastically well on AMD chips.  Anyway, it&#x27;s not that I can&#x27;t make my codes work on the new Apple chips, but I&#x27;d have to explain to my commercial clients that there&#x27;s another $50-100k upcharge due to the architecture change and licensing costs due to GPL restrictions.  That&#x27;s a lot to stomach.')
