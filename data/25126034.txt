I agree with everything you said, except I think Rust genuinely has a shot here. It doesn&#x27;t have a runtime, and you can choose to use just the core libraries or even no standard libraries. It exports to the C ABI, so it&#x27;s compatible with existing software and libraries. It isn&#x27;t a garbage pile like C++. And it solves a real problem C has, code safety. It&#x27;s silly to say any language will completely replace any other language, but I think Rust fits into the slot pretty well for the vast majority of cases where C is currently the best choice.')
