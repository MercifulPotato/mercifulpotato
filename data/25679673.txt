If you stick to Dino and Conversations (maybe Gajim too), the OMEMO is easier and more reliable to get working than Matrix&#x27;s encryption, and you can turn it off. I mainly use Matrix unencrypted because they don&#x27;t let you turn it back off, and it feels like most of my contacts don&#x27;t understand the device naming and verification stuff. (also sometimes device verification just doesn&#x27;t work). XMPP is also a LOT less laggy. Closer to IRC feel.<p>I still use Matrix, but it&#x27;s often frustrating with messages showing up late or out of order, and none of the clients feeling quite good enough yet. Especially if you use multiple accounts.<p>Every XMPP client I&#x27;ve used supports multiple accounts, but for Matrix I&#x27;ve only recently run into Quaternion which supports this, and I believe also Neochat (they both use libquotient), but they&#x27;re still rough to use.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t even consider options that aren&#x27;t free software, and I&#x27;d also exclude signal because of them not putting their app on f-droid, not being properly decentralized, relying on a phone number, etc. (note that both email and phone number are optional for Matrix accounts)')
