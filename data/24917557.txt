While our code of practice didn&#x27;t specify scheme or location, it&#x27;s pretty awful that this company didn&#x27;t seem to have anything in place. But I guess that&#x27;s to be expected from what sounds like a corporate firm rather than a set of practitioners. At this scale, clients are just numbers on a balance sheet.')
