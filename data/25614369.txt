It&#x27;s really crucial that you limit your goal for the day to something that you have nearly 100 percent confidence about. So even if you think &quot;I can do this whole thing today!&quot;, you should just pick off the first piece of it that&#x27;s definitely attainable to use as your goal.<p>In addition, on the few occasions where I didn&#x27;t manage to hit my goal by the end of the day (maybe three times in the last month), I&#x27;d take the time to figure out why that was and think of how I could have reframed the goal in a way that would have made it achievable. Usually when I missed a goal it was because it was either not specific enough or it was dependent on something else. For example, I might have had &quot;Push XYZ patch&quot;, when it should have been &quot;Make bugfixes to XYZ patch and push if able&quot;, since there&#x27;s always the possibility that the latest fixes introduce an unexpected problem or that the reviewer won&#x27;t get to the code review that day.')
