Certain benchmarks would show Intel holding onto a narrow lead in single core performance (IPC) which is only the top metric in a few scenarios where parallelism isn&#x27;t of consequence.<p>And certainly Intel leads in market share by a significant margin, so in that respect AMD hasn&#x27;t beat Intel yet.<p>But for a large number of use cases, AMD Zen-based x86 chips been a superior option to Intel at <i>least</i> since Zen 2 if not earlier for many uses (of course - heavy parallelism, improved efficiency, better value, easier to power and cool, etc.)')
