Even in a small country such as the Netherlands there&#x27;s wild price variations for fast internet if it&#x27;s available (at some places synchronous gigabit is offered for €34&#x2F;mo while at others offer it&#x27;s €90&#x2F;mo).<p>The map also doesn&#x27;t take into account the subdivision of countries, even huge ones like the US and Russia. You can&#x27;t compare Siberian or Alaskan internet prices, or Silicon Valley prices for that matter, to prices in densely populated areas. In African cities internet availability is a pain, but it&#x27;s infinitely better than internet availability in remote villages.<p>The map makes for nice colours but there&#x27;s no conclusion to be made from it. You need to process the data itself and combine it with other sources (like the average internet speeds reported by speedtest.net and several wealth indices) to get any use out of it.')
