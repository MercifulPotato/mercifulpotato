If you make a claim to the contrary, you are contradicting well-established science. I canâ€™t prevent you from denying scientific evidence, but I can tell you that this way you will never understand how the universe really works.</i>&quot;<p>I mean this is just flat out wrong and actually terrible science. Everyone who has taken a class on complex systems is aware of the phenomenon of emergence. You cannot understand the dynamics of a bird flock by breaking it down to the individual birds, and you cannot understand the dynamics of a hurricane by looking at each individual particle. A steering wheel cannot drive, an exhaust pipe cannot drive and a tire cannot drive, but a car can drive. The human mind is of course another important example. You can pry someone&#x27;s head open and break the brain down to its constituent parts, but you will not find a mind anywhere in there.<p>Systems can have properties that are not found in any of its parts, because it&#x27;s the <i>interaction</i> of the parts, not the parts themselves, that produce those properties. That is why reductionism has never been a successful enterprise, and why we indeed do not have a &quot;unified science&quot; (as some of the logical positivists imagined) which explains the totality of all things in one formal language. (i.e. physics).')
