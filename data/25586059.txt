Doesn’t that mean that some players will see things different than others? I my friend A stabs a monster and my other friend B also stabs a monster but they come in different order I would see A killing monster, but others might see B killing it instead?<p>Edit: probably the order of commands is kept in order via the chat room server no? But then what is it using WebRTC for? Perhaps the “host” is e source of truth for the order... meaning that all the commands speed and delay depend on the host network bandwidth.')
