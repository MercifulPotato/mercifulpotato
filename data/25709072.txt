I&#x27;ve always had weirdly loose shoulder joints (and can partially dislocate them), as well as weird things with the tendons in my knuckles.  And when I started lifting, I would always have trouble with the jerk.  Any time I did heavy jerks frequently, I would get escalating shoulder pain.  As I trained more, I got better at maintaining shoulder stability.  Power jerks still give me a lot of trouble, but split jerks are fine.  Though with the pandemic, I haven&#x27;t trained in months, and my shoulders are feeling all wonky again.<p>On a similar note, squatting was the absolute best thing for my knees.  I had knee pain since I was about ten, and it didn&#x27;t let up until I started squatting heavy.  And whenever I would stop for a couple weeks, the pain would come back.')
