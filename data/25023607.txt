Lieberman was an independent and broke with the democrats on many issues, including the ACA: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2009&#x2F;dec&#x2F;16&#x2F;joe-lieberman-barack-obama-us-healthcare" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2009&#x2F;dec&#x2F;16&#x2F;joe-lieberman-...</a> . Funnily enough, this kind of makes my point for me. Even during a near-supermajority, the Dems could barely pass some conservative healthcare reform, because the republicans threatened to filibuster <i>almost everything</i>. Historical report here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;id&#x2F;wbna35643530" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;id&#x2F;wbna35643530</a> . The filibuster has since been watered down to reduce that kind of abuse - and honestly I think the Democrats have learned that they need to play hardball, because Republicans sure as hell aren&#x27;t interested in compromise.<p>In fairness to you, I did under-consider the effects of the use of the filibuster during Trump&#x27;s term - appears that while the power of the filibuster has in general been watered down, the Democrats have been using it aggressively to block Trump&#x27;s nominations. I wonder if the republicans regret kicking off this trend.<p>&gt; Not a single republican voted for the bill<p>Sadly, we&#x27;ve reached a world where politicians largely vote as a block, not on their personal beliefs. I&#x27;d take this as indications of precisely nothing other than strategy. If you look at the bill itself, it&#x27;s conservative, and a clear compromise from what the majority of Democrats want.<p>&gt; It was Pelosi. Her position was my bill or nothing.<p>Patently untrue - she&#x27;s already come down from an initial position of 3T.<p>So unless Pelosi caves to the Republicans&#x27; exact demands it&#x27;s all on her? Let&#x27;s imagine McConnell says that he&#x27;ll approve a relief bill containing a trillion for the rich and a buck or two for the poor, is Pelosi solely responsible for delaying relief?<p>Pelosi is trying to get a level of relief that she views as appropriate. Of course the threat of walking away has to be there - otherwise the other side is free to offer something completely inadequate. If Pelosi and Trump of all people can get close to agreeing, it&#x27;s worth considering pointing the blame at McConnell.')
