Every team gets their own deploy pipeline and can deploy changes independent of each other, with their own error boundaries - awesome!<p>Over time though, the added overhead of micro-frontends really started slowing us down. For eg: instrumenting the web user experience with analytics, across app boundaries in a consistent fashion was a grueling coordination effort with multiple teams. A UI refresh would require coordinated effort across multiple teams. Sure, we had shared components, libraries with common business logic released as their own private packages, etc. But that&#x27;s the exact overhead I&#x27;m talking about. Upgrading a shared dependency across multiple apps was quite the hassle.<p>After a couple of years, we ended up switching back to a monolithic frontend, with a single React app.')
