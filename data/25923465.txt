This is much more useful in practice, assuming you can write a regex.<p>You could give it a list of image hashes to automatically filter. Once smartasses started perturbing images to change the hash, someone made a fork based on perceptual hashing.<p>Recursive filtering (I don&#x27;t want to see this, nor any conversation it spawned) works better with imageboard-style DAGs of posts because the mechanism is trivial, but is a powerful concept if it could be implemented more generally.<p>I&#x27;m probably forgetting a lot more examples but the point is that the ideas are out there and that powerful tools of that sort are definitely possible - it&#x27;s just that, for various reasons, the big social media players today don&#x27;t see value in building something like that for their users. It doesn&#x27;t help that modern social media&#x27;s general antipathy to adversarial interop prevents a lot of the easier third-party implementations of tools like this.')
