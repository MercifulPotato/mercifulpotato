It also should be easy to create pheromone traps if it is true that the hornet&#x27;s seek out the scent of other dead hornets.<p>On a side note, I see mites as a genetics issue. I would rather see commercial outfits using selection rather than treating with chemicals and shipping packages with weak genetics all over the US. Spearding weak genes is kind of the opposite of Darwin...')
