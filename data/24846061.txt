A pull request for &quot;performance optimization&quot;, basically a proposal to unwrap a higher abstraction to do it at a lower level, manually and directly.<p>Yes, it does save a few function calls and instantiating a class - but that&#x27;s not where the real bottleneck is. The proposed changes would require rewriting large amounts of code elsewhere, making the logic more verbose and complex.<p>It took some effort to convince the person that the trade-off isn&#x27;t worth it. I tried to be diplomatic, but I&#x27;m afraid they took it personally that the pull request was declined.<p>I wish I could have proved my objection with some metrics - how many milliseconds were shaved off by the proposal, versus the increased &quot;cyclomatic complexity&quot;, as a measurement of its detrimental effect on the code base.')
