Does censorship, even if justified, fuel anger and distrust, potentially increasing social conflict in the long-term?<p>Political divide in the USA has greatly increased in the last couple months. The blame lay solely at the hands of left leaning entities.<p>&gt;Is it possible to bring fringe groups back into the fold of peaceful civil discourse, or are we simply throwing up our hands and declaring that some percentage of the population must always have their speech regulated? (I suppose this question applies for both social groups and for individuals.)<p>That&#x27;s smoke and mirrors at best. The deplatforming being done in the name of banning &#x27;conspiracy theories&#x27; and &#x27;violent speech&#x27; is not at all a legitimate assertion.<p>This has been a coordinated effort to deplatform political opponents. &quot;censorship&quot; or &quot;freespeech&quot; are not considerations or problems. The platforms(twitteR) can decide if they want those people on their platform.<p>What it does mean is that eventually new platforms will exist that the left cant shutdown. The right-wing will move there and there will be even less political discourse and even more echo chamber issues.<p>More importantly, this level of deplatforming is orchestrated, it not only confirms the election was stolen, it makes this election the worst election in us history.')
