I&#x27;m going to read that.<p>I&#x27;ve thought a lot about charisma in the context of actors. People are drawn to certain actors for reasons that are hard to pin down. It&#x27;s most explicit in film action heroes. They&#x27;re often not the most attractive men and they&#x27;re rarely good actors, but people will go see a Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwartzenegger film even after a long string of flops. They are certainly full of the &quot;presence&quot; and &quot;power&quot; part of Fox-Cabane&#x27;s thesis, even if not the &quot;warmth&quot;.<p>I most want to know more about the &quot;presence&quot; aspect. I&#x27;m certain it can be taught, but I don&#x27;t entirely know how. I do think it ties in with another thing I&#x27;ve observed, that many of the most charismatic film actors have experience on stage, especially the UK stage. I believe it has to do with the way stage forces an actor to draw your eyes, where a film actor has a camera telling an audience where to look. I still don&#x27;t entirely know what it is they&#x27;re doing. Fox-Cabane may have ides.')
