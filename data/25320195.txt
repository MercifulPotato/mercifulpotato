Very risk invesment atm.<p>Property - buying real estate of any form is a very complicated process, where you get burned if you don&#x27;t understand the market.<p>Securities - same thing as stocks - unless you are trading options, features, interest rate swaps, etc. The same arguments apply, with more complexity.<p>bonds - aka padding for mutual funds to reduce their risk with, on paper. Near-zero yields.<p>Investments - are you going to repeat the same words that mean the same thing ad nauseum and act like it&#x27;s an argument?<p>Diversified portfolios - oh, I guess you are. Next you are going to say &quot;Index funds&quot; - what do I win?')
