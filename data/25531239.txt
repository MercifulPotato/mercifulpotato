This seems realistic.<p>So training people to be security-minded is useful. It&#x27;s the next line of defense.<p>How do you train your users? &quot;Just send an email and request that users report it to whoever is responsible&quot; as you mention is one thing. But you can also imagine someone complying with that but then falling for a well crafted phish (that happened to me, as I mention elsewhere in this thread.)<p>Being confronted with falling for something makes people take the threat more seriously. It takes someone&#x27;s attitude from &quot;it can&#x27;t happen to me&quot; to &quot;oh, it did happen to me.&quot;<p>&gt;&gt; at my company anything important is gated by a U2F token, among other things. We are simply &#x27;immune&#x27; to most types of phishing<p>I don&#x27;t know your business&#x27; threats but that seems na√Øve. Imagine your sales team gets a phish email asking them to list \n your biggest customers, including contact info and revenue &quot;so that we can send them an appropriate thank you gift for the holidays.&quot; If someone replies to this&#x2F;fills out the form, you have leaked critical information even though nobody has penetrated your system (so your tokens don&#x27;t help.) Even if this type of thing isn&#x27;t a problem for your business, you can imagine it is for many.')
