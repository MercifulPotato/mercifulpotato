I might use similar terms to describe my political beliefs if I was into labels, and I feel none of this. I&#x27;ve always been frank about my political leanings when it comes up, and no one I know has had any trouble talking about the issues while leaving the Candidates out of it. That said, given where the Republican party is right now, I can&#x27;t imagine voting for any R on the ballot (and contra-wise Biden and Jerry Brown are the only two D votes I&#x27;ve ever cast, both entirely in opposition to the frankly scary Republican opponent, not in support of the candidate).')
