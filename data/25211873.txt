IMO Apple and the Hackintosh community has been mutually benefited until now. Many who have accustomed to macOS from Hackintosh has eventually invested in Apple products.<p>Considering Apple has only went after those who profiteered by selling pre-built Hackintosh and not everyone who are profiteering from Hackintosh scene; I would say Apple did care about the Hackintosh community in some way.<p>I thought the higher performance&#x2F;price Hackintosh, especially with Ryzen might force Apple to act differently but now with M1, Apple needn&#x27;t worry about Hackintosh performance&#x2F;price anymore.')
