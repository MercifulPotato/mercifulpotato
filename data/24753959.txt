I&#x27;m torn between the part where co-authors were unable to access datasets for months (and never did get them in the end), the part where &quot;trolls and Stanford University professors&quot; were cast as villains who attack the noble science of criminology, and the part where the journal editors avoided following journal policies and instead launched a corrupt hunt for a whistleblower.<p>&gt; &quot;I never worked with (or even saw) any version of the data,&quot; Dr. Johnson wrote about Johnson et al. (2011).<p>That&#x27;s not good scientific method, is it? Criminology is already on extremely poor philosophical foundations, and now we see that it&#x27;s also a poorly-practiced science with nepotistic and corrupt methodologies.')
