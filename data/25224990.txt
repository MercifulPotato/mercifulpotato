You said &quot;the type system can never know what is semantically correct&quot; but I think the right way of saying it is &quot;the type system can sometimes not know what is semantically correct&quot;.<p>Because in practice, code like &quot;src := fromAccount.toSourceAccount()&quot; is very rare and happens at system boundaries or logic boundaries once - after that, all semantical errors can be caught by the typesystem, and this accounts for the vast majority of the code.<p>So yes, the typesystem can and will prevent semantical errors. But it can not protect you from making them in all cases, that&#x27;s impossible.')
