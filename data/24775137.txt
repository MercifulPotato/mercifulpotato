People were abandoning the ship in the millions after that fiasco. Until then, they had it good. Thet could get all the ad sales they could handle, they were reading the emails of millions (exactly like Google, Microsoft, and other &#x27;free&#x27; services do), they kept tabs on everyone.<p>They dropped the ball so hard, it just did not bounce back after that. &quot;Lately&quot;, every time I duck (DDG) something and I see it&#x27;s a yahoo hosted site, I just close it and go to the next. I am in Europe, GDPR is, thankfully, the rule here, and the number of &lt;bad word&gt; trackers, advertisers, and other crap that I have to agree with to read something in the Yahoo universe is &quot;too damn high&quot; (to quote the meme).<p>Goodbye Yahoo, we had a good ride, and then you messed it up, HARD. Yahoo managed to mess up so many things..  (I dislike Yahoo mostly for the Tumblr fiasco).<p>Farewell and adieu fair Spanish ladies..<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yahoo!_data_breaches" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yahoo!_data_breaches</a>')
