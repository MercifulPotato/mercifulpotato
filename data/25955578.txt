I&#x27;ve been there quite a few times even though I live in the UK, it is well worth the trip to combine Ottawa and Lachine&#x2F;Montreal partying.<p>First time out I followed a Riot paddler who was keen to take me out as the rest of my crew didn&#x27;t want to go. There was a massive thunderstorm and I noticed that everyone else had gone so I paddled back alone, riding the lightening.<p>Great times.')
