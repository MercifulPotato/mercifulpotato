It portrays a trial from the perspective of a lawyer&#x27;s daughter. The fact that it&#x27;s portrayed from a white person&#x27;s point of view doesn&#x27;t somehow invalidate the story unless you&#x27;re just anti-white.<p><i>they support the continuation of power structures that make it systematically difficult for minorities to have equal levels of opportunity.

There are plenty of educated people who disagree with you.<p>To ban this book is to further narrow the field of political opinions acceptable to the liberal educational elites.')
