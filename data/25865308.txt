They need to suck oxygen into their body as quickly and efficiently as possible to maintain consciousness, because the g-forces forces blood away from their heads and towards their legs and feet.<p>Here&#x27;s a &quot;classic&quot; video of a pilot successfully evading an unbelievable number of SAMs over Iraq. The rapid breathing might make you think he&#x27;s panicking. Nope, he&#x27;s got it 100% under control and is following training perfectly. Though I&#x27;m sure he certainly needed a drink after making it home.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qUjX1RntqVw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qUjX1RntqVw</a><p>There&#x27;s also sort of a method of flexing their thighs that they learn. Restricts blood flow to the legs, so there&#x27;s more blood for the rest of the body. That&#x27;s a bit of an athletic endeavor in and of itself. Try flexing your thighs... now hold them that way for 5, 10, 20 minutes. Yikes.<p>Anyway, how the hell could you even bark out voice commands while doing that sort of breathing!?!?')
