Really loosening control of the app store is another thing.<p>Doubling the fees at the $1,000,000 mark lights up many of my &quot;institution design&quot; danger signals.<p>Regimes like this usually cause people to change their business so they stay under the $1,000,000 mark.  For instance in France the employment law gets rigorous for firms that employ more than 50 people so you find a lot of 49 person firms.<p>People feel resentful when they feel they are being exploited or controlled and some will forgo $10,000 in revenues to save $1000 in taxes or fees.<p>Two factors that impact this are:<p>- the &quot;two-sided market&quot; means that each app install creates (global) value for existing apps.  (e.g. 100 mini-Facebooks are not as valuable as 1 Facebook)<p>- others follow the &quot;spray and pray&quot; model where they mass produce a family of apps and since it costs much less than $10‚Å∂ to form a legal entity it makes sense to disperse.')
