That&#x27;s important, only because there seems to be a new commonly held belief by the faithful that &quot;no CPUs compete with the M1 in any sense of the word.&quot; That&#x27;s an inaccurate belief.<p>Remember the original statement I responded to:<p>&gt; I haven&#x27;t seen a review where it has underperformed any other comparable device.')
