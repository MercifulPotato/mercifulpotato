One, typically executable code is packaged in a file along with other content, otherwise, the OS doesn&#x27;t know that the contents are intended to be executed.<p>The broader problem is, if you could somehow work around that... what are you going to _do_? You need OS-specific code to read and write files, to display things, to get input from the keyboard&#x2F;mouse, to talk to the network. It&#x27;s not like Ye Olden Days where you can just write directly to the display memory and have things show up, the OS controls your access to all of the hardware. An OS-agnostic executable can&#x27;t accomplish much on a modern PC.')
