But I think they are rare.<p>Also the risks aren&#x27;t symmetrical.  If you take an MVP approach and find out an MVP doesn&#x27;t work you can always build a bigger badder product, you&#x27;re out a little bit of time(relatively).  If however you build out a big bad product and find out you don&#x27;t have product market fit.  You&#x27;re much more screwed.<p>Another reason this advice is useful, is because new founders who are more likely to rely on advice and rules of thumb over their own experience are far less capable of solving an un-mvp-able ideas simply because they&#x27;ll have far less access to the capital required to build a big bad product.')
