But I don&#x27;t want to run a server for such tasks. Desktop CPUs like modern Ryzens work pretty well for it.<p>Also, single core performance benefits gaming, especially when you run things in Wine where there is more overhead.<p>Hardware accelerated video encoding is already handled by discreet GPUs, so the benefit of putting that also in a CPU&#x2F;APU is moot in the desktop use case.<p>What so far is missing are cards that support AV1 encoding in hardware. I doubt Apple will be much of help here too.')
