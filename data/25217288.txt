I think it&#x27;s unfortunate though that discussions like this will seldom produce a good or convincing example as much as I agree it would be good to have them.<p>The issue as I see is that people with balanced and nuanced views and an appreciation of the complexity of the matter will just not bother participating in the discussion.  Instead, we&#x27;ll hear from people with the most extreme or emotionally driven views and they&#x27;ll tend to pick unconvincing examples-- even if there are better examples to be had.')
