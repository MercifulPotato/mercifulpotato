I&#x27;d like to add on  this with my own experience.<p>4 years ago I joined a gym and that is hands down the best choice I made in my life.<p>While I agree on&#x2F;confirm all other points, 6, 7 and 8 aren&#x27;t that easy: everytime I talk about my hobby, I usually get one of these feedbacks:<p>- &quot;he&#x27;s dangerous, better stay away before a brawl starts&quot;<p>- &quot;nah, you don&#x27;t looke like a fighter&quot; (my body is slim type)<p>- general ignorant remarks about kickboxing vs muahy thai, or this gym vs that gym. Or my sport is better than yours.<p>The issue is two fold:<p>On one side, people are generally ignorant regarding martial arts (mechanics, techniques, mindset, morality).<p>On the other side, training usually gives you enough muscles to practice the art (and you&#x27;ll notice that), but it might not be enough to give you &quot;visible&quot; muscles: for that you need a diet and training tailor suited to your body parameters.<p>(EDIT: formatting)')
