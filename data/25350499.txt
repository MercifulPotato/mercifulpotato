They always maximize the truck space with boxes wedged up to the ceiling. But if they are short-staffed they will have too few loaders for too many trucks and the packages won&#x27;t be arranged in a findable way for the delivery drivers. The trucks would actually be less full since the loaders won&#x27;t have time to play Tetris with the boxes.')
