If you look at municipal budgets infrastructure is usually around 10%.  There isn&#x27;t one out there that spends a majority of their budget on infrastructure.  The expensive things are cops and schools and fire and other labor intensive services.<p>The municipalities that have gone bankrupt the issue has almost always been an inability to pay pensions.  With the other ones caused by financial fraud and&#x2F;or mismanagement.<p>For the life of me I can&#x27;t understand why people keep posting this Strongtowns nonsense.  Their core hypothesis is easily probable wrong and they post the silliest numbers.  Like this one pegs Lafayette&#x27;s infrastructure replacement at 32 billion.  Yet Lafayette&#x27;s entire budget is only 0.6 billion.  Since they haven&#x27;t spent the entire budget for last 50+ years on infrastructure that 32 billion is obviously nonsense.')
