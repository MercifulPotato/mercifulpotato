In my tests, with a Rails app, &quot;standard&quot; dynos are looking surprisingly slow, possibly unacceptably so.  Very curious to hear about other people&#x27;s heroku formations if anyone wants to share. What platform you&#x27;re on (Rails or something else), and what your response times look like, would also be interesting.')
