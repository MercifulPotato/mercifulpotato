I&#x27;m talking about 8% of funds miraculously disappearing during currency exchange. I don&#x27;t understand why anybody would bother going via USD.<p>You need to shop around for a better US bank account. This is not a common thing for us to do so if you pick up a random bank then youâ€™ll be paying close to 10% in various conversion and fx fees. There are definitely US banks that charge 1%, some even 0%.')
