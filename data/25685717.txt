I am hateful and distrusting of closed-source voting machines. Perhaps it was wrong to appeal to the tired old &quot;let&#x27;s have ruinous economic sanctions on most foreign nations&quot; prejudice that so many public officials pretend to have... At some level it would be nice if the people administering elections in a particular jurisdiction were subject to the laws of that jurisdiction.<p>Voting machines are inherently a challenge to verify. Even if the voter herself compiles source code and loads the resulting object into the machine before voting, it&#x27;s impossible for her to verify the hardware is actually using that object. The paper ballots produced by these machines have marks next to candidates, but they also have an opaque bar code and that&#x27;s what gets scanned when votes are &quot;recounted&quot;. On top of all this, considering the design and code of these machines to be commercial secrets ensures error and distrust.')
