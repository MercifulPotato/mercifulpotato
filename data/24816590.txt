The maintenance costs are amortized in the per-kwh cost to consumers, same as with nuclear or gas or coal.<p>Single houses can&#x27;t live off just solar energy because they aren&#x27;t diversified like a nation can be (in terms of storage, routing, diversity of technologies, etc).<p>Nuclear is nice in theory, but unfortunately they are managed by humans, and humans do stupid things like run them past their decommission date or fail to locate backup generators above flooding level or skimp on maintenance and inspections. And nuclear accidents create no-go zones that last millenia. Only truly &quot;meltdown-proof&quot; reactors would avoid this problem, but R&amp;D into this is terribly slow and seems to be obstructed at every turn by incumbents.')
