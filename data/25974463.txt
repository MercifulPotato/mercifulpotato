There was some leaks to fix, but nothing significant, only $300 for the entire work. I have a truck that is now 22 years old and also 150k miles, but it is a diesel and so you will probably say it doesn&#x27;t count.  My last car (sold only because my job let me take the bus) was at 260k miles and no issues (though I did change the timing belt on schedule).<p>Modern cars will generally last at least 300k miles today with few problems.  When the finally die it is because the body is shot - something that has nothing to do with the power train.  (I live in an area where winter means a lot of salt on the roads, my friends in warmer areas report cars lasting even longer).<p>Of course I probably shouldn&#x27;t say this. People like you who trade in their almost new cars all the time because they are afraid they are a money pit keep people like me in nice cars for not much money.')
