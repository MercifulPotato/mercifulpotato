They embraced Islam after sacking Baghdad and slaughtering the Caliph, having had him trampled by horses. When Timurlane invaded India he would erect mountains of infidel skulls after battle [0]. His descendants followed that practice though to be fair they practiced this against all opponents just not infidels however it speaks to their barbarianism. All Mughals from Timurlane to Aurangzeb destroyed temples, smashed idols and butchered the priests and monks. Dozens of Indian religious sects that were heterodox (outside) to classical Hindu thought like Carvaka, who were material rationalists, were exterminated including most Buddhist and Jain sects. Buddhist traditions that exist outside India have recorded these holocausts.<p>Akbar, who you eulogize, as having ushered in a golden age was anything but. He carried out the fanaticism of his ancestors and was proud to be known as a Ghazi or &quot;great Islamic warrior&quot;. Amongst his notorious deeds that are whitewashed are destroying temples and idols and rewarding those who killed infidels and soaked their beards in their blood [2].<p>Aurangzeb who ruled from 1618 onwards was the 6th emperor had thousands of temples destroyed like his illustrious great grand father.
