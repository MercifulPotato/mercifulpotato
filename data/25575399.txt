You have to do everything yourself and carry all your stuff, but there are checkpoints with volunteers, marshals that you can join to get a good pace, loads of friendly people and so on. You also get to refill your food at checkpoints, and they make sure people know where to find water.<p>I have done Fj채llr채ven Classic in Sweden two times and Hong Kong once and love it.')
