I&#x27;m afraid if it becomes too popular they&#x27;ll add new features and ruin it.<p>My process of writing anything goes through this tool. I write in a plain text file to avoid distraction. Then run it through this app to simplify the writing and make it more legible. Then I pass it through scribens, another tool in my pipeline to catch mistakes. Since I can never find someone to read and edit my work, I convert it to audio and using a TTS reader.<p>It drastically improves my writing.')
