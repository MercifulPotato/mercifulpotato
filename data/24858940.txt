When they are mandated and gas models aren&#x27;t sold then manufacturers will make cheaper models to meet the market&#x27;s demand.<p>That isn&#x27;t how that works. You can&#x27;t just make something cheaper by fiat. It takes time, demand and technological advancement. Banning new ICE vehicles unilaterally will make it so nobody can afford a new car.')
