For Nazis, it&#x27;s about Aryans vs Jews, where the &quot;Aryan race&quot; is considered to consist of tall, blond, blue-eyed people. Most Greeks would not be considered Aryan, as would most Germans, for that matter.<p>I find it quite telling that you are surprised Greeks might be considered anything but white, while not showing any surprise about Turks. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any difference in skin color, so that confirms my suspicion that &quot;whiteness&quot; isn&#x27;t just about looks.')
