I dont need anything else other than that green bill or a zelle transfer. Bitcoin is pretty much useless in venezuela and the few people who uses it, also uses it to buy &quot;cheaper&quot; currency exchange of VES&#x2F;USD since its literally just a bunch of corrupts and drugdealers trying to wash their USD so you usually get more VES per 1USD&#x2F;BTC than per 1 USD<p>PS: bitcoin holder since 2014, so im not here with anti crypto propaganda<p>PS2: i find it weird that noone here talks about USDT')
