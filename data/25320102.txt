A cynical take on this is that Brown has always had strict residency requirements for its students, and residency fees are <i>far</i> above the market rate in Providence. If students could simply mark themselves as &quot;remote&quot; to get out of paying dorm fees, I&#x27;m sure many would.<p>The other key bit of context is just how poor of a job Brown did at geolocating students. Dozens of students (some international!) received baseless notices of reprimand. The most compelling theory I&#x27;ve seen is that these students were using Brown&#x27;s VPN, and were identified as on campus via IP geolocation.')
