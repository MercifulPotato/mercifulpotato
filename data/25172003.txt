Weâ€™ve played chess, worked on learning languages, picked up musical instruments, learned to ski, learned to hunt mushrooms, electronics projects, woodworking projects... sure sometimes you have to keep it at an age-appropriate level, but there are things I want to learn and if I include them then they benefit and grow as well. My kids are now at an age too where they are starting to pick things up on their own and then they can teach me.')
