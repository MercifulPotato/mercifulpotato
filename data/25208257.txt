Deception is not always wrong – there are extraordinary cases when we understand a doctor’s need to lie. I imagine doctors overstate their confidence to children before a particularly complicated surgery. Sometimes – very rarely – it may be the best option among only very bad options. Deception should be a last resort, not the rule. As we look to the future, the field of economics must cease it’s cavalier compliance with lying – even with perceived prosocial lying.<p>I find this statement rather odd and clearly incompatible with the very specific claim that &quot;we fervently and unequivocally condemn deceit of any kind in the medical field&quot;. Well, do we or don&#x27;t we?<p>In any case, you&#x27;re correct that the article taken as a whole is a bit more careful. In my comment I&#x27;m telescoping in a bit on the one claim about doctors and the role our intuitions about honesty in the medical field are supposed to play in the argument.')
