Prime example of this is modern US copyright and patent laws and enforcement.<p>As long as elected officials have to raise funds to campaign and win, elected officials will be beholden to the people who financed them.  If politicians didn&#x27;t write special laws and loopholes for corporate special interests, they wouldn&#x27;t last more than one term.  They would be replaced by the next challenger who would take special interest money and then &quot;pay it back&quot; via special laws.')
