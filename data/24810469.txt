No one is going to design such a big ship with no additional backup power supply and certainly those aren’t just batteries.<p>I don’t understand why people here still keep coming up with arguments against nuclear when countries with a large share of nuclear in their energy mix have the lowest emissions in their energy sector.<p>Oh, and the waste isn’t really a problem. In fact, nuclear waste is one of the best types of waste.<p>See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;ne&#x2F;articles&#x2F;5-fast-facts-about-spent-nuclear-fuel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;ne&#x2F;articles&#x2F;5-fast-facts-about-spent-...</a>')
