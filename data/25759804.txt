Creator or current maintainer owes you and other users exactly nothing.</i>&quot; is a non-sequitur, it doesn&#x27;t hold up. Whether you have the source code and rights to redistribute it is orthogonal to whether the creator or current owner has a contract with you and &quot;owes&quot; you anything.<p>Having access to the source doesn&#x27;t automatically mean the owner&#x2F;maintainer owes you nothing. I think the comment is promoting only the &quot;FOSS == gratis&quot; side of getting things for free ($0) and not considering the original &quot;FOSS == insight and rights, even if paid for&quot; side of things.')
