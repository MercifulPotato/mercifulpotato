If I ever finish those, there’s a few other “retro” stuff I’d like to look into. I also play with more modern stuff, mostly imagining implementing an 802.11 controller (hopefully a 802.11bb one when released) and a custom DOCSIS modem.<p>Part of my problem with a lot of this stuff (and why I imagine I don’t see a lot of people doing it) is 1. I generally need a lot of expensive equipment to be able to designed labs for this stuff that I can’t  always immediately (or ever) afford and 2. It requires knowledge from several separate and often complex fields. Also it’s a lot of work and time to invest in a niche interest solely out of curiosity.')
