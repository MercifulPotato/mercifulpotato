Item(by='gsnedders', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607928268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25412779, text='It&#x27;s worthwhile pointing out that there have been significant changes to aviation since, most notably the move to twin-engine aircraft. But ultimately that was made possible through small incremental improvements in engine design (and material sciences and manufacturing). There haven&#x27;t been similar leaps forward since.<p>The Boeing 747-8 is 29% more fuel efficient than the 747-100 in absolute terms before you even start considering the extra space it has as a larger aircraft. Some of that is aerodynamic refinement (and they&#x27;re limited by starting with the older airframe!) and some of that is newer engines. And the 747-8 is relatively poor compared with many newer airframe designs.')
