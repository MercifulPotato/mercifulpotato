It’s the equity comp that is the difference, and the part that is more a function of the leverage you have as a candidate. H1-Bs are more desperate and less likely to have leverage to ask for high equity comp without a bunch of other offers.<p>And again the bigger part of wanting H1-Bs is that they’ll work a lot harder and turnover will be lower due to threat of having to leave the country.')
