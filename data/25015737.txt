I would pull transport info in from Transport For London, News in from where ever relevant, Reddit posts, my current finances from my bank, Home info from HASS, Server statistics, etc..<p>Ultimately I would like a service where I could hook into existing connectors, or write my own adaptors to pull data and display on a dashboard.<p>Does anyone have any experience with such software or other solutions? I&#x27;ve been toying with some ideas and services, but was curious about existing services that already have the framework in place (and hopefully connectors), as I don&#x27;t want to go reinventing the wheel for logging, caching, etc.')
