That&#x27;s essentially how I would pass a few days here and there to save money on food and expenses.<p>I would sleep as much as possible, fast until around 8pm, and eat a cheap meal (e.g. bulk pasta and tomato sauce I made from marked down cans of tomato and froze), then back to bed. A lot of the time, if I couldn&#x27;t sleep, I would read. This was pre internet and I didn&#x27;t have a phone or tv.<p>Days go by pretty fast like that (it was very, very cold out each time I did this and I had inadequate clothing for the weather so even a walk was not happening).<p>Eventually, the next thing I had to do would come up and I&#x27;d get back to normal. For context, I worked in kitchens so work meant &quot;free&quot; food (my jobs paid very little) or a couple times I was in a cabin in the middle of nowhere waiting for the weather to clear so I could dig out and get my car in the road. Nice to do this when you have a good supply of stove wood and a good book.')
