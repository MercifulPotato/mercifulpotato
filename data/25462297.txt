Google discussion search was <i>the</i> most powerful tool to find real world information. You could put in the model number of some product you knew nothing about (e.g. a camera or boat motor) and discussion search results would reveal many different forum threads where professionals and aficionados had discussed the product in detail; those same forums were already hard to find and a search for &quot;boat motor forum&quot; wouldn&#x27;t necessarily bring you to the same forums and even if so, requires many extra steps to arrive at the same thread.')
