If you look on the total effect of society then probably not. I mean to have competetive companies you need people who have worked(or played) their ass off and achieved skills and knowledge which only the mixture of privilege, work and skills can achieve. You actually want to give the smart kids extra tuition, because mostly these people will innovate later.\n(I dont mean to speak in absolutes here, but on average)\nSociety is not only about distribution but to distribute something you have to create it first.<p>So I would say, yes it is a flaw of meritocracy, but meritocracy is  not flawed.')
