I chose to go on a partial media blackout in 2020 so the only things I&#x27;ve seen about the issue are some mathematical rebuttals on YouTube, whatever I see here on HN, and whatever I hear from my conservative friends.<p>It&#x27;s likely some people are acting in bad faith, but many more just haven&#x27;t seen convincing enough counterevidence to counteract what they&#x27;ve heard from &quot;the other side&quot;.  If we flag their posts so it&#x27;s not even visible to most users and impossible to reply to, then it&#x27;s impossible to have that conversation and we are just proving their claims of censorship and a lack of evidence.<p>I think it would help to have a summary essay, not attached to any news outlet, that simply listed the publicized claims of fraud (like this claim that mail-in voting is fraudulent), who benefits and loses (democrats are more likely to mail in ballots especially in 2020, so discrediting mail-in voting favors republicans), what evidence exists, what counterarguments invalidate the allegations, and whether the alleged fraud was sizable enough to sway the election.  Boring and emotionless, like a spreadsheet.')
