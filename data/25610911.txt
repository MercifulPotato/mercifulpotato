You said you would work for the devil himself. We werenâ€™t talking about Facebook. Also, being overburdened with crippling medical bills for your dying child would obviously complicate the moral calculus.<p>&gt; The breathtaking presumptuousness and pompous assumption that my life viewpoint is holding me back is...amusing, honestly.<p>Fair point... But I didn&#x27;t have much to go off of. Look at what you wrote. It doesn&#x27;t come across well.')
