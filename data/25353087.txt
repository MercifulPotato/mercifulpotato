Nassim Taleb uses book sales as an example: popular authors get more popular exponentially. But something physically bounded like height follows a normal distribution.<p>To put it another way, let&#x27;s say you have two randomly selected authors. Their average earnings are $1,000,000 per year. Is it more likely that they each earn roughly $1,000,000 per year, or that one earns $1,000,000+ and the other almost nothing?<p>On the other hand, you have two women whose average height is 1.7m. Is it more likely that one woman is 30cm tall and the other is over 3m tall or that they are both roughly 1.7m?')
