Withstanding pressure requires reinforcement, which means weight, which... see above.<p>So while there are no &quot;official&quot; numbers as to what constitutes launch depth, physics dictates there is a maximum practical number.<p>So what to do about it?<p>Well, nuclear attack submarines generally exist to try and follow nuclear ballistic missile submarines.<p>Any any given point in time, &gt;0 and &lt;all ballistic missile submarines are being shadowed, likely without knowing it.<p>Consequently, were a substantial launch order given... a <i>lot</i> of those missile subs would start a very synchronized and quick rise to shallower depths, as well as possibly creating mechanical noise related to launch preparations.<p>After that, well, that&#x27;s what preset plans of action in different threat scenarios are for...')
