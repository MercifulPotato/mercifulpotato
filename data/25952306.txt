If you want to help you can resign.&quot; So maybe not that bipartisan.</i><p>This is misrepresentation (of a tweet, you could have just quoted the entire thing!):<p><i>&quot;I am happy to work with Republicans on this issue where there’s common ground, but you almost had me murdered 3 weeks ago so you can sit this one out.<p>Happy to work w&#x2F; almost any other GOP that aren’t trying to get me killed.<p>In the meantime if you want to help, you can resign.&quot;</i><p>So to summarize: yes to working with Republicans, no to working with Ted Cruz, the most hated man in the senate.')
