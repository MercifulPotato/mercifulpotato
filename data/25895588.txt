Rather than accept eating blant foods until your taste buds&#x2F;brain adjust you should sprinkle powder onto your tongue before every meal to confuse your taste buds? What are the long term effects?<p>Nothing against the berry&#x2F;your product (although I find adding $1.30 of powder to each meal crazy) but is that how weak-willed the average person has become?<p>More personally, why would you need this for Greek yoghurt? Are we talking about actual high-fat-high-protein Greek yoghurt made purely from milk, or is there some &#x27;Greek(-style) yoghurt&#x27; that actually tastes horrible? Everyone I know seems to love pure Greek yoghurt, with at most some berries or granola on top.')
