If it feels snappy then they&#x27;re good enough at algorithms for the kind of software that they create, if it doesn&#x27;t then maybe it&#x27;s worth looking into whether or not there&#x27;s a good reason for that.<p>Like if you apply for a job at the NYT, I doubt they make you do a timed writing test with people staring at you and asking you questions in the middle. They probably just read some of the previous work you&#x27;ve done.')
