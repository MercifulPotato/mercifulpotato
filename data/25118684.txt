The posters would brag about cheating, and would justify it by saying the course material was bullshit and the professors were unreasonable and the degree was just gatekeeping. They&#x27;d describe the arms race between students figuring out new ways to cheat and the effort expended by the professors to thwart cheating.<p>At Caltech, it was effortless to cheat and professors made no attempt to thwart it. (That said, if two exam papers came back with the same mistakes, the students would still have some &#x27;splainin&#x27; to do.)<p>The students all knew each other (being a small university) and the A students were often asked to help out the struggling students (I got a <i>lot</i> of help this way), and so it was pretty obvious to spot an A student who didn&#x27;t actually master the material. You knew they earned it.')
