This loads instantly without installation on an iPhone, an Android phone, a Windows PC, a Mac, an Xbox, a PlayStation, a Nintendo Switch, a Tesla, etc.<p>Even if you could write a native 3D app that runs on all of those (probably the only sensible way would be to use Unity or similar) you&#x27;d be stuck with a long and slow installation step instead of an instant load experience. Even worse, you&#x27;d be at the mercy of each platform&#x27;s capricious gatekeeper. Have fun passing certification requirements for all those consoles, buying a Mac to build your iOS binaries, paying the associated developer program fees, and good luck getting your app on Tesla and the long tail of smart fridges etc.')
