And the purpose of patent law was to reward people for inventing or creating by allowing them to recoup the costs of inventing and creating.<p>There was no fair use exception back then; courts were <i>extremely harsh</i> on copyright and patent law offenders. It wasn&#x27;t until Congress codified &quot;fair use&quot; into the law in the 1970s. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;msu.edu&#x2F;~mcgrat71&#x2F;Writing&#x2F;Fair_Use_Rife.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;msu.edu&#x2F;~mcgrat71&#x2F;Writing&#x2F;Fair_Use_Rife.pdf</a>')
