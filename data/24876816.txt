There needs to be a way to focus (aka view in full screen) on something  without having to hold down the f key. If screen sharing was as good as it is in Zoom, Hubs could actually be a Zoom replacement for online classes. But not being able to share your screen in a way that the others can view full screen makes Hubs unusable.')
