I heard somewhere that complex empires historically have a life expectancy of ca. 300 years.<p>Yup, that&#x27;s the worry.<p>&gt; - I also heard somewhere that the Arab Srping revolutions took off in full only when the panicked government shut down social media. True or not, it’s an insteresting “what if”. The “panem et circenses” government should maybe think twice about turning off Twitter (in practice) for these subjects, no?<p>I had not heard that.  I think it&#x27;s a bit unfair to compare people being oppressed by an actual dictator in a relatively poor country to people who live in one of the richest countries in the world.  All these people had the means to pay for transport across this massive country and pay for lodging.  If you&#x27;re really struggling can you afford to buy a round trip plane ticket and a hotel?<p>Also Twitter hasn&#x27;t been turned off for the people, just for the leaders and presumably instigators.  They&#x27;re still all gonna be able to freely talk shit about Biden and libtards, they just won&#x27;t be getting orders from the top.<p>&gt; - life looks to be getting less comfy, with COVID. A year ago I would feel more at home in the comfy prosperity argument but today that rings hollow<p>True, COVID has caused a decrease in the QOL.  But on a macro level, there is still enough food, shelter, healthcare, and Call of duty to go around.  I think it&#x27;s enough to keep a large chunk of the population from seriously considering taking up arms.<p>Much of my opinions on this topic come from this video, I highly recommend it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rStL7niR7gs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rStL7niR7gs</a>.')
