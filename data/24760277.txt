Item(by='bdowling', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602542392, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24758849, text='&gt; you need a form suitable for modification by a skilled stranger with little prior exposure to said work<p>That’s a nice idea, but it’s not a condition of the GPL. GPL v2 and v3 both only state, “The ‘source code’ for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.” That definition exists because without it a licensee might try to argue that distribution of modified and then obfuscated code satisfies the source code offer condition.<p>Regarding a project licensed to others under the GPL, if the project owner accepts contributions under the GPL, then he becomes a licensee of the contributions. So, as you pointed out, he would need to meet the “preferred form” clause and other terms, at least as regards to the contributed portions. As you might expect, for a substantial project with many contributors, this could become very complicated. Therefore, many projects require contributions be made under a more liberal license (or even a copyright assignment) that allows the contribution to be sub-licensed to others without conditions.')
