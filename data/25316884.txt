You may not be using heroin but I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;re certainly using some kind of illegal drug or legal drug on the regular. You have personal stake in the game. But that&#x27;s just a guess, I&#x27;m certainly not accusing you of it, you can say you&#x27;re totally drug free and that&#x27;s fine, I won&#x27;t say you&#x27;re wrong.<p>&gt;This actually hurts marijuhana legislation efforts as people like you just assume I am a coke&#x2F;heroin&#x2F;meth addict. And feel pushed to keep things forbidden alltogether.<p>Did I push this? So you do use mj on the regular. It&#x27;s not a &quot;hard&quot; drug but it shows you have a biased stake in the game.<p>Anyway I&#x27;m not pushing anything. My agenda as I said before. Is I don&#x27;t know.<p>&gt;This actually hurts marijuhana legislation efforts as people like you just assume I am a coke&#x2F;heroin&#x2F;meth addict. And feel pushed to keep things forbidden alltogether.<p>So you admit that this is your bias.<p>&gt;(I suppose you ended up on dangs watchlist or even got shadowbanned, as not many people else read this thread now, if at all)<p>I can flip privacy setting on and off. I made a personal post just for you.')
