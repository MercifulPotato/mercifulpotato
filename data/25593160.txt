I&#x27;ve replaced enough software with CL, that now I can&#x27;t stand to use a computer without it. With CL you can do whatever the fuck you want, all the time. It&#x27;s glorious. The limitations are your own ability, and having to interface to crappy non-CL software, idiotic non-Lisp protcols, and hardware seemingly designed to be operated by spavined brine shrimp. But also I&#x27;m &quot;eccentric&quot; and I like exiling myself to the software wilderness, where you have great freedom, but have to be very self reliant.')
