Basic DVI is somewhat VGA with analog signal replaced with TDMS. I think if you limit yourself to only few predefined colors with 8b10b encoding hardwired in shift registers, it&#x27;s doable. (for signal integrity you can only pick colors that have balanced encoding)<p>edit: as pointed in other comment, lowest bit clock is 250MHz, which might be a problem, it seems fastest discrete logic chips are topping out at ~150MHz')
