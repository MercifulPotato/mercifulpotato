I gave up scaling though because it&#x27;s garbage.<p>The gnome-tweaks solution mentioned in the article works, but it&#x27;s buggy.  Some apps ignore the setting (Dia, I&#x27;m looking at you!) and in some distros (Mint, I&#x27;m looking at you) parts of the OS bug out, with e.g., some dock icons being scaled and some not. Anyway, the resulting hodge-podge was awful enough that I&#x27;m using a 1080 resolution on my fancy 4K screen.<p>Remaining issues include video playback, which bugs out from time to time, bluetooth, which mostly works except when it doesn&#x27;t want to connect or when it sets the sound profile to the early-bleedingly awful HSP setting.<p>One issue worth mentioning is new hardware. When I switched I bought a (then new) X1 Carbon 7, which turned out to have no support for its fancy new digital microphone. The driver took six months to make its way into mainstream distros and I spent this period doing telecon calls with voice via my telephone and video via the webcam.<p>Anyway, everything mostly works these days. One thing I enjoy compared to modern macs is not having to fight my machine over the right to install software I want (code signing my own gdb binaries is an awful experience).')
