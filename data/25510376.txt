At the worst, OP could turn this into a learning excercise on how to negotiate in a tough situation, with zero downside compared to the advice given here.<p>This doesn&#x27;t have to be a protracted legal battle, but reading up on documents they signed, figuring out their proiories (continue in biz? get at least some value out? etc) and negotiating in good faith is something that might come very handy later, in another startup, with much more to lose.')
