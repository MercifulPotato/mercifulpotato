That being said, I do think you lose out on a lot of convenience with an iPhone as your sole camera.<p>To start, you can actually crop. You can use lenses with a higher focal length than 70mm, which for many people makes all the difference in portraits. If you&#x27;re using something like ProRAW, you&#x27;re limited to 1&#x2F;3 of an FPS vs 20FPS.<p>If you want to capture the moment on an ILC, you can also just hold the shutter. This would be the very first time we go from a platform that has higher image quality and more editing lattitude to a technology that has less of it. The replacement isn&#x27;t an entire tool belt and bags of gear, for me it&#x27;s an A7ii and a 28-75 2.8 (for a total cost lower than the iPhone 12 Pro + my current phone and will outlive it by four or five times).<p>As for sales, the iPhone has already gobbled up everything except the high end camera market, which is actually seeing increasing sales, so we&#x27;ll see about that. I don&#x27;t find it all that probable.<p>As for ProRAW, it&#x27;s technically completely inferior to, say, an ARW file.')
