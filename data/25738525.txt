If only for the short time to honor their duty.<p>Someone in the mob threw a fire extinguisher at Officer Sicknick&#x27;s head. Later on the 1&#x2F;6th, Sicknick collapsed due to a stroke (probably related to the beating he received). A day later on the 7th, he succumbed to his injury and died. I don&#x27;t believe he ever &quot;returned to duty&quot;, but now that we have his name, his story is at least more easily searchable.')
