I&#x27;m not using the word &quot;true&quot; thoughtlessly, it&#x27;s just that there seems to be a common theme among the varied descriptions of absolutely intense camaraderie between blood brothers, soldiers, and so on that leads me to believe that most of what we experience as friendship is a diluted version of those bonds. In an industrial information based economy with social media, where most threats are about soulless boredom or withstanding the daily grind, it&#x27;s even harder to form such bonds in any genuine way.')
