(+1 to govdeals too, when the auction is in geographic range)  While we&#x27;ve gotten nibbles from accelerators, up to the interview stage, they want to see an MVP before funding us.  This is, of course, kind of a non-starter when you don&#x27;t have 200k lying around for a minimal denovo lab, and there&#x27;s not much in the way of rental lab space where we are.  Thankfully, after four years of grinding on this as our side gig -- and a big slowdown due to the plague -- we&#x27;ve got enough preliminary data to apply for an NIH grant, which we&#x27;re very optimistic about.<p>My wife and I have a setup up in our house (it&#x27;s all GRAS and Biosafety Level 1 stuff) and have mostly bought off ebay and govdeals. She&#x27;s a neuroscientist and I&#x27;m a physics&#x2F;engineering guy.  My job is to handle the business end, acquire gear, and maintain it so that she can science as hard as possible.<p>Most of our lab gear is 80s and 90s-vintage gear we&#x27;ve fixed up.  You&#x27;d be amazed what a little analogue electronics knowledge can do here; people will throw out a device rather than replace the belts or motor brushes.  We&#x27;ll get used and broken gear at a fraction of of the cost of new and certified refurb machinery.<p>I&#x27;m currently modding our venerable Labline orbital shaker incubator.  Over the course to two months the tachometer and both of the remote bulb thermostats on it went out, so I&#x27;m installing a Johnson Controls A421 to manage the heater and adding a $20 Hall effect tachometer to replace the analog tach.  The mechanicals are solid, though (got it for $300 plus freight!) and getting another would be a slow expensive crap shoot.<p>BTW, readers, do you think that there is an audience for a blog that talks about the details of rebuilding old equipment like this?  I&#x27;m not big on video, so it would mostly be long form writing with lots of images.')
