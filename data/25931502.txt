Most bad papers are rejected, but the authors can always try again at another journal.  Any paper will probably get published somewhere, eventually, even if only in a Hindawi or MDPI journal.  The journals aren&#x27;t accountable to anyone, and as long as they have enough good articles to serve as cover, academics will need to pay for access because citing relevant prior work is obligatory.  The publishing system is very weak against fraud.')
