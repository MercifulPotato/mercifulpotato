Item(by='somebodynew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602334844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24738196, text='The typical argument against pragma once is that it&#x27;s unclear what should happen if two different hard link paths are used to include a file with the same inode (along with similar situations on Windows or with files on network drives). That is to say, in general, there is no consistent and portable &quot;true&quot; absolute path that uniquely identifies file(s) as conceptually having the same underlying storage.<p>In practice, I have never actually seen a problem arise. The most likely real trigger would probably be a mix of including a library through a path that indicates a specific version and including it through a path that uses a &quot;latest stable&quot; link. That is already fragile and asking for trouble, though.')
