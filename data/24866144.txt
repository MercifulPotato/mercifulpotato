Potential &quot;yay&quot; and &quot;nay&quot; votes are both term-limited, so the &quot;inexperience&quot; should cancel out?<p>What?  Take this to it&#x27;s logical conclusion and imagine term limits of 1 day.  No one would be making sound decisions with those yeas and nays.<p>And why would they always be 50 &#x2F; 50 and &quot;cancel out&quot;?  If you know nothing about a fairly complex topic, it&#x27;s easy to be mislead, especially by someone with an ulterior motive that&#x27;s playing a game much longer than your term limits.')
