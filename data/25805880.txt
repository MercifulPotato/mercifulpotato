I&#x27;m not looking for legal advice but rather interested in reading how anyone with experience did it. I am working on a physical consumer product that we are aiming to receive crowdfunding for. I have been back and forth of whether to go with an LLC in my state or Delaware C Corp. My main back and forth is because I look at other successful CPG start ups and some are LLCs others C Corps. Both of which have raised millions. We already have private investor interest (Nothing like huge VC funding). Can anyone share their experience with this? I&#x27;d really appreciate it!')
