We are on a variable rate mortgage, and our interest rate is 1.4%!! But it&#x27;s actually the second time I&#x27;ve had a rate this low, we had a similar phenomenon after 2008 at some point.<p>I live in the exurbs, over an hour from Toronto, but a 3 bedroom home near my daughter&#x27;s school in the small town &#x2F; 905 suburb nearby just sold almost $100k over list, at over $1.5M.
