That is a sign your prior belief of the lying people is off - with the more realistic prior belief that liars keep lying the question is why this made up story now?  Or how did they execute this lie?<p>And yes, the key to using the internet effectively is to filter things out that are garbage. I individually try not waste my time on bullshit, truth based organizations filter out a lot of crackpots: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physicstoday.scitation.org&#x2F;do&#x2F;10.1063&#x2F;PT.6.4.20190201b&#x2F;full&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physicstoday.scitation.org&#x2F;do&#x2F;10.1063&#x2F;PT.6.4.2019020...</a> and Twitter itself is free to try to do this filtering as well. I applaud them for trying to remove BS rather than trying to push addictive content but whatever. This very news site is interesting because they spend a lot of time trying to filter BS in favor of productive and informative conversations.')
