The right to exclude others from doing something is a property right. Using force to empower some to exclude others from doing something, is itself an idea that may or may not have pragmatic value.<p>The point is that there are useful views on property that do not require the object or thing to be scarce. For example in the US property is legally the bundle of rights people have in relation to an object or thing (including ideas).<p>Edit: And you&#x27;re right, there&#x27;s nothing &quot;natural&quot; about IP. It&#x27;s just a tool that may or may not be useful.')
