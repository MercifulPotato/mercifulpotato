Frankly most organisations continue spending on digital ads despite seeing diminishing returns because they have had hired people, often at the VP level to do just ads. These people obviously have to justify their salary so they forcibly convolute numbers to attribute some revenue to justify what they do- which is running ads.<p>They randomly change distribution models, ignore the bot traffic, and present eye candy line graphs to show &quot;tremendous&quot; impact from ads.
