I was responding to OP&#x27;s assertion that we shouldn&#x27;t bother to vaccinate &quot;healthy&quot; people at all.<p>IIRC the IFR is ~0.2% for people in the 20-39 age bracket. I still find that risky (though I&#x27;m risk-averse), but the better argument is the lingering effects of moderate&#x2F;severe cases, which I&#x27;m not sure is counted.<p>Also, I assume your policy decision would include younger people with risk factors like heart disease and diabetes, rather than going strictly by age. I&#x27;m chronically ill and I want my vaccine.')
