Unfortunately, the underlying objects could change during a compilation because of partial revelation, so parts of the system would have to be recompiled when the builder found those cases.  I&#x27;m sure Modula-2 could have been faster in that regard, not having the opportunity for a type to be elaborated more in later compilation units.')
