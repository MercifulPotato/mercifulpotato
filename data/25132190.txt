Y&#x27;know, general reddit things. There are some other subdiscipline specific subreddits too, tho all fairly small. This is a multireddit I made that contains the ones I know of: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;gkayaalp&#x2F;m&#x2F;linguistics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;gkayaalp&#x2F;m&#x2F;linguistics&#x2F;</a><p>The best community I know of is the LinguistList. I follow their RSS feeds to keep on top of what&#x27;s happening in the field, but they also maintain many mailing lists, which you might wanna give a look.<p>There&#x27;s also linguistics.stackexchange which does have some good content and answers.<p>There&#x27;s some small linguist presence on Humanities Commons (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hcommons.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hcommons.org</a>).<p>LingBuzz is like an arXiV--discussion board hybrid thing.<p>If you&#x27;re into conlanging, I know that some communities&#x2F;subreddits exist but IDK the names or URLs, unfortunately.<p>Other than that sadly we don&#x27;t have anything to the extent that CS or physics enjoy.<p>Edit: You&#x27;re welcome, BTW. If you want to ask about anything more specific, resources or otherwise, I&#x27;d love to help.')
