Once I&#x27;ve got a password that&#x27;s borderline too long to remember, I can&#x27;t really add more random characters to it without risking forgetting it. Concatenating it with a dictionary word (&quot;password-dictword&quot;) is much easier to remember, but (I believe) still adds a meaningful amount of security.')
