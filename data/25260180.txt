That’s a shocking rise from the 441 people who died of drug overdoses in 2019 and the 259 who died the year before that.<p>The article suggests the number was already growing at an alarming rate even before covid. While this is tragic, I&#x27;m not sure we can attribute these deaths solely to covid lockdowns.<p>It also behooves us to consider the practicality of public health measures. It&#x27;s extremely easy for a californian mayor to tell people to stay home&#x2F;wear masks and get a relatively high level of compliance. Getting people to stop using drugs is a much taller order.')
