Even with a single translation, it&#x27;s completely possible to interpret different parts of the bible in different ways. Fundamentalists take one extreme interpretation and tend to only acknowledge the parts of the text that seem to agree with them and ignore the ones that don&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s the same with the Quran, the Torah, the Bardo Thodol. Religious text tend to have a lot of allegories and ambiguous texts that are ripe for different interpretations...<p>And someone who is religious could always easily claim that god may be perfect and omniscient but men are fallible and that the text has been imperfectly re transcribed over time  (the oldest copy of the complete Bible, the Codex Vaticanus is from the 4th century for example).<p>But then again, I don&#x27;t think in absolutes and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m an agnostic... I don&#x27;t find any religion likely but I can&#x27;t claim to know everything and be completely sure that there is no god, or entity or whatever.')
