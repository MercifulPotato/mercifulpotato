We&#x27;re really not supposed to talk about this stuff.<p>mrep, you&#x27;re either misinforming me, or you&#x27;re misinformed. That 3.2% that you named doesn&#x27;t cover domestic military spending (Homeland Security, FBI, NSA) nor does it cover pensions for widows and retirees, nuclear weapons research, nuclear waste disposal, nuclear weapon manufacturing, interest on war debts, the VA. Factoring in these costs actually puts military spending second on your list: 993.8 Billion Dollars, just 7 billion shy of the trillion we spent on social security. We now have a growing number of &quot;civilians&quot; in the military too; these private contractors help to make military spending look smaller than it really is.<p>And keep in mind the military budget has only grown since 9&#x2F;11 never shrinking. We&#x27;re still blowing up Yemen, Somalia, the Levant and Afghanistan as I type this, after already blowing up Iraq, Libya and Pakistan over a period of 20 years. It&#x27;s expensive.')
