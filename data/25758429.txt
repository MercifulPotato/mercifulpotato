Plus you have to host your own code which is another (very small) fee.<p>You also lose access to some of Apple&#x27;s cloud service like Sign in With Apple which some customers prefer (self included). There are also some additional sales just due to being in the App Store.<p>Which is to say, the getting rid of that 15% fee isn&#x27;t a slam dunk. Even before the Apple Tax cut, many developers chose to use the App Store even when the fee was 30% for good reason. I suspect if you are earning $900k in the App Store and launching a new product the math gets quite weird.')
