There might have been a few press stories about an unusual form of pneumonia or a new coronavirus but it wouldn&#x27;t have got more attention than the bad flu year of 2017 did in the USA.<p><i>It is possible in 3 years we look back 4 years and find no excess deaths over that time period</i><p>Right. The point I&#x27;m making is you don&#x27;t have to wait 4 years. The data to make that call is already in: Swedish excess deaths for 2020 are on track to be normal. Very unlikely there&#x27;ll be a sudden massive surge in the last month of 2020 given Sweden&#x27;s near-zero COVID-linked death rate. Outside of the first wave excess death in 2020 has been lower than average for Sweden so it&#x27;s already balanced out.<p><i>My personal belief is Sweden saw larger deaths than Denmark&#x2F;Norway in part due to their COVID policies, but they did not experience the complete disaster many predicted in March. Whether the trade off was worth it will be debated by public policy experts for years, and ultimately no one will agree.</i><p>I feel the Danish economist&#x27;s analysis is convincing w.r.t. &quot;dry tinder&quot;. I fully agree with the last sentence though!')
