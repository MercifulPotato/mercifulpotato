I even tried to get rid of it by explicitly saying I don&#x27;t want it recommended to me, which gets rid of the individual channels but similar stuff just keeps popping up.<p>Youtube overfits what people click on so badly, I have no idea how this isn&#x27;t fixable by honstly just turning the recommendation system off and just giving me random crap, even that would be an improvement.')
