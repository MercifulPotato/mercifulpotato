Or have their kid stab themselves with a used heroin needle while they&#x27;re taking a walk outside. Or have gibberish screamed at them by someone with drug-induced psychosis while spending fifteen minutes waiting for the bus, etc. These are very unpleasant experiences and it&#x27;s normal for people to not want them.')
