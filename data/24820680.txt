Apple Watch Series 5 w&#x2F;GPS:<p>- Surprisingly, my iPhone Xs battery lasts <i>longer</i> because I&#x27;m checking it less.<p>- Counter-intuitively, I&#x27;m spending less time on my phone because I&#x27;m less likely to get sucked into my Watch than my phone. Now I just read non-urgent messages and Dismiss them.<p>- I use the compass <i>all the time</i> now that I&#x27;m travelling[^1] in the UK and I use the compass all the time to learn the city layout. Apple Maps is still crappy on the Watch compared to Google Maps on iPhone, but because my Watch vibrates before every important turn, I have less navigation anxiety.<p>- I feel safer walking in the city because I don&#x27;t have to hold my phone in my hand.<p>2. Macbook Pro 16&quot;:<p>It was f*cking expensive, but:<p>- Rust compile times have come down 10x compared to my mid-2015 MBP15.<p>- Screen is 200% better.<p>- Sound is 500% better.<p>- Keyboard is 200% better.<p>- Track Pad is way better.<p>...hate the Touch Bar, though :).<p>- [^1] If you are a professional dev in London, hit me up for a beer, esp. if you write Clojure for a living.<p>(PS. @dang please can we have list formatting support?)')
