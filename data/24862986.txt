Mortgage interest is not included in the basis of real property or in depreciation. It&#x27;s just another deductible expense.<p>Most real estate companies are partnerships or REITs due to special tax provisions. But most of their investors are corporate entities.<p>Generally, profits from rent are not reinvested in buying more real estate because they simply aren&#x27;t sufficient for that. Real estate is a cash flow game: real properties are purchased through commercial mortgages, and rental income services the debt. Generally, profits arise when real properties are sold for appreciated values. Because of this, real estate investment flourishes in <i>low tax</i> years: as a result of depreciation, the cost basis of the real property has been reduced, so the taxable income from the sale has increased.')
