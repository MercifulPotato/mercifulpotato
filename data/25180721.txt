It is valuable to have multiple distribution channels for your product, and in the age of online retail, this is especially true. Because cultivating a distribution channel is not zero cost, if those channels are destroyed by one distributor taking a loss and undercutting everyone else, it can be highly detrimental to the manufacturer. That&#x27;s because if you only have a single distribution channel they can pressure you to cut manufacturing costs through outsourcing or decreasing quality.<p>Source: I helped build a product to track MAP violations, and there&#x27;s also a bunch of articles and books written on this stuff.')
