Take this quote from the article:<p>&gt; “We need the wealth that has been generated in the city to be shared more broadly with workers and residents”<p>This person seems to assume the taxes will be shared with the workers and residents. Would they still support these taxes if that were not the case?<p>Others (in this discussion) seem to think the taxes will be thrown at things that don&#x27;t benefit the city. Maybe so? Would they be more supportive if they knew it was for something they believed in?')
