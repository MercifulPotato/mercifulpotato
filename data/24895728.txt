I spent a lot of time pulling together the many brands and flavors, although there&#x27;s certainly more.<p>My goal was to make it somewhat reminiscent of restaurant menus (remember those?), but highlighting the price that you pay per pod. I find this site useful for myself, so that&#x27;s why I made it. (Yes, I drink k-cups... But hey, I have two young kids, so I think I have an excuse. I had to put a pause on the french press.)<p>For all of you who are also working from home and drinking k-cups non-stop, I&#x27;m hoping you, too, will find this site useful. I&#x27;d love to hear any feedback you have, good or bad!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unitprice.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unitprice.org</a>')
