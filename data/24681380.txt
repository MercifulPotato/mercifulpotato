Referring to parts of a chart by color is fine, and provides additional information, as long as a line style or shape identifier is also used, e.g., the &quot;blue solid line&quot; and the &quot;orange dashed line&quot; in the case of a line plot or the &quot;blue circles&quot; and the &quot;orange squares&quot; in the case of a scatter plot. Ideally, I think color swatches should also be included when referring to colors, so it isn&#x27;t necessary to match the name to the color [1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpetroff.net&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;figure-caption-color-indicators&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpetroff.net&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;figure-caption-color-indicators...</a>')
