Item(by='__blockcipher__', descendants=None, kids=[25865950], score=None, time=1611270123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865661, text='Yeah let&#x27;s talk about greed for a second.<p>Elastic, at this moment, is pulling in half a billion dollars in revenue per year. They&#x27;re growing at at least 40% y&#x2F;y. They&#x27;re valued at $15B at this very moment.<p>So, tell me again why this license change is so necessary? Oh right, it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s just a disingenuous move to try to monopolize the market they&#x27;re in.<p>Except, the irony is, this isn&#x27;t even going to increase the money they&#x27;re making, because Amazon, as I predicted days ago, was always just gonna fork 7.1.0 and keep it Apache 2.0. Which is not only legally their right, but actually ethically is a good thing to do anyway.<p>And don&#x27;t even get me started on how Elastic puts most of its real efforts into their proprietary features anyway, and if you hypothetically opened up a pull request that perfectly implemented TLS or some other feature they&#x27;d deny it because they have a conflict of interest with X-Pack.<p>Now I want to be clear. I&#x27;m personally an anarcho-capitalist, I reject the whole idea that a company being big makes it evil. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem that Amazon is making money with free software - aren&#x27;t all of us in the industry making money with Linux, or with apache httpd, or &lt;insert open source software here&gt;?<p>So, I don&#x27;t hold the fact that Elastic is a multi billion dollar company against them either. But when they try to gaslight the communtity and portray this absurd, patently false, downright offensive david vs goliath narrative, I&#x27;m going to call them out for being liars, because that&#x27;s what they are. They have shown they will break deep promises they made to the community without a second thought.<p>They&#x27;ve also shown they couldn&#x27;t even be honest in their communication around this licensing change. They claimed this would have no effect on their users - bullshit, a good friend of mine works at Wikimedia and they can&#x27;t run Elasticsearch 7.1.1 or above in the future because they don&#x27;t run proprietary software. Meanwhile the license change doesn&#x27;t even do what they claim it&#x27;s for.<p>They also have mastered the art of doublespeak like this:<p>&gt; The list of improvements under this new free and open, yet proprietary, license, is overwhelming<p>Ah yes, the infamous &quot;free and open, yet proprietary&quot; software. Couldn&#x27;t live without it.')
