First off open source cannot exist without closed source.<p>Imagine if everything in the world went open source. Then nobody would be getting paid, everyone would starve because they&#x27;re giving away there work for free.<p>Most things in this world are profit oriented products produced as a direct result a capitalism. Open source is an offshoot phenomenon in software arising because software is both easier than other forms of engineering (see thousands of bootcamps) and also easily copyable.<p>However it should be known that most software developers need to have a job in closed source software in order to pay the bills.<p>Whenever you see something open source you have to know it&#x27;s an offshoot phenomenon. These are side projects spawned by intense interest but ultimately still a side project to a person&#x27;s main line of work which is ultimately profitable. Be surprised that there are 3D printers because it&#x27;s abnormal. The fact that there are no open source 2D printers arises because there&#x27;s lack of interest and because there&#x27;s no profit in open source 2D printers.')
