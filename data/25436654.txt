Also interesting at 7:50, where he talks about people with recurrent infections. They have seen only 1 in the whole trial.<p>The results are probably even slightly better, since a few people got infected at about the same time they went into the trial. Wondering if itâ€™s recklessness due to them thinking they were vaccinated thus immune.')
