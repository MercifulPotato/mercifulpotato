I had no interest in dealing with the terrible QNAP OS on it and wanted to do something open source.<p>The only somewhat difficult part was preserving data from the old disks as QNAP has custom extensions to LVM or MDRAID which work nowhere else. So there were a few back and forth of removing a few disks from the pool, rebooting to a normal linux, formatting them without the custom garbage, booting back and copying over.<p>In the end I decided to go with NixOS as I&#x27;ve already used it on my laptop&#x2F;desktop for about 5 years. I also wanted a modern CoW file system and went with bcachefs. Getting it working with NixOS takes some fiddling, especially if you also want encryption but it works. It now runs samba, matrix-synapse and soon maybe nextcloud. Not quite there yet with everything but quite happy that I went down this route.<p>The only thing missing from the HW side is an SSD, but the box has USB3 and UAS support so I might add an external one that bcachefs can use as a faster tier.')
