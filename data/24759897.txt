Next while in my Verizon account I went to my privacy settings on multiple devices, and updated browsers and I had nothing but redirect notices about not being able to connect to the site. I called Verizon, to make my concerns known and was finally sent a link via text, to finally change my settings to Opt-out. Ridiculous. Thank you for your post.')
