Expropriate is a technical term for taking property from someone, usually by the state for public use. The emotion you&#x27;re referring to is all associated with the act itself. You&#x27;ve also failed to identify an inaccuracy.<p>&gt; It looks like you&#x27;re trying to be manipulative here rather than present a sound argument.<p>All I did was ask a question.<p>&gt; Why should they take more money from people to save peoples&#x27; houses? Why should my taxes go up to save your house?<p>Your taxes are going up because the government has decided to build a road or rail line. Why should the cost of that be artificially low because the government is able to expropriate people&#x27;s homes?<p>&gt; Note that this is a completely separate discussion from whether eminent domain actually pays people market prices for their homes.<p>By definition, it does not. This is why your statement:<p>&gt; we&#x27;re either going to spend some money and buy peoples&#x27; homes,<p>elides the relevant factor: people are being &lt;strike&gt;expropriated&lt;&#x2F;strike&gt; <i>deprived of their homes through threat of violence</i> in order to lower the cost of infrastructure.<p>&gt; we&#x27;re going to spend more money and create a tunnel. But money doesn&#x27;t grow on trees for local governments; if they spend it, they have to take it.<p>Perhaps the government needs to exercise fiscal discipline. Perhaps the government can&#x27;t afford a new rail.')
