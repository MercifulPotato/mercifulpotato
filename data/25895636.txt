I stayed with my older 2015 MPB for now until the new MPBs come out and by then there will be better Apple Silicon support. Instead  I bought a used System76 Meerkat, which is an Intel NUC essentially, and I have that small thing sitting in my desk. So, I can ssh into it, or when at home sitting in front of my desk, I can connect it to my monitor and have a Linux machine.')
