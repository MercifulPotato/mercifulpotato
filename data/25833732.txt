It&#x27;s none of their business that I&#x27;ve joined Signal or when I do.  Especially not the commercial contacts.<p>I joined Telegram thinking it didn&#x27;t do that notification, and was surprised and annoyed when just after joining someone in my phone contacts then started a surprise chat with me.  Yet I&#x27;ve never received a notification about anyone joining Telegram, so I must be confused about this feature.<p>I completely agree about Signal conversation backup being the biggest issue.  For my uses, a chat app that doesn&#x27;t save non-secret conversations in a way I can keep and search long term is of little interest.  The ability to transfer history between Android devices is no use if the reason for having a new device is the old one is lost or broken.<p>(I use a mix of Telegram &quot;secret&quot; chats (which aren&#x27;t sync&#x27;d) and regular chats (which are) depending on the subject, generally preferring the latter if it&#x27;s not sensitive.  I often want to refer back to things or search them, especially things like photos, dates of events, agreements, etc.)')
