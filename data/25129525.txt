Go where you can reduce your expenses to as low as possible - parents house, good friends, whatever. Get unemployment or whatever gov assistance you can get.<p>Clearly you are doing something wrong in tech, so hedge your bet and get a simple job at Starbucks or something like that for now. Use that to save up some cash so you have some legs to stand on. Early morning and night grind on development and leetcode and get a solid entry job.<p>Btw you should be getting student loan forgiveness by now, 11 years out of college.<p>All of what I said above is 100% doable but you have to be stoic and &quot;just do it&quot;... you can&#x27;t cry and make excuses and say crazy stuff. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and just give it your best shot, you&#x27;re not gonna fail if you do.')
