Depends on how much you rely on it. The more you rely on it, the more it matters that it is accurate.<p>Sometimes (in a iterative process, for example) all you need is a starting point. But some iterative processes can get stuck in infinite loops with a bad value. So sometimes a bad prediction would be better than none at all because you just need a starting point.
