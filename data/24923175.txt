The referent isn&#x27;t &quot;some other scientific computing API&quot; (although I&#x27;m sure there are some sane scientific computing APIs), but rather &quot;other APIs in general&quot; since there&#x27;s nothing inherent to any particular domain that demands this kind of &#x27;magical&#x27; API.<p>WRT &#x27;hardly anyone is CPU bound&#x27;--the context is numeric computing; what are people bound by if not CPU? I&#x27;ve seen several projects where web endpoints were timing out while grinding in Pandas, largely because there weren&#x27;t good options for taking advantage of multiple processors. Based on prototypes I did, I&#x27;m confident that other languages could serve those requests in single-digit seconds if not sub-second.')
