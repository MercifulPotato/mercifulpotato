Item(by='icebergonfire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611322548, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25868934, text='&gt; If you think I&#x27;m exaggerating, ask them a question about economics or health care, and listen as they &quot;expertly&quot; explain Everything(tm) to you.<p>In my circles &quot;rationalist&quot; is widely used to describe a person who holds opinions as &quot;untainted&quot; by emotions as a human could possibly have them. Meaning there is a describeable chain of independently-verifiable rational facts that take you from A to B, yet they are not married to the conclusion and you can reason them out of their positions if you can spot a hole in the process.<p>And no, not a single one of the people I know would dare pretend they know better than experts in the field. They might ask informed questions and poke around using their &quot;standard&quot; logic brain-instruments, but they mind their tone and proyect relentless curiosity instead of hubris.<p>I am sure that people can abuse this thought-technology to peddle bullshit or to proyect an image of being all-knowing entites.<p>In my case stumbling across LessWrong and later on SlateStarCodex got me started on trying to decouple emotions from the reality that causes them. It has helped me immensely in my never-ending quest to try to be the best possible version of myself.<p>&gt; Ffs, even the label &quot;rationalist&quot; itself is pathetic, and very revealing. It&#x27;s basically a way to signal &quot;I am right, take my word for it&quot;.<p>That sounds abrassive to me and I wouldn&#x27;t want to talk with that kind of people either, whatever labels they are wielding at the moment. I wonder if there is a cultural-bubble effect at play here, or if I have been lucky to not encounter them just yet.')
