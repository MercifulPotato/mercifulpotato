After changes, preview then saves a file that is not valid per Preview (OCR text layer is corrupted).<p>It is very difficult for me construe a situation in which this would <i>not</i> be considered errata in Preview. Even if ABBYY is writing unusual PDFs, it&#x27;s popular enough software that this issue will be encountered in the real world multiple times. Having to deal with unusually formed PDFs is just a general trait of writing PDF software. If you consider it a non-issue that your software writes corrupt PDFs when the same situation is handled correctly by Acrobat, no matter how unjust you feel the cruel world to be, you should not be in the PDF business. There&#x27;s a reason most PDF viewers only present a highly constrained feature set, and it&#x27;s because writing a capable PDF editor is very difficult. Apple has decided they are up to the challenge, and in this case has failed.<p>As a general rule, if your software package opens a file fine, then writes a broken version of it, seems to all the world like a bug in your software package.<p>The idea that this behavior in a PDF reader can be excused because the software that generated the PDF was not approved for the operating system the <i>viewer</i> is running on per the vendor... kind of stretches credulity. I don&#x27;t usually inquire as the OS used to generate the PDF when I receive one.')
