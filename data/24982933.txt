I guess what I&#x27;m getting at is that if you have to have multiple identities to ensure privacy, then you somewhat defeat the point of having your own domain, unless that is, you have multiple domains that you own.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly have anything to feel uneasy about. It&#x27;s more the idea that I don&#x27;t want one central domain that I use for everything which is tied to my real identity, either through the domain name itself or through the whois record (although I think you can pay to have an anonymous whois). It seems like a central point of failure. There are documented cases of people having their identity stolen and numerous online accounts hacked because they used the same email address to sign into various services. If you know someone&#x27;s email address and one or two other things about them, social-engineering your way into other services they use seems to be relatively easy for a skilled attacker.<p>This is all somewhat paranoid thinking, but I don&#x27;t want to go the hassle and expense of getting my own domain, only to that it is a less secure or private option.')
