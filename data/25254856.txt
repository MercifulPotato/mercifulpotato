Perhaps they were bad workers.  I&#x27;ll explain how affirmative action causes this problem.<p>You are forced to hire a certain percent of POC.  Doesn&#x27;t matter if they are a poor fit for the company.  Doesn&#x27;t matter if they are not even a good fit for the job.  Doesn&#x27;t matter if they are not even capable of doing the job.  You can&#x27;t wait to hire a POC that is a good fit or capable, or you are violating the law.<p>It is also difficult to fire the forced hires once you are forced to hire them.  Instead of just saying &quot;they sucked at their job&quot;  you have to play all kinds of games to fire someone that is a POC hire.  All companies face this issue and until its addressed (By removing affirmative action) there will always be this dysfunctional divide.<p>This also causes a harmful feedback loop to POC that are simply not up to the task and always think they are being targeted (because they are) rather than upping their skill set or working on their professionalism.<p>And here come the downvotes.')
