I do want a File Manager, Gallery App, and Music Player.  Most of these require read&#x2F;write access to the file system&#x2F;memory card.<p>If you dig through Google Play, to try and find the permissions, many have network access.  So in theory could read your file system, and upload files.<p>So the question is, how do we trust these applications?<p>Do the gatekeepers to the applications stores test these applications for these kind of exploits?<p>Beyond uploading my Photos, and Music, and Downloaded Files, is there any other risk of an application having access to the file system.  Or rather, are things like a Contacts database encrypted and only accessible by trusted applications?<p>Can you sandbox applications?  With native Android tools, or possibly other applications?<p>I&#x27;m not overtly paranoid but don&#x27;t have trust on these platforms enough to use them for phone calls and messaging at this point.<p>Any pointers welcome, and thank you in advance.')
