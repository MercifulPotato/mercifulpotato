My read of this is their interest in expanding the existing effort somehow, focused initially on MDN. Separate from this doc effort I&#x27;ve wondered why Mozilla hasn&#x27;t emphasized business opportunities around communications like VPN services, etc until recently as it overlaps with their mission, expertise and appears to be a legitimate business opportunity at scale. It&#x27;s not my area of knowledge, only a speculation from some observation.')
