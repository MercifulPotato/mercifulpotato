I just stick with Ubuntu because it&#x27;s the most popular, so the most likely someone bumps their head on the problem before I do, and maybe I find their stack exchange question or bug report when I search.<p>I&#x27;ve been very happy with Ubuntu 20.04. Not without issues, but overall it&#x27;s been quite stable and snappy (pun intended) and I prefer it to macos and windows.')
