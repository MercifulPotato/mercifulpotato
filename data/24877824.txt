The contradiction is hard to ignore. Maybe the old way of living wasn&#x27;t really that nice.<p>Well you quite obviously are not going to due to selection bias. But yes, there are people who have tried to simplify their lives down, both now and since the dawn of the modern era. Pick any level of tech you like: log cabin, lean to, nothing but a knife.
