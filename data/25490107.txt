Your first comment made no mention of your sexual assault (and, once you’ve mentioned it, most commenters–myself included–are quite sorry that this happened to you). People aren’t telling you to “get off the internet”, they are responding to your claim that it is impossible to avoid sex on the internet. For which, quite frankly, there are many better ways to go about this than arguing with people in the comments section for an article about “The Internet is for Porn”. If your desire is that people scrub the internet clean of sex, that’s not going to happen, sorry. That being said, there are many tools available to make it so that your experience remains free of such things.')
