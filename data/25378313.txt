I&#x27;m skeptical enough of the body fat readings one might get from a weight scale, so it&#x27;s going to take some convincing (which TFA does not do) to get me to believe body fat % can be deduced from photos of me in my underwear.<p>But on top of everything else, the WA Post article doesn&#x27;t describe anything that makes it worth buying the Amazon product over a bazillion other products that cost just a bit more (or even the same or less, I don&#x27;t follow the market that much).')
