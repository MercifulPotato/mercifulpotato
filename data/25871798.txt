But:<p>&gt; Underwear shirts typically last between 20 and 25 times.<p>This person must have very different wear standards from me, as I would guess my “underwear” shirts last 50+ wears over many years. Although I don’t wear those often, so I admit I may be overestimating how many wears they face.<p>FWIW it’s also about how many <i>washes</i> they face. It’s good to wear clothes more than once per wash, assuming light wear and they aren’t smelly, because washing wears them out a lot more than wearing them does.<p>&gt; But my shirts stand out in a league of their own. I spend 751 euros on shirts yearly. Do you recall my costly affection to high quality shirts? Well, here it shows.<p>Ok now I know this person lives in a different world from me :)<p>I do really agree about buying for quality and thinking in terms of cost per wear.<p>I’ve had great luck with Mack Weldon for t-shirts and undershirts. I especially like the “silver” fabric t-shirts, and I can confidently say I’m getting &gt; 50 wears off these given how long I’ve had mine and how often I wear them. They do eventually wear thinner and looser, but have not developed any tears or holes. And, specifically the silver fabric is amazing in how fresh and clean it always smells. You really can wear it 4-5 times, you only need to wash it when it eventually gets stains.')
