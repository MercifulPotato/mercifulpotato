Anything more, and you&#x27;re moving the market away from its efficient price.<p>The problem with the squeeze is that certain participants are put into a position where they&#x27;re being forced to buy.  And, that creates an incentive for other shareholders to hold onto their shares well past their fair value.  Holding onto shares well past their fair value is antithetical to efficient price discovery.')
