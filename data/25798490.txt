A couple years ago I tried to build an older Ionic app that nobody had touched for six months, and the build had just bitrotted. Something somewhere in the dependencies hadn&#x27;t been screwed down tightly enough, and everything was broken.<p>I feel like the Yarn 2 package manager is a good move towards in making frontend development more stable (The &quot;Plug&#x27;n&#x27;Play&quot; feature allows you to store your dependencies in your repo as zip files, just in case), but a lot of libraries are still the wild west.<p>There are &quot;boring&quot; frameworks like Ember and Angular that move slowly and limit breakage, but they&#x27;re pretty unpopular with many developers, despite being great for building products in an enterprise setting.<p>I disagree strongly about browsers; having an extremely stable platform that never breaks backwards compatibility is exactly what the web needs to be. Frontend development tooling would be so much better if it was more like browsers.')
