Not because he&#x27;s too left, but because he&#x27;s not left enough.<p>If this were true, then Florida&#x27;s state laws wouldn&#x27;t so conservative.  Passing one minimum wage law, which is long overdue and lags behind any &quot;left&quot; state, does not lead to the conclusion that Florida would have voted for someone such as Bernie Sanders.<p>Even the minimum wage law FL passed is very weak.  It&#x27;s $1 per year, starting at $10 per hour, starting Sep 1, 2021.')
