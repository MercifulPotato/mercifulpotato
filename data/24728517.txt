I own a quest 1 since I impulse bought it in retail. After finding out what it was I ordered a rift s which I use more frequently. The software package is actually decent, but the lock-in is repulsive.<p>With facebooks decision both devices will certainly be scraped soon.<p>I probably need to make sure my oculus account isn&#x27;t automatically migrated...<p>To be honest I think the current VR trend died like the last ones, maybe it was a bit more successful. The devices and the experience are nice at first, but not suitable for prolonged use.<p>I think AR is a complete separate technology that has some overlapping problems, but are still too different to make a prediction.<p>I think VR would have been more successful if we had a common base for different devices. My believe in tech dystopia is severely dampened if it relies on VR.')
