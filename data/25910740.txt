Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25911269], score=None, time=1611619957, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25910226, text='&gt; Instead of filing massive law suits, why doesn&#x27;t Dominion attempt to prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that the machines were _not_ biased with technical evidence.<p>All right dstola: For the purposes of argument, I accuse you of being a thief who has embezzled millions of dollars from some company you&#x27;ve worked for.  Instead of suing me for defamation for my lie, why don&#x27;t you just prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you didn&#x27;t steal anything?  Maybe you could open source your bank account data, and all your movements to show that you couldn&#x27;t have opened any secret accounts?<p>That&#x27;s a ridiculous ask.  The malicious accusation of embezzled is a lie that <i>harmed you</i>, and proving your innocence won&#x27;t compensate you for the harm caused by that lie.  These lawsuits are about the harm done to Dominion.<p>Also, no analysis of any kind would ever satisfy the people who believe the 2020 election was marred by vote fraud.  That belief isn&#x27;t based on evidence, and massive amounts of evidence to the contrary hasn&#x27;t convinced those people.  There&#x27;s no reason to think one more report would make any difference.')
