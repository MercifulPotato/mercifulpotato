Perhaps that&#x27;s an antiquated notion now<p>&gt; This doesn&#x27;t exists.<p>It does exist, but as mentioned by the parent comment, that security superiority of Linux in contrast to Windows is a reputation it earned in the late 1990s and early 2000s; back then (before Windows XP SP2), Windows was a security disaster. Both Windows and Linux got better at security since then.<p>&gt; Arguably otherwise Windows has better defense because it comes with built-in virus scanner.<p>Back then (before Windows Vista), it didn&#x27;t. And one could also argue that this might be because Windows needs a virus scanner more than Linux does.')
