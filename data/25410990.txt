Item(by='HexagonalKitten', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607898149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25407636, text='One huge error HN made was telling people that downvotes can be used to disagree.<p>If a view is so rehashed that it was disproven in the 90s then surely a simple cut&amp;paste would do your work for you and the ignorance would be challenged. Instead people simply downvote, thinking that this is approved and useful, without saying anything and it turns the site into an echo chamber where any questions to the standard view is unreadable.<p>Because there are no limits on downvotes a few righteous groupthinkers can and often do downvote every post they disagree with, letting 2-3 people make a thread entirely ideologically &quot;pure&quot;. This ease of driving a post invisible versus actually putting words to screen mean that the baying hounds always win.<p>I admit I&#x27;m controversial in many of my opinions, but I posted what I thought was a very bipartisan post in the voting thread, about how we should fix the holes (and things that appear to be holes) in the system so that people trust it more next time and I was downvoted. The only acceptable message is that there wasn&#x27;t a single fraudulent vote cast. And we don&#x27;t know that. We hope, but the very existence of SD cards that can go missing, internet connected machines, and so many other things, means we can&#x27;t verify this.<p>Without misused downvotes someone would have called me a trumper, and I&#x27;d deny it, and my point would remain, and maybe other people would argue the points. It&#x27;d probably even get support and encourage more people to reconsider, if not reject voting machines in the future. But with disagree-downvotes it&#x27;s just hidden because it&#x27;s not immediately on point with the groupthink.<p>This is why politics seems so radicalized. Moderate views get censored.')
