It&#x27;s about letting users AGREE to being tracked and then track them, OR (with the same amount of effort and without denying them service vs tracked people) DISAGREE and then not track them.<p>If they&#x27;re still tracking me and keeping data about me that they can match to the PI that is my github account, then this &quot;no cookie&quot; thing is just more &quot;letter of the law&quot; bullshit.<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty damn clear to Github and MS what the intention of these EU laws are. They can&#x27;t just say &quot;oh it&#x27;s worded in a way that gives us wiggle room, so fuck your intentions&quot;. Well they can but they&#x27;ll find out whose faces they told &quot;fuck your intentions&quot; to.<p>We&#x27;re trying to protect consumers from tracking bullshit, here. Not throwing up obstacles for large corporations to work around.')
