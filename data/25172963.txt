Then a different product pops up, solves the same problem in exactly the same way, and costs the same. Migrating isn&#x27;t free and at the end you have two suppliers to manage. Does that make any sense at all? I think not.<p>There is a different case that makes sense: you have object storage and it&#x27;s not sufficient, so you go look for object storage suppliers that deliver something different so it suits your need. Now it makes sense to look for a service that is relatively similar to what you are already using but is better in a factor that is significant for your application (i.e. speed of object key changes), now it does make sense.<p>Marketing just says: &quot;Look at us, we are faster&quot;. I think that message is not going to matter unless that happens to be your exact problem in isolation, which isn&#x27;t exactly common; systems don&#x27;t tend to run in isolation.')
