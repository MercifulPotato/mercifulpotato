Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609611789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25613719, text='&gt; Can you give an example?<p>Of a bad reason or a bad effect?<p>Bad reasons are a dime a dozen.  Maybe they just don&#x27;t want to.  They don&#x27;t like the idea, and they&#x27;re stubborn.  Or they made a deal with one or two companies and don&#x27;t want to allow others, even though some customer would really prefer the disallowed ones or can&#x27;t get service from the allowed ones.<p>For bad effects, it means that the customer can&#x27;t get the food they want, even with 100% knowledge that it&#x27;s a third party picking it up, and that the quality will be imperfect in a way that&#x27;s not the restaurant&#x27;s fault.<p>Here, let me quote someone else from this same comment page: &quot;Last night I wanted w bottle of alcohol for new years celebration. I already had a few drinks so I didn&#x27;t want to drive. Unfortunately no delivery service had an agreement with any local liquor stores.&quot;<p>And, I mean, for non-food items imagine how bad it would be if you needed explicit permission from the manufacturer to sell something on ebay.  Food&#x27;s not <i>that</i> different.')
