It looks like it&#x27;s a Lisp implementation? Why would I want to spend time learning&#x2F;using this over JS&#x2F;Go&#x2F;Java&#x2F;etc.?<p>I&#x27;m not trying to make any statements about the usability or anything, I just literally cannot find enough details about what Shen is beyond some books on Amazon or vague home page claims to make any judgements about this.')
