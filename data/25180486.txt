Or every block procedurally? That way you can cut RAM as much as you wish. For example, if you have a procedural formula to determine if a block is populated, you don&#x27;t need to store it in RAM, just use this formula in the renderer directly (in Shadertoys this usually would repeat per-pixel).')
