But how about the other kind of failures? The answer is clear: strong consistency only is guaranteed for _certain expected_ errors, not in the general case. Hence generally speaking, strong consistency is _not_ guaranteed. As simple as that. Saying it is guaranteed &quot;in practice&quot; is, pardon, stupid wording.')
