However, these solutions are <i>reactive</i> and quite partial as opposed to strong <i>preventative</i> measures like alcohol detection-based car immobilization solutions. Some would say that it is a radical measure, but so is electronic speed limiter&#x2F;governor in all modern cars.<p>I&#x27;m well aware of the progress in autonomous driving space (including Tesla&#x27;s - though, I would argue that Tesla is not the leader in this space; I think that it&#x27;s Waymo). However, more generally, my point was not about limited fleet use cases, but rather global-scale deployments and <i>massive adoption</i>. That, I believe, is certainly not going to happen soon.')
