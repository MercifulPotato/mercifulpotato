There are clear symptoms of severe deficiency. But is 20 or 30 ng&#x2F;ml really enough? Maybe we should target a level closer to 80?<p>The issue is further complicated by the interaction with other micronutrients such as calcium and vitamin K. Vitamin D intake has to be adjusted based on those as well. So it&#x27;s tough to make a blanket recommendation for everyone.')
