Sure some things are harder to comprehend, but we haven&#x27;t come across anything incomprehensible yet, let&#x27;s cross that bridge when we get there.<p>Usually when I see &quot;limits&quot; in other people it&#x27;s not so much that they can&#x27;t possibly comprehend something, it&#x27;s that it would take an impractical amount of effort and time to have them comprehend it. With better teaching technology it may be more feasible for them to understand these things that were incomprehensible to them, and if not there&#x27;s always the next generation.')
