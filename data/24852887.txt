I&#x27;ve driven them. They&#x27;re fine, and sure, they&#x27;re made for fun. But the purple prose you see about how orgasmic driving one is is bullshit. It is a car. It goes. Yay.<p>If I had to drive to commute, I&#x27;d own a car, and likely spend more on it that I would for a pure utility vehicle. But I still wouldn&#x27;t shell out for a Tesla any more than I would a Bentley - just so very not worth it to me.<p>I&#x27;m not criticizing - I spend what looks like crazy money on things other people don&#x27;t care about. To each their own. But there will always be a niche for those Priuses everyone likes to crap on - for people who just don&#x27;t give a damn about car status games and just want to get from A to B.')
