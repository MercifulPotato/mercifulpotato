It didn&#x27;t sound like the author downloaded a QR code reader and happened to get malware. He got malware from some source which installed itself that way.<p>I had a QR reader in my camera app on some old Androids, around 2011 or so, but maybe it was because I then often was running custom ROMs? Or because back then QR codes were hyped and used for everything? Anyways, in 2019 or so it was included again in the native camera app on all Samsungs.<p>While I get the allure of &quot;it just works&quot;, having a niche feature that&#x27;s basically never used and easily installed anyway seems like a weird hill to die on.')
