Ultimately, weapons can be exported under pretty liberal rules.<p>Even if there are controls (like there are on weapons), the existence of a robust weapons market means that weapons are usually available to any regime (or less) that can pay for it.  Certain weapons (ICBMs, tanks, jets) <i>are</i> actually controlled, but these tend to be weapons (1) without a robust market (2) that potentially challenge an exporters military power (3) really expensive.<p>The avenue (IMO) is to fight the legality of malware and&#x2F;or malware mercenaries <i>within our</i> countries. We&#x27;re losing at this.')
