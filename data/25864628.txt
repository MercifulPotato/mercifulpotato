I bet there&#x27;s a club that meets semi-regularly. For example the original D&amp;D generation is well past their 30&#x27;s, so I&#x27;m sure you could find a group that meets every could weeks with lots of players in their 30&#x27;s, at a local game shop. Similar for boardgames. Or if you have a hipster coffee shop nearby it might have a corkboard up with slightly less nerdy version of this stuff.')
