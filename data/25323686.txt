But no one ever wants to believe you. If I am in close proximity of a WiFi router as example: I get block-headed and pulsing-zap feeling above my ears. Hearing deteriorates causing my hearing to go all tinny.<p>I&#x27;ve mitigated it by turning my WiFi router transmit power to half which helps but doesn&#x27;t help in office environments where the router is mounted above or if I am round at someones home.')
