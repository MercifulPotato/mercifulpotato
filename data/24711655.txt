I think if you want to prevent that you need doors on your kitchen and to not combine it with the dining space.  Which is hard to find because most parties and social life revolves around the kitchen, so most people don&#x27;t like that setup thus builders never build it. There is also the general trend to make houses into large open spaces for living, dining and kitchen, which makes it even worse.  Like the open office trend!')
