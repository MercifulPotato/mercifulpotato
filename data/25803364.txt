Item(by='infogulch', descendants=None, kids=[25803853, 25803456], score=None, time=1610815422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25802841, text='&quot;Consciously malicious&quot; is not a good rule of thumb standard to measure threats to yourself or your business; it only accounts for a tiny bit of all possible threats. GP isn&#x27;t claiming that Google is consciously malicious, they are claiming that you should prepare as if they were. These are not the same thing.<p>A lion may not be malicious when it&#x27;s hunting you, it&#x27;s just hungry; look out for it anyway. A drunk driver is unlikely targeting you specifically; drive carefully anyways. Nobody at Google is specifically thinking &quot;hehehe now <i>this</i> will ruin jdsalareo&#x27;s business!&quot; but their decisions are arbitrary, generally impossible to appeal, and may ruin you regardless; prepare accordingly.')
