Item(by='bpt3', descendants=None, kids=[25282198], score=None, time=1606942092, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25281163, text='&gt; Are you saying there are no lessons the West can learn from China&#x27;s infrastructure projects without resorting to authoritarianism, IP theft, or environmental harm? That there is no way to pick apart and separate some positive learnings from the negatives?<p>Not at all.  Every nation can always learn from others, or at least be motivated by the accomplishments of others to improve internally.<p>&gt; Are you saying THIS is the best we can do as a Western democracy?<p>Maybe?  Again, it depends on what your definition of &quot;best&quot; is.  If not enough people in Toronto think it&#x27;s important enough to have a robust public transit system, then it doesn&#x27;t happen.  I&#x27;m very confident Toronto has the resources required to complete an ambitious project if desired.<p>&gt; To me, this kind of paralysis on infrastructure projects is not &quot;better&quot; by any definition you use. It&#x27;s not an intentional tradeoff between infrastructure and environmental protection, or between public development and property rights. It&#x27;s just indecision, waste, and stagnation.<p>If the project isn&#x27;t a good use of resources, indecision and inaction is the better outcome.<p>&gt; Every time a comparison to China&#x27;s infrastructure comes up, the knee jerk reaction is to point out that it&#x27;s an authoritarian regime so of course they can force through any infrastructure project they want. Which is fair enough, but it drowns out any discussion asking &quot;Hey, CAN we do any better in the West than we are doing right now? Is what we have good enough?&quot;<p>Unlike in China, these discussions already happen regularly, and the key difference between the status quo in China and the West is the decision making process, so that&#x27;s where the conversation is focused.')
