Silently swallowing them is a recipe for disaster, because nobody gets any info about what went wrong. In very limited cases -- e.g. &quot;I don&#x27;t care about this harmless error&quot; -- it&#x27;s correct to swallow them up, but Java devs tend to overuse it and disaster ensues.<p>&gt; <i>Should you instead handle every error close to their source [...]</i><p>You shouldn&#x27;t. Handle those errors that it makes sense to handle, pass them up otherwise. Just don&#x27;t swallow them.')
