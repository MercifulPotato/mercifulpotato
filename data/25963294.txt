The US, EU, UK, etc have indeed bought more than they needed, but they won&#x27;t (by definition) be using more than they needed - the extra purchases were due to spreading the production and vaccine approval risk to ensure that <i>enough</i> were available.<p>You could reasonably argue they shouldn&#x27;t be vaccinating whole populations, by which I mean including low-risk elements, whilst poorer countries cannot vaccinate even high-risk ones. That&#x27;s a different question though.')
