This might just be survivorship bias though, but still, one takeaway I got from the email exchanges is that pg really evaluated founders on both the idea&#x2F;market opportunity and the qualities of the founders themselves:<p><pre><code>  I&#x27;d recommend having the debate after meeting them instead of before. We had big doubts about this idea, but they vanished on meeting the guys.\n</code></pre>\nTo be fair, pg probably has more signal on the founders as individuals and VCs may not get as much signal based on a pitch meeting, but you could also argue that one of YC&#x27;s edge was their focus on identifying stronger founders moreso than great ideas, whereas VCs, given their general strategy of investing more in large priced post-seed rounds care more about traction and market opportunity and less on the &quot;intangible&quot; traits of the founders.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that pg also believed in the eventuality of AirBnB competing with and taking a lot of market share away from hotels. Fred and the &quot;older&quot; guys at their firm didn&#x27;t believe this.')
