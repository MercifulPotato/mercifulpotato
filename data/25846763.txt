Perhaps it might be because it&#x27;s significantly less popular but everyone out on their soap boxes now surely should have been making noise then as well.<p>Furthermore, a lot of these arguments seem to be very black and white. You either are or aren&#x27;t open source. Surely there are shades. Surely the OSI definition isn&#x27;t the only one. Surely being able to contribute, modify and run for your own purposes still counts for something.<p>It really is the case that everyone wants OSS but no one wants to pay for it.')
