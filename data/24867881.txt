Item(by='ppf', descendants=None, kids=[24868474, 24871707, 24871711, 24871020], score=None, time=1603448501, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24865731, text='Neat design (especially the blades), but I have these issues:<p>1. It&#x27;s only $30 of parts if you get most of the parts for free (especially if you consider the mounting hardware).<p>2. You&#x27;re screwed if you can&#x27;t get hold of those alu sheets from a printers shop - I have no idea where I would find them.<p>3. There&#x27;s little info on how to turn the rotary motion into electrical power, and no info on expected power output.<p>4. The published design, with one bicycle wheel, does not look strong enough (a later video shows a new design with two wheels, but then you have alignment issues). There&#x27;s a big bending moment on the axle, and those old-fashioned freewheel hubs are known to snap axles (I&#x27;ve snapped one myself).<p>5. None of the electrics are weatherproof, but that&#x27;s par for the course for homebrew stuff!')
