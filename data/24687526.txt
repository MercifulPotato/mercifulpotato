I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s retired yet<p>Ok, I might have misunderstood the info posted at: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;downloads.linux.hpe.com&#x2F;SDR&#x2F;project&#x2F;ubuntu-hpdsa&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;downloads.linux.hpe.com&#x2F;SDR&#x2F;project&#x2F;ubuntu-hpdsa&#x2F;</a> which states: &quot;NOTICE! The hpdsa driver is no longer being developed past the versions indicated. Do not upgrade the Ubuntu kernel or try to use this binary driver with Xenial. If you have a B-series Smart Array, it is advised to use the Linux md (software raid) driver, or upgrade to an H or P series hardware-based host bus adapter.&quot;<p>I thought the hpdsa driver was the same across distros, not unique to Ubuntu. Based on what you&#x27;re telling me it seems that only the Ubuntu version was discontinued.')
