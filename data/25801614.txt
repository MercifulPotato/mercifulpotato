This storytelling doesn&#x27;t concern itself with real world use cases.<p>I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve heard Docker pitched with &quot;it&#x27;s what Google uses!&quot;, while the truth was that they didn&#x27;t.<p>Before that it was MongoDB which was &quot;just like Spanner which was key to Google&#x27;s success&quot;, while in reality it wasn&#x27;t even similar.<p>And you should organize in Spotify-like tribes, even though that idea is one person&#x27;s idea about how they wished things worked, filtered though an eco chamber of conference talks.<p>As an engineer it is easy to dismiss these ideas when you have enough behind the scenes knowledge. But the point of storytelling isn&#x27;t to build technology, but to pitch it. It does a good job at that. So use it, but wisely.')
