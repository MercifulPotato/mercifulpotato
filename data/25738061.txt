Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=[25738813, 25739333], score=None, time=1610402822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25737834, text='I don&#x27;t even understand what the &quot;Fairness Doctrine&quot; would mean today.<p>In the 1960s and 70s and early 80s, it essentially gave a right of reply on broadcast media. It meant nothing on cable, it mean nothing in the world of books, it didn&#x27;t mean much for the press (they had to be careful about libel anyway).<p>If it is raining outside, and there&#x27;s someone who says &quot;it&#x27;s raining outside&quot; and someone says &quot;it&#x27;s not raining outside&quot;, how is anyone&#x27;s life improved by the idea that they should both be given air time?<p>The job of a journalist&#x2F;reporter&#x2F;something is to figure out what is going on, and tell that story (maybe by using quotes from other people).<p>The problem is that when the story is more complex than &quot;is it raining?&quot; there isn&#x27;t a single answer, and there isn&#x27;t a single way to tell the story. In making choices about what to tell and in what order, one becomes &quot;partisan&quot;.<p>I prefer the solution in the UK, where nobody seriously thinks of any newspaper as &quot;neutral&quot;, and yet despite their relatively clear biases, they all manage to tell roughly the same stories, albeit with different emphasis.<p>Contrast that to the US, where mainstream and rightwing-media-claiming-to-be-mainstream don&#x27;t even tell the same stories, and when they do, they sometimes make essentially opposite claims about them.<p>There will always be room for &quot;fringe&quot; or &quot;eclectic&quot; takes. The far-left has had to deal with that essentially forever, and the far-right used to. What&#x27;s really changed IMO is that in the last few decades, approaches to story-telling (which is all journalism really is) that used to be confined to the fringe far-right outlets ended up appearing on mass-audience outlets.')
