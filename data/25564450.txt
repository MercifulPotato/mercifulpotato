The pain comes back to doing something like combining results.<p>Additionally, commands have so many options they can move between simple to parallelize, to more complicated.<p>I also wonder if the approach should be to build a query planning layer al la pash, or addressing the parallelism in the command itself. I.e their sort example.')
