I installed it for about 8 months before giving up. I spent too many nights getting it to work properly, and recovering from various failures. I never felt safe putting my data on it.<p>In my opinion, Nextcloud favours quantity over quality, and many of its core features are subpar. Upgrades are messy, and the docker images fail at reproducible builds. The android client is also buggy.')
