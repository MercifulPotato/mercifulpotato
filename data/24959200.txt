Then I have no interest in hearing your toxic and hateful opinion and I sure hope you&#x27;ll be afraid to voice it around me.<p>It&#x27;s a great thing to have political discussions and to try to see all sides of a topic. Your willingness to see the other side&#x27;s points should stop at the point where the other side is actively trying harm people for the crime of existing in this world.
