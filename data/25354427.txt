If their actual wages (the minimum the employer can pay them, called the &quot;basic cash wage&quot;) plus their tips do not bring them over minimum wage, then their employer is required to make up the difference. So if nobody tips, the business winds up having to pay more.<p>So you&#x27;re likely hurting both the worker and employer, and making it more complicated for both of them.<p>Specifics (basic cash wage value, etc) vary by state.')
