Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609896977, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652181, text='&gt;  At big companies, it should be possible to have enough engineering offices to staff oncall with normal 8 hour days. (8 hours in Tokyo, 8 hours in London, 8 hours in San Francisco, or similar.)<p>That arrangement is commonly known as &quot;follow the sun support&quot; (not particularly at you, it&#x27;s just a good piece of jargon to know).<p>It comes with it&#x27;s own set of issues.  I work on a team that does follow the sun support, and while it&#x27;s great for handling ops issues, it makes dev work much harder.  We&#x27;re not a large team, so it evens out to 2 people per region (one of which is always &quot;on-call&quot; and can&#x27;t do dev work).  The communication costs from time zones are real, and it makes everyone&#x27;s context on what is going on different because they see updates from different regions.<p>&gt; I remember it being something like $1600 per week, but I forget the exact number<p>No wonder, that&#x27;s a pretty generous on-call stipend.  I&#x27;ve worked places that paid for on-call, but never that well.  It was usually more of a token amount, like $200 or $400 for the week.  I.e. far less than it would be if you were paid your hourly wage (averaged from salary).<p>Overall, I think &quot;follow the sun&quot; is a great idea for teams that are generally not forward looking.  It&#x27;s hard to communicate on forward looking projects, but it&#x27;s easy to hand over operational issues.  I would absolutely do it for a NOC-type team, but I would have to think about doing it for a dev team that needs to handle after-hours issues.')
