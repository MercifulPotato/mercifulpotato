I&#x27;ve finished my studies and got a title that includes &quot;software engineering&quot;.<p>Even with that title, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal if someone who didn&#x27;t get the same title calls himself an engineer. Talk is cheap, but if you can create systems you can call yourself an engineer in my opinion.')
