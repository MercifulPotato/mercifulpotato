I also worked with HTTP&#x2F;2 (when it was still a SPDY draft) and came to the same conclusions: TCP peculiarities (most notably congestion control and its dynamic window scaling) mostly eradicate the benefits of HTTP&#x2F;2. HTTP&#x2F;1.1 was using 5-6 different TCP connections (which re-use OS level window scaling caches), while HTTP&#x2F;2 you had to transfer all resources through a single TCP connection.<p>People often claim HTTP&#x2F;2 to be superior due to its multiplexing capabilities, but always reason with the mental model of having true stream-based flows and leaving TCP completely out of the argument loop. But guess what, that model is just a <i>model</i>, indeed you have packet-based TCP flows that are abstracted away to mimic a continuous stream as a socket - and those matter.')
