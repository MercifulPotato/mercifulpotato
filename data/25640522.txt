Trump&#x27;s call basically was precisely this. We heard claims, claims on the internet. No not social media but &quot;Trump media&quot; so there are golden. The best claims ever.<p>And those claims, not the substance of them but the fact that the claims exist, are the basis of disputing the election now.<p>To drive this point home, they now want panels to investigate &quot;what happened&quot; despite the claims already being tested in court. The substance doesn&#x27;t matter, it never mattered. Sowing doubt and mistrust of the process was always the purpose.')
