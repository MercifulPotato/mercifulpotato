Men are doing this to themselves.<p>The problem for women is that the negative societal aspects of their lives are not controlled by women - it&#x27;s still largely controlled by men. Same for people of color in the US - their lives are largely controlled by white people (and specifically white men).<p>I think even for the wildest of misogynists out there (I am in no way implying this is you or anyone on HN) it&#x27;s hard to argue that the world would not be drastically different if it was mostly controlled by women.')
