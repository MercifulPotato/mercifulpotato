On x-ray one was almost horizontal pushing into my back molar. My dentist always said if your wisdom teeth donâ€™t cause you any bother then leave them. But mine hurt bad. I have heard wisdom teeth are there to fill in gaps when we lost a tooth like it would push other teeth towards each other if you lost a tooth. But this is something I learned as a kid never actually saw proof this is their function.')
