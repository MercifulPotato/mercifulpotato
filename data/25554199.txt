Many Scandinavian countries have a higher population than most US states, yet somehow they seem to function better in so many dimensions.<p>So if you&#x27;re comparing a government the size of a US state to the US federal government, and saying the states do better, yeah, sure, but it&#x27;s not a fair comparison. You can find US states that do better than the US as a whole, too. A much better comparison is the EU.<p>The US is the geographical size that is almost twice the Roman Empire (9 million km^2 for the US, 5 million km^2 for the Roman Empire), with widely varying climates and therefore economies, and a diverse set of cultures. To suggest that the solutions for a Scandinavian country (relatively homogeneous culture and climate, population roughly the size of a major US city) is unhelpful.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;these other people with a completely different history, geography, culture, and population&quot; do it so much better, but it&#x27;s just not helpful. Let me know hen you figure out how to apply Scandinavia or NZ to  New York, the South, Utah, California, rural Iowa, and Alaska, and you can figure out a way to convince everyone it&#x27;s in their best interests.')
