I was consuming sexually explicit content by age nine or ten, had my secret copy of Grand Theft Auto, etc. and at no point was I in any &quot;danger&quot; other than running against the Puritan sensibilities of my guardians.<p>I remember thinking that the fact that my male Sims couldn&#x27;t wear female clothes as unnecessarily restrictive, but looking back if my guardians had seen me playing a game as a male wearing a dress, they would have destroyed the game in front of me immediately. &quot;Unsafe&quot; is a considerably relative term.')
