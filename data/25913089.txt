If you need to restore a production server in an emergency, and the whole server remains down for an hour because that&#x27;s how long Tarsnap takes to restore some tens of Gigabytes, then you will very quickly look for alternatives. I raised this issue with Colin, Tarsnap&#x27;s creator, multiple times. And the answer has always been &quot;maybe some day&quot;. I now simply encrypt backups myself and store them in an S3 or Linode bucket. Much faster. For personal backups, I love restic syncing to Backblaze, where I back up 1.4 TB or so for $5 per month.')
