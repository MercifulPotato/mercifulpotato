I&#x27;m pretty sure I overclocked it to 50Mhz at some point. It was a great machine! I started my image and video processing career on it. I never did figure out how to program the DSP in it, but really wanted to at the time. It&#x27;s amazing how far computers have come in the interim, but I&#x27;m not surprised to hear that you can get a decent experience out of one of the machines from that era.')
