The telephone company is not going to cut off anyone&#x27;s service because of seditious communications.  Nor is any public place going to ban people from committing seditious acts there.  They will just be arrested when they commit the the crime.  Will any ISP terminate anyone&#x27;s service for fear of enabling sedition.\nThese companies like Google are, first and foremost, websites.  The website is the company.  If there is no website, there is no company.<p>What is interesting about this is that these websites are protected by Section 230.  Are there limits to Section 230 protection.  Do they end at sedition.')
