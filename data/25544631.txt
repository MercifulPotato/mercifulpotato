Yes, that does not cover all cases for all people, but it covers a large part and the scenario people keep bringing up is the exception to the rule that would only take place if people were on road trips or there was no charging at their residence or work.<p>Obsessively talking about charging times is a frame of reference influenced by decades of driving ICE vehicles. And  frankly the hydrogen vehicle thing also seems like it is heavily influenced by this mindset as well.<p>I can&#x27;t make or fill gasoline (or hydrogen) at home. After years of &quot;refueling&quot; my Volt this way, I&#x27;d have a hard time giving up my &quot;gas butler&quot; that gives me a full &quot;tank&quot; every time I leave my house, and having to return to going to gas stations sounds highly unpleasant and very inconvenient.')
