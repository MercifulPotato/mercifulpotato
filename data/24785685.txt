Why shouldn&#x27;t everyone know how to code?&quot;<p>To quote a commonly-used Web meme: &quot;Why not both?&quot;<p>In my opinion, why should a software tool only have one interface to it?  What if there were many possible interfaces available, from very simple interfaces with reasonable defaults for casual users, to more option-rich interfaces for power users, to an API for programmers.  What if we could take advantage of today&#x27;s AI technology to automatically construct GUIs that are tailored to a user&#x27;s experience level?  What if users could customize the GUIs in order to make the GUI fit their needs better?<p>What if the system supported a variety of languages, not only common languages such as Python that many programmers are familiar with, but also beginner-friendly languages?  Users are willing to program provided it&#x27;s not too difficult: AppleScript from the 1990s was a step in the right direction, and Excel&#x27;s macro language is probably the most widely-used programming language in the world.  With today&#x27;s AI&#x2F;NLP technology, we could go further by developing ways for users to describe repetitive, routine tasks using natural language.<p>I think there&#x27;s still a lot of room for innovation on the desktop.  But you highlight a very big problem: where is the market?  Who is going to pay for this innovation?  Outside of open-source projects, the major commercial desktop environments are platforms controlled by multi-billion dollar corporations.  Building a new desktop environment that is capable of competing against the commercial giants will take a lot of time and capital.  The last company to give this a try was Be, Inc. in the mid-1990s, and they had a hard time competing against Microsoft&#x27;s OEM strategy.
