Being free in both beer and speech is important enough. People (incl. us) install 1000+ server clusters with CentOS. The absence of licensing fee allows us to buy more servers. The absence of licensing fee allows &quot;small researchers&quot; to have a verified platform to work with. If you don&#x27;t have a verified platform, you cannot trust your results.<p>CentOS carries a legacy from Scientific Linux (which was RH compatible too) and has a lot of software packages developed for&#x2F;on it. It might be a regular .tar.gz or RPM distribution but, they&#x27;re <i>validated and certified</i> on CentOS. This is enough. Some middlewares used in collaborative projects (intentionally or unintentionally) search for CentOS signature. Otherwise installations fail spectacularly (or annoyingly, it depends).<p>I have to run my own application on every platform with a relatively simple test suite which checks results with 32 significant digit ground truth values. If these tests fail for a reason, then I can&#x27;t trust my application&#x27;s results for a particular problem. My code runs fast and it&#x27;s relatively simple (since it&#x27;s young). Some software packages&#x27; tests can run for days. It&#x27;s not feasible to re-validate a software every time after compilation on a different set of libraries, etc. CentOS provides this foundation for free.')
