But we can hardly give the SAT every week.<p>Educators need quizzes and other assessment measures.  That way, I can know how my class is doing.  My students can understand where their performance falls short.  And their parents want to know how the class is going along the way.  These let all the involved parties adjust for better performance.<p>And these interim assessment steps need to count for at least <i>something</i> to get a reasonable level of effort from students.  (My classes are &quot;fun&quot;, but that only goes so far: there&#x27;s the fraction of the material that&#x27;s intrinsically less fun, and there&#x27;s the fraction of students that will not do <i>anything</i> without a grade incentive).<p>In turn, these quizzes and other assessment measures that I use, let me eventually score well on the metrics of engagement and scholastic progress that are used assessing <i>me</i>.  ;)')
