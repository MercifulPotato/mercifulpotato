I&#x27;m not sure where I got it from but I have several Netsurf versions on my Amiga, including a crash-prone 3.10 build. The last official release is 3.6 I think.<p>Even so the 3.10 build I have isn&#x27;t built against current AmiSSL so TLS sites fail. It is slower than say, Voyager Browser and much slower than IBrowse. Netsurf 3.6 is usable if you&#x27;re patient on an 060&#x2F;50. Performance is around what I&#x27;d expect from a Pentium 75-100 maybe?')
