After it&#x27;s caught the problem is also heavily publicized for folks to take action, and registries remove the affected versions immediately so there is a very small exposure window.<p>2) Low impact: people who write malicious code into these packages don&#x27;t have a specific target, they are writing dragnet malware, which typically means mining cryptocurrency or ransomware. If you&#x27;re going to get hacked then that&#x27;s the best possible outcome (as opposed to, e.g. a data breach).<p>Your security posture would have to be superb if supply chain attacks were anywhere near the top of your list - for the majority of companies they have more basic and targeted issues to worry about.')
