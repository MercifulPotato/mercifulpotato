I don’t know what Xerces is supposed to do but because I was leasing land from the water Dept and it was managed by a non profit, I had to go through them..I tried for three years, not a peep. I gave up and do what I can...but I know there is so much more that can be done.<p>At this point, I think the environment is in the hands of private citizens.
