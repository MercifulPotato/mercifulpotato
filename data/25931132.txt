I had pictures of all kinds of different planes on my wall and wanted to be a fighter pilot - as did half the boys in the Top Gun generation. Much later my wife&#x27;s cousin in the British Army was shot by an American F-18 in Afghanistan on a close air support mission. I clicked on this article because of my old fondness for A-10s but you&#x27;re absolutely right, it&#x27;s easy to become fascinated by the technology and separate yourself from the reality that these things are purpose built to kill other humans.')
