There are cars, and electric cars. They are separate, and you shouldn&#x27;t mix the numbers. Care are obsolete, and will be gone in the future. Maybe soon depending on the global fear level around climate change.<p>Cars are the horse and buggy market. Electric Vehicles are the entirety of the future car market. If you have 0% of the horse and buggy&#x2F;car market today, but have over 50% of the electric car market, you are very well positioned for the future.<p>I&#x27;m exaggerating. The horse and buggy analogy is flawed (VW, BMW, GM, Ford, Toyota, Honda, etc are all real electric car competitors). But just looking at Tesla vs the petroleum car market is also flawed. The reality is in the middle, with Tesla well positioned to be a top electric car manufacturer, but not to dominate the market.')
