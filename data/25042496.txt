There&#x27;s a lot of toxic, authoritarian company cultures out there that hide behind the idea that in order to be a good coworker you need to upbeat, peppy, and thrilled to be working at all times. It seems to go hand in hand with the (usually toxic and exploitative) work hard&#x2F;play hard mentality.<p>If I were required to use this at work, I would instantly view it as a yellow&#x2F;red flag that management is starting to get heavy handed about team culture, and I would probably start resenting it.<p>My ideal company culture is pretty minimal at this point: friendly people, a healthy work&#x2F;life balance, and coworkers who are open to&#x2F;good at learning - because that&#x27;s what I strive for myself.<p>I&#x27;m probably coming off as a curmudgeon, and like I said maybe it&#x27;s just due to some bad associations that come to mind, but this seems like it&#x27;s starting down the path of &quot;look how much fun our employees have at work!&quot; My $.02.<p>That being said I wish you luck, and it seems like a neat option for more social settings.')
