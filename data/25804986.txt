I think many of us are kind of socially unmoored, and actually don&#x27;t know how to take a neutral tone, and get anxious when someone takes a neutral tone with us. Almost like we&#x27;re so insecure that we need constant positive feedback&#x2F;reassurance that we&#x27;re in a friendly situation. I&#x27;ve been around this my whole life and haven&#x27;t gotten used to it, but I do the overly friendly act when it seems that people are expecting it. It doesn&#x27;t cost me anything, and it seems to help people leave an interaction feeling secure.')
