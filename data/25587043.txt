In particular, the idea of a &quot;node&quot; being the set of subnodes with the same name is counterintuitive to me.  Maybe it&#x27;s just the terminology, or maybe I just find things easier to navigate when they&#x27;re presented in a strict hierarchy.<p>I did immediately get the &quot;Everything2&quot; vibe, which is cool, but the thing is -- I&#x27;ve never done anything other than a random walk through Everything2.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine trying a directed or semi-directed traversal of related topics in Agora.<p>What am I not grokking?')
