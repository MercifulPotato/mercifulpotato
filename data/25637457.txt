There is a small-but-non-trivial segment of gamers that are willing to spend huge amounts of money for in-game privileges.<p>2. There is a similar, somewhat-overlapping segment of gamers willing to spend huge amounts of time on a game, if that huge amount of time is rewarded with things that can&#x27;t be accessed any other way (think grinding for top-tier rewards in a game like Path of Exile, some things just aren&#x27;t accessible if you don&#x27;t spend 1000+ hours)<p>3. Asia is driving the leading edge of game monetization now, and that leading edge is gacha games (lootbox mechanics&#x2F;disguised digital slot machines).<p>Looks like a couple of experts on extracting money from casual gamers have turned their attention to the whale&#x2F;core gamers, and this attempt is blockchain-flavored. As a sibling comment (duskwuff) pointed out, blockchain is irrelevant to the actual value in-game of the item. The devs can change the game world to make your $1k sword irrelevant, and based on how these kinds of games usually go, they probably will - and the whale gamers will gladly open up their wallets to gamble on the latest and greatest.<p>There is nothing innovative or exciting about Mirandus at all, unless you are looking for the fastest and most efficient way to fleece gamers - in fact, the Minecraft aesthetic feels like a little bit of a giveaway to the devs&#x27; real goals - lower the technical requirements to cast as wide a net as possible to pull in as many whales as possible.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong and this is the start of an Ethereum-powered future where digital goods are freed from platforms, but I doubt it. Most likely this is a digital cash grab that will launch to massive early-backer-funded fanfare, but will sink into the abyss of forgotten gacha games, once the devs have made their millions and start looking for a new target. Just like all the others.')
