So I think what we should be advocating isn&#x27;t an ideal world that will never come to be but rather a hard push for privacy aware designs.<p>What I mean is that biometrics are going to be used one way or another, what we should make sure that the data can&#x27;t be leaked original data can never be access again etc.<p>A different example would be healthcare data. In Germany spend so long lobbying that data should not be used until the new health minister just sneaked in a law or two to just give that data to insurances.<p>What we should be doing is design systems in a way that that data is actually accessible by default but also not abusable. I.e. only a subset research necessary PII filtered data should be available. But that way we could potentially have audited systems where we can make sure that the data is shared in a safe fashion and the other side can&#x27;t do malicious things with it.<p>Because if we don&#x27;t, once the data becomes available some government contractor will write the law (and the crappy software) with the Health Ministry acting as a defacto lobbyist for the insurance industry.')
