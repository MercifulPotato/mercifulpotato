We&#x27;ve had a decade a survey data that indicates exactly what the effect the ACA had on employer provided healthcare was.<p>See here for one such example:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pnhp.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;impact-of-aca-on-employers-and-their-employees&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pnhp.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;impact-of-aca-on-employers-and-their-e...</a><p>Some relevant highlights:\n * More than one-third of organizations now have increased out-of-pocket limits, in-network deductibles and&#x2F;or participants’ share of premium costs in response to ACA. More than one in five organizations have increased copayments or coinsurance for primary care, increased participants’ share of prescription drug costs and&#x2F;or increased the employee proportion of dependent coverage cost.\n * The excise tax on high-cost group health plans (a.k.a. Cadillac tax) is considered the top ACA cost driver beyond 2015. Since 2011, a steadily increasing percentage of organizations has taken action to avoid triggering the excise tax — a trend likely to continue. More than one in ten organizations already have adopted changes to prevent them from triggering the tax, 21% are working on changes and 28% plan to act sometime prior to 2018. Only one-quarter said changes were not necessary either because they have no high-cost plans (23%) or because they plan to pay the tax (2%).<p>That being said, the year following the passage of the ACA saw a large anomalous spike in employer healthcare costs that wasn&#x27;t present in Medicaid&#x2F;Medicare.  It&#x27;s almost undeniable that this was due to the ACA.')
