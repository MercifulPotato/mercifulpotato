Demonstrated high efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 may translate to overall prevention of transmission in populations with high enough vaccine uptake, though it is possible that if efficacy against asymptomatic infection were lower than efficacy against symptomatic infection, asymptomatic cases in combination with reduced mask-wearing and social distancing could result in significant continued transmission. Additional evaluations including data from clinical trials and from vaccine use post-authorization will be needed to assess the effect of the vaccine in preventing virus shedding and transmission, in particular in individuals with asymptomatic infection.</i><p>What they are saying is that it is technically possible for their vaccine which is highly effective at preventing symptomatic COVID to be somehow ineffective at preventing asymptomatic COVID.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;144245&#x2F;download" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;144245&#x2F;download</a>')
