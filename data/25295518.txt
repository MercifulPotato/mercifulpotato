Somebody wants to enter the country? Do a background check, give them a tax ID and let them in. Everyone is a resident without fear of deportation unless they commit a felony. After 5 or 10 years of residency, anyone can become a citizen.<p>I realize that&#x27;s pretty extreme, though, so here&#x27;s a more conservative reform approach:<p>End the H1-B program entirely. Just grant people temporary work visas on request after a background check. No company needs to be involved at the beginning. If a person is able to find at least 3 months of full-time work in the first 6 months, they&#x27;re given work residency.')
