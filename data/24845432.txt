So I’d say Mojave is less likely to break than Big Sur, whose hidden issues are probably yet to be discovered. That goes double if you have a less common setup, e.g. an eGPU.<p>(Note that this is not necessarily true for security vulnerabilities. As in most complex pieces of software, security bugs are guaranteed to abound in both Mojave and Big Sur.)<p>Other reasons to stick to Mojave for now: support for 32-bit apps, fewer confirmation pop-ups, easier kext handling (I guess?) and better AirDrop support for older devices. Also, iTunes – in case that’s your thing.')
