There is a count of votes, and that count of votes led into one direction as they counted more votes. And sometimes that count climbs higher at specific moment in time based on a county that had not reported that starts reporting, etc. But it doesn&#x27;t matter, it&#x27;s only if you look at it at a specific moment. If you wait for all the votes to be counted at the end, you have a final tally there is no sudden change of votes in one direction or another. What you&#x27;re saying is pure fabrication.')
