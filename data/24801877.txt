It came (to them) shortly afterwards.<p>That China may have had such evidence and kept it private doesn&#x27;t make the WHO&#x27;s statement any less truthful at the time it was issued. They aren&#x27;t an intelligence organization; they rely on cooperative member nations.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;factchecking-trumps-attack-on-the-who&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;factchecking-trumps-attack...</a><p>&gt; While there is a debate about what was known when — and it seems clear that China knew more than what it reported — the WHO never said the virus was not communicable. Instead, the agency always considered the possibility, even if it also shared information from China that found no evidence of such transmission.<p>&gt; Lack of evidence, especially of “preliminary” results, does not mean the WHO was saying the novel coronavirus could not be spread between people. The same day as the tweet, the WHO cautioned that there might be some human-to-human transmission of the virus among family members in China.<p>&gt; According to a timeline of events, Van Kerkhove, who is also the WHO’s technical lead for the COVID-19 response, also said that human-to-human transmission wouldn’t be unexpected, since that is what occurs with SARS and MERS, which are also coronaviruses.<p>Just a few days later:<p>&gt; By Jan. 19, the WHO was more definitive, saying in a tweet that there was “some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts.”<p>Trying to use this tweet to justify US inaction <i>months later</i> is silly and transparent.')
