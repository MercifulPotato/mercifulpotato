It&#x27;s still not hard for me to accept that happens. What&#x27;s hard for me to accept is the complete lack of nuance in your reasoning. There&#x27;s really no room left for discussion after you&#x27;re through painting a picture, but that picture does not jibe with reality. That&#x27;s aside from the siege mentality that isn&#x27;t supported even by the picture but goes along with it.<p>&gt; From my &quot;outside&quot; perspective, you&#x27;re obviously stuck in a bubble in which people must go out of their way to pretend both sides of every issue are equally valid.<p>&quot;Both sides.&quot; &quot;Valid.&quot; You&#x27;re framing the argument in terms of your bubble.
