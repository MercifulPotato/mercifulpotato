In response to this, synchronous generators will produce more power to bring the frequency back to normal. This is as a result of the big spinning mass in the generator that wants to maintain its rate of rotation.<p>Synthetic inertia involves configuring control loops in the battery inverters to cause them to have a similar response to a synchronous generator. The bonus is that you can tune this control as much as you like depending on grid conditions.')
