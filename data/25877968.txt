Neither do children, nor pets, nor farm animals, nor automated control systems.<p>The common thread connecting these examples is: people who are responsible for managing children&#x2F;animals&#x2F;PID controllers bear responsibility for the action of these systems, whatever the actions are. Same reasoning should apply to algorithms: don&#x27;t deploy them unless you&#x27;re prepared to be held accountable for what they end up doing.')
