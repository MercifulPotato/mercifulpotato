Helping out customers integrate their website &#x2F; understand how something works.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s tons of other smaller things here and there, but those are the big &quot;buckets&quot; of my time.<p>Once I know what to work on next, I tend to prioritize as follows:<p>1) At the start of each week I pick 1-3 topics to work on next (for example writing a new blog post, working on a new feature, or even just writing documentation which I am going to next).<p>2) Each day when I&#x27;m working on my project I pick the most impactful thing I could work on, and start with that. I allow myself to explore a topic in depth, sometimes without a clear goal or deadline. After all it&#x27;s supposed to be fun if I want to stick to it for the long term.<p>3) I try to respond to customer emails as soon as I can, and understand why they&#x27;re giving my product a try. That&#x27;s my gauge for what to work on the following week.')
