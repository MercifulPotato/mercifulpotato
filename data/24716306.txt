Sadly, the closest thing there is to official bindings for NodeJS haven&#x27;t been updated for 4 years and don&#x27;t build against newer versions of Node, so I ended up having to rely on some random fork that I have no reason to believe is going to be maintained.<p>Unfortunately, the overlap of people that know C++ well enough to write high quality bindings and also have an interest in NodeJS is not that large. I tried to get into it myself, but there&#x27;s a pretty steep learning curve and once you go beyond tiny toy examples it gets pretty hairy.<p>If someone has the skills and interest in taking on a medium sized open source project that would be immediately useful to a lot of people in the Node community, Zstandard would be a good choice.')
