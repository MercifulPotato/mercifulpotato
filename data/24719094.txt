So if it was run constitutionally Facebook would be even less restricted than it is now.<p>However I don&#x27;t think that Facebook would be run constitutionally if it were government owned. It would be run as a propaganda outlet and a way to spy on people all over the world.<p>Right now Facebook&#x27;s motives are just money. If Facebook were government owned its motives would become more complex and dangerous. It would want to make the American government look good. It would want to elect corrupt politicians who promised behind closed doors to increase Facebook&#x27;s funding.')
