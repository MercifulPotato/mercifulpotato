Browsers <i>already</i> allow you to control cookies, extensions can manage them and create popups if you want them, and in fact very old browsers had a &quot;confirm all cookies&quot; feature in them. Nobody used that old feature because cookies became so prevalent nobody wanted to be informed anymore, so those features got taken out, but it was technically very easy to do.<p>The EU basically looked at that situation with a competitive browser market, extensions, the existence of the same feature in the past and said, &quot;screw all that, the Commission knows best&quot;. Which is exactly the attitude that drove people to vote leave in the first place.')
