I&#x27;ve think Option is just null with extra steps.<p>Better to concentrate on the plain &quot;A&quot; in &quot;Option[A]&quot; I think. WHen you don&#x27;t have nulls, Option is what allows you to have plain types that <i>don&#x27;t</i> use Option, that can&#x27;t be &quot;missing&quot;, which is enforced by the type system, and so doesn&#x27;t need any &quot;steps&quot; at all to handle them as regards presence&#x2F;absence of value.')
