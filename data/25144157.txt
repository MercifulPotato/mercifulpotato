(And the understanding of the genericized term is at least as much shaped by Naziism as Italian fascism, anyhow; this might annoy Mussolini if he was around to be annoyed -- frankly, that Nazis are taken as an example of &quot;fascism&quot; would probably annoy Hitler, too -- but, you know, that&#x27;s just the way language evolves; if we&#x27;re talking about Mussolini&#x27;s movement in Italy specifically, we generally say &quot;Italian fascism&quot;, not just &quot;fascism&quot; unless there is context to indicate that we are specifically talking about Italy.)')
