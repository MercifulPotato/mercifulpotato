Later on, the NN is tweaked and would say you actually probably have cancer, but you don’t know because you never bother checking again. The insurance companies get their hands on those results. You’re not committing fraud (because you don’t know), but now the insurance companies are more reluctant to sell you insurance.<p>(To be fair, I don’t think the insurance companies are allowed to discriminate against you using only that data. They probably need an official, recognized diagnosis from a real human doctor.)')
