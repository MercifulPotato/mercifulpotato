My ISP has multiple interfaces, i.e. HSI (high speed internet, bridge or NAT PPPoE), Voice (bridge with ISP network, VoIP for phones), Voice_ATA (bridge with ISP network, VoIP via embedded ATA, modem acts as one IP phone), TR069 (through which CWMP communicates and also which exposes SSH, Telnet, HTTP and HTTPS management on an internal IP address, bridged with ISP network) and IPTV (used for IPTV STBs, bridged with their network).<p>All interfaces are separate, and if you bridge your modem it only bridges HSI on LAN1. Phone works, IPTV on LAN 2 and 3 works and of course TR069 works.<p>If on xDSL, ISP can see all stats on their end of the DSLAM, there is literally nothing to configure from the modem side, except maybe turn on&#x2F;off certain modes, but by default they&#x27;re all turned on.')
