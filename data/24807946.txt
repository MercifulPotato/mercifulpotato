Plus there are an enormous number of foreign words added sometimes with their original spelling, sometimes with a hacked phonetic version.<p>I assumed all languages were like this (spelling only loosely&#x2F;occasionally linked to pronunciation). But German manages it just fine.<p>I always found it frustrating being told to sound out words and everyone acting like this system worked when I was a kid. It put me off reading&#x2F;writing etc. Not sure what I can suggest other than being honest and saying &quot;yeah, you&#x27;re right, that word makes no sense&quot;.')
