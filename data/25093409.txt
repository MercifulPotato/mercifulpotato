We fucked it up twelve ways to Sunday. Why: giant egos. There were turf wars between Austin, Santa Clara and Israel over who would design it, and the team that won out had long since lost its best principle engineers and had no clue how to spin the architecture to meet the design win. Otellini&#x27;s hindsight hedge is pure spin: we knew the landing zone, we just didn&#x27;t know how to get there. And the aforementioned turf war guaranteed we didn&#x27;t get access to other teams&#x27; talent. I&#x27;m bitter because it was a really fun team when I moved from Motorola to Intel Austin, and then it just corroded over political battles.')
