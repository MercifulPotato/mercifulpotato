What is the maximum number of results that one can retrieve.  Without any additional parameters, it looks like it only returns 15 videos by default.<p>Personally, for channels, I use a script only needs to access the channel&#x27;s page; it outputs a list of all the videos in the channel.  One of the more recent web development trends I dislike are sites that &quot;load more results&quot; using additional Javascript-triggered HTTP requests in response to scrolling a page.   YouTube channels with multiple pages of videos are one example.<p>With custom scripts I wrote for searching YouTube, outputting lists of videos from channels, and downloading non-commercial videos, I can use YouTube without the need a graphical browser.')
