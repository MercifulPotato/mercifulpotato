I had nothing more advanced than Bluetooth, drove a rental car with Android Auto support for a week, and immediately went out and replaced the head unit in both of my vehicles with one that supported AA and Carplay.<p>The most obvious benefit is navigation.  You get the full power of Google&#x2F;Apple maps in real time, and you never have to pay your car OEM for updates.<p>Navigation is also integrated with everything else.  It knows that I have an appointment on my calendar in half an hour and suggests that as a destination without me having to retype it.  It knows that in the mornings my most likely destination is &quot;work&quot; and my most likely evening destination is &quot;home&quot;.  It knows what brewery I like to go to on Saturday afternoons and suggests that too.<p>Voice control is another huge one.  I don&#x27;t have as much experience with Carplay, but with AA I can use Google Assistant for nearly everything and keep my eyes on the road.<p>It makes the connections trivial.  Most modern systems should support wireless Android Auto - when I get in the car it connects over WiFi automatically without me doing anything.  Even on older vehicles I plug in one USB cable and am good to go.  Compare this to my bag of hardware I bring on trips where I&#x27;ll have a rental car - you need to find a mount that works (sometimes a.dashboard suction cup, sometimes a vent clip), get the phone in a good angle where you can see it and it can get a good GPS signal, go into the car and pair it to Bluetooth, attach the charging cable and make sure it&#x27;s not getting caught on anything, and so on.<p>For calls and texts, it just works.  I&#x27;ve fought with Ford Sync and other proprietary systems just trying to get it to recognize names.  The stock unit in my Subaru was so bad that it couldn&#x27;t keep &quot;Firstname Last name&quot; and &quot;Othername Last name&quot; as two separate identities because they sounded alike, so I had to map half my family to Harry Potter characters.  With Google&#x2F;Apple, no such problem - just say &quot;Call Firstname Last name&quot; and it works every time.<p>The system integrates with whatever background noise you want - music, podcasts, and so on.  It makes everything automatic and painless.<p>Android Auto gave new life to my old cars')
