With or without self driving doesn&#x27;t really change that.<p>I think the last one is their big problem: Uber has their current market-position by selling below cost, and they&#x27;ve locked in a lot of things like compensation at the assumption they were profitable to a much more fanciful degree. Once the VC money runs out, they&#x27;re going to need to raise prices and it&#x27;s a lot easier for anyone else to compete with them since they&#x27;re all renting the same Waymo cars and all of the drivers are running multiple apps anyway. Uber has some economy of scale benefits but they also have a reputation for mistreating drivers and a lot of expensive real-estate and staff which local competitors don&#x27;t have.')
