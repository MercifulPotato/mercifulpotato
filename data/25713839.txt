This particular shop owner does not support Trump. They have a community notice board on their shop where people can post things.<p>Of course they are not going to let a Trump supporter post a MAGA sign on that board. It&#x27;s their business, they can decide whats allowed there and what isn&#x27;t. Forcing them to display a MAGA sign would be essentially &quot;forced speech&quot; which would also violate their rights.<p>That doesn&#x27;t prevent anyone from making MAGA signs or posting them in other places, so the free speech of those people wasn&#x27;t violated in any way by the shop owner refusing to display their signs.<p>Therefore I think Amazon, Apple, Google and the other companies shouldn&#x27;t be forced to convey messages on their platforms they don&#x27;t agree with, otherwise it&#x27;s violating their rights.')
