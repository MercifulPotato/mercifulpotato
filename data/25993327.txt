Many happy hours playing high-end PC games on a super cheap and lightweight Chromebook that starts up instantly and runs silently compared to my weighty, expensive, and noisy gaming laptop that needs to boot into windows (although that only takes 5-10s these days to be fair)<p>Feels like nVidia (...and Xbox?  Not tried that) have eaten Google&#x27;s own lunch in the stream-to-chromebook context.')
