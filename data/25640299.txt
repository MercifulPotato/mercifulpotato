Item(by='jjulius', descendants=None, kids=[25641242], score=None, time=1609806378, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640252, text='&gt;What are the numbers since &#x27;86 when the controversies started?<p>Without the exact number of episodes that have aired since then, I cannot answer that question.<p>&gt;Have they issued corrections for them?<p>It seems to me that you only skimmed the Wikipedia article to get a total count of controversies and to determine the dates around when they occurred. It would probably do you some good to take just a few minutes to read through them so that you better understand the nuance of them, the actual severity of the issues, and whether or not they issued corrections, retractions, etc.<p>In fact if you had read through them, you&#x27;d have noticed that the last one isn&#x27;t a controversy about any aired content at all but is rather an internal issue, so there have only been 13 controversies.')
