That strategy means that you buy things you don&#x27;t need, causing a TON of environmental externalities. So, yeah, they&#x27;d have more fraud - maybe their return policy isn&#x27;t compatible with the environment. Maybe their profit margins are not compatible with the environment. Maybe... just maybe... their entire business model isn&#x27;t compatible.')
