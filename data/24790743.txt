Radio controlled target drones predate the [semi] autonomous drones seen today.<p>The first drone was a radio controlled de Havilland Tiger Moth called <i>Queen Bee</i>.  The term &#x27;drone&#x27; is a play on that name.  Drone bees fly once then die, just as radio controlled airplanes being used as targets for anti-aircraft guns only fly once.')
