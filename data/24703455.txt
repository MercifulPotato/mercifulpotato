Most of us were born here, many of us moved here, but we have a pretty good thing going on. New immigration should be a net benefit for our society and it should favor the side of the workers - e.g. Americans in general - not the bottom line of a business class looking for ever cheaper labor in order to extract additional money from their efforts.<p>Personally I&#x27;d like to see the entire H1B program scrapped entirely. If you can&#x27;t find an American to do a job, hire and train one. If you don&#x27;t want to, don&#x27;t do business here.<p>The rest of your comment is semantic quibbling. &quot;American workers&quot; in this context means Americans. Nothing in that phrasing implies carving the country up into ever smaller groups based on certain characteristics and including or excluding them.')
