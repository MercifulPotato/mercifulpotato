My problem is the M1 is so good that if they do a 8 performance cores version for 16 inch MBP in spring there would literally be no point in having a desktop - I could have a single device that outperforms the desktop machine. Frankly I don&#x27;t see why they couldn&#x27;t offer a 13 inch varian with more cores - thermals are not a constraint.')
