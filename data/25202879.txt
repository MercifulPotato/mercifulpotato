We also have a potentially big fish client deal in the works, and our founder has been telling investors about this possibility order to drum up excitement and in turn, funds.<p>We expect the next response from big fish to be a yes&#x2F;no as to whether we are moving forward.<p>The founder said they didn&#x27;t want to follow up with the big fish to speed up their response because if it were a &quot;no,&quot; they could no longer tell investors about the possibility of a big fish deal. They said they wanted to close out this round quickly instead.<p>This feels a little off to me, and I worry it borders on fraud. Is intentionally blinding yourself to information like this illegal in some way? Or is this just par the course and not an issue?<p>Just wanted to make sure I&#x27;m not in an legally precarious situation here.')
