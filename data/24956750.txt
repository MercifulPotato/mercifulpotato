Given its current performance, I do not believe the current administration and its party to be capable of effectively distributing a vaccine. I also suspect a modest portion of the population supporting this party will not consent to such a vaccine under any circumstances.<p>(Warning: political speculation partly driven by election anxiety)\n“Wait,” you say, “there could be an administration change soon, what if that happens?” Unless the Senate is secured–such that a bill could be passed through reconciliation–the aforementioned party will return to the same diehard obstructionist form as we saw the during the Obama administration (even if many agree with the contents of the bill McConnel would never allow a vote). It will be up to the executive branch to issue executive orders in order to distribute the vaccine. This is not guaranteed to be effective either. Whatever the order is it will immediately be challenged in court only to be struck down as “grossly unconstitutional” thanks in part to the three most junior justices of the Supreme Court, wherein (I suspect) their opinions on executive power apply only to presidents of the party that appointed them.<p>I would expect similar legal challenges and outcomes even if the senate majority is Democrat. See the Affordable Care Act, wherein the existential legal challenge  _National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius_ decided that it is constitutional (by the skin of its teeth 5-4 Roberts in the plurality.) Which, by the way, I would not count on it being constitutional after opinions are issued from the upcoming Supreme Court term so the count of uninsured will skyrocket sometime next year, great time (&#x2F;s) to deliver a vaccine through a for-profit healthcare system. Elections matter.')
