Item(by='chadash', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605666918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25122071, text='We like to assume that markets are efficient because if not, there&#x27;s an opportunity for arbitrage, but for betting markets, this just isn&#x27;t true. Predictit, the most often referenced one, has a fee structure that makes it horribly inefficient: they take 10% of all winnings on a given bet and 5% of all withdrawals from the site. The latter actually isn&#x27;t as big of a deal, but the 10% on winnings means that I can&#x27;t make any money off of the spread when you have, for example, a market where Biden has a 88% chance of winning and Trump a 15% chance (which are the odds on the site as of right now). In a market without fees, I&#x27;d buy a Trump NO for 85 cents and a Biden NO for 12 cents. If Biden wins, I make 15 cents on the first bet and lose 12 cents on the second. If Trump wins, I lose 85 cents on the first bet and make 88 on the second. Either way, I&#x27;m up 3 cents. But with a 10% fee on winnings, I make 1.5 cents if Biden wins and I actually lose 5 cets if Trump wins. Then I pay another 5% when I try to withdraw my money (which isn&#x27;t as bad of a fee, because in theory, I would just do a bunch of arbitrage to grow my pile fee-free and then withdraw at the end).<p>What ends up happening is that people on these sites don&#x27;t get any value from betting on events that are 90%+ likely. Which is why the Trump&#x2F;Biden market even puts Trump&#x27;s chances as high as they are. I personally think Trump&#x27;s chances of winning are less than 1%, but I&#x27;d lose money if I bet against him. Meanwhile, some of his biggest fans may not actually think that he has as high as a 15% chance winning, but if they win, they get a 600% return, so what&#x27;s the difference.')
