Item(by='chrisfosterelli', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608763844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25522913, text='Sorry, I should have clarified what I meant by &quot;documents&quot;. Notion has a really rich concept of a &quot;document&quot; with deep functionality that other tools typically don&#x27;t have.<p>For example notion pages can include full markdown <i>in addition to</i> subdocuments, databases, templates, relationships, reminders, galleries, kanban boards, formulas, lists, calendars, timelines, images, videos, web embeds, code snippets, files, maps, tweets, figma views, etc.<p>Where other apps do have some overlap, they typically don&#x27;t have similar sharing functionality. Notion pages can be private, shared, team-visible, or public on the internet.<p>To more directly compare to your examples:<p>* Vim - No rich document features, no mobile access, no markdown rendering, no sharing.\n* Joplin - I haven&#x27;t used this myself but a quick look seems like it has no sharing or team features.\n* Obsidian - No sharing features.\n* Google docs - No rich document features.<p>Keep is just a notes app. No argument that alternatives exist there. I like Keep because it works well on android and the web and keeps it simple, but there&#x27;s definitely other options.<p>FWIW I agree there is alternatives to Notion, in the strictest sense of &quot;alternative&quot;. Quip is really close for example. For some use cases (like the article here) you could call Confluence an alternative. But they&#x27;re just not as flexible or full featured as notion for such a massive variety of use cases across a team. We use notion as a client CRM, project management tool, internal documentation tool, public user guide, discussion space, note app, research log, etc. and there&#x27;s not really one tool that covers all of those use cases competitively.')
