Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[24891152], score=None, time=1603663849, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889918, text='I disagree.<p>A market economy is not based on greed, it&#x27;s based on the willingness of people to provide services for one another whereupon actor&#x27;s first motivation may be individual wealth creation, but the side effects of trade, division of labour and especially competition create massive surpluses, usually for the buyers, i.e. consumers.<p>Most importantly, companies are only successful if they focus really hard on <i>doing things that others (i.e. &#x27;the market&#x27;) believe is valuable</i>.<p>Paradoxically - it is &#x27;intrinsically motivated&#x27; behaviour that is &#x27;greedy&#x27; or purely self-oriented. To think that someone - anyone - deserves some kind of high standard of material living because &#x27;they want to do whatever they want all day&#x27; - irrespective of the net utility they create for the community ... is selfish.<p>&#x27;Intrinsically motivated work&#x27; already has a name, it&#x27;s called &#x27;art&#x27;. And in that I would lump the vast majority of OSS which was designed to meet the makers view of what is useful, not &#x27;the market&#x27;s view&#x27;, which is why most of it is not used.<p>Nothing could be less healthy on the whole than letting Engineers build &#x27;whatever they want&#x27; because most of it will be completely useless, and projects will generally not produce enough material input to be able to do anything at scale.<p>Another bit of paradox is that if there were more efficient means to fairly license and maintain software - 90% of OSS makers would happily do that. I don&#x27;t believe they are ideologically tied to OSS - if they could tool away on their favorite bit of software and earn what they though was a &#x27;fair living&#x27; by selling it - they would do it in a heartbeat.<p>Intrinsically motivated initiatives are important, and frankly, nobody would do Engineering if they didn&#x27;t like it on some level, but it&#x27;s only one ingredient, and not the primary driver.<p>And of course, most labour has zero possibility for intrinsic motivation: 40-80% of jobs would instantly be vacated if that were the only motivator as they&#x27;re just too grinding, boring, difficult for someone to do mostly on that basis.<p>The market forces people to &#x27;serve others&#x27; and that&#x27;s ironically want people don&#x27;t want to do ... because it&#x27;s a grind. What people really &#x27;want to do&#x27; is &#x27;whatever they want&#x27; which probably won&#x27;t bode well on the whole for having a broadly high standard of living.')
