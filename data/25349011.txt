It&#x27;s obnoxious, and I know people take advantage of it (and wish they wouldn&#x27;t!) to claim allergies to things when they just don&#x27;t like them. But it&#x27;s just not worth playing with someone&#x27;s health. I&#x27;m really lucky that people believed me when I told them I had to know what things were fried in or whether they&#x27;d used beef stock for that soup.')
