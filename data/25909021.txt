They see all the good cases, where someone walks out more confident and with better sight. Their product helps people. But then so do homeopathic placebos (to a certain (measurable) extent), and that&#x27;s the hard part to figure out.<p>Of course, in this case everyone truly does see better when they walk out and what GP is wondering about are the long-term effects. This stuff is complicated, though I frankly have a hard time believing this claim of &quot;just stop wearing glasses and you&#x27;ll see better&quot;. Surely someone would have noticed that? But without doing a deep dive into the research here, it&#x27;s all just speculation on both their part and mine.')
