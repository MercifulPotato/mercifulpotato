However with a sample size of 1 , it could be hundred factors and it is unfair to accuse anyone .<p>[1] Even when is there larger sample it is nuanced and tricky to really say, unless the superboss explicitly favours women there are inherent biases in the system against them, for example amount of mandatory maternity leave u.s. offers is pitiful, there are lesser women in STEM etc, the super boss selection criteria may be biased because of underlying biases not necessarily her own. Doesn&#x27;t mean she should get a free pass, It should be investigated&#x2F;reviewed before jumping to the conclusion of labelling someone sexist.')
