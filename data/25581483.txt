Item(by='javajosh', descendants=None, kids=[25581754, 25582005, 25582957], score=None, time=1609335099, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581293, text='<i>&gt;Because a private company has no right to tell me what to do with the hardware and software I legally bought from them.</i><p>Interestingly, Nintendo&#x27;s explicit message was not that the hacking was wrong, but that the <i>sharing</i> of the hacking was wrong, because sharing the hack encourages piracy on a larger scale. It&#x27;s hard to argue with that logic, TBH. And I actually admire their soft touch approach.<p>My sense is that this is not that big of a deal, to Nintendo or anyone else. The platform, the physicality of &quot;normal&quot; distribution, plus the general inability of people to successfully mod their stuff, all favors Nintendo naturally.<p>Seems like a tempest in a teapot, and if anything, I don&#x27;t think it harms Nintendo&#x27;s reputation at all (modulo sensationalist headlines).')
