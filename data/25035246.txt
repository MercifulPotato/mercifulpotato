It&#x27;s only natural for form to suffer as you try and push yourself harder, but there are not many exercises where bad form so consistently leads to such debilitating injuries such as slipped disks.<p>This is anecdotal evidence I know, but I can think of two friends that have gotten slipped disks from doing deadlifts in 2019, and this was during personal training sessions from &quot;ex-Olympians&quot; that cost $100s an hour.')
