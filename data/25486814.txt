I will use estimation calculators and figure my bill will be $25&#x2F;month (which I get for a couple months) and then suddenly get a $120 bill.  This has happened more than once and has had me loose all confidence in these services for hobby projects.  I&#x27;d rather just buy a Pi cluster at this point.')
