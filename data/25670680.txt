That wasn&#x27;t an Intel thing, and that sort of thing could happen with any hardware that isn&#x27;t tested with every combination of other hardware.<p>I&#x27;m excited that the M1 is good, also- that it seems fast with everything, even the old Intel-specific code via Rosetta. I don&#x27;t subscribe to Apple NIH[1] philosophy, but what they have made historically, barring the problem I mentioned above and a few macOS and iOS issues over the years, has been awesome. The M1 seems to follow Jobs&#x27; philosophy of making the best product.<p>[1]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Not_invented_here" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Not_invented_here</a>')
