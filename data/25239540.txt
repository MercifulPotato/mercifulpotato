It is not clear that the service is paid because it is mentioned that the extension is open-source.  I understand you need to keep the lights on, but it is better to let know about about the pricing I upfront.<p>You mentioned there is a free tier, but can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s supported on free vs the paid tiers. It&#x27;ll be better if you add the free tier and features to the comparison chart. Just my two cents.<p>A great idea regardless, kudos.')
