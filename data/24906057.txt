Paraphrasing from memory:<p>The factory had a machine break down. They hired a few cheap engineers who were unable to diagnose and fix the problem. Eventually they found an experienced engineer who fixed the machine by tapping it with a hammer and charged them $1,000. When they asked for an itemised invoice they got:<p>Tapping with a hammer: $5\nKnowing where to tap: $9,995')
