Item(by='room500', descendants=None, kids=[24946949], score=None, time=1604084276, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944891, text='&gt; We&#x27;re not comfortable relying on pure intuition in science<p>I stated that we should come to a consensus on topics - not rely on intuition. Science is a great example of a field that relies on critical thinking and debunking theories, but also in our ability to build consensus about how the world works. Disagreeing with the consensus should be encouraged, but it needs to be done with the facts (experimental results) - not just stating that something is unknown (a statement that can be applied to 99.9% of science if taken at face value).<p>&gt; Yes, but as it, perspectives are often misperceived as facts<p>Agreed.<p>&gt; You can still make decisions, just be honest about the fact that they are based on speculation<p>In complicated topics, this should be a given. But agreed in general.<p>&gt; There is a plausible theory that QAnon is actually a state sponsored psy op<p>I have heard that, but my point was that QAnon is not a &quot;typical&quot; political group. Regardless of its founders (foreign actors, bored kids, whatever), there should be a heavy dose of skepticism when looking at their theories, especially when many of their theories have been debunked but are continued to be peddled.<p>&gt; The QAnon phenomenon is also being used as a justification for censorship<p>It is, and that is a bad thing. Unfortunately, we need to do <i>something</i> to correct the amplification problem of social media. Now we can disagree on the extent of the role that private companies should play in this policing, but it should be illegal to yell &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theory - even virtually.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m disturbed by the percentage of the population that is more concerned about conspiracy theories ... about children, than they are about the possibility that children are actually being sexually abused<p>The beauty of &quot;save the children&quot; is that it is impossible to call it out as coordinated propaganda without being accused of not caring about children. Of course I care about children. But I am also concerned that the upswell of social media was not natural.<p>&gt; don&#x27;t forget that you are guessing at what the right thing to so is<p>I am, but we as a society have always faced these dilemmas. Before social media, there were libel and slander laws that discouraged outright lies. With social media, however, there is almost nothing to gain from going after someone who posts slander. There is a fundamental problem when any random person can write whatever they dream of as fact and then <i>amplify</i> it to millions of people through social media.<p>I don&#x27;t have all the right answers. But I think we need to agree that <i>something</i> should be done to prevent this amplification of propaganda. And then let&#x27;s figure out how to fix it together.<p>&gt; These are complicated topics, and I certainly don&#x27;t have all the answers.<p>Same. This site is one of the only places where these topics can still be discussed without devolving into flame wars. So thank you for that.')
