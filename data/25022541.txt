A friend gave me a couple of older nice waterproof Polk audio speakers. Mounted them in the back of the van on a custom rubber shock mount I build from random pieces at the hardware store.<p>I wanted a way to power the speakers and send music via bluetooth 5. All powered off my 12v solar system. Looked around at all the &#x27;commercial&#x27; offerings and found nothing attractive. Everything was over priced or just didn&#x27;t have modern features.<p>So... I searched around on Amazon for the right keywords. Ended up getting one of these little class D 100w+100w amps with treble and bass knobs off Amazon for $30 [1]. Got a 12v-&gt;24v step up for $16 [2] to give the amp a bit more power and less distortion.<p>Works amazingly well for a fraction of the price of anything else.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B089KVH9J1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B089KVH9J1</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B01EFUHFW6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B01EFUHFW6</a>')
