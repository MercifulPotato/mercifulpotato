I think there is a profoundly bright future to be had with hyperloops, powered by a mix of solar and fusion energy.<p>That being said, I do believe that there are a lot of challenges to resolve along the way.<p>* how do we halt the release of methane from the arctic and prevent the death of the North Atlantic Current (NAC)?<p>* how do we make online education even better and as close to free of cost as possible?<p>* how do we restore trust in government and media?<p>* how do we free people from crushing debt, whether it be from student loans or medicine?<p>* how do we change the physical layout of communities so they are no longer structured around the automobile, but instead are built for remote work and raising children at home?<p>* how do we rapidly grow the housing stock, so that everyone has a place to live?<p>Solving these problems (and the many I have neglected to mention) is a difficult challenge, to be sure. I am certain of one thing though: clean technology and honestly earned wealth are our friends here, not our enemies.<p>A lot of great jobs will be made constructing the infrastructure required to make all this stuff happen.')
