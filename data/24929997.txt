Item(by='chopin', descendants=None, kids=[24930357], score=None, time=1603976317, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929639, text='&gt;&quot;Disturbing the Peace&quot; is one example off the top of my head of something that&#x27;s incredibly subjective that we consider the purview of the legal system.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a good thing. Good laws (especially criminal laws) should be normative, i.e. it should be deducible for anyone which behavior is punishable. Laws not adhering to this principle are ripe for selective enforcement and have no place in a rule-of-law society.')
