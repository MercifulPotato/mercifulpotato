The bluetooth connectivity is flaky, and sometimes I hear weird sound artifacts over Bluetooth too. The robot voice announcement whenever a device goes in or out of range, even if I&#x27;m currently listening to something from a different device, is <i>super</i> annoying, and there&#x27;s no way AFAIK to turn it off.')
