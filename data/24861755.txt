Real-estate on the other hand, would hardly be illiquid and the United States do have a reasonable assessment program for real-estate. The same cannot say for antique cars or artwork.<p>However, to combat the side-effect of wealth tax requires global governance, which in today&#x27;s day and age, seems like a pipe dream.')
