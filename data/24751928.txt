(I have one 4k and one 1440p.) Text is noticeably easier to read on the higher resolution monitor.  I think this is primarily because we sit much closer to monitors than to TVs. (I don&#x27;t think I can tell when my TV plays 4k vs 1080p, as I sit about eight feet away.)<p>If I had a 30&quot; monitor with 8k resolution, I would probably not be able to tell a difference, unless I went looking very closely to it, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend the money on that.  However, at 40&quot; or 42&quot;, I suspect one would notice it at the distances one normally sits from a computer monitor. At that point, my reason for not buying it would be that I can&#x27;t afford it. ;)')
