On the bright side, they also mention  a “need for continued awareness-raising activities among traders and consumers about their obligations and rights“ as a direct action point for the Commission itself.<p>On a side note, I feel a similar relief as you. As much as I’d personally want a stricter and more enforced regulation, because it bugs me that I can’t access all the content I’d want, I admire that the Commission looks at a bigger picture and takes into considerations long-term effects on the media industry as well as the quality of the available content.')
