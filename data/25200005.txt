This was because they noticed I wasn&#x27;t using them and they contacted me about that. They have a really simple way to return hardware now - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xfinity.com&#x2F;returns" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xfinity.com&#x2F;returns</a><p>Now I just stream my cable to my TVs via the Roku app (my TVs are mainly TCLs, which have Roku built in) and that isn&#x27;t counted against my cap. As a customer of theirs that has saved me ~$60 a month and my TV usage doesn&#x27;t get counted against my data cap. That $60 basically covers the cost of uncapped service. This seems to be a pretty good deal to me.')
