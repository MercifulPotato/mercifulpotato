First is &quot;ignore everything&quot; which is handled by &quot;;&quot; but then there is the function &quot;comment&quot; or &quot;rich comment&quot; that should still be valid code and all dependencies it needs available. If not, someone couldn&#x27;t open the file and run the forms inside the block as-is, so the program is not valid.<p>It&#x27;s a gotcha, but in the end I think it&#x27;s neat that it makes sure it&#x27;s valid.')
