Support assertion&#x2F;argument.  Last sentence may summarize support.  These paragraphs should follow the overall structure but sometimes you will need more than one paragraph to support something you suggested in the second paragraph.<p>Paragraph n+1: Review conclusion and some salient corollaries.<p>Paragraphs n+m: Discussion of implications of conclusion.<p>I read through paragraph after paragraph and I have no idea what your argument was, where it was going.
