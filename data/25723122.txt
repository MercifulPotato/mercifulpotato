By this definition it&#x27;s entirely possible for two different brands of fascism to have two opposing goals, and for one to use fascist methods on another fascist.<p>If your definition of fascism is specifically centered around nationalism or racism then this doesn&#x27;t really work, but I don&#x27;t think the word fascism implies this, only that fascism is usually associated with regimes using fascist authoritarianism to enforce racist and nationalist ideologies.')
