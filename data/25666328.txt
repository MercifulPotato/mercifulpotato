There&#x27;s a big dissonance in the eyes of folks who watched CNN stand over a burning building proclaiming that the BLM protests were in fact entirely peaceful. And in the eyes of folks watching FOX right now, saying the assault on the capital was largely peaceful. I&#x27;m not joking. Both of these things happened.<p>I think it&#x27;s also important to call out what&#x27;s different between the two instances. The BLM protests were in response to a real, meaningful threat to the safety of a group of individuals. American citizens. There were real life body counts that were being fought against, and an attempt was made to renegotiate the role of policing in modern society.<p>The capital assault was over something that didn&#x27;t happen. The capital assault happened because the president has been fanning the flames of violence in America for four years. Seeding dissent. Destroying faith in governance and in the rule of law. <i>Simply because of the fragility of his ego</i> didn&#x27;t allow him to accept defeat.<p>I&#x27;ll come right out and say it, violence is never ok. It&#x27;s also not fair to equate the two of these situations.')
