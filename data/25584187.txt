The reality is though that you can still buy a brand new Harley today, for a relatively affordable price (starting at ~$7.5k). To be clear - I&#x27;m not saying we should outlaw motorcycles entirely... my point is that since I can buy a brand new loud motorcycle for funsies, neighbors noise complaints be damned, I should also be able to buy and operate a drone too. I&#x27;m all for new noise restrictions, but they should apply to everything.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I can put much stock in the frequency argument either... If you live in a neighborhood and 3 guys with motorcycles move in, you&#x27;ll be hearing them very regularly. Drones aren&#x27;t going to come any more often than delivery trucks do today, and they&#x27;re certainly loud enough to be heard, not even counting the extra wear on the local roads, and increased pedestrian danger.')
