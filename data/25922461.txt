Rust has so few libraries of significance that it still depends on C for security-critical areas like SSL.<p>&gt;it is literally impossible to write &quot;a small codebase focused on its key value-adds without distractions&quot; in a language that doesn&#x27;t have strings and requires you to build a dictionary from scratch<p>Strings are misunderstood, I&#x27;m not going to get into it here. My dictionaries in C usually clock in at about two dozen lines of code. The complexity doesn&#x27;t go away because your language does it for you.')
