I&#x27;m assuming then that phrases like &quot;celebrate diversity&quot; are frowned upon.\nEdit: I just wanted to add that having not grown up in a non-individualistic society these things feel very unusual to me. My comparison to fascism is a bit hyperbolic and not meant to offend, apologies all round. I&#x27;m leaving it instead of deleting purely for the sake of discussion.')
