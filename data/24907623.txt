Though the irony seems to have been lost on them that there is an evil corp called IOI in Ready Player One trying to seize control.<p>In any case, it was only a matter of time before this happened.<p>The thing that turned me off Oculus development actually happened around the same time as the release of the Quest, where they started to aggressively gate-keep what could come through the store, more so than even Apple&#x2F;Google with their respective stores.<p>You essentially had to pitch them a concept before they would give you approval to start building (this is still the case for Quest 2 I believe). Now, I grant you that it&#x27;s better to stop developers from wasting time and money if they&#x27;re never going to be approved, but I also object to being told whether I can install something on my device or customer devices (there are workarounds, but they are just that).')
