It&#x27;s so sad.<p>IRC used to be amazing, but nobody uses it anymore.<p>It&#x27;s attrition.<p>People got older, had kids, or tech to them simply became a dispassionate job. They didn&#x27;t have time for the community.<p>Facebook brought lots of new people to the internet. The sorts of people we connected to online became less technical in aggregate, and we started spending more time on our computers talking to those folks and proportionally less time talking to domain expert nerds. It&#x27;s zero sum.<p>Everything became hyper commercial. If you&#x27;re not making money, why do it? Why spend your time helping people build some other person&#x27;s commercial product?<p>The web turned into a proprietary monolith and stopped being cool. It turned into a job. Work at mature tech companies involve so much optimization of small product details that we grow tired of programming as a hobby and don&#x27;t want to sit through more of it at home. Your coworker is just there for the same paycheck that you get and they&#x27;re spending the evening zoning out and having fun. Why log onto IRC and chat about technical things when you have to come back and hear your coworkers talk about the great time they&#x27;re having?<p>The technical configurability of the past got glossed over with big shiny buttons and flat smartphone UI. It made configuring IRC clients lose its luster. We spend more time on our phones than our desktops or laptops now, anyway.<p>The proprietary platforms have orders of magnitude more money to make chat look and feel polished.<p>The new kids aren&#x27;t learning it. It doesn&#x27;t look like anything they&#x27;re familiar with. It looks old and feels crude. There&#x27;s nobody to carry the torch.<p>As more people leave, there&#x27;s less reason to stay.<p>RIP, IRC.')
