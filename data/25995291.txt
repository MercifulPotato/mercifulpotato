Many of your early skills are expiring, you don&#x27;t relate as well culturally with the younger devs at small shops, and you&#x27;re too expensive for well established companies (why pay you extra for your 20 years of experience when they can pay a freshly minted college grad half as much?).<p>- Consulting is an option, but you need a strong grasp of a specialty area, and you need to be able to understand business and people problems more than software problems in many cases (this is essentially the route my father took)<p>- Management is an option, but A: It&#x27;s not for everyone (My uncle is miserable).  B: it&#x27;s hard to swing a position in management without either taking a risky position at a very early stage company, working your way into it over several years, or having the right contacts within the industry to point you at new opportunities.<p>---<p>Personally?  My plan is to no longer be in the industry at 45 (I&#x27;m mid 30s now).  Ageism is absolutely real, and it&#x27;s fairly pervasive in the software industry (and if I&#x27;m being honest, a lot of society in general).<p>I have 15 years or so to plan, and I&#x27;ve been experimenting with a variety of things I think I might enjoy as a breath of fresh air - I recently registered a company as an agricultural nursery in my state (focused on landscaping plants with a small division set aside for locally popular fruiting trees&#x2F;bushes [blueberries, figs, stonefruit]).<p>I&#x27;ve also been doing hobbyist carpentry for several years, and I&#x27;ve recently starting taking commissions from family and friends (not really for profit yet, mostly to continue building skills and develop a network of contacts).<p>I&#x27;m also investing in property (Tax liens - not rental management or flipping).<p>---<p>My kids will be end of highschool by the time I hit 45, and I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;ll be recommending they attend college, so I plan to have expenses drop dramatically.<p>When I&#x27;m ready - I plan to have a frank discussion with my employer at the time about cutting hours in exchange for cutting salary, with the end goal being to transition income to my other activities.')
