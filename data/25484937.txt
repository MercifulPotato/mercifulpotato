Wouldn&#x27;t it be fair to have both ram speeds the same?<p>No it wouldn&#x27;t, because Apple is selling that as their supported configuration. If that crashes due to ram &#x2F; chip instability you can take it back to Apple to get a new one <i>with the expected performance</i>. That&#x27;s completely different from your homebrew ram overclock, if that config doesn&#x27;t stay stable, tough luck.')
