The judge is an ultra-conservative Bible-thumper family court guy (there are only 2 judges in the rural county, and they seem interchangeable) who doesn&#x27;t care about anyone and her attorney is a lazy, milquetoast, limp lasagna noodle who should be reported to the bar for malpractice. My mom is almost out of money and her ex is dragging her all the way to court and blocking every reasonable settlement. She won&#x27;t have anything left after this is over. The ex even muttered &quot;why did he do it&quot; under his breath because it&#x27;s costing him so much, like he has some sort of dementia mixed with regret going on. The kicker is he will eventually inherit millions of dollars, but my mom will die in abject poverty while he  quibbles about $100 of spousal support which is peanuts to him.')
