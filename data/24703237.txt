Females are social. Killing one of the small pigs will 100% grant triggering a vicious attack from their mother and aunts. Just running towards the children and allow the pigs an escape route would be a much safer move.<p>The tale looks much more like an excuse to explain having a lot of furtive hunting in the fridge IMO.')
