It will look cheaper than beef so it&#x27;s gonna sell more, but truth is beef costed 6&#x2F;kg to produce, poultry probably something around 0.5-1&#x2F;kg.<p>And that&#x27;s what really drives a change in habits in societies and economic system where free market is the only available choice.<p>It works much better and without all the friction that ethics or beliefs pose.<p>Next big thing is gonna be plant based food, because it&#x27;s even cheaper than poultry, it&#x27;s not evident if the plant is suffering or not (it&#x27;s easy to recognize a limping chicken, what about a peronospora on lettuce?) but you can sell it at the same price of poultry.<p>Even better, thanks to the small portions packaging, you can buy at the supermarket 250gr of salad at 1.50 euro in Italy (and that&#x27;s the price of the cheap one), which is 6 euros&#x2F;kg, avocados cost about 7-8 euros&#x2F;kg, but roasted chicken costs about 5 euros&#x2F;kg!<p>And it&#x27;s ready to eat!<p>That&#x27;s something we should also be careful about.<p>But we don&#x27;t.<p>&gt; that’s only if you let your cat out. Every<p>Not really.<p>But suppose we do all the time.<p>What do they eat then?<p>not their owners&#x27; flesh I suppose...<p>They eat <i>other animals</i><p>The meat you don&#x27;t eat is gonna become food for pets (cats and dogs have a special tendency to not care about humans&#x27; religions and eat meat to survive), it&#x27;s already happening, pet food is an ever growing market, which is already valued around 100 billion dollars and guess who is the primary segment for this market?<p>It&#x27;s the US with 40% of the global market.<p>Cats and dogs in US are already eating, today, in 2020, 30% of the meat produced.<p>It they were a Nation, they would rank 5th in the World for meat consumption.<p>When I talk about priorities, this is what I actually mean: how many animals can we save fighting the fur industry and how many by giving up on keeping pets confined in our houses?<p>(the irony, minks in a cage are considered a crime, a cat in an apartment that can never go out it&#x27;s caring...)<p>But nobody asks this question, because it&#x27;s an uncomfortable one and it would mean to actually face the consequences of our actions and rethink our societies from the ground up, instead we prefer as a species to &quot;Tilting at Windmills&quot; the same way Don Quixote did.')
