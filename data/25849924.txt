And as for resources? Asteroid mining will get you more water, minerals and metals.<p>But territory - terraforming might be really difficult or take too long. If aliens need an oxygen&#x2F;CO2&#x2F;nitrogen atmosphere and liquid water, Earth could be tempting, even if the plant&#x2F;animal life is useless to them.<p>If territory isn&#x27;t an issue, maybe we&#x27;d just be friends or anthropological curios.')
