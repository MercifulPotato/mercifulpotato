No longer memory-limited, the eZ80&#x27;s 16-bit registers have grown into 24-bit registers that provide a linear 16-Mbyte address space without a memory management unit (MMU). This capacity is greater than most competing 8- and 16-bit processors.<p>Code-compatible with the Z80, the eZ80&#x27;s new instructions support the larger registers. Other enhancements include a 16- by 16-bit multiplier with dual 40-bit accumulators. Operating at 50 MHz, the eZ80 isn&#x27;t as fast as most high-performance 32-bit processors. Yet it&#x27;s more than adequate for the control and monitoring environments it targets.&quot;')
