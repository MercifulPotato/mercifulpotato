My grandfather still plays the original Age of Empires, and when he finally upgraded to Windows 10, we found that the game would no longer run. Luckily at that point AoE: Definitive Edition was on its way, and he bought that when it came out, but it got me thinking about stuff that&#x27;s too recent for DOSBox but too old for modern Windows. It&#x27;s a shame that he had to re-buy the game when he still had the original CD for it because there was no way of running it in Windows 10.')
