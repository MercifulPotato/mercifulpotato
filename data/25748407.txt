This would be difficult and technically challenging to enact in many situations (what does it mean in the case of social networks for example?), And if there&#x27;s no competition we need antitrust ASAP<p>If <i>all</i> the competition are also deplatforming you, I think at a certain point it becomes fair to say that you were more or less democratically rejected, much like if every bar in town kicks out neo-nazis that&#x27;s not a failure of free speech but a success of the free market. But that relies on a large, healthy, robust competitive ecosystem which does not exist in a billionaire-dominated tech scene.')
