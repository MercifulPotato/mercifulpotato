There is evidence that anesthesia causes brain damage.  This shows up in the data most for babies and small children, and the elderly, where you can see it on IQ tests and chance of dementia.  It&#x27;s more pronounced with multiple surgeries.  It may be that it&#x27;s damaging everyone&#x27;s brains, but it&#x27;s just not as noticeable for adults.  One study with twins showed about a 1.5 point IQ loss from a major surgery.<p>Of course, 1.5 IQ points is not likely to dramatically change the course of your life, but I would absolutely not get it if the procedure could be done under sedation.')
