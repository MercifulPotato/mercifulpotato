It&#x27;s the most fantastic thing ever, let&#x27;s you have a complete control over the local revision history to undo anything you want.<p>I think Git is a real pleasure to use.  Personally, with git-reflog, I think it&#x27;s really difficult to mess up in a git repo (but, of course, if there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way).<p>I&#x27;ve worked with SVN on several repos and projects, and it&#x27;s the VCS I like the least.  It&#x27;s not intuitive at all, less shell-scriptable than CVS (how do you `cvs diff -r1.{1,2} file.c` in SVN?), less portable and takes more time to setup (e.g., effectively less UNIX).  I think the ViewVC interface is also one of the worst out of any other option out there, be that CVSweb or gitweb, both of which have a better usability, in my opinion.  SVN repository is also a 100% monolith, unlike CVS and even unlike Git (in Git, you can&#x27;t ignore individual files like in CVS, but you still can ignore unrelated branches for a checkout, for example, without the need to renumber the whole thing, which is a requirement in SVN if you want to get rid of any branch).  Basically, my personal opinion, is that the monolithic and inflexible SVN is just broken by design for any distributed and large project the size of a BSD.  It&#x27;s still puzzling to me why it was chosen over Git back in 2008, the same year that DragonFly did select Git as replacement for CVS.  If anything, with DragonFly project being smaller, they had less of a need for Git than did FreeBSD.')
