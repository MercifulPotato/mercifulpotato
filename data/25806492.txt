Itâ€™s been a while since I wrote a lot of rust code that needed more error handling. I used the error-chain crate like two years ago and was never really satisfied. The macro construct felt weird. I also split my application into binary and library part. I will check out these two crates for my next project because the code looked really nice. Except maybe the map_err cases. I dislike the need to manually wrap errors around. The error-chain crate had default into implementations and chain functions for the result type. But honestly I never got around to understand when to use what.<p>[error-chain]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;error-chain" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;error-chain</a>')
