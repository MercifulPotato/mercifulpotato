The optionality is wonderful and my team has really taken to it. My favorite part is that some of their work is asymmetrical, so if they need to run to the store during working hours--totally fine!--they just finish up their work later in the day. It&#x27;s really amazing what people will do when you tell them, &quot;sure, WFH, you&#x27;re an adult, I trust you to manage your time&quot;. And of course I&#x27;ve been very clear that if they we lose that trust, I will fire them :)')
