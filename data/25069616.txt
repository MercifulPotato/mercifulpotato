I&#x27;ve tried many times, but my explanations seems to mostly confuse people rather than enlighten them.<p>So let&#x27;s use the words of others instead, here is the best explanation I know about why the Clojure REPL rocks: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vvvvalvalval.github.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;what-makes-a-good-repl.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vvvvalvalval.github.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;what-makes-a-good-repl....</a><p>Short version is: you can send snippets of code to your REPL from your editor, and because of the common structure of Clojure apps, you can usually evaluate content in the middle of a function without having to change any code. Basically unlimited introspection into a running program.<p>I used to program in PHP, C#, Golang, Ruby, NodeJS&#x2F;JavaScript (both backend&#x2F;frontend) and some others, and no language comes close to the dev experience of Clojure. I&#x27;m sure other lisps are similar as well, but haven&#x27;t used anything else than Clojure substantially.')
