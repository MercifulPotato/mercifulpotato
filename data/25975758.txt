Shorting 140% of the stock increases supply by 140% and demand by 140%. It looks balanced, but there is an asymmetry in terms of pressure to close positions.<p>Those shorting shares have to pay interest, place collateral if price goes up and need to buy back those shares regardless of market price. The ones holding shares don&#x27;t have that pressure and their losses are bounded.<p>If options are used, the effect depends on how the price of the underlying moves. Generally they just have a multiplicative effect, the losing side has to increase collateral.<p>A particularity of shorted calls is that losses are unbounded.')
