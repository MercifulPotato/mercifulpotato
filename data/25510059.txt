Also caching of framework libraries off CDN&#x27;s and such.<p>This doesn&#x27;t save battery life on a device. If someone downloads a few meg of JS their browser has to parse and execute that JS locally. This use of processing uses power. If that same person had half as much JS to parse and execute it would use less power.<p>A CDN does not save from this happening.<p>When power use happens on a server it&#x27;s more on the server but less on devices with batteries. Batteries aren&#x27;t used up as quickly (both between recharges and in their overall life).<p>A server side setup can cache and even use a CDN to only need to render parts that change.<p>My points are that it&#x27;s not all cut and dry along with considering batteries.<p>Oh, and older systems (like 5 year old ones)... surfing the web on an older system can be a pain now because of JS proliferation.')
