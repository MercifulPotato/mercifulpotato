I thought you were saying that Searle responded to ”the system does understand” argument by saying “OK, but it’s still not conscious.” Now I think you are saying his response was “no, it doesn’t understand, it merely passes the Turing test; it can’t understand because it’s clearly not conscious.” Which again, seems to beg the question.')
