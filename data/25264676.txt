Some quick math tells me that to get 10x our current total energy usage in solar panels would only take 1% of the total surface of the earth, 3.4% of the land area and 56% of the Sahara. So just putting solar panels on deserts across the world and building a worldwide grid would be a much more feasible project than trying to capture directly from the sun. All those solar panels would cost ~13x our world yearly GDP so it&#x27;s not completely unreasonable either.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1B3Vtm-bk8NIntYc8mZRwcpikF-U2VkBDOLt8PaDjR1c&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1B3Vtm-bk8NIntYc8mZRw...</a>')
