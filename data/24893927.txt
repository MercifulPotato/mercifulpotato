I think that&#x27;s a thing that people seem to be missing: posts like yours seem to suggest that the only or main reason people live in SF is because their jobs are there and they want a short commute.  That&#x27;s... just not the case for many, many people.<p>I think there are valid arguments for leaving, valid arguments for staying, and valid arguments for moving in.  But it depends on each person&#x27;s individual situation and wants and needs.')
