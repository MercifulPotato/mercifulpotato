Before that, I played around with owncloud a bit over the years.<p>I&#x27;m now at the point where I&#x27;m trying to find a different solution. I don&#x27;t even use all the web UI stuff, but desktop sync is unusable to me now. It all started a few months ago when the new desktop client version came out, and would always crash when opening that new view. When it was updated on the server side, I started getting signed out every time I shut down one of the computers I&#x27;m using, which gets especially frustrating on the computer where I&#x27;m using two nextcloud accounts, because I have to log in, wait 30s because apparently there are bad logins from my IP (??), grant access, log out, log in with the other account, grant access again, and then do the same dance again on the next computer I start. And ever since I&#x27;ve been using it, I kept getting &quot;undefined states&quot; and weird database errors.<p>It just seems like they don&#x27;t do a lot of testing and focus more on features than stability. Any suggestions for a very stable open source service hosted in linux that does good desktop sync with a windows client?')
