Chicago and Detroit are thousands of miles away from where I live - what relevance is the murder rates in those cities to me? Someone living in Alaska would have to cover a quarter of the surface of the globe to reach Key West Florida...why would they feel impacted by the crime rate there?<p>Go look at a heat map of per-capita gun homicides in the US.  This is not a &quot;national&quot; problem. Communicating this has been very challenging for people who live in Chicago in particular - everyone thinks the entire city is a killzone, when in fact there are perfectly safe neighborhoods, and other neighborhoods that are a warzone. But if you were to only see the <i>citywide</i> statistics for Chicago murders, you wouldn&#x27;t even leave the airport.')
