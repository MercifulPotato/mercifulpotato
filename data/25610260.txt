Someone else also mentioned the &quot;sense of accomplishment&quot; feeling. While I&#x27;ve never thought about this before, I think it&#x27;s a pretty good one cause you can&#x27;t get it in any other way and certainly cannot pay for it. That probably makes it better than anything else if you can use it as a &quot;reward&quot; when building a habit cycle.')
