What would you say they are?<p>Early on, the problem was mirrorless were slow in autofocus, and they had relatively <i>terrible</i> EV quality. Now they have better autofocus than mirrorless, and more importantly, with the very high resolution EV displays they have now [1], what you see is exactly what you end up getting. You don&#x27;t have to guess about anything anymore, like what&#x27;s going to blow out, which is fantastic. What you see in an optical viewfinder with your eye is not what your sensor sees is going to portray. I don&#x27;t see any benefit to optical viewfinders at this point.<p>[1] 5.7MP OLED EV!: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bhphotovideo.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;product&#x2F;1494679-REG&#x2F;sony_ilce7rm4_b_alpha_a7r_iv_mirrorless.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bhphotovideo.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;product&#x2F;1494679-REG&#x2F;sony_ilce...</a>')
