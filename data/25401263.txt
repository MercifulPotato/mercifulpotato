The topic at hand is a <i>compliers</i> course.  ibains complains about a desire for qualified <i>IDE developers</i>.  It&#x27;s like complaining that your family doctor isn&#x27;t an orthopedic surgeon.  Why should a compilers course spend the requisite time for these highly specialized IDE algorithms?<p>Specifically.  What part of this course should be <i>removed</i> to make room for IDE-specific algorithms?  Or, would an advanced IDE algorithms course (with this course as a prerequisite) be a more sensible approach?')
