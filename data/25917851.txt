Item(by='jasode', descendants=None, kids=[25918890], score=None, time=1611679152, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25917251, text='<i>&gt;That said, because it&#x27;s worker owned co-op vs an investor owned business there is potential to actually build &quot;a customer centric company&quot; ;) This is bc unlike Amazon we aren&#x27;t under same economic pressures as a typical VC or investor owned company.</i><p>You&#x27;re right.  Your proposed worker-owned co-op still has economic pressure; it&#x27;s just a different <i>type</i> of pressure:  <i>It is financially constrained by workers&#x27; savings to contribute capital.</i><p>I made a previous comment about this:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11166080" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11166080</a><p>But that limitation is ok if everyone involved understands how it puts a <i>different financial risk</i> on creating a viable business.<p>So potential worker&#x2F;members would need to know what a realistic capital contribution would be.  $5000?  $10000?  And probably some &quot;sweat equity&quot; too.  E.g. a programmer that could earn $200k salary from a business maybe needs to work for free to help build the co-cop from nothing.<p>Therefore, a scenario is the programmers paying $5k into the business and with $0 income for several months to code the website, etc.  That would be economic pressure for many people.<p>Am I way off? What are your ideas to present a palatable (while also realistic) financial scenario to attract co-op members?')
