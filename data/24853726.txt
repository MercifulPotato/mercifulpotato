You have nearly a dozen comments where either I&#x27;m seriously misunderstanding everyone involved or you&#x27;re hell-bent on believing that any description of YouTube&#x27;s business practices must be a complaint that more things aren&#x27;t free.<p>E.g.:<p>&gt; Ancestor: [paraphrased] YouTube makes money by doing extra work to make a free service more painful to use and then charging to remove those annoyances.<p>&gt; You: [paraphrased] What makes &lt;ancestor&gt; so entitled as to think that you deserve the free service without the annoyances?<p>&gt; Me: [paraphrased] No, YouTube is definitely intentionally removing features from their free service and offering to add them back if you pay them.
