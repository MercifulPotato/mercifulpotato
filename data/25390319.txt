If it were, then we&#x27;d have all been using fusion power since the 1980s.<p>If you prefer a global approach as opposed to a US-centric approach, then consider the fact that the world consumes 60 TWh of electricity per day, or 2.4 TWh per hour. By comparison the entire world only produces 300 GWh, or 0.3 TWh of lithium ion batteries. And only a small fraction of that is used for grid storage [1]. These plans for intermittent sources as a primary source of energy are contingent on vast - 3 or 4 orders of magnitude at least - increases in the production of storage capacity. This isn&#x27;t something that can be relied upon. This is like pointing to Moore&#x27;s law and developing an application assuming a 4 THz  CPU is going to be around 10 years from now.<p>Lastly, I can&#x27;t help but appreciate the irony of complaining about a US-centric approach and cherry-picking Australia - a country with lots of undeveloped land and huge solar power potential - as an example. Like I said in my previous comment, the bulk of global energy consumption occurs in North America, Europe, and Northern Asia (China, Japan, Korea). These places have much lower solar potential between greater inclinations of the Earth and less amenable weather. And even with it&#x27;s natural advantages, Australia still only generates 7% of its electricity from wind and solar each.<p>By comparison, the US already generates 20% of its electricity from nuclear and several countries like France, Ukraine, and Belgium are majority nuclear generation. Nuclear is by far the best proven way of delivering carbon free energy, save for hydroelectric power but the latter is geographically dependent. It&#x27;s more expensive than fossil fuels, nobody denies that, but it&#x27;s actually doable with current technology. Its feasibility is not contingent on orders-of-magnitude improvements in key technologies. Using nuclear for the bulk of energy generation <i>has</i> been done by multiple countries, we merely need to walk in their footsteps.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energycentral.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;ec&#x2F;world-battery-production#:~:text=As%20of%20Dec%202019%2C%20the,40%20million%20EVs%20by%202028" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energycentral.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;ec&#x2F;world-battery-production#:~:t...</a>.')
