Cafes&#x2F;restaurants for take-out or delivery only.<p>* Other retail closed except for online or click&amp;collect contact free.<p>* Night curfew 8pm - 5am, relaxed later to 9pm.<p>* Maximum 5km radius from home unless for work&#x2F;medical care.<p>* Only 4 reasons to leave home: essential work, medical care, one person shopping once&#x2F;day, one hour of exercise.<p>* Masks whenever in public (not just inside).<p>Over time, some things got slowly relaxed. The curfew was changed when we got to the start of daylight savings. The radius was relaxed from 5km to 25km. A &quot;singles&quot; or &quot;intimate partner&quot; bubble was established, that allowed people to have one other person outside their household. Then two households were allowed to meet outside the home, but still masked.<p>At the same time, the government support included $150 if you were being tested and had to quarantine until the results (usually 24h). Then if you were positive or were a close contact and had no sick leave, then there were payments of $1500 for the 14 day isolation&#x2F;quarantine period.<p>The Federal government introduced Jobkeeper, which was a subsidy of $1500&#x2F;fortnight for businesses to maintain employment, and Jobseeker was an extended unemployment payment.')
