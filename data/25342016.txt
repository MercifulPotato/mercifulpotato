This is the first I&#x27;ve heard about limiting outdoor recreation to within 5 miles of my home.<p>I haven&#x27;t been notified about any of the details of any of the lockdowns.

Despite having just been in government custody, they didn&#x27;t even know the basics about things like social distancing, much less any more specific restrictions.<p>How are these things supposed to be effective when it&#x27;s so hard to learn about them?')
