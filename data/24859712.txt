I was more saying that I think one of their larger signals (that we know of) PageRank has some consequences in terms of presenting things like a well linked and referenced GitHub result as a top result instead of an actual striped shirt. They do a really good job of filtering out garbage but in terms of contextual relevance it doesn&#x27;t work out so well.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll also point out that it may not even be a modern PageRank fault but a consequence of learning to rank or some other major signal but it&#x27;s in line with what I would suppose to be the culprit.')
