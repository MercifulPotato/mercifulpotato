My point is that the laws on the books and the firearm homicide rate seem fairly loosely coupled, if at all.  If TX has loose laws, and CA has strict laws, and they&#x27;re about the same with regards to firearm homicide rate, I think it is fair to suggest that the original poster&#x27;s suggestion that &quot;knowing every person could be armed actually reduces issues&quot; may be faulty.')
