Now was it too extreme, for too long? Probably. Again we can’t know the counter factual.<p>Actually, while we can&#x27;t be precise about the number of deaths that would have occurred from doing nothing, we <i>can</i> use the number of cases as a proxy for that.  Since the case fatality rate (CFR) is correlated with the number of cases, it&#x27;s actually a pretty good proxy.<p>As to whether or not restrictions have been &quot;too extreme&quot; or gone on &quot;too long,&quot; I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a function of the number of cases reported in specific areas.<p>In some places where there has been widespread testing&#x2F;tracing, lockdowns have been eased when the spread has been significantly reduced.<p>In fact, NY state[0] sets specific case rates (IIRC, &gt;3% rolling average over seven days) in very small and specific geographical areas as a determinant of the need for specific, localized restrictions and increased testing&#x2F;tracing to limit the spread of the virus.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forward.ny.gov&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forward.ny.gov&#x2F;</a>')
