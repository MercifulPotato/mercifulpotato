You can overclock them just fine on AMD platforms.<p>That being said, unbuffered ECC DRAM, all other things being equal, probably won&#x27;t overclock as high since the extra memory chip places a slightly higher load on the memory controller than equivalent non-ECC memory. In that sense, you could consider it &quot;slower.&quot;')
