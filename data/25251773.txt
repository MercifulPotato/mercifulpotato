Of course, from perspective of  actually fighting climate change, the idea is beyond silly, but what really happens here is that you’re selling to people the <i>idea</i> that you’re doing it for the climate, you’re selling the feeling of doing good, and people can spend lots of money to feel and signal that. I applaud the  people behind the project, and my only worry is that stunts like these are going to distract from and remove the steam from efforts that actually push the needle.')
