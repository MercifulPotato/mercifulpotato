There&#x27;s a limited amount of money that will put into space, and it&#x27;s great that Jeff Bezos wants to spend a billion a year on it. It would just be great if there was more to show in return for that money. For example, Elon Musk claims SpaceX has spend about a billion on reusability for the Falcon 9. Just imagine such a leap forward every year.<p>Another reason Blue Origin gets a bad rep is that they don&#x27;t exactly try to play fair. As mentioned by a sibling comment, they tried to patent something (landing on a ship) that&#x27;s at best just common sense. When NASA wanted to lease LC-39A to commercial providers, Blue Origin tried to block NASA from leasing it exclusively to SpaceX on the basis that it&#x27;d be unfair to them, even though they hadn&#x27;t flown anything that could use the pad yet (and still haven&#x27;t). They landed their New Shepherd after a suborbital flight to 100.5 km just weeks before SpaceX landed their first Falcon 9 booster -- claiming to be the first to land a rocket propusively. That would be fine, except Bezos then tweeted &quot;Welcome to the club&quot; to Musk, ignoring the fact that orbital rockets are <i>much</i>, <i>much</i> harder (as evidenced by the fact that they still haven&#x27;t launched, let alone landed one, 5 years later).')
