I&#x27;ve heard other debunking comments that simply dismiss it as a video issue, and that is what grinds my gears.<p>Forgive me if I was a bit defensive in the before comment, but I did not make the claim that nothing was there. I made the claim that there were better explanations. It is important that we try to characterize arguments individually and not group as &quot;them&quot;. All that leads to is frustration and fighting. I&#x27;ll say it takes two to tango but we should all work on not stoking the flames. I think this is a big lesson we as a society need to learn from recent events.')
