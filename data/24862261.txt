Extend is when they improve it. Extinguish is when so many people prefer it that their improved version dominates the market.<p>That is &quot;Extinguish&quot; is not Microsoft <i>forcing you to stop using Linux</i> it&#x27;s Microsoft <i>making Windows so good that you no longer want to use Linux</i>.<p>Linux users think improving things so people like them is bad, because Linux has a culture where you have to suffer the difficulties as a hazing ritual to prove your geek cred, and if you like popular, convenient, easy, pleasant, non-technical, user-or-business focused features that&#x27;s inherently a &quot;luser&quot; attitude and a person to be scorned.<p>That is, people who run around the internet fearmongering &quot;Embrace,Extend,Extinguish&quot; are simultaneously criticising Microsoft for making software so bad that nobody wants to use it and losing market share and desperately clutching at popularist straws, while at the same time terrified that Microsoft will make software so good not only will it dominate the market, but they peronsally will find it irresistable and be unable to muster the religious willpower to stick with Linux when faced with the temptation of something better.')
