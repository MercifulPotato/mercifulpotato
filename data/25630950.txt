The idea behind unions is that an employer is not willing to lay off all the employees that are unionized (because this would lead to a sharp decline in productivity and thus KPIs). I consider how many products were scrapped by Google as quite some evidence that Google would be nearly as successful if it fired the unionized employees and continued working with some &quot;core team&quot;.<p>This does, of course, not mean that I endorse this reality, but when you negotiate, you better know what leverage you actually have.')
