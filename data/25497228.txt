Explain what you did and we can get it fixed.  You will make mistakes, we all still make mistakes.<p>That is what i always do and expect my coworkers to do.  Yeah we talk a little smack afterwards (only jokingly), but were able to resolve most self inflicted wounds quickly.  Nowadays what scares me more is a coworker who hides mistakes rather than one who confesses to them.')
