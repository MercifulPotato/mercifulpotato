I donâ€™t see the benefit of being about to do &gt;&gt;100mph outweighing the risks- earlier comment mentions how this arises from the need for useful torque bands in IC engines which explains a lot and makes perfect sense, but with modern engine controllers and especially electric I agree that this is no longer necessary to leave enabled in the vast majority of vehicles.')
