They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information.<p>It&#x27;s annoying when news websites report on research that isn&#x27;t reviewed. It&#x27;s been happening at an increasing rate over the last few years because these news websites are so hungry for advertising revenue. It undermines the public&#x27;s trust in science. It threatens our ability to do research openly and inclusively.')
