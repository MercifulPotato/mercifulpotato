The officials in this area behave exactly as you describe.  The difference in my situation is that, if there was concrete evidence of bribery at the planning office, it would be prosecuted and it would make headlines (just as the bribery case in the article did.)<p>Local governments that withhold building permits and corruption at PG&amp;E have become so politically contentious that the state government has had to repeatedly intervene.')
