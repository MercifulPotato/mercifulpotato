Very lucrative and highly unethical, and Google being part and parcel of this makes them look particularly bad. If anything Google should know what the right phone number for a business is, and if they can&#x27;t even get that right you have to wonder about the quality of their results in general.<p>Of course the page of the business or entity you look for should be the top result for its own search query.')
