Item(by='jancsika', descendants=None, kids=[24954005], score=None, time=1604159454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24951146, text='Debian has an escape valve from its fundamental spirit-defining policies even for non-free software. And if Debian didn&#x27;t have that policy wrt non-free, I could easily make a similarly general post as you did listing the very real dangers of shipping blobs, which probably carries more weight than the dangers of vendoring you outline.<p>So, why can&#x27;t there be a repo for the all the vendored things, and make a policy for the maintainers there?<p>By not having that escape valve, the pressure shoots out on the maintainers-- in this example the maintainer&#x27;s work is made impossible as evidenced by the statements of the previous maintainer that it would take two fulltime devs to package this according to the current policies. So you encourage burnout on your volunteers.<p>This also encourages passive aggressive software design criticisms. Look at the very first comment here that shifts to talking about the &quot;maturity&quot; of the software under discussion. I&#x27;d be willing to bet I&#x27;d see similar flip judgments on the list discussion of this-- all of which completely ignore the monstrous build systems of the two browsers that Debian ships. So apparently there&#x27;s an escape valve for exactly two packages, but no policy to generalize that solution for other packages that are the most complex and therefore most likely to burnout your volunteer packagers.<p>Keep in mind you are already on maintainer #2 for this package that still <i>does not ship</i> with Debian because shipping it per current policy is too burdensome. Also notice that you&#x27;ve got a previous maintainer on the list-- who already said this is a two-person job at least-- calling out the current maintainer for being lazy. It seems like a pretty lousy culture if the policy guidelines put policy adherence above respect for your volunteer maintainers.')
