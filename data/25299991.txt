The M1 is the lowest performance, lowest end Mac chip Apple will ever make, and it’s already knocking on the door of premium Intel and AMD chips. Not the super-premium, highly multicore stuff like threadripper, buts it’s a lot closer than anyone expected in single core.<p>To me, this means that when Apple consciously goes after the high end desktop market, they are likely to overshoot in exactly the same way M1 overshot the mid range mobile space. That could put Apple’s high end iMac chips in Mac Pro territory anyway.')
