Clinton was behind after the night of the election in 3 states that she needed to win, by amounts ranging from about 0.25% to 0.7%. That&#x27;s comparable to where Trump is now in the 4 states he needs to win.<p>She conceded the morning after the election.<p>You really think Biden would be more like Trump than like Clinton in this kind of situation?')
