I went over to r&#x2F;WSB earlier today to see what the fuzz was all about, and all of the posts there remind me exactly of the content that was being posted in cryptocurrency subreddits a few years ago. Posts about having bought high and intending to hold. To me when I see this I think, how many of these posts are people that are trying to hype up others to put money in, so that the people that are hyping the others can get out. And I think the answer is a lot. And the rest of them are people caught up in the hype. But the hype cannot last, it never does.')
