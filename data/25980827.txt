The plotting library is it&#x27;s own stand alone module, and there is a `plot` function which accepts an arbitrary number of arguments.  This is how the app is able to plot multiple graphs at the same time.<p>Using tuple&#x2F;list for points&#x2F;lines makes it easy to plot points and lines at the same time, with a single function call, without any nasty keyword arguments.<p>For example<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; plot((0,0), (1,1), [(0,0),(1,1)])<p>The other reason was it makes the code a lot nicer in some places.  I tried using a keyword argument at first and there was a lot of additional logic to keep track of.')
