Here in Italy it happens all the time. When such skewed filter is removed, futurism appears as the embodiment of a troubled and exciting phase, one of those moments in history in which huge changes were in the making and tradition was a burden to leave behind. One could also imagine Marinetti&#x27;s disappointment about yesterday&#x27;s heroic future turning into today&#x27;s dull present, in which technology often works against humanity rather than empowering it. His faith in the technological future clashes badly with today&#x27;s permanent fear and the consequent recrudescence of religion and stale tradition.')
