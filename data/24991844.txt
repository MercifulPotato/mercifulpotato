When I started, I used it to find out where to go to look for birds and what birds to expect once I got there.  It also is an excellent listing tool, and listing in eBird helps you identify by knowing what&#x27;s likely to be seen.  As you get more into it, you&#x27;ll be really glad you kept early lists in eBird.  Push past the registration, it&#x27;s worth it!')
