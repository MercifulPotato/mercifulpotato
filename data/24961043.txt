Someone who has grown up speaking Hindi cannot reliably converse with someone in Bangla, Sambalpuri, or Tamil. If anything, the word &quot;dialect&quot; is overused regarding India – Bhojpuri [2] was often mentioned as a dialect of Hindi; but as a fluent Hindi speaker I cannot claim to understand or have a fluid conversation with someone speaking Bhojpuri. I am glad that it is at least <i>sometimes</i> referred to as a language now.<p>----------------------------------------------------<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;international&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2016&#x2F;01&#x2F;difference-between-language-dialect&#x2F;424704&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;international&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2016&#x2F;01&#x2F;di...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bhojpuri_language" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bhojpuri_language</a>')
