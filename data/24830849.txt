Paraphrasing is stating your interpretation of what you&#x27;ve heard and mirroring is reflecting back exactly what the speaker said. I didn&#x27;t break down the two interpretations in this post to keep it simple, but from what I&#x27;ve learned and read, mirroring is especially useful in more vulnerable &#x2F; emotional conversations. You want to help the speaker feel seen as they are, without placing any judgment on them (and your interpretation is a form of judgment of what they&#x27;re saying). Paraphrasing helps in making the speaker feel heard, but it&#x27;s more useful in driving clarity.')
