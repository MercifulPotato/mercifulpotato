Item(by='tyingq', descendants=None, kids=[25855648, 25856012, 25856015, 25857031, 25860192], score=None, time=1611204766, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25854992, text='<i>&quot;Please be gentle with me.&quot;</i><p>That guidance wasn&#x27;t needed, really. It&#x27;s refreshingly free of trendy design, and straightforward to use. And other things, like the ads not being in the way of the content.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve got a list you&#x27;re working on, but what&#x27;s there looks great.<p>One minor suggestion...there are some paths that lead you to a &quot;muscle not found&quot; page, like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musclewiki.com&#x2F;Barbell&#x2F;Female&#x2F;Calves&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musclewiki.com&#x2F;Barbell&#x2F;Female&#x2F;Calves&#x2F;</a>.  Some way of preventing landing there in the first place would probably be more intuitive.  Like a popped hint when you hover over a calf if Female&#x2F;Barbell is pre-selected. Or some semi-transparent overlay to suggest Calves can&#x27;t be selected, etc.')
