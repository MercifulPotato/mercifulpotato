Only in hindsight has it been glaringly obvious how egocentric tech workers are. High paid, wielding incredible power, and the praise from their managers&#x2F;peers just reinforces delusions.<p>Try doing a hard days work in a skilled trade such as woodworking, electrical, or HVAC. Now that&#x27;s humbling. It also exposes you to many different people and types of thinking, which IMO, promotes healthy self perspective. Echoing here even on HN just amplifies the dilemma.')
