Zoonotic origin is the source of the majority of viruses:<p>&gt; Approximately 60% of the known infectious diseases and 75% of the new emerging or re-emerging diseases infecting humans came from animals. SARS-CoV-2 is the latest addition to the seven coronaviruses found in humans, and experts said that all of these viruses either came from bats, mice, or domestic animals.<p>&gt; More so, bats are the source of the Ebola virus, rabies, Nipah ad Hendra virus infections, Marburg virus disease, and influenza A virus.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencetimes.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;26492&#x2F;20200717&#x2F;covid-19-update-coronavirus-has-zoonotic-animal-origin-scientists-explain-why.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencetimes.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;26492&#x2F;20200717&#x2F;covid-1...</a><p>&gt; An estimated 60% of known infectious diseases and up to 75% of new or emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin (1,2). Globally, infectious diseases account for 15.8% of all deaths and 43.7% of deaths in low-resource countries (3,4). It is estimated that zoonoses are responsible for 2.5 billion cases of human illness and 2.7 million human deaths worldwide each year (5).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5711306&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5711306&#x2F;</a>')
