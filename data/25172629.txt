Perhaps it&#x27;s time to ditch the fuel excise tax entirely, and tax all drivers based on (vehicle weight * kms driven * some constant).<p>If you want to tax fairly based on road wear, you have to tax by axle weight to the 4th power * distance driven.<p>That said, there&#x27;s a pretty simple solution that doesn&#x27;t send the same &quot;we are punishing EV owners with an extra tax&quot; message: have a road usage tax for everyone, and slightly decrease the fuel tax.<p>But please, PLEASE, keep most of the fuel tax. Climate change is a real, urgent issue, and everything that encourages change away from fossil fuel should be kept.')
