There are trade offs.<p>I&#x27;m not gonna try and say that it should replace containerized applications (I would choose those 9 times out of 10 given the choice). Unfortunately, there are cases where there isn&#x27;t a choice or Lambda is still a good choice (like maybe the grandparent&#x27;s image resize thing, probably depends on a lot of things).<p>I tend to think of a Lambda as a custom piece of cloud infrastructure. So, in addition to unit tests, I just test them like I would any other Terraform module. I use Terratest to deploy a stack containing the resource under test and a surrounding harness. In this case, maybe the Lambda, a source bucket, a destination bucket, a DLQ, logs, etc. Then execute my test cases, poll for results, do assertions, etc. When it&#x27;s done, Terratest destroys the stack.')
