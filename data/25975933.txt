But it is besides the point. OP was making generalizations regarding people of &quot;privilege.&quot; I respectfully disagree. I feel that you find dishonest people in all walks of life. More importantly, I think this type of prejudice and &quot;demonizing the other&quot; is quite damaging to our society. &quot;Privileged&quot; is such a vague, subjective basket to throw people in. Who&#x27;s privileged? Anybody who has something (physical or abstract) you don&#x27;t? Let&#x27;s attack ideas not people.')
