Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25667621], score=None, time=1609991534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25664936, text='Some things that people feel strongly about may not &quot;resolve&quot; according to reason.  That you&#x27;ve only ever been inside your own mind (with it&#x27;s processor, and its model, which is derived from its &quot;lived experiences&quot;) might have had some influence on how you believe that other people think.  But if you look at what&#x27;s going on around you, does this seem likely?  The question then is: it is it that these people just(!) &quot;aren&#x27;t reasonable&quot;, or might there be something else going on?  I don&#x27;t doubt it&#x27;s partially true, but what is <i>really</i> going on in other people&#x27;s heads is unknown to you and me.<p>&gt; by what alternate means do you propose we find and determine how to correct them<p>A reasonable thing to do would be to perhaps ask people what their problem is.  Funny thing is though, it seems like this reasonable idea hasn&#x27;t occurred to any &quot;reasonable&quot; people, as far as I know anyways.<p>A more ambitious approach would be to perform a comprehensive and careful examination of the other styles of thinking &amp; belief systems that are out there.  When you read threads like this one, do you get a strong sense that a large percentage of the people in here have actually done that?  I don&#x27;t, perhaps because I&#x27;ve actually done just that, at least do a large degree.  I <i>know</i> that 75%+ of the people in here are running largely on heuristics, likely combined with some first hand experience (perhaps with a side order of confirmation bias), and likely plenty of consumption of &quot;proper, trustworthy journalism&quot;, written by people who are also running on heuristics.<p>Very few people have a very good knowledge of how the mind works, and almost no one seems to have <i>excellent</i> knowledge, including things like edge case behaviors.  Another thing you may notice in culture war threads like this one is the lack of curiosity&#x2F;uncertainty&#x2F;humility - but you may not notice it unless you are consciously looking for it.  That&#x27;s another thing about the mind:  it&#x27;s not so great at seeing things that aren&#x27;t there, or knowing things that it doesn&#x27;t know.  I believe that this is a partial cause for the perceptions of omniscience that are always on full display in threads like this.  Ironically, omniscience is a fairly <i>reasonable</i> perception for a neural network like the subconscious mind - after all, how do you reason about data that is not in your model?<p>Such things can be learned, but why would one go to the effort of learning something new if you already know everything worth knowing?  That would be <i>unreasonable</i>.<p>As for the general utility of using reason as an approach to our problems - HN is surely an above average intelligence forum.  The conversation that&#x27;s going on in this thread (and the many others like it that occur on a regular basis), is this what &quot;reason&quot; looks like?  And if people on HN can&#x27;t even manage it, how reasonable is it to expect joe sixpack to pull it off?<p>And so I shall take my downvotes, and we will repeat this same process tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and eventually we will all reach our expiration date and our children can continue this process, and then pass it down to their offspring - <i>The eternal circle of life</i>.  Well, eternal, provided another nation who doesn&#x27;t suffer from this cultural affliction doesn&#x27;t rise to power and ruin our party that is.  That would be a real bummer.<p>PS: Sorry for being a dick.  <i>It&#x27;s in my nature</i>.')
