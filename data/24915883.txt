You catch a  <i>virus</i> . In this case it is Sars-CoV-2 . The virus causes a disease. In this case Covid-19.<p>So , how this ladders up (in my understanding at-least is this): People can catch the virus irrespective of Vitamin D levels. The virus can and will replicate in the body. The Vitamin D levels in the body <i>determine</i> the severity of the disease in the said body. This all feels intuitive but I am conscious that immunology is where intuitions go to die so someone please correct me if I am wrong :)')
