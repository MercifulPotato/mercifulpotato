Of course both figures are drops in the bucket compared to the Corporation&#x27;s revenue. I don&#x27;t know if that &quot;half and half&quot; nature is coincidence, an internal directive, or necessary to maintain their tax-exempt status, but it&#x27;s pretty consistent.<p>For-profit entities can, of course, lobby and sit on standards bodies just fine. We certainly see plenty of that behavior from the other vendors.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the Foundation is worthless or that people shouldn&#x27;t donate to it, just that they should know what they&#x27;re paying for and what they&#x27;re not.')
