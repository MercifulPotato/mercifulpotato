You&#x27;d need <i>disposable</i> income to double for the effect to be neutral (probably a bit more because even poor people deserve a bit of indulgence now and then). As it is, poor people are more sensitive to housing inflation. Even if wages and home prices move up in lockstep (which they haven&#x27;t) they&#x27;ll take more years to save up enough for a down payment. That&#x27;s why so many remain permanent renters, denied the equity and tax advantages of home ownership and putting them at even further disadvantage.<p>So yes, the point about inequality damn well <i>is</i> relevant. Anyone who wants to pretend they know about statistics should know that distributions matter as much as averages and medians.')
