You&#x27;re acting irrational.  Where&#x27;s this anger coming from? What can I&#x2F;we do to help?&quot; would it subdue the flames and vitriol that exists on social media?  Maybe. I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s worth a try.<p>What I suspect would be better would be to pick up the phone and call that person and say those things.  The release of venting verbally with a person who is understanding and prepared to accept the venting is likely significantly more productive and healthier than over text.<p>Then again, 99% of the time, we don&#x27;t even know that persons name, much less their phone number.  Therein lies, I think in part, the crux of the problem: I&#x27;m a tribe member who is able to throw stones at a member of a different tribe without immediate or clear consequence.')
