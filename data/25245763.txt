The problem with political discussions is that every person (or every side) is actually debating something else.<p>That said, there are three common contexts to &quot;bringing up the wrongs of the past:&quot;<p>1 - It&#x27;s a counter to traditionalist&#x2F;revivalist&#x2F;restorationist sentiment and&#x2F;or mythology. In this case, the myth is that all freedoms come from and are rooted in the infallible founding. Any change is a corruption or a regression and reduces freedom.<p>The true history is that abolition happened first in the empire. The moral change which made the term &quot;freedom&quot; applicable in any meaningful sense came from outside the empire. The conclusion (should be) exactly what you laid out.
