Look at their list of demands. It&#x27;s indeed a red scare because they are really, really red. For example, refusing to work with the defence industry - which country in the world would benefit most from a damaged US&#x2F;European military? China!<p>We can see what kind of union this is by the fact that:<p>1. They aren&#x27;t going to try and bargain collectively<p>2. Their announcement claims Timnit Gebru was fired and that was terrible, instead of the obvious truth that she said made obnoxious requests and said she&#x27;d resign unless she got them, then was told &quot;OK, we accept your resignation&quot;. They&#x27;re a brand new organisation and they&#x27;re <i>already</i> misrepresenting reality.<p>In other words it&#x27;s going to be nothing like the IBEW or whatever. It&#x27;s yet another left-wing campaigning organisation, pretending to be a union to try and make the members un-fireable no matter how nasty they become.')
