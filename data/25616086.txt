How do I know that? Because when I look at who the actual users are who make these votes, and I see they were, for example, commenting on HN about Julia in 2015, the odds that they are a communist plant round to zero. This reality is so absolutely remote from what comments like yours are insinuating that it&#x27;s hard for me to believe that people are willing to go there. Yet here we are, with spies in every closet and foreign agents under every bed. The only word for this is cartoonish.<p>The truth is that this is a very large, very international community, with millions of users having all sorts of backgrounds and views, and they disagree on divisive topics like China. That is the extremely mundane—albeit emotionally charged—reality of what is going on here. Accusing people who hold different views of being spies and foreign agents is the fastest way to poison the community, so we don&#x27;t allow it, especially when there isn&#x27;t a shred of anything resembling evidence to support it.<p>This entire dynamic is determined by tribal identifications on both sides. That leads people to hate and ultimately want to destroy each other. That&#x27;s not compatible with the value of this site, which is curiosity. People can&#x27;t be curious with each other and want to destroy each other at the same time—the nervous system doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>If anyone wants more explanation, there are arbitrary amounts of it at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=astroturf%20by:dang&amp;sort=byDate&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=comment&amp;storyText=false&amp;prefix=true&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=astroturf%20by:dang&amp;sort=byDat...</a>.')
