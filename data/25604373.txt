Please make it more normal. Would love to actually read it.<p>Specifically,\n- Don&#x27;t start pages with no content above the fold. If I have to scroll before seeing any meaningful text, it sucks.<p>- Don&#x27;t suddenly navigate me away from what I&#x27;m reading because I clicked a button 5 seconds ago. Button clicks to navigate should be instantaneous.<p>- Don&#x27;t change what page I&#x27;m on by scrolling. Scrolling should be scrolling, not page navigation.<p>For. The. Love. Of. God. Please don&#x27;t build websites like this.<p>Love the idea! Hope it improves so I can share with all my math entrepreneur friends. ;-]')
