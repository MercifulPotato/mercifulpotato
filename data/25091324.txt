For my last free trip we went to Hong Kong and Tim Lancaster was piloting, so I got to meet him - enjoyably, everyone affectionately knew him as &#x27;Tim out the window&#x27;. He gave me a harrowing account of the whole experience, worst of all was trying to tilt his head backwards so he could breathe.<p>Also interestingly, as we were approaching to land in HK, we suddenly started gaining altitude again and ended up doing a lap round the island because, &quot;The runway was busy&quot;. Tim later confessed to me that he&#x27;d hit the wrong button and withdrew the approach flaps.<p>They also regaled me with stories of the old HK landing strip that involved flying so low through the city, you could see into people&#x27;s rooms, shortly before banking hard to the right when you saw a giant chequer board on the side of a mountain, and landing.<p>I then spend a week going out every night in Hong Kong city with several plane loads of Airline Stewardesses. That&#x27;s another story, but suffice to say, I was very lucky 24 year old boy.')
