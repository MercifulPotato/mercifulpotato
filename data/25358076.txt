Item(by='rramadass', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607519292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25356931, text='&gt;I feel like reading books that have no relationship with my job (software engineer) is a waste. Do any feel the same? Is this a harmful mindset and should stop worrying about &quot;wasting&quot; my free time?<p>This is very harmful to your &quot;intellectual growth&quot; and you should break out of the mindset that everything you read should be oriented towards your job and career only. Something from the book <i>The 7 habits of highly successful people</i> which i had read a long time ago stayed with me. There is a concept of P <i>(for Production)</i> and PC <i>(for Production Capability&#x2F;Capacity)</i> mentioned in that book. P is what gets you a job in the present time since you are employed to &quot;Produce&quot; something for the Company immediately. However your future growth, both professionally and personally depends on how well you cultivate your &quot;Production Capability&#x2F;Capacity&quot; so as to take advantage of whatever the future might throw at you. This is why expanding your mind and intellectual horizons by reading on widely different domains is so important. Don&#x27;t limit yourself by reading only job&#x2F;career related stuff. Go outside your comfort zones and expose yourself to various ideas and concepts. Life is much more fulfilling that way.<p>One thing to note is that you don&#x27;t read all books cover-to-cover. You skim and jump back-and-forth to quickly identify the gist and essentials. Only then do you sit down for serious study of the identified sections. Also don&#x27;t try to remember everything you study; only the essence&#x2F;core is to be assimilated, for everything else keep a mental bookmark so that you know where to look for when you need the details later.')
