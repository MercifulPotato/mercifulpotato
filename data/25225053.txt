Item(by='freedomben', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606443301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25224885, text='When she was five years old (late 80s&#x2F;early 90s timeframe), my sister propped the lid up on the washing machine, and jammed a toothbrush into the safety switch so it would run thinking the lid was down.  She thought it looked really cool and pretty.  At one point she decided the vibrating was cool too.  She got up and danced on the top of the washer.  Being that soap gets slipper when wet, and kids don&#x27;t always have the grace of a gymnast, she slipped and landed feet first in the washing machine.  It&#x27;s not every day the emergency room get to body cast a five year old kid with multiple femur fractures.<p>The grotesqueness aside, I do loath the pendulum swing we have toward safety these days.  It&#x27;s so bad now that it makes things worse in a lot of cases.  I have to dick with my phone for navigation (which requires a lot more looking away and danger) because my car won&#x27;t let press a couple of buttons while it is moving in the name of &quot;safety.&quot;')
