From my experience I think the main problem is that developers often don&#x27;t like to work with &quot;legacy&quot; code, where legacy means anything they didn&#x27;t write themselves. Also, \nmost developers tend to drastically underestimate the cost of a full rewrite as they don&#x27;t know all the intricacies of the old system. From the outside most systems seem easy and straightforward, so people think they should be easy to rewrite. During the rewrite people then discover all the little edge cases that the legacy system handled and that they didn&#x27;t think about.<p>There are legitimate reasons to rewrite a system in a new language, it&#x27;s not a a decision that should be taken lightly though. From a business perspective it&#x27;s also very expensive, as having a team of 5-10 developers rewrite a system that already exists and works can cost millions of dollars, so you should have a really good reason and clear ROI objective when deciding to do this.')
