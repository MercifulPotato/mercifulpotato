The drivers can see the tip before they accept the order.  So if they see no tip, they will reject it.  Eventually you&#x27;ll probably find a driver that will bring you your food, but it will take a lot longer, and that driver is going to have to drive a lot farther to bring your order (depending on how many drivers rejected you ahead of them).')
