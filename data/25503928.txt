Must. Vote. This is extremely infuriating but it’s even more maddening that we as a country, voted for this. We voted for our representative. We voted for what they stand for. There’s no one to blame but ourselves (even though you didn’t “directly” vote for them, we still bear the brunt of the decision, that’s how a democracy works). But I’m honestly hopeful that voters will get wiser as the current state of technology becomes a commodity. The thing that does concern me, is the irreversible damage that will take generations to heal.')
