For sure. Are a lot of them bothered seeing homeless people because they&#x27;re no longer used to it? For sure. Do a lot of them vote against policy that might alleviate poverty because it&#x27;s easier to judge the empoverished from a distance? For sure. But I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the fundamental motivator for people to move.<p>Everyone needs an Oasis. Some people find it in the stacks at the library, some in their own bedroom and some on 1&#x2F;4 acres of manicured lawn and bushes.')
