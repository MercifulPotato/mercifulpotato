From BitTorrent, we took the scaling properties of peer-to-peer: downloads get faster rather than slower as more people join the network. From Git, we took mutability: the original publisher can add or modify data while peers can keep a full history for auditing and preservation. Dat is unique in the rapidly growing area of decentralized web, blockchain, and other cryptocurrency projects. It was the first in the field with a public interest focus.<p>This is a very simplistic view of it. You may want to check out the link I posted instead, and of course you could dig deeper from there.<p>A similar project to it would be IPFS.')
