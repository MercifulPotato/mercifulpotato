I found it because it&#x27;s named the same as his stackoverflow page which is a very unique identifier with the same uppercasing on specific letters.<p>- Another doesn&#x27;t believe there were famines under Mao (we were discussing the Wiki page on it) and calls it propaganda. This was from a Uighur emigrant.<p>- Another agrees fully with the CCP ocean territory claims in the SEA that take basically all the oceans to the west of Philippines etc.<p>- Another thinks China can&#x27;t be a democracy because the logistics of over a billion voting are too hard<p>- Another left HK early on because of disdain towards the democracy protests (long before attacks on mainland businesses)<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re right that there&#x27;s heterogeneity there (that almost goes without saying and is true of any group of people) and a public vs private distinction but that doesn&#x27;t contradict what I&#x27;ve said.')
