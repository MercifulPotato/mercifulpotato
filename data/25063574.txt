Something like that will genuinely benefit more from a highly optimised ASIC than anything else.<p>The use case is obviously huge, and you don&#x27;t see the elephant in the room: money.<p>Putting all those drives to even a cheapest Xeon around, increases the price n-fold over the price of the flash, unless you talk about multi-terabyte scale SSDs.')
