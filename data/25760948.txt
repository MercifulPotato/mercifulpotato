I&#x27;ve been finding myself asking people to be &quot;clear, not clever&quot; with usage of some of the sugar, whereas previously adopting new syntax hasn&#x27;t been so much of a challenge.  It&#x27;s definitely a balancing act between being easy to read and causing the reader to have to context switch while reading.  Most of the sugar in C# hits all the right spots though.<p>I have no doubt that some of this newer syntax is clever, and very welcome to many, but not everyone will realize that it&#x27;s far more beneficial in the long term to cater to the common denominator.')
