I&#x27;m not trying to be facetious. I think the distinction between marginal and fixed costs is important here because it&#x27;s all about the feedback loop for aggregators. And one can think of marginal costs as &quot;friction&quot; in this loop.<p>That being said, perhaps aggregation theory won&#x27;t be complete until Ben considers fixed costs in addition to marginal costs, which I believe might be your argument?')
