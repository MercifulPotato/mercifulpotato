This is something that can only be answered by a societal discussion and hopefully some democratic way of decision.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is what you&#x27;re trying to do, but it sounds a bit you want to imply that because there&#x27;s no objective measurements of &quot;fairness&quot; we shouldn&#x27;t even try.<p>FWIW I think your question doesn&#x27;t give me enough information to form an opionion, because the tax should depend on needs of the authority that does the taxing (e.g. if there&#x27;s an obvious lack of healthcare in a country that causes many people to die needlessly - that&#x27;d be a good reason for higher taxes).')
