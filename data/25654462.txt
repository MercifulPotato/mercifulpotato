It&#x27;s been on my backburner for years as well. I have the book and started to take the edX course a couple of years ago, but got sidetracked with work. I e-mailed Peter Van Roy back in May, asking if the edX course would be resumed. He stated that the local university course got removed from the engineering curriculum, so that&#x27;s why the edX course isn&#x27;t running anymore. Hopefully it comes back. He mentioned that he had recorded some lectures on his YouTube channel.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edx.org&#x2F;course&#x2F;paradigms-of-computer-programming-fundamentals" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edx.org&#x2F;course&#x2F;paradigms-of-computer-programming...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edx.org&#x2F;course&#x2F;paradigms-of-computer-programming-abstraction-and" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edx.org&#x2F;course&#x2F;paradigms-of-computer-programming...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;PeterVanRoy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;PeterVanRoy</a>')
