I realized that I naturally intermittent fast, because it seems to work the best for me. Normally I eat my last meal of the day ~ 8pm, and nothing but coffee, tea, or water until 11am or 12pm the next day. The only time I eat something in the mornings is if I&#x27;m doing a workout or something active early in the day. Occasionally I&#x27;ll feel hungry and eat something, but otherwise, I normally feel sluggish and slow if I eat breakfast. For my other meals, I actually eat a ton of food, around 2,500 calories on average.<p>On the flip side, I know multiple people who have tried the same and have your exact experience. Oddly enough, three of them had tried keto and had great results where I personally didn&#x27;t. I know there&#x27;s no real correlation there, just thought it was interesting. Try keto maybe?')
