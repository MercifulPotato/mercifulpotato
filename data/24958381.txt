In the past things like homosexual acts were criminal acts. Is it fair to disenfranchise people because of this? Likewise is it fair to disenfranchise people who were locked up for minor&#x2F;petty drugs use which is now legal in various states?<p>It’s not something easy to agree with, I sometimes have a hard time agreeing with it for especially severe criminals, but being able to vote regardless of criminal history is key to preventing a dictatorship emerging and passing laws to lock up people they disagree with&#x2F;supress dissidents&#x2F;ensure only their supporters can vote. Yes I realise this seems all very rhetorical. Until it isn’t.<p>Sure, you could just wait for the people to revolt against the dictator, but why not put systems in place to avoid it in the first place?')
