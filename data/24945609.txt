If they are compelling and it&#x27;s something I was unsure of anyways, I&#x27;m willing to accept that my current view may be flawed. OR if at the end of the conversation the other persons arguments were uncompelling or even disproven during the conversation, then I feel better about my current view of the topic.<p>If someone doesn&#x27;t want that conversation, then it doesn&#x27;t happen. I don&#x27;t strap someone to a chair with toothpicks under their eyelids. I reserve that when getting people to watch my short films!<p>Edit: Conversations about differing&#x2F;opposing view points isn&#x27;t always about changing minds. It just helps to get to know someone. If someone tells me they are vegetarian, I don&#x27;t launch into why I&#x27;m not. However, I will make the mental note to not ask them to join me for dinner at the local steak house. If I want to have dinner with them, it helps me plan an appropriate place that they would be okay with as well.')
