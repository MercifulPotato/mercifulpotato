Lectures are fine, but you don&#x27;t really grasp the little details needed to do a proper job until you have messy datasets, very large datasets, have to deal with text in a non-english language, etc.<p>That&#x27;s the most useful stuff in my opinion. Courses and lectures include sample data that don&#x27;t really put you in the position to having no option than optimize your workflow because your box can&#x27;t deal with it in a reasonable time.<p>Or when you go crazy because you can&#x27;t perform some analysis because something somewhere is wrong and your debugger can&#x27;t help you, and you just want to punch someone in the face.<p>That&#x27;s how I discovered that cleaning and preparing data is about 90% of the job, avoid CSV for non-numeric data and use SQLite instead, when possible, the god-send of Knime, etc.')
