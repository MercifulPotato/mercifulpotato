You can, of course, hang on for longer by being paid from research grants. However, even that is tricky because the size of a &quot;standard&quot; modular NIH grant hasn&#x27;t gone up in ages and even a modest salary ($60k + benefits) will now eat up a substantial chunk of it, so you&#x27;ll spend a lot of time looking for money. Frustratingly, you often can&#x27;t be the PI on grants either, so it devolves into ghost-writing. It also makes it hard to settle down if you are piecing together a string of 1-2 year contracts.<p>This is, IMO, stupid. It&#x27;s not good for doing science and a few studies have shown that not good for training scientists either. A system that funded a few more staff scientists would likely produce more and better research and training.<p>[0] It&#x27;s even worse, as many awards for tenure-track profs are ALSO gated on time-since-degree.')
