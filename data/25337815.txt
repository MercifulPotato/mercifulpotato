I do hope we see more services crop up, and new methods for people to encrypt email outside of specific services, maybe better plugins for Thunderbird or something, hell I&#x27;d easily pay for such a plugin if someone else can communicate back and forth with me through it and it is encrypted. Maybe even some sort of forward secrecy involved in the system.')
