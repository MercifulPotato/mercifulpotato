His agenda is pushing so-called alternative medicine. When you dig in just a little and do some research on him you will find a lot of reasons to question his assertions.<p>In his studies, it is true that he tells people he is giving them a placebo. He also tells them that it can still help them. This is not really an &quot;open label&quot; placebo as people still have the expectation that it is some kind of treatment and will help.<p>I also find it interesting that the placebo effect only helps with subjective conditions, such as pain and nausea. No placebo will set a broken bone or seal a laceration.')
