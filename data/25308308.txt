Of course the suggestions come from an honest place, but often the verbalized outputs do not live up to the epistemic standards we would like to hold ourselves to.<p>I think perhaps I should less say &quot;do this&quot; and instead more say &quot;here is my experience, and my current theory about that experience, and what I&#x27;m trying to do to improve&quot;.  Or perhaps even &quot;I wonder if...&quot;.<p>It turns out that I had to re-write this comment to follow my own advice, and I think in this case it was in fact helpful, at least for me.  That&#x27;s pleasing.<p>As someone who has many opportunities to give advice to people 20 years younger than me, I&#x27;m doing a lot of &quot;well, I used to think X, and now I don&#x27;t, so a similar evolution may happen to you&quot;.
