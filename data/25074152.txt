But thanks to a comment above I&#x27;ve moved my _sync folder back to Dropbox and use Maestral as my Mac Dropbox client and it&#x27;s been working great for the past 18 hours or so.<p>I switched _sync back because Alfred and other apps warned that using iCloud Drive for sync doesn&#x27;t work great because it doesn&#x27;t always update properly, and I&#x27;ve found that to be the case.')
