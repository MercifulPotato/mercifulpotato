I would like to see a system where no one is censored at all, but certain categories are suppressed below default public visibility. i.e. politics and things tangentially related to politics to be treated as NSFW tags. One tier above spam. Still viewable by those curious, but not elevated to current prominence. Ultimately a system like western TikTok, the default category is vastly apolitical content but you have to search for fringe partisan issues, and those issues are siloed from the greater user base.<p>&gt;I find it disturbing that people have stopped supporting free speech when they stopped liking its content.<p>I think the issue is the current system seems to be pushing content people would usually avoid. My position is pro-censorship, it&#x27;s pro-moderation &#x2F; curation &#x2F; or suppression if we&#x27;re being less charitable.<p>&gt;I refuse the premise that we tech workers know best and therefore must protect the fragile little minds of everyone else.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the tech workers job to decide how to protect, but to implement protection based on what&#x27;s good for mental health and not dark patterns for monetization. There&#x27;s studies on the effects of social media out there, people are fragile. Current social media feels like it exist in pre traffic regulation and seat-belt era of safety. Not just for users, but for society.')
