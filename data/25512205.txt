The shelters are full of less popular breeds and mutts. Also a ton of dogs with health problems. Usually they are neglected and have been abused constantly making them much harder to adopt.<p>I would estimate that at least half of the people who own dogs really should not. All of the aggressive, anxious, barking, fighting, and crying dogs I walk past just drives me nuts.')
