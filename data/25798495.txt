Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=[25798548], score=None, time=1610756342, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25787745, text='There was a recent post here that suggested that Einstein&#x27;s first wife was much more involved in doing the science for which he became famous than she was given credit for. They wrote the papers together and published under his name because that was the thing that had some hope of working.<p>It took two attempts to come up with proof of his hypothesis and these two attempts happened years apart. The first attempt to photograph the sun during a total eclipse occurred during World War I -- known as The Great War at the time -- and one of the teams was arrested. The other failed to get good photos due to bad weather.<p>Although there are two solar eclipses and two lunar eclipses most years, total eclipses aren&#x27;t common and occur several years apart. IIRC, there were six teams trying to get photographs the second time and only one (or maybe two) succeeded). There was no war on but weather was again a factor.<p>Einstein himself was not on any of the teams that took the photos that were seen as proof of his theory.<p>Scientific breakthroughs are frequently a team effort while one person takes the lion&#x27;s share of the credit and ends up with the big name recognition. And I sometimes wonder how often it&#x27;s kind of like <i>Pinky and The Brain</i> where the real genius of the show is actually Pinky but he never gets any credit.')
