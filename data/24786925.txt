Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602757393, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24784400, text='&gt;You can even do all that stuff online by SSHing a much better computer.<p>I pay 20€ per month to &quot;SSH&quot; into a worse computer and by &quot;SSH&quot; I mean I effectively do VNC over WebRTC. The video encoding performance of cloud servers is just abysmal. I&#x27;m forced to use 720p. Meanwhile my desktop can easily run 8 1080p VP8 streams at once without breaking a sweat. How much did it cost? 350€ for a Ryzen 2700 with 8 cores, 32 GB RAM and a new mainboard. I&#x27;m not counting the cost of the case or PSU because I already had those and there are super cheap options already. After 1.5 years (or 2 years if you include case, psu, storage) the server will have cost me more even though it performs far worse. Why would I still pay for the crappy server? Because it&#x27;s a shared user experience. I&#x27;m not the only one on that server. My friends are there as well.<p>You know. If I actually used Stadia or Nvidia&#x27;s alternative  I&#x27;d be their worst customer. I&#x27;d run their dedicated GPU instances all day even if the only thing I do is listen to music with that instance while I&#x27;m playing games on my desktop.')
