This is going to be true across all platforms of non-trivial scale (eventual consistency + batch jobs).<p>Second note: the number of people who actually do this is very low (a few a year, of hundreds of thousands of developers). The blog posts are scary, but in my ~five years at Firebase, I&#x27;m pretty sure we refunded every one.
