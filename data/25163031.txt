We don&#x27;t pay especially generously, but we do all make a living and we&#x27;re satisfied with our income.

We have a business. It&#x27;s a small business, but a viable business nonetheless. Our business is growing more slowly than the typical VC-funded software startup that we commonly associate with tech businesses in $CURRENTYEAR, but it is profitable and growing nonetheless.')
