Google&#x27;s result used a <i>programmable universal</i> quantum computer for a specific task; the point of the experiment was not just to show that it can do this specific convoluted task faster than classical supercomputers, but also to show how powerful the quantum computer they&#x27;ve built is and how well they can control it. What they then did is go on a publish a dozen papers of running many other algorithms on it (of course, for those algorithms the quantum computer is not yet powerful enough to show advantage).<p>On the other hand, the device used in this experiment is a single-purpose non-universal sampler with very limited applications.')
