ERHS is highly-ranked, especially so for a public school that is not a full magnet (it has a magnet STEM program that makes up a portion of the student body but otherwise draws from the surrounding neighborhoods). It&#x27;s quite strong academically, and several of its alumni have returned to give back to it. And, generally-speaking, it&#x27;s customary for highly-successful Americans (and especially those that become public figures) to give back to their high school and college alma mater.<p>It&#x27;s a little disheartening that the immediate assumption is that &quot;he might not have fond memories&quot; or that &quot;it could be throwing good money after bad.&quot; I assume that this is because the school was described as &quot;majority-minority.&quot; ERHS students have their pick of desirable internships with the likes of NASA and the USDA, and regularly sends alumnae to Ivies and the Intel ISEF. It&#x27;s not exactly an intellectually-stifling environment. We can&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going through Brin&#x27;s mind, especially as he&#x27;s never publicly discussed the subject, but we can certainly look at how his behavior compares to others, and I think HN&#x27;s disregard for that in favor of a kneejerk negative reaction is shameful (if not unexpected).')
