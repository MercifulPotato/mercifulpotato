Friend of mine used to play DOOM deathmatch with his housemates at uni back in the 90s.<p>One of them was really good at designing levels but really terrible at the game, so he&#x27;d always hide the BFG somewhere that obviously only he&#x27;d know about so that he could go and grab it and then wipe out the other players relatively easily.<p>The others quickly got wise to this and, of course, DOOM was really easy to mod. For example, changing sound effects was simple: you could just overwrite them with different sound files on disk, I believe. So what they did is replace the sound that played when somebody picked up the BFG with the full length theme from The A-Team. DOOM didn&#x27;t have the most sophisticated sound engine by today&#x27;s standards, but it did have directionality, and sounds did get quieter the further away the source, and louder the nearer it was.<p>So the upshot was you had early warning that the guy had picked up the BFG and could either avoid or sneak up on him as appropriate. Apparently this used to really annoy him.')
