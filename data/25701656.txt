It could be possible the call recursed &quot;only&quot; 10,000 times and didn&#x27;t blow up any stack.<p>Or perhaps you&#x27;ve only used good macros. But it is incredibly easy for a macro to end up with (+ 0 x) where you think it will end up with &quot;x&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that you have used a macro that ended with (+ 0 x), the optimizer turned it into &quot;x&quot; and you got the tail call eliminated <i>but were not guaranteed</i> to get that, and it may blow up on another Scheme implementation.<p>That&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t like about it; The compiler definitely knows if it did TCE or cannot, and it <i>does</i> change program semantics if it did or didn&#x27;t. So why can&#x27;t I just annotate the code saying &quot;well, I intend this to TCE, please complain if you can&#x27;t?&quot;')
