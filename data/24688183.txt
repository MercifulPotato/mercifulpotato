At the time I had been having a decade of upper back pain that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.  At one point it was so bad I could hardly get out of bed.  At that point I went to an osteopath, on the recommendation of a physician friend of mine, and he gave me some isometric exercises for my neck, and the pain was instantly gone.<p>I&#x27;m not kidding, if he&#x27;d dome some slight of hand with chicken parts, I&#x27;d totally believe in that psychic surgery crap.<p>But before that, I created a mount for a laptop and second monitor that would clamp into my bicycle maintenance stand (Ultimate Support Classic), and I could rotate the arm around to bring the screens to a comfortable location.<p>The biggest problem I had was that there was very little arm support.  I could rest part of my forearm on the chair&#x27;s arm rests, similar but less so than what the article has.  Maybe in his case that&#x27;s fine, but for me it was like holding my arms out in front of me at a 45 degree angle and after maybe an hour it was pretty painful in my shoulders.  I probably would have added some additional armrests to it if my back problems hadn&#x27;t been solved and I decided to abandon it.<p>I was happily using a Thinkpad keyboard with trackpoint at the time, so the mouse issues didn&#x27;t impact me.  One could also imagine a counter-weighted mouse, with the weights hanging off the back, via a pulley sort of system.<p>I also found being entirely static for hours at a time wasn&#x27;t that comfortable, and that sort of &quot;bucket seat&quot; really doesn&#x27;t lend itself to anything but one position.<p>Maybe a decade after that, I tried another experiment that worked pretty well.  This one I guess I&#x27;ll call a &quot;lounging desk&quot;.  I got a nice leather club chair with ottoman, and a big, heavy entertainment center that I put to the side of it.<p>On the top of the entertainment center I had my laptop and one 30&quot; monitor, and then a monitor arm holding another 30&quot; monitor.  This was in front of a window so I could look outside.  I could swing the monitor in front of me, and the club chair allowed me to sit or recline or curl up, lots of different positions.  This was actually a pretty nice setup, and if I hadn&#x27;t shortly after that moved jobs to an at-the-office setup, I&#x27;d probably still be using it.<p>These days I find switching between sitting and standing to be very comfortable.')
