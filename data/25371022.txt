Why <i>wouldn’t</i> you think this? We’re the only beings capable of <i>so</i> many things that others can’t even begin to comprehend. Even if you think other beings are <i>capable</i> of achieving certain higher tiers of life (or however it is you define “special”), we’re the only ones that actually can; of course we’re special. So yeah, <i>is</i> it ethical to consume the literal highest level of evolution and dominance of life we’ve ever seen?')
