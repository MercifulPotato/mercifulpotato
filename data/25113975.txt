You are a point tracing some path in space over time. That’s how we experience it. But zooming out and looking at the path itself, you are not really a point (moving through space and time), you are a curve in space and time.<p>I’m not trying to talk about ideas of self or anything. Just that the same thing can be described in two ways: as a low dimensional thing changing with respect to another dimension, or a slightly higher dimensional object that just is.<p>Viewed as points changing over time, a solution to the grandfather paradox would be a remarkable coincidence, with <i>everything</i> happening to match up <i>exactly</i> as it had.<p>Viewed as curves in time, a loop is just a loop. There’s nothing remarkable about a circle. You don’t look at a circle and think “gee what a remarkable coincidence that this infinitely fine path crosses itself perfectly. You just go “yup, it’s a circle.”<p>Neither of these is a better picture than the other. Everything (things described as 3D things) does move in time. Everything (described as 4d things) just exists.')
