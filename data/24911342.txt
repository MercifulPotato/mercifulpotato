The best advice I can give is to not get in over your head.<p>Emacs and Org are the best combo for me because of the near infinite flexibility they provide... but that power, if tapped too early, will cause you to spiral into configuration hell and burn you out.<p>There’s also the temptation to look at other configs and copy stuff into yours. But I’ve found that most people have configured Emacs&#x2F;Org to match <i>their</i> brainwaves. What I end up with after copy-pasting my way through a config is a Frankenstein’s monster. It doesn’t <i>feel</i> right.<p>So, I’d advise patience. First step is to learn some basic Emacs like file editing (I used Evil-mode from the start to make this easy). Maybe setup auto save of files if that’s important. And get familiar with Org syntax. There are IntelliJ&#x2F;VSCode plugins that do highlighting if you want to practice in a familiar environment.<p>After that, practice what you can do with Tab and Ctrl-c (C-c). There are a surprising number of features with these two keys. Hide&#x2F;expand, header tagging, table reformatting, etc.<p>I stopped here for years and found it very useful.<p>Learning Elisp (beyond basic configuration), the agenda, roam&#x2F;deft, capture templates, table formulas, Babel, export, etc. will come as you need them afterwards.')
