That you can write code when given a spec. That&#x27;s great, but that&#x27;s insufficient for what they are hiring for.<p>What it doesn&#x27;t tell them:<p>- Can you elicit clarity on a vaguely stated problem? These are conversations that top engineers have with their business counterparts and other technologists constantly.<p>- Can you iterate with another person on a solution. The whiteboarding exercise is a dialogue, and while contrived, problems are often solved in joint manner like that.<p>- How do you do under pressure? Something is going wrong and it&#x27;s affecting millions of users. Can you carry your weight when the team is fire fighting?<p>Obviously the whiteboard isn&#x27;t perfectly correlated with the above, but it&#x27;s as good an indicator as I can think of. Saying &quot;just let me write something off-line&quot; means people are oblivious to these other key attributes. FAANG devs aren&#x27;t earning 300K a year for just being able to write code on a spec.')
