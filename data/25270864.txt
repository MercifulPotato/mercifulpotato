We&#x27;re not taking over the world overnight, but we are steadily growing.<p>From a business perspective, data sovereignty and end-to-end encryption seem to be really potent differentiators for certain market segments, especially government. To wit, the French government has a massive Matrix deployment under the name &quot;Tchap&quot;, and the German military began rolling out a similar initiative called &quot;BwMessenger&quot; last month: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esut.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;meldungen&#x2F;24138&#x2F;matrix-messenger-fuer-die-bundeswehr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esut.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;meldungen&#x2F;24138&#x2F;matrix-messenger-...</a><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum you&#x27;ve got Mozilla, who replaced their IRC network with open, federated Matrix and saw greater far greater community engagement as a result.<p>October also saw a commercial entity (Famedly.com) begin sponsoring the development of a third-party homeserver implemented in Rust (Conduit). So we&#x27;re starting to see glimmers of a potential ecosystem around the Matrix protocol independent of Element.<p>We don&#x27;t have the same pop culture buzz as Slack or Discord, but I absolutely think there is something of substance here.')
