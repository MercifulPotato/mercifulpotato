Requiring them to publish everything their users post would be what&#x27;s called &quot;coerced speech&quot;, which happens to be single biggest no-no of the legal concept of freedom of speech.<p>Forcing someone to say something against their will is considered far worse than preventing someone from saying something they want to say.
