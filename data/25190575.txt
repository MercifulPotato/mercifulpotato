It&#x27;s a fairly low power drive. WD has been making their own controllers, &amp; they have a history of being fairly power friendly. This is a very new drive too. This review[1] shows it using 2.62 watts during a large file copy and on-idling at 0.96 watts.<p>The best drive shown is a Crucial MX500, using 2.32 watts during cpy and 0.52 watts at on-idle.<p>There will be some additional power consumption from the usb adapter too but i&#x27;d expect no more than 0.2 watts.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tomshardware.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;wd-blue-sn550-m2-nvme-ssd-review-best-dramless-ssd-yet&#x2F;3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tomshardware.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;wd-blue-sn550-m2-nvme-s...</a>')
