I disagree emphatically with that position.<p>Denying the Holocaust = bad<p>Tiannemen square protests = good<p>Making these decisions is not impossible and saying we just can’t decide does not track with me as a valid argument.<p>People can tell the difference between Tiannemen and terrorism when you give them the info to do so. You don’t need to show someone nazis and Holocaust denial so they know it exists.<p>I understand the position you take, so don’t be so condescending about “well what would a Chinese person think”. You’re entirely missing my point.')
