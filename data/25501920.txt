Item(by='Viliam1234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608601186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25491436, text='&gt; There are also many people who take offense to the term lower&#x2F;lesser functioning<p>As I understand it, the problem with using the expressions &quot;lower &#x2F; higher functioning&quot; is that it evokes the idea that problems of people with &quot;lower functioning&quot; are a strict superset of problems of people with &quot;higher functioning&quot;.<p>In reality, it&#x27;s more like there is a set of symptoms, and some people have a larger random selection, and some people have a smaller random selection, so it is possible to be &quot;higher functioning&quot; but fail at X, or be &quot;lower functioning&quot; and fail at everything but X. So the &quot;higher&#x2F;lower&quot; is more about how much your specific set of symptoms disrupts your life, but it doesn&#x27;t imply which symptoms are present or absent.<p>But people who see the &quot;lower &#x2F; higher functioning&quot; as two sets of symptoms will judge you by presence or absence of one specific symptom.<p>(Also, with some symptoms, how much they disrupt your life depends on what environment you live in.)<p>&gt; Autistic twitter is quite the landmine for semantic wars of this sort.<p>Twitter seems to evoke the worst in people in general. The explanation I wrote here would almost certainly be also considered highly offensive by someone.')
