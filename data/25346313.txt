Despite the fact that I&#x27;m a leftist, I do see lots of misinformation coming from the left, and I&#x27;ve seen leftist facebook groups that quickly devolve into memes about killing landlords or other extremist drivel.<p>&gt; I happened to read a BLM post on Medium once, and I now get a daily email of several blog posts that are at least as delusional as the above beliefs about how all white people are not just racist, but fundamentally and immutably racist.<p>Although I agree the left can spew out all kinds of BS, the difference here is that your example is <i>lukewarm extremist content</i> at best. This kind of content paints wild ideas but does not contest reality or directly incite weird actions. Here&#x27;s some examples of what I mean:<p>* (contesting reality) My family member who reads GNews will sometimes randomly start conversations with absolutely out-there tidbits of misinformation like &quot;oh my god, did you know JFK Jr is still alive? I just saw a video that proved it&quot;<p>* (inciting actions) My family member who reads GNews went out of her way to acquire HCQ as a &quot;just in case&quot;, and also tried to convince family members in China who had a fever (unconfirmed covid) to take it without even seeing a doctor. At some point she considered taking HCQ as a preventative for covid despite being being at nearly 0 risk of exposure (never going outside)<p>&gt;  I often wonder if politicians and forum&#x2F;media commentators are completely oblivious to this notion, or if they are aware of it but have some sort of a &quot;the ends justify the means&quot; thing going on.<p>I strongly suspect this is the case.')
