Item(by='samatman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609959805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25657642, text='The author of Frink takes particular pride in doing unit maths <i>correctly</i>.<p>For example, if the conversion between two units is defined by statute to be some weird ratio, Frink will use that, and not merely the best f64 approximation of that ratio.<p>As indicated by a sibling comment, Frink also handles interval maths, and in general it just has a remarkable amount of features, being a fully-fledged programming language.<p>It&#x27;s a pity it isn&#x27;t open-source, the author says he doesn&#x27;t want the aggravation of having to deal with pull requests and so on, and just wants to work on his software project on his own. Which, ok, that&#x27;s fair: but at least Lua and SQLite don&#x27;t accept contributions from outside the team, so there&#x27;s a model for releasing open-source software without having to collaborate with the general public.<p>No question that it would increase the size of his inbox though, so I get it.')
