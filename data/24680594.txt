Item(by='johnchristopher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601831669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679154, text='I can&#x27;t answer to the comment that got flagged so here&#x27;s what I wrote (sorry for the murder of the English language):<p>&gt; I was working for a regional public agency but as a contractor not as a civil servant. My job was budgeted and paid for by a a higher up federal&#x2F;state agency (country level).<p>&gt; This job was part of a broader state program to bring some specific skills to some lower agencies and ease the connection between agencies (on a networking level and on a per project basis level).<p>&gt; This year, that regional public agency was supposed to be absorbed and merged into a sister regional public agency. All those agencies are managed and run by politicians (public sector). So I got my end of employment paper at the beginning of the year, kept on working for three months and then I was supposed to be transfered&#x2F;rehired - still as a contractor - to the new agency (which is in the same building, do the same work, with the same people, it&#x27;s just label shuffling).<p>&gt; Except one week before that I got a call from one of the cronies to let met know that they had budgetary problems and rather prefer to use the budget to pay someone who is already there. That person being - ohohoho - the best friend of our new agency director. It&#x27;s a public agency, they don&#x27;t bump into budget problems in march. I cost them 0 bucks because it&#x27;s financed by another state agency. And yes, that person was severely lacking the necessary skills to do my job and to follow up with the current projects.<p>&gt; I alerted the higher up agency, they didn&#x27;t take it well at all because the budget was also used to pay for certifications (which the friend of the director should retake), there were some projects at their level where I had the networking and relationships needed and really they didn&#x27;t like that the lower agency got rid of one of their element like that and that the lower agency thought they could whatever they wanted with `my ` budget. They don&#x27;t like ton invest into people for years and see them go, whatever the reasons.<p>&gt; To be honest, that program was on shaky legs but I was one of the good elements. From the people at the top of the chain (remember I am talking public sector, I went to the highest point) I was told that they had done everything so that our team wouldn&#x27;t be unemployed in the middle of a pandemic. They had budgeted things so that we didn&#x27;t lose our job in very difficult times. That&#x27;s why I use the word `robbed`.<p>&gt; So now the whole program is scraped, that director&#x27;s friend is still on half time and the lower agency has a hard time getting their project&#x27;s budgets approved by the higher up agency.<p>&gt; And I find a new job, half time though, and I am starting tomorrow so I got that going for me.<p>&gt; But I am really bitter because I loved that job and the projects were really specific and I was fast tracked at some point to be fully employed as a public servant by the higher up agency which would have meant a much stable life and perspective to buy&#x2F;build a house, have a baby, etc.<p>&gt; So, that&#x27;s how it works.')
