I&#x27;m all for used video game retailers. GME happens to be a pretty crappy one. But they are one that has availability of used games when a console isn&#x27;t fashionable anymore. Got max payne for $4 and vanquish for under 8 a few months ago. (PS3) Sony is stopping their online store for the PS3. (Go figure)<p>&gt; Also, GameStop would sell a used disc for $55 while a new disc was $60. Because they get 100% of $55. Then their associates HEAVILY pushed used on gamers who donâ€™t give a shit and just want to save 5 bucks.<p>Where&#x27;s the harm? Their ability to sell it for $55 is capped at the total stock they have. Dev companies can print near unlimited amounts of copies for a low price.')
