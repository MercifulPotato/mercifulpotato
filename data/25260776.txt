You start a new project and you have a Gemfile.<p>2. This Gemfile is where you define your top level dependencies very much like a requirements.txt file. You can choose to version lock these dependencies if you&#x27;d like (it&#x27;s a best practice), but that&#x27;s optional.<p>3. You run `bundle install`<p>4. All of your dependencies get resolved and installed<p>5. A new Gemfile.lock file was created automatically for you. This is machine generated and contains a list of all dependencies (top level and every dependency of every dependency) along with locking them to their exact patch versions at the point of running step 3.<p>6. The next time you run `bundle install` it will detect that a Gemfile.lock file exists and use that to figure out what to install<p>7. If you change your Gemfile and run `bundle install` again, a new Gemfile.lock will be generated<p>8. You commit both the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock to version control and git push it up<p>At this point you&#x27;re safe. If another developer clones your repo or CI runs today or 3 months from now everyone will get the same exact versions of everything you had at the time of pushing it.')
