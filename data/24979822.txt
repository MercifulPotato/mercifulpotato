However it seems that people now days mean for inflation to be about price increases rather than money supply inflation (increases). The money supply inflates and deflates. Prices increase and decrease.<p>I think it would be best if we all start being more clear and specific when talking about &quot;inflation&quot;.<p>Printing money DOES automatically lead to inflation. It leads to inflating the money supply or MONEY SUPPLY inflation. However printing money and inflating the money supply does not necessarily lead to price increases or price inflation. Most of us care about price increases, which are a symptom, but not allows present, of money supply inflation&#x2F;printing money.')
