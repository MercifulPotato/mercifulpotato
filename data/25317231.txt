Coming up with a film like Mank in 2020 is nothing short of miraculous. (Yes, it&#x27;s a film, it&#x27;s not a documentary, it can tweak facts if it needs to).<p>While I was watching it in awe, gleeful at the <i>I don&#x27;t have the time nor I will spoonfeed here, if viewers don&#x27;t know the references nor what we&#x27;re talking about, that&#x27;s their problem</i> attitude, I couldn&#x27;t help wondering what fraction of potential audiences today could possibly get it.<p>Just the sequence where Oldman and Seyfried as confidants, roam utterly extravagant San Simeon&#x2F;Xanadu&#x27;s gardens in an ethereal evening after this politics&#x2F;business&#x2F;class faux pas of the Brooklyn mistress... That&#x27;s the old magic of the moving pictures, people. This one tells you why Citizen Kane happened (that&#x27;s spelled out in that sequence BTW). It doesn&#x27;t have to be accurate, only tell you the story, and this it does beautifully.')
