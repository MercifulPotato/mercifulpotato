It also isn’t appropriate for multivariate testing and just isn’t going to be understood by most users anyway.<p>There <i>are</i> way to do this in a decent way, but you have to do it within the application using your own logic.  The change log provided by the platform is inadequate.<p>&gt; If you don&#x27;t put anything about new features, don&#x27;t be surprised when users don&#x27;t use them (because why would they know)<p>If you need to tell your users about new features in the App Store change log, then you’ve already failed because almost nobody sees it.  Users know about new features because either a) it’s obvious when you use the application, or b) you tell them about the new features somewhere they will actually see it, at an appropriate time.<p>&gt; or complain what something &quot;breaks&quot; (or just changes on their workflow) because your changelog communicates nothing.<p>A change log does not prevent this.  You are attributing a lot of power to the platform change log that it simply does not have.')
