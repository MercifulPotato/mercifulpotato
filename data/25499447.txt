This is an important difference, since the submitted title here implies they were entirely wiped out.<p>It looks like this company raised ~$250M, and sold for $230M. This isn&#x27;t any sort of nefarious &quot;founders got wiped out&quot;; they sold for less money than they raised and this is the typical outcome in that situation.<p>Also, from the article:<p>&gt; As part of the deal – which will see ServiceNow keep Element AI’s research scientists and patents and effectively abandon its business – the buyer has <i>agreed to pay US$10-million to key employees and consultants including Mr. Gagne and Dr. Bengio</i> as part of a retention plan.<p>This is the kind of &quot;everyone got wiped out but the founders got an out-of-band parachute&quot; that highlights an often-understated difference between &quot;founders&quot; and &quot;just an employee&quot;. Even with a terrible outcome, founders and top executives can still manage to come out on top, and only employees <i>actually</i> get wiped out.')
