Adding noise does not anonymize data sufficiently. If your traffic monitoring software adds gaussians to car speeds, you can still average over multiple reports about two cars to identify their respective average speeds. Those can be used to determine whether they are trucks or cars, etc.<p>In neural networks, weight changes do carry meaning. If your network has particularly large updates for the horse recognition neuron, you likely watched horse pictures. If it has updates for handbags, you likely watched pictures of them. If the company averages over all your submissions, the noise will be less relevant and the handbags and horse pictures will eventually show up.')
