Anything about Java is probably going to be largely neutral or negative, while a piece on Common Lisp might be much more positive, even though Java is a far more successful programming language in most ways.<p>I don&#x27;t think that this bias is a bad thing. It&#x27;s nice to read about cool technologies that you might not use in your day job. But anyone using HN to decide on the right tool for a project should carefully consider other sources of information as well.')
