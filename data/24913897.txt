Ending death entirely seems a bit less plausible; even a person who doesn&#x27;t age can still die by accident, and I&#x27;m not sure how the probability of any person experiencing such a random accident can ever drop to zero.<p>My optimistic view is to look at self-awareness as a very surprising thing that doesn&#x27;t make any sense.  As far as we know from biology, I should be basically a biological robot that can use its brain to solve problems but without any real sensation, just reaction to stimuli.  If self-awareness isn&#x27;t an emergent property of complex biological machinery, maybe it isn&#x27;t entirely dependent on it either.  I can&#x27;t imagine how self-awareness would work without a body or a brain to connect to it as an interface, but perhaps there&#x27;s more to souls than is apparent and maybe those do last forever in some form.')
