Item(by='sirn', descendants=None, kids=[25346895], score=None, time=1607441581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345699, text='I have $4,000 audio setup (Sennheiser HDV820 + Sennheiser HD800) and honestly a $500 Sennheiser HD650 plugged directly to a 3.5mm adapter sounds way more fun in everyday use. The exponential quality curve only goes up to certain point and beyond that it&#x27;s all about the sound characteristic (HD800&#x2F;S is good for classical&#x2F;jazz) and how much the manufacturer is going charge for it.<p>That being said, I still use AirPods Pro a lot more than both HD800 and HD650 due to convenience of using it even though the sound quality is way worse. Fidelity isn&#x27;t really much of a concern when I&#x27;m doing something else with background music.<p>I&#x27;m very excited about AirPods Max.')
