Like putting all of your game logic directly in untestable Monobehaviours and writing total spaghetti code. For me, the most useful thing that Unity docs or tutorials never taught me is that your complex logic shouldn’t necessarily be in the Monobehavior itself. If you instead put logic in plain C# classes that implement interfaces it becomes far easier to test and mock game logic. I’ve seen people having to manually test things like running out of ammo by clicking 30 times because they had the logic in the Monobehaviour and they couldn’t unit-test it.<p>If you use Microsoft’s DI Extension it gets even easier.')
