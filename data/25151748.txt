If your software is paid, your revenue generally scales with your user base, so you can go full time on the project, or even start hiring people to help you. Also, since your revenue comes directly from your users, you want to listen to their requests and align your software with them. You can&#x27;t just release an overnight patch pissing most users off, because you will feel the monetary loss right away.<p>Except, these days, people expect consumer software to be free.
