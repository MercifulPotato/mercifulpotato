I have zero interest in anyone who changes jobs regularly. This might sound mean, but I promise I mean it as sincerely as possible. Grow up, focus on your life, and stop worrying about the things you can&#x27;t change. You got to where you are for a reason. People rely on you. The first thing you should do is work extra hours to make up for the slacking. You will feel good. You also need to take care of yourself. A proper diet and exercise is extremely important. After that, get a wholesome hobby you can pour yourself into. Master something.<p>Good luck. Honestly')
