The demand is massive.  From my commercial experience, this sort of stuff has lots of similarities with other branded goods (bags, watches, designer clothes). It probably is built to a higher standard than mass-merchandise, but people buy it for  more reasons than the tiny theoretical improvement in performance.  I reckon more people buy a Rolex as a signaling device than because it more closely to Swiss Chronometer accuracy standards.  I think the same for lots of bike stuff.  Not really a value-judgement (I&#x27;m thankful for my customers) but in many cases, it&#x27;s not a pure performance-per-dollar value calculation that they&#x27;re making.')
