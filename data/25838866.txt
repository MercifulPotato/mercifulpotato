Say one could enjoy some kinky porn and at the same time not treat all women as objects in day to day life. The same way you could enjoy a violent movie and not go on a killing spree afterwards.<p>There&#x27;s clearly a demand for this kind of stuff and I don&#x27;t see any point in trying to shame it out of view - it won&#x27;t change the fact that people enjoy it (they&#x27;ll just enjoy it in secret).<p>_edit_<p>Not sure why op deleted the above comment, he did have some valid (altho a bit dramatic) points. Looking back the line that I quoted might have been sarcasm.')
