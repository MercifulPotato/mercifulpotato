Say one could enjoy some kinky porn and at the same time not treat all women as objects in day to day life. The same way you could enjoy a violent movie and not go on a killing spree afterwards. It&#x27;s really not that hard.<p>There&#x27;s clearly a demand for this kind of stuff and I don&#x27;t see any point in trying to shame it out of view - it won&#x27;t change the fact that people enjoy it (they&#x27;ll just enjoy it in secret).')
