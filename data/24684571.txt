A working gizmo cannot be argued away. We need some mechanism by which the products of research are exposed to reality, a little bit of a market force to help us evaluate what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Already there is a replication crisis. What we need is to make talk less cheap, ideally give the academics skin in the game. This would be a system where people toil away for years before producing something, and some may never succeed, but when they do they get all the upside from creating a new technology, and we as a society benefit from having this new invention.<p>Essentially, I would break apart the monolithic idea of academia. There&#x27;s too many inefficiencies, we waste away the talent of very smart people working on incomprehensible details that only a handful of people care about, and they write papers no one will read, only to then go to finance  or tech where they&#x27;ll wonder what was the point of grad school since a small percentage of their skills&#x2F;specialized knowledge is necessary to make a living. We&#x27;re creating all these PhDs and we don&#x27;t know what to do with them. We need to foster a more entrepreneurial path in these people, they&#x27;re stuck thinking that they only have two choices: academia or industry.')
