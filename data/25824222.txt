Call me the n word all you want. But if you threaten my life you should be stopped. Either by the police or by me.<p>Then what about lies?  The real problem of the last few years is that really blatant lies have been remarkably successful in the &quot;marketplace of ideas&quot; and quite hard to effectively argue against (if you disagree, try using facts and reason to convince a QAnon believer that the world <i>isn&#x27;t</i> run by Satan-worshipping pedophile Democrats who Trump &amp; Muller are secretly preparing to defeat in a blaze of glory).  Those lies are fuel for those &quot;specific threats or calls to violence.&quot;<p>I think a lot of the conventional beliefs around free speech make assumptions that may not be as true now as they were in the past (e.g. most of the participants will act in good faith (or at least have some shame) and act reasonably, and that any participants that don&#x27;t will be quickly identified and ostracized).  The error is sort of like classical economics theories incorrectly assuming people will be rational economic actors when they often aren&#x27;t.')
