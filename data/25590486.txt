Why do we have to use complex numbers when the system is very much real? What is the real world interpretation?<p>This isn&#x27;t an answer to your question but an analogy. Negative numbers probably seemed strange when you learned about them as a child. After all they don&#x27;t seem to exist in the &quot;real&quot; world. But they&#x27;re still a useful mathematical tool for turning subtraction into addition, among other things. (And negative numbers <i>do</i> have real-world connotations, like floor numbers below ground level.)<p>Complex numbers are exactly like that: They are a useful tool for extending the idea of multiplication to &quot;stuff that rotates or behaves like a wave&quot;, among other things.<p>Don&#x27;t read too much into the names; &quot;complex&quot; and &quot;imaginary&quot; are meaningless labels that simply let us keep track of how multiplication and addition differ from those operations on so-called &quot;real&quot; numbers. Just like &quot;negative&quot; numbers should not be considered &quot;less desirable&quot; or &quot;more pessimistic&quot; than positive numbers, the everyday meaning of the labels doesn&#x27;t apply in a math context.')
