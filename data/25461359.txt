Doing that basically encourages people to lie to you, and poisons the relationship. Everyone trying to lose weight will cheat, and it is often the response to that cheating that determines your ability to continue. By making cheating shameful, you are basically guaranteeing failure (this is a corollary of the idea that places that don&#x27;t have obesity shame fat people...naturally appealing to places with a history of Puritarinism, but largely ineffective).<p>You can only lose weight once you have the motivation and knowledge that you can apply to do it yourself (the stuff about processed food, for example, is utter psuedo-science nonsense that significantly confuses the issue into &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; foods...again, Puritarinism).')
