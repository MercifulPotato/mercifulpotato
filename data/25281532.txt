It&#x27;s because the photo-lithography devices from ASML are so finicky, that you need to babysit them.<p>Which means that you need a lot of engineers.  And they must also be relatively cheap.  Otherwise, you burn through your budget.  Which is also something that Taiwan can provide, since the exchange rate is more favorable for this work.<p>For the American foundry to work, they must employ a lot of engineers.  And engineering labor in the United States is expensive.<p>Hence, the US foundry may operationally work, but it will be a commercial failure.')
