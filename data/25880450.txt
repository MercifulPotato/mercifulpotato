You want to observe the notification called <i>NSApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification</i>.  The way you want to observe this notification is by being sent the message * appDidBecomeActive:<i>.  The &quot;object:&quot; parameter tends to be nil, so I did actually have to look that up:  it means I only want to receive this particular notification when sent by that object.  It is almost certainly redundant in this case, because nobody else has any business sending </i>NSApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification<i>, and it is usually precisely what you do </i>not* want, hence it is usually nil.<p>Anyway:<p><pre><code>   [prefix stringByAppendingString:suffix];\n   [dictionary objectForKey:key];\n\n</code></pre>\nIn the old NeXTstep days, before our editors had code completion and other conveniences, you could very often just type a phrase describing the operation you wanted and magically the code would compile and do what you expected.  Hard to both describe and probably believe if you haven&#x27;t experienced it yourself.')
