It&#x27;s not a great achievement of his people, nor an inexorable sign of progress. It is at best something marginal, like making slot machines legal so swine like  Sheldon Adelson can buy off US politicians instead of scurrying around in criminal back alleys avoiding police where gambling syndicates belong.<p>You&#x27;re lecturing me on the &quot;liberal paradigm in law&quot; which was somehow invented in the 1960s rather back in the 1700s when the rest of the liberal paradigm was invented by, you know, the philosophers who invented classical liberalism.<p>And great reddit tier red herring about &quot;defining porn.&quot; How about &quot;all the filth that the Danes made legal, as OP was boasting about.&quot; Is that a clear enough definition for you, or do you want to parse dirty pictures and debate the merits of DH Lawrence books?')
