Political assassinations (most recent <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hisham_al-Hashimi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hisham_al-Hashimi</a>, an outspoken political scientist who published reports on corruption)<p>2. Massive corruption that inhibits the growth of the country<p>- For example: Per the last head of the Commission of Integrity (CoI) [0]. $250 Billion &quot;lost&quot; oil money only by Sabotaging Iraq&#x27;s oil industry so you have to buy from them (under the table now, overt before). How?\n  - There are 12 crude oil pipes exporting Iraq&#x27;s oil. 6 of them go to Um-Qasr port [1]\n  - 2 main ways to steal, either you poke holes on the pipe (small sized oil cartels, $250k a week or so) or political mafias that own &quot;illegal&quot; ports and shipyards. There are more than 60 of those (per the last head of the CoI) so they can load&#x2F;unload from the ships, these mafias makes ~$5 million a week. \n  - When the CoI would try to send inspectors, the inspectors receive messages warning them if they enter the port of Basra they would be beheaded.<p>This is only 1 sample of an industry where Iranian backed terrorists run to the ground. If you look at any others (from communications, to even milk) have a similar theme.<p>Unfortunately the sources are all in Arabic, if you would like the Arabic sources I can point you to the interview with the last head of the CoI. I have contemplated translating those to make them more widely available but that risks the lives of my relatives back home<p>----\n[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Commission_of_Integrity_(Iraq)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Commission_of_Integrity_(Iraq)</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Umm_Qasr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Umm_Qasr</a>')
