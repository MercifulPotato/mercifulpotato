Those three things cover all the concerns listed here.<p>The single most important thing about gdb, however, is the .gdbinit file. Being able to script your debug session is hands down the best thing about gdb. Bugs that require several steps to repro can be completely automated in gdb. You have conditionals and looping available in the debug script, this is very powerful. I suspect a bunch of the debuggers listed don&#x27;t really support such a workflow.<p>Since I work in a CUDA environment often, it&#x27;s also nice that cuda-gdb mirrors gdb, I can have scripting &amp; tui mode for both.')
