But again, the parameters were known. The magnets give you the field strength, the field strength tells you the radius, the radius^3 gives you the cost, and also, some measure of the construction time.<p>This is one of the great things about Elon Musk -- he looks at things from first principles. When it looked like he needed 1000 Gigafactories to reach his goal, he went back to the drawing board on decades of battery manufacturing, to come up with the Terafactory.<p>When carbon composite rockets looked to be too hard to manufacture, and have too many other detriments, despite the clear wins in strength-to-weight, he dropped it and went with stainless steel.  I&#x27;m pretty sure if he was staring at the basic Tokamak equations, he would have long again saw the economic and time dependence on R, and the massive benefits to improving B, and that would have driven him to look for alternatives.<p>Too many researchers engage in sunk cost &#x2F; dollar auctions, doubling down on obvious wrong approaches, because they&#x27;ve already spent so much.<p>This is also why DeepMind won CASP again, because rather than try to iteratively improve their 2018 result, they dropped it as a dead end and restarted with a completely new approach, even though the 2018 approach was also a revolutionary breakthrough.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is, being able to let go of your previous projects if they are stalling, with huge cost over runs, and a mediocre future return, is a value we should seek in fusion research, and elsewhere.')
