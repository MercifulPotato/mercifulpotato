I don&#x27;t believe we all exist randomly or that our existence was an accident. I am a deeply religious person precisely because I don&#x27;t believe all of this is random.<p>If all is random, why does every person who claims to believe this not live as if it were true. Almost all of these people plan out their lives and their retirements, etc. etc. and then claim that everything is random. Why do you say &quot;I&#x27;d be a fool to waste your brief time in the universe&quot; if your brief time here is an accident. It&#x27;s a fluke and nothing you do during your time here matters at all because you yourself don&#x27;t matter at all, so why pretend that doing good and spending your time wisely is important?<p>Sorry if I sound harsh, but I really wish to understand this kind of thought, and you just never can talk about this kind of stuff this way with people in real life.')
