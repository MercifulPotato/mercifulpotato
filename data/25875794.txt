It will certainly be different, but it&#x27;s still an open question whether it will be easier to secure from a national security standpoint.<p>There&#x27;s the physical security aspect of this, which is as you say, hard to take down when it&#x27;s decentralized.  However, as power generation gets more distributed, we&#x27;ll naturally start seeing more (if not most) of these pieces of equipment be controlled over networks (private or public), and securing distributed infrastructure from a software standpoint is still a hard problem.<p>Just look at the state of IoT security today.  It&#x27;s quite bad, and that&#x27;s not even realistically including nation state attackers in the threat model.  I don&#x27;t expect this to go well with a decentralized grid, at least not for a while initially.')
