Item(by='jchook', descendants=None, kids=[24829038], score=None, time=1603130482, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825567, text='&gt; We have found that organic no-till practices year after year do not yield optimal results, so our organic systems utilize reduced tillage and the ground is plowed only in alternating years.<p>So.. by no-till they mean occasional till?<p>My naive thought on no-till is that, in addition to reducing erosion, the soil gains a poorly understood yet very beneficial network of information and nutrient sharing that builds over time (eg mycelium). Tilling destroys that. Also I read it works best with diverse, cooperative planting instead of mono-crop factory farming.')
