The veneer of the place was already cracking for those that lived there or visited, and now it’s cracked for employers. Why stay and limit yourself to SF when you can source talent from everywhere, knowing that a partially or entirely distributed model can work? I can’t imagine real estate values ever return to their prior state in SF. It’s going to be painful for those that own there, but could be some strange sort of renaissance for the city.')
