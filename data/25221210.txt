Having anywhere from 300-700kg coming through your windshield is going to hurt you. But that assumes you hit it.<p>But like you said, you also run the risk of flipping the car. It would be interesting to see some actual data on this. It&#x27;s the sort of thing that has been repeated so much that it&#x27;s easy to make bad assumptions.<p>Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve almost hit a moose two times. Both times I just completely froze up and slammed the breaks. They jumped out of nowhere, the only reason I didn&#x27;t hit any of them was just pure luck and timing, and had nothing to do with my ability to react or steer away.')
