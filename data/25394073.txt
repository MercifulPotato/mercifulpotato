It means you generally can&#x27;t stop someone from publishing something, but you can sue them after.<p>This does two things. First, it makes it so that if someone feels strongly enough that they&#x27;re right to be willing to risk the penalty, the public still gets the information. This is important. It&#x27;s a check on the courts getting it wrong.<p>And the second is that in order to punish someone for speech, you have to prove it in court in a public adversarial proceeding where the person being punished has an opportunity to defend themselves and the claim is aired as part of the court record in a context where everybody knows that it&#x27;s in dispute but the media and any interested party still gets to find out what it is.<p>This is obviously not what happens when you implement a general prohibition against all claims of election fraud with no meaningful opportunity for anyone to view the material being censored or make their case that it shouldn&#x27;t be prior to its removal.')
