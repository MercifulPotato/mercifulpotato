I spend most of my driving time in and close to the city.  The sole reason I need a car is that I often need to get from one side of the city to the other.  That usually means ring roads and similar, which have higher speed limits and even higher actual speeds driven.  Which means I need both something that won&#x27;t cause a traffic jam there, AND something that is small enough to navigate and park in the city.<p>A lot of people also live just outside the city core and commute by car into the city.  This too means roads with higher speed limits than the actual top speed of this car.  Which means, it becomes a problem.<p>I live in a country where 5.6% of cars are electric. (By comparison, California has 1.3% electric cars). In part because of exactly this need to combine inner city and the periphery around the city. Authorities try to get cars out of the city, which is why they provide tax incentives to at least switch to electric for those who can&#x27;t switch to public transport.<p>If we talk about people who only navigate inner cities, electric bicycles, scooters and small motorcycles are preferable from a traffic point if view since they are much more effective.  They take up much less space on the road, require less parking space and can navigate the city much faster. (In the summer it is faster to navigate across the city on an electrical bicycle than it is to drive any car regardless of size)<p>From a government perspective, this car doesn&#x27;t solve a problem.  It creates new problems by increasing the space requirements and by putting new demographics into new settings.  Dramatically so if the car were to be successful.  From a consumer perspective it does offer more comfort for a narrow sliver of affluent teenagers, and a possible service vehicle for companies, municipalities etc.<p>For someone who needs a car anyway this is a typical second or third car - which means we fail to shrink down the fleet;  it just grows larger.<p>Its _only_ qualities are size and aesthetics.  It falls short in every other respect.')
