It doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with them <i>actually</i> promoting drug use, but it helps <i>normalize</i> illegal drug use in a way, while Apple wants to keep a &quot;family friendly&quot; approach to its App Store.<p>Honestly, if I were the creator I&#x27;d just rebrand it.<p>I remember coming across the app years ago, it wasn&#x27;t obvious from the name what it did, and when I finally understood it, it just seemed like the creator was trying a little too hard to be &quot;edgy&quot;.
