I&#x27;m wondering if you have any examples of where it is true. What has been censored effectively?<p>As far as I&#x27;ve been aware, legal censorship has never worked. &quot;Cultural censorship&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;taboo&quot;) can be quite effective, but I&#x27;m not aware of any examples where the law has been in any way effective at all in this area.<p>&gt; <i>you can see with Parler’s experience (ignoring political affiliation) that once a large group of people are organized against you, it’s simply in feasible to rebuild decades of infrastructure in isolation.</i><p>There&#x27;s two issues with this. Firstly, you&#x27;re conflating &quot;a large group of people&quot;, with &quot;the law&quot;: these are not the same thing. Far from it.<p>Secondly, Parler is not exactly a shining example of technical competency. I wouldn&#x27;t hold them up as &quot;the example&quot; of technology -vs- legal censorship purely because there are much stronger&#x2F;actually competent representatives of the technological side out there that would fair far better than Parler.<p>It&#x27;s also notable that many of the learned &quot;techie&quot; individuals who might rally to defend some other technology were it under siege from powerful state &amp; corporate censorship, in this case actually rallied against Parler. So Parler were up against far more than just the forces of legal censorship.')
