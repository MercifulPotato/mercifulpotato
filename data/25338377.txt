Nobody wants to.<p>How many trillions are spent on war? On corporate subsidies and kickbacks on everything else? How much money is wasted in so many other stupid things? We have a GDP rising at a faster rate than our populations and have for decades. We don&#x27;t spend the that extra money helping people. We could, but we don&#x27;t.<p>And then people look to NASA and SpaceX and say &quot;Look at all that waste&quot;.<p>Meanwhile, this money is going to go to providing low-cost internet all over America (and then the rest of the world). It&#x27;s going to provide a real, tangible benefit to people at a lower cost than the alternatives.')
