For one, it doesn&#x27;t take into account whether there are common alternatives to a given project&#x2F;package. Of course data like that is hard to gather automatically and from GitHub, but possibly that&#x27;s just not a great source, and&#x2F;or could be combined with others -- such as operating systems&#x27; repositories, which would contain information not just about alternatives, but also about packages required to run a minimal system, and to build it.')
