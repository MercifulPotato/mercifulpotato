GP might be confusing &quot;compatibility&quot; with specific grant of future version usage. The FSF default recommended notice boilerplate for the GPL v2 is:<p><pre><code>  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and&#x2F;or\n  modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\n  as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\n  of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n</code></pre>\nSo it includes an explicit &quot;or any later version&quot; clause. Since by far most projects just copy&#x2F;paste standard language it&#x27;s common to be able to combine v2 and v3.
