I don&#x27;t doubt that, but not every political issue, important maybe, should be the top priority for every company, there are a lot of NGOs created just for that. A company should notice the importance of politics, but should also not forget the reason of its existence, which is to provide services or produce commodities of some kinds.<p>As citizens and organizations, we surely deserve our right to engage in politics, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it should what we discuss about on every nights&#x27; dinner table. A large fraction of those conversations will be, as it should, devoted to what&#x27;s going on in the lives of our own and people around us. It&#x27;s easy to lose focus in the  mountains and seas of all those issues that matter, things just won&#x27;t change in a blink, but we simply can not afford to let those issues to be the entirety of our lives, no matter how important they are, as much as one hope for otherwise. Call it the downside of democracy, but we just don&#x27;t yet live in a time where everyone can devote all parts of their lives to discussions on fairness and justice, regardless how beautiful it sounds.')
