These are different.<p>A NAS can serve as a backup.<p>Not all backups are suitable as a NAS.<p>Now, let me restate: Most people have no networks capable of significantly more than 1Gb&#x2F;s between two hosts in their house. Complaining that a backup server is also attached at 1Gb&#x2F;s is not going to cause people to discover that they have already purchased 10Gb&#x2F;s switches, or LACP switches, or even acquire 2.5Gb&#x2F;s switches.<p>Of the people who have 10Gb&#x2F;s switches in their house, approximately none of them are going to look at this very low cost, low performance, low power system and say &quot;yes! this is my new primary backup system!&quot;')
