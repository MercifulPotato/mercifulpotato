Yes, but I find it laughable that you think Tesla has no competitive advantages. Off the top of my head I can think of their battery production + supply chain, direct sales to consumers, world class electrical engineering, best in class safety, and over the air software updates. All of those factors would be extremely hard or impossible to duplicate at an existing car manufacturer.')
