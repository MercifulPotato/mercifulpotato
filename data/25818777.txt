I&#x27;ve never heard anyone say they tried it and found it useful. Every company I&#x27;ve worked for also practiced a culture of discreet secrecy around every topic a mentee could conceivably want to know about: compensation, performance evaluations, where you, your boss, and your team stand within the company, etc.<p>It&#x27;s sad, but gossip is ever-present at companies because it is the best and most informative kind of mentorship. Far from accurate or reliable, but still the best among a field of bad candidates.')
