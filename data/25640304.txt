I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d attract any extra attention unless you&#x27;re already being followed.<p>A numbers station is really only useful to a particular use case that seems exclusive to nation-state spies: you don&#x27;t care who knows you&#x27;re transmitting, but you need the message and the location of the recipient to be absolutely secure.')
