I&#x27;m not afraid of the flu and most people I know are not. How about instead of shutting down the entire economy and destroying many people&#x27;s lives, we say to the people that are afraid of it to isolate? The government could have paid for them to receive their groceries through an app. It probably would have been cheaper than the massive amount of money spent trying to get the economy to recover after destroying it. Most of the deaths are in nursing homes so we should have quarantined nursing homes also instead of destroying the entire economy. That probably would have cut the deaths by at least 50%. The average healthy person has nothing to fear from COVID.<p>I&#x27;ve been to many large parties, I went to 3 Stop the Steal protests (and came into contact with probably 10,000 people easily), I never wear a mask, I take no precautions and I&#x27;m fine.')
