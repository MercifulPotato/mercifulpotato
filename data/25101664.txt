Not in a good way.<p>While I can see the attempt at humor (&quot;dietary choices&quot;), adding it to this list has at least two problems from my perspective:<p>- undermines the seriousness of the other categories<p>- makes fun of what for many is a consequence of their religious beliefs (which appears earlier in the list)<p>&gt; &quot;Do moderate.... nonsensical posts&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether this is the Parler position, or yours, but this is going to upset a lot of people.')
