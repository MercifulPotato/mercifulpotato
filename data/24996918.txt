These guys probably get hired in cases where downsizing is the desired answer.<p>The way big, obvious decisions get made gets a lot of scrutiny. They&#x27;re litigated, literally and otherwise. It&#x27;s pretty hard to go into major layoffs without a &quot;no choice&quot; mentality. The advice might create an air of certainty, help with labour courts, settle dissent in management, etc. It might play an &quot;explored-all-alternatives&quot; role, etc.<p>It&#x27;s the type of thing we never hear a full throated defense of, because these things don&#x27;t ever work without some level of ambiguity.')
