Item(by='jleahy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609155383, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25557653, text='&gt; Has anyone quantified the penalty in using register renaming to allow for a split register file in high-performance implementations while allowing compatible low-power implementations with a single register file? Maybe the transistor savings are dwarfed by other concerns in a modern hardware implementation, but given RISC-V&#x27;s academic goals, economy for FPGA implementation seems useful.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I fully get your point. A low power implementation would have one physical register for each register in the instruction set (ie. for RISC-V it&#x27;s already split). If you have a unified file in the instruction set then that means that you&#x27;re going to have fewer GPRs available (ok for RISC-V as 16 is enough really) and you either need unified in your OOO implementation or you need to make integer-&gt;floatingpoint forwarding an exception (at which point you&#x27;d be better just to split 16&#x2F;16).')
