With everything capped at 1 or 1.2TB of transfer per month, there&#x27;s no point to having internet any faster.<p>For anybody who needs the speed, they are transferring large amounts of data. If you can&#x27;t transfer large amounts of data, what good does the speed do?<p>The other big problem is, a huge part of the country still has basically no internet. Rural communities stuck with 1.5MBps DSL or even slower can&#x27;t even have 2 kids in school learning virtually.<p>Imagine if you had 1 remote parent working from home, and 2 kids trying to do school. Most rural internet just won&#x27;t cut it. I feel terrible for people having to deal with our shit connectivity in this country.')
