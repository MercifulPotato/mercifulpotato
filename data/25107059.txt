Certainly no position that aims to increase the number of sapient lives is consistent with a systematic eradication of sapient lives.<p>The Nazis killed at least 12 million human beings. Did they save 12 million humans through that process? Certainly the anatomy books they produced in their horrific experiments led to an improved understanding of humans and perhaps some better treatment but I think it will take a lot of evidence to convince me that this method is differentially superior to approaches that are more palatable to me. I don&#x27;t think they saved a net 12 million lives in the process, and after all, if you kill one man you kill all his descendants. So currently I think I have a high prior probability of Nazi Germany harming humanity far more than they have benefited it.<p>It&#x27;s going to take some convincing, I&#x27;m afraid.')
