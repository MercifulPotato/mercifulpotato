Server 2020 is the same codebase now, I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;d be much difference, and I appreciate the creature comforts of the shell.<p>But.. I still get winrot, and my dev environment drives me mad. I&#x27;ve been working on a laptop since covid started, and my dev machine is a VM on the laptop, so it&#x27;s a nightmare.<p>At home I run NixOS with a Win10 VFIO setup for games. Both Linux and Windows at home are drama-free, but I don&#x27;t abuse my home computer nearly as much and it&#x27;s much more powerful than the work laptop.')
