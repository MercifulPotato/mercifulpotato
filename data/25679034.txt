But I&#x27;d like to learn what it takes to configure and use Kubernetes from scratch, and given that a) it&#x27;s mainly for scaling&#x2F;managing something, not <i>building</i> something exactly, and b) you don&#x27;t typically <i>need</i> to scale&#x2F;manage something the size of a one-off personal project, I&#x27;m not really sure what would make for a satisfying and completable goal.<p>Any ideas, or suggestions that have worked for you?')
