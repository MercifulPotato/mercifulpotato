Item(by='lordkrandel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609240273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566999, text='I guess this is taking &quot;innovation&quot; as &quot;stuff you put in your house&quot; or &quot;new vehicles&quot;. It&#x27;s mostly an argument for older people. Fact is that there is no more need for &quot;hardware&quot; but there&#x27;s hunger for software.\nEach classroom in Italy now has a screen instead of a blackboard. But hey, in 2020 we are all schooling from home. No big deal?\nNo more need to travel to school for parents at all. We are ordering pizza with a button so hey, no mysterious &quot;ordering tool&quot;.\nOur world, jobs and knowledge is being digitalized, so no more need for specialized hardware. \nIn the 90&#x27;s phones were about text. Then photos, then videos, then Internet, then ordering pizza, videoconferencing, calling a taxi, interacting with the State, going to the bank, reading the news. So no junky appliances in our kitchens, we have delivery.\nUnless you accept that innovation is not always about having more, but changing ways, then you won&#x27;t be able to point that out and appreciate.\nAnd this is something people born before the 1980 tend not to accept.')
