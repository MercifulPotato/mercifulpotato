However, like a mint-condition beanie-baby, the value of Bitcoin is highly debatable. While most people would agree there is some non-zero value of having a distributed and decentralized currency, without a historical basis for valuation, justifying the price is difficult. It&#x27;s better to think about crypto as an independent asset class with its own dynamics that are probably correlated to the balance of power between private and public interests. Ask yourself: in the long run, and globally, does the value of decentralized currency system increase or decrease relative to our current inflation-based monetary system?')
