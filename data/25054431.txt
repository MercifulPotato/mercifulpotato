My new manager wanted me to start right away, but I pushed back and said &quot;no&quot;.  This was after working a job that had me doing 60-80 hr weeks for months on end.<p>I set it up so I had zero obligations at the start - no vacations planned, no &quot;to do&quot; lists.  I would get up in the morning and ask myself &quot;what do I need to get done today?&quot; and the answer was &quot;nothing&quot;.  It was really glorious.<p>After a couple weeks of doing whatever I wanted - reading, going for a walk, meeting a friend for coffee, I felt my background anxiety level had diminished a lot.  Then I started into the phase of &quot;what do I want to get done before I start working again&quot;.  None of it was &quot;must do&quot;, but rather cleaning up the garden, fixing the car, taking care of financial paperwork.  The next few weeks felt incredibly low pressure and highly productive.<p>It&#x27;s a great way to get into a healthy mindset, at least for me.')
