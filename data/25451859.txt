Universities aren&#x27;t teaching computer science, because businesses don&#x27;t care about that, they just want coders.<p>I took a few computer science courses at UT back when Djikstra (not from Djikstra himself, though, from Dr. Nell Dale) was there. Everything in the algorithms class came with formal proofs. Loop invariants were core concepts. The book was not yet published, we spiral-bound photocopy of the draft.')
