The Right has changed. Trump does support free trade - if the US is not taken advantage of. Foreign wars are something everyone&#x27;s tired of. Russia as a major threat is not something people take seriously, unless it&#x27;s used to influence people against Trump. Etc.<p>Many on the right would classify the points you mentioned as &quot;neocon&quot; or &quot;neoliberal,&quot; something they&#x27;ve always been uncomfortable with and seen as an infection of the party and had to grudgingly accept without alternative, until Trump.<p>Support for Trump <i>is</i> at a deep, emotional level for many. But certainly not in spite of his policy positions. If anything, his policy positions reinforce that emotion for most of his supporters.<p>The people most in need of good policy, at the price of an acceptable nonchalance regarding a president&#x27;s mere presentability - minorities - made their voices heard by voting for Trump. Every single minority demographic voted in higher numbers for Trump this election over last. The only demographic to vote for him less? White men. And that made the difference.<p>The privileged have the benefit of being able to vote based on presentability. The rest of the population cannot afford to in the same way.')
