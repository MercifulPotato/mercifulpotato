Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604150964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24949378, text='VST does not deal in 12TET. VST2 delivers MIDI data to a plugin, which most plugins (not all) will interpret in 12TET. But the plugin may offer its own mechanism to change the mapping between MIDI note numbers and frequencies, or it might use the MIDI Tuning Standard to do so.<p>The only role for a DAW in this comes if the DAW labels MIDI data with note names. If you&#x27;re not using 12TET, these labels will likely be wrong. But since MIDI itself doesn&#x27;t inherently use 12TET, just 128 notes numbered from 0 to 127, any DAW can still be used to work in non-12TET tunings and scales.')
