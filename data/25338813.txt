If you&#x27;re doing &quot;serious date calculations&quot; for any modern organization, and you are asked to make a graph of 20th century data by decade, you will be expected to use the standard decade divisions, i.e. 190_, 191_, 192_. If you include data from December 2000, and get different results from your colleagues, you have failed. The last decade of the 20th century was Jan. 1990 - Dec 1999, according to everybody except the most pedantic of history majors.<p>And the idea that you could actually do serious date calculations that count backwards all the way to AD 1 while maintaining a precision of 1 year is also ridiculous. There are error bars around the year numbers from that long ago of something like 2-5 years.<p>I understand the basis for the [1901-2000] definition. However, I really don&#x27;t think its defense outweighs its huge downsides, especially the split-decade problem.')
