It&#x27;s frankly annoying in the kind of web api context that this author is describing and is another source of lost productivity.<p>So, Ruby has Rails, PHP has Drupal&#x2F;Wordpress&#x2F;etc, Python Django. However, neither Go nor Rust have a mature framework that makes it easy to spin up a CRUD app. I&#x27;m hopeful that some sort of project in Rust will rise up along the lines of Flaskrestplus in which resources are the primary abstractions. Resources could have codegen&#x27;d frontends built using something like react-admin so that you could build a fully functional web form in 100 loc or less. There&#x27;s no reason the frontend bits couldn&#x27;t be shared by Rust and Golang (and C++, D, Haskell, etc) frameworks.')
