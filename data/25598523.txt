I understand you as &quot;management provides the direction and some design constraints, seniors fill in the details, juniors just implement specifications from the seniors&quot;, which matches my experience.<p>Hypothesis 2: Maybe it&#x27;s a culture thing? I&#x27;m guessing from your user name that you&#x27;re from Europe, and I&#x27;m from Germany. Maybe the downvoters are literally coming from a different place? (Don&#x27;t know how it would be different over there though.)')
