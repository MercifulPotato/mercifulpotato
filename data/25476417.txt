Once you&#x27;ve plucked a song from the internet and put it into your collection it becomes reliable, you know why you saved it and what playlist it belongs and what activity you want to pair with it and what frame of mind you were in when you saved it.<p>Streaming&#x2F;youtube is so ephemeral, even with history and playlists it&#x27;s difficult to remember what you found so groovy about a piece when it could all be gone tomorrow. I rarely develop a fixed memory of a song until I&#x27;ve saved it.')
