I was under the impression that we were talking about internal dev support, where GPL is totally irrelevant, but even if you were distributing it to customers I&#x27;d be surprised if qemu&#x27;s GPL infected your code since they&#x27;re only ever combined at runtime (and even that&#x27;s questionable in my mind, but IANAL). That is, if your code could run on the GPL Linux kernel without issue, why would it running on the GPL qemu compatibility layer matter?')
