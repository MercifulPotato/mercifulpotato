The ‘harder’ case is just unlikely when the algorithms one started with were already state-of-the-art and the programmer didn&#x27;t know what they were doing. It might seem tempting to think that a cryptanalyst now has to do twice the work, but what they&#x27;re really doing isn&#x27;t cracking multiple encryptions — they&#x27;re just attacking a <i>different</i> encryption.')
