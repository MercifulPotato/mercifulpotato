JavaScript took the web in a weird direction.<p>Semantic articles, comments, upvoting, media - distributed p2p - could disrupt Google, Adtech, and increase signal to noise ratio dramatically.<p>Imagine Napster &#x2F; Bittorrent for news. Shared p2p. That would be amazing. There&#x27;s no HTML to enforce presentation rules. Your client can represent the content any way you want.<p>I love the web, but I hate what Google, Facebook, Reddit et al have turned it into.<p>The signal is in the text and media content. Not the HTML&#x2F;JS shell it comes wrapped in.<p>I think p2p is the right model to avoid the walled garden boondoggle. People can bootstrap it by pirating New York Times, etc. content at first, but then adding micro transactions later. Or maybe it should be completely free from monetization attempts.<p>Comments and upvotes could flow like email, completely distributed. They&#x27;d be cryptographically signed to prevent spoofing, and you could curate your own peer group.<p>The web doesn&#x27;t have to be the final protocol.')
