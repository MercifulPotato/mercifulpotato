Having known about this website for a while, this is my first time deciding to create an account and making a post.<p>I have (somewhat) recently decided to start working on a simple C project. It is a “replacement” for the Unix utility ‘cal’.<p>Of course, it is far from actually hoping to replace anything, it is more of a clone with some different functionalities than anything else.<p>One of my friends mentioned that in his classes for his degree in computer science, he was assigned to fix a ‘cal’ clone the teacher had written in Java.<p>Since I was always kinda interested by calendars and timekeeping, that sparked some interest in me. I decided to start the project because I felt like it would be fun to try to come up with something simple to display the calendar.<p>I chose C because it is a (relatively) straightfoward language, and it is very popular, so basically anyone can understand it.<p>Initially, the program was really short, but lacked a lot of functionalities. As the time went on, and I felt periodically bored enough to work on it, I decided to sacrifice some simplicity for more useful features.<p>I feel like now it has gotten to the point in which it is “mature enough”, and could potentially be used by people who regularly use ‘cal’.<p>Don’t mind the bugs too much. (But of course, feel free to bring them up!) One that I know exists and just haven’t gotten around fixing yet is the overflow handling for my function for parsing integers.<p>I’m looking forward to know what people might think about it! Any kind of feedback is really appreciated, be it regarding functionality, code style, or anything else!<p>P.S., You can try it through a Web interface through the first link on the website. Try e.g. ‘greg -yh’ for output very similar to ‘cal’.')
