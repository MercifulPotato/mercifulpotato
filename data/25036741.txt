Anyone who buys an app, or in app purchase, is directly a Google customer.<p>I&#x27;d also argue that even if someone uses Play Store services, but doesn&#x27;t pay a penny, they&#x27;re still a &quot;customer&quot; in a looser sense of the word.  They&#x27;re engaging in the market-place, likely using free apps subsidized by advertising. Even if you want to argue that they&#x27;re the product instead of the client (and I&#x27;d be inclined to agree), they&#x27;re still revenue-generating users.')
