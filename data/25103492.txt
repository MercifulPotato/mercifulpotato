Item(by='forest_dweller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605465376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25100147, text='&gt; Do you really think the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-england-merseyside-43816921" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-england-merseyside-43816921</a> case is egregious? The punishment is meaningful, but hardly life or career changing. Just because something has been said in rap lyrics does not mean it&#x27;s OK to say in all contexts. Do you know the context and what she said? Surely it&#x27;s conceivable that what she said really was harmful to community.<p>All you are doing is rationalising putting an Ankle braclet on a 17 year old girl because she posted some rap lyrics to face book. There wasn&#x27;t a violent act, theft or anything that is actually harmful happened.<p>This nebulous &quot;harmed the community&quot; can be used as an excuse to curtail any of your freedoms. You could say &quot;These homosexuals are harming the community, therefore we can remove them from it&quot;.<p>&gt; Consider why free speech exists: to protect public debate and essentially hold up the light of transparency to power - clearly there&#x27;s no trivially obvious line to draw that will protect only that speech, nor a trivially obvious line to draw that will protect all non-harmful speech. So when a society, in a healthy debate not too different to the one we&#x27;re having now chooses to draw the line somewhere between those too extremes: that&#x27;s just fine. Personally, I think the US protects speech that simply undermines society (and the US), and that doing so is at worst self-destructive, and at best irrelevant. Yes, we need to protect speech - but we don&#x27;t need to pretend the line between constructive speech and hate speech is terribly subtle, nor that there is going to be some kind of chilling effect from rules like this. Do you feel threatened by this court outcome? No, right?<p>We didn&#x27;t choose to draw the line though. The legislation was pushed through in the mid-2000s because of terrorists bombings (by Islamists) in the UK.<p>The law keeps on being expanded to include more and more trivial things. IIRC A man was arrested for looking through a shop window too oddly.<p>Once you allow any curtail of speech there will be calls to curtail more of it for the &quot;public good&quot;.<p>&gt; Regardless, though bad laws should be repealed the larger point stands: these countries have not devolved into Orwellian nightmares.<p>They are locking people up for speech and investigating jokes. So yes they have.')
