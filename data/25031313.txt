Nor is the caricature of &quot;Liberal elites&quot; you read about in the National Review.<p>&gt;nor would you rather live in another country where that&#x27;s the national norm.<p>Who said I&#x27;d rather live in another country. You seem to be having the argument you&#x27;d like to be having rather than actually participating in a conversation.<p>&gt;The issue with immigration policy has been stopping illegal entry and ensuring the rest are valuable contributors to society.<p>I&#x27;m sorry but if you aren&#x27;t considered part of the in group, White Trump supporters won&#x27;t admit this to you, but as a group they are terrified by the demographic changes in the country. Fear that their culture is being erased is the primary impetus behind their call for decreased immigration. Law and order, and calling for a points base immigration system is simply more palatable than outright calling for only letting in Whites.<p>&gt;Nobody is stopped because of their national origin, nor has that ever been proposed.<p>Trump has instituted Travel bans multiple times. During his campaign he called for &quot;a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country&#x27;s representatives can figure out what is going on.&quot; He also reportedly said &quot;Haiti? Why do we want people from Haiti here? Why do we want these people from all these shithole countries here? We should have more people from places like Norway.‚Äù<p>His advisors and and multiple national Republican politicians have said they are afraid that White birth rates are lower than immigrant birth rates.<p>&gt;The USA still continues its green card lottery system which gives out many free slots every year. Very few countries come anywhere close to matching the immigration strength or desire of the USA.<p>Again this isn&#x27;t from lack of trying. Trump isn&#x27;t a dictator, there are limits to what he could accomplish in 4 years.')
