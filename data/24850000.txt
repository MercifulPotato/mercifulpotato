Yes it&#x27;s all electrical and chemical and electrochemical and so on. The problem is not with finding a good visual&#x2F;logical representation.<p>You usually don&#x27;t see connections between different things when you aren&#x27;t actively looking for them, or when you haven&#x27;t seen&#x2F;thought those things to be related in the past. Since CPUs were designed by humans, your logical reasoning would usually work well when reverse engineering one, especially if you know the general ideas of how integrated circuits are constructed and what functional blocks a CPU is made of. Nature, on the other hand, has no logic. Your reasoning doesn&#x27;t work with natural phenomena, and that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re seeing in areas where experimentation and direct observation is hard, infeasible, or impossible.')
