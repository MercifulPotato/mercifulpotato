I got one from work when they first came out, and ended up sticking with my iPhone 5. I also really dislike the protruding camera lens, and now all phones do that. The phone can&#x27;t even lie flat on a surface. Bigger is not better. I use a Pixel 2 right now, and it&#x27;s the perfect size for my hand. It also has a protruding lens, but with a slim cover, it&#x27;s fine.')
