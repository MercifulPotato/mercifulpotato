Well, you might not like that it&#x27;s locked down, but you need that app. Then once you&#x27;ve had one for three years you&#x27;re locked into their ecosystem indefinitely.<p>It&#x27;s also a trap. When the lockdown first comes, they say they&#x27;re just using it to exclude malware and other things you actually don&#x27;t want. You have to get your apps signed, but they sign all the ones you care about, so what does it matter?<p>Only after mobile platforms that don&#x27;t do this have reached negligible market share and have no network effect do they start excluding apps you might actually want. But by then it&#x27;s too late.')
