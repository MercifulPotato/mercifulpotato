And like 1000&#x27;s of others, got the unfortunate message, that I was not accepted into the program. And looking back, my application and venture, was not ready for YC. But why? And will we ever be?<p>The following are my thoughts on why were rejected, and a few concerns which still slumber in the back of my mind: \nI believe that 3 main issues caused our application to be firmly placed in the rejected pile. I do not believe that it was a close call.<p>The number 1 reason: Team. \nOriginally, I had the idea for my startup 5 years ago, and since then I have moved continent, started a family, gotten jobs, left jobs, and struggled to launch my startup. I guess, one of the side-effects of moving country is your network goes from level 80, to level 0. I tried some cofounder dating, and actually found a great CTO to join me, but after 2 months of working together, he was asked to become the new Vice Minister of Technology for the country, and therefore had to quit the startup. Thereafter, I &quot;convinced&quot; a technical and strategic partner to join my company, even though we lived 7 timezones apart, we believed that we could manage (spoiler alert, we couldn&#x27;t). The project was not moving ahead at the pace we wanted it. And finally, my new CTO quit, after being offered a senior position at AWS. Alone again... I am now working with a former co-worker, and friend, but he has been clear from the beginning, that is not interested in the CTO position. He wishes to continue his employment for the coming 5 years or so. In the same period, I found a CMO to join the team, but that didn&#x27;t work out either, as I felt he was not invested in the project.')
