Additional factors in that are low interest rates, meaning that on the one side mortgages have record low interest rates and on the other low risk savings accounts have no interest anymore, so people are looking to invest. Given how the prices of housing have gone up because of these factors, people see buying a house as a great investment.<p>Anyway, all of these factors combined mean that fewer people can afford to live in a house, there&#x27;s much more of the &quot;working poor&quot;, etc etc etc.')
