If there&#x27;s a group of people with some strongly held belief, not supported by evidence, about the government doing something evil then perhaps we should call it a &quot;shared paranoid delusion&quot;. It&#x27;s hardly a &quot;theory&quot; if they already believe it and it hardly involves a &quot;conspiracy&quot; seeing as it&#x27;s perfectly normal for the government to plan things in secret, even things that aren&#x27;t &quot;evil&quot;.')
