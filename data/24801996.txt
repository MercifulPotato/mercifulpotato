I wrote an MP3-&gt;midi convertor that is very fast and does not use the GPU or any kind of deep learning, it also gives results that a year ago were SOTA but in the meantime have been passed by deep learning based techniques.<p>I will definitely use your software. What would be great is to have a &#x27;virtual midi device&#x27;. If it works well enough are you open to licensing it? We will sooner or later hit this problem and such a component would make our lives a lot easier, it would <i>also</i> allow me to practice on my real piano using the software, which if I didn&#x27;t want to play the piano I&#x27;d give my left arm for.<p>On another note: when you know what should be played it is actually easier: you only need to output a &#x27;1&#x27; or a &#x27;0&#x27;, what is played is what is expected vs what is played is not what is expected.<p>This may be a simpler problem to solve, and in that context it might even be able to detect chords.')
