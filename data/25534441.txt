Many of the compliance standards do require best practices, in most circumstances. For example, CSF, RMF, NIST 800-53 or 171 are all relatively sound from a technical perspective (e.g., data at rest must be encrypted, encryption must be FIPS-validated encryption, etc.).<p>Unfortunately with ISO 27001, NIST 800-171, etc., is that people see having written down policies as evidence of implementation of proper controls. If you have a policy that says you use role based access control, you have to actually do it. If you ha be a procedure that says you backup sensitive data to X alternate location and perform failover tests annually, you have to actually do it.<p>It’s sad, but 85% of compliance assessors I have worked with essentially look for “do you have a policy? Does that policy say the things the standard says it should? You’re compliant!”.<p>I blame the companies in part, but I also blame the people who are trusted to objectively and competently evaluate the system’s level of compliance. The standards and assessing compliance to them is great in theory, but in practice, people are...people.<p>The few areas I will say have succeeded are NIST 800-53&#x2F;FISMA and FedRAMP. They are not perfect (see: SolarWinds), but the bar for obtaining an ATO and&#x2F;or FedRAMP accreditation is relatively high.')
