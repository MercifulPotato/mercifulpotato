I find it beautiful that:<p>* { a^n | n in N } is regular;<p>* { a^n b^n | n in N } is not regular (exercise: use the pumping lemma to prove this) but is context-free, i.e. it can be recognised by a pushdown automaton (a finite state machine which can also use a single stack);<p>* { a^n b^n c^n | n in N } is not context-free (by a pumping lemma again), but it is context-sensitive, so can be recognised by a linear bounded automaton.<p>Oh, and &quot;finite state machine with <i>two</i> stacks&quot; is Turing-complete so any computable language has a recogniser of that form.<p>It&#x27;s mad that you get such fundamentally interesting classes of machine just by generalising so simply in such natural ways!')
