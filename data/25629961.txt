A friend of mine wrote a short story about this sort of thing a couple of years ago[2]. We actually spoke about it, and it got me to wondering what the business model of a service like this could be. Subscribing to receive videos from and communicate with a deceased relative. &quot;Unsubscribing&quot; would be like condemning them to the grave yourself.
