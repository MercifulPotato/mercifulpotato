It felt to me like it was a lot of middling, risk averse people at the middle layers of production and show running, with an inflated sense of worth . That&#x27;s pretty common in hollywood - and it generally produces mediocre outcomes - not AMAZING gamechanging outcomes.<p>They have good line producers and of course great technical talent for set design, editing, production - but the left hand of marketing doesn&#x27;t talk with the right hand and you get a lot of disjointed efforts.<p>If you look at Netflix, for all their downsides, they go big and hard, buy working shows based on data and don&#x27;t shy away from controversy. They also have way better middle talent which I think makes the difference.')
