You can,\n- pass a gRPC client instance,\n- pass a gRPC connection,\n- pass a gRPC endpoint in string format,\n- pass a gRPC service instance implementing the service interface generated by `protoc-gen-go-grpc`.<p>These are meant to fit grpc-gateway to scenarios where gRPC server might be implemented in another programming language, or accepting clients at a TCP port or   another kind of a socket, possibly under a different network realm than grpc-gateway. Pretty much like a reverse proxy, but can also be integrated with services in the same code level, escaping the overhead of a transport layer.')
