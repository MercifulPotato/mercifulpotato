I will give him tips every now and then, especially if he runs into problems, but I largely just let him do whatever he wants.<p>I never forced this on him, it&#x27;s something he enjoys immensely. I myself didn&#x27;t learn how to program until after graduating from college, so I know how little value learning programming at an early age is, except as a form of enjoyment.<p>He asked to learn Python but I refused, since I find it weird that he would be learning the same language that I myself am using to earn a living! But the upside is I can always outsource my work to him while I relax. Seriously though, I will teach him when he&#x27;s ready but right now there&#x27;s no use case for him to learn.')
