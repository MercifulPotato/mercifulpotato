Item(by='caconym_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610227055, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25704205, text='IIRC there are 25 deaths attributed to the &quot;BLM protests&quot;. That includes <i>all</i> of them, across the country, likely a number of events in the high hundreds or low thousands. AFAIK that number does not include any police deaths, though there were a couple attributed to right-wing extremists in the same period.<p>In a single medium-sized event, Wednesday&#x27;s riot got 5 people killed. One of them was a policeman, and at least three of them  were due to violence. So in terms of fatalities per participant-day, Wednesday&#x27;s event was probably at least two orders of magnitude more violent than the &quot;BLM protests&quot; taken as a whole.<p>I think that&#x27;s a significant difference, and one that exposes this sort of whataboutism as false equivalency (in addition to the other issues with whataboutism).')
