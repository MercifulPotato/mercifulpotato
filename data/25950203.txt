It&#x27;s just a configuration mistake. I had `session.default_name` set to no value, and because I typically exit qutebrowser with &quot;ZZ&quot; (`:quit --save`), the last session I created was getting overwritten by the contents of my last-viewed windows.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t have checked if you hadn&#x27;t responded. Very grateful.')
