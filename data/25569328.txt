In fact, they’d be firmly past the threshold the study identified as the minimum wealth necessary to engage with wealth-building jobs.<p>The conclusions don’t really apply at all to situations like a US tech company, unless you’re trying to understand why homeless people living on the streets aren’t able to get jobs at an Amazon warehouse or other entry-level jobs. Trying to project this on to hiring practices of educated candidates into high paying tech jobs is ignoring the core focus of the study.')
