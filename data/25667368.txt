There&#x27;s nothing wrong with money being exchanged for a service and both sides are satisfied. The problem is when that monetization is based on something else than money (such as personal data) or that the company abuses their monopoly position to force people into an unfair deal.<p>The solution isn&#x27;t to say &quot;profit = bad&quot;, it&#x27;s to break up monopolies or force interoperability and forbid certain forms of &quot;payment&quot; (such as exploiting and reselling personal data) that are deemed nefarious to society.')
