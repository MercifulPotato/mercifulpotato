This returns a unique query ID that can be used to execute that query server side. In OneGraph, you can use <i>just</i> HTTP for that, no need for a GraphQL client library. You can use any HTTP client to trigger a POST request with the persisted query ID and its input params in the request body. This way it seems a bit easier and simpler that your approach with RPC in WunderGraph. I need to read your docs to have a full picture though. ;)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onegraph.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onegraph.com</a>')
