Explicitly labeling everything as `public` or `private`, C++&#x2F;Java style?<p>&gt; <i>Does Python force you to pass [self] as an argument to make some kind of clever point?</i><p>I think the idea is that `a.foo(b)` should act similarly to `type(a).foo(a, b)`.<p>However, what happens when you define a method and miss off the `self` parameter is crazy. Inside a class, surely `def f(a, b): print(a, b)` should be a method that can be called with <i>two</i> arguments.<p>&gt; <i>And why are some classes (int, str, float) allowed to be lower case</i><p>Historical reasons. AFAIK in early versions of Python these weren&#x27;t classes at all - the built-in types were completely separate.')
