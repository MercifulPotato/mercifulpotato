Also, the more ways of explaining something the better in my opinion. We don’t all think on the same frequency and the more answers the more likely to find one on your own understanding. SO helped me many times when I got stuck on something. When learning something new I wouldn’t go directly there, Id use a tutorial or some authotitative reference')
