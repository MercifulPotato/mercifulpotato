I would go so far and say that they&#x27;re below medium, some of them reaching low. I would get to keep so much more of my salary in Finland, since my income tax is at around 40% here in Sweden. Add to that all the other kreeping taxes added over time.<p>I love Sweden tho, no tax can change that ;)')
