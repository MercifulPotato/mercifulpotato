Indic scripts&#x27; unique way to create sounds (with 52 consonants and 12 vowels) means we need innovative ways to type fast and accurately. Our innovative mobile keyboard will create vast amounts of Indic-script data. We aim to acquire a large fraction of 400M Indian users who don&#x27;t use mobiles for lack of understanding English keyboards and other interfaces. This is an entirely new demographic that will use internet services in 2020&#x27;s.<p>Location no bar, we are physically located in Goa, India. You may want to join us and continue to work from Goa for any other folks you serve!<p>We look forward to work with full-stack developers (mainly Android&#x2F;Java) and AI&#x2F;ML specialists as CXOs and tech-leads.<p>Thanks a lot for engaging, we look forward to hearing from you.<p>Shukriya!')
