These are ordinary Win32 apps written to match the style of the era. Worse, some <i>system</i> control panel items have plugins in turn. E.g.: drivers can define extra &quot;tabs&quot;, network cards have protocol-specific popup windows, etc...<p>There is just no way to update the look &amp; feel of these to match the new Settings app style, most of the code is third party and ships as binary blobs.<p>The Microsoft Management Console (MMC), used mostly for Administrative Tools and server consoles has a similar problem.<p>Combined, these two make up the majority of the OS GUI!')
