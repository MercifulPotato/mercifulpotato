What happens if (or perhaps when?) Google decides to kill it? I&#x27;m probably in Google&#x27;s target market for Stadia - I don&#x27;t own a gaming PC and have reliable gigabit fiber. But I&#x27;m not prepared to drop vast sums into building a library on Stadia if I could lose everything. They need to work on a more sustainable business model (for them and consumers) but in the meantime they need to work with publishers so existing players can request Steam keys. If they did that I would be willing to give Stadia a shot.')
