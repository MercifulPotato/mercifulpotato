You do need a capture card, but if you have a Camlink or the no-name $20 USB capture card that EposVox did a positive review on, you&#x27;re good to go.<p>On Android (I have a P20 Pro), I use a USB-C HDMI dongle meant for a Nintendo Switch, but it works with my phone plus it lets me charge the phone while using it.<p>Filmic also has a &quot;remote&quot; app (~$3, iirc) so if you have an extra mobile device, you can control the camera app remotely (since the phone you&#x27;re using as a camera has its screen is pointing away from you).')
