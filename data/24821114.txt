If you could get an at least equally fast result as when writing &quot;normal C++&quot; in Rust, with more safety and less effort for debugging, would this not be tempting for many people using C++? Because this is what I observed in my case. And this given that I&#x27;ve written no more than a few hundred lines of performance-critical code in Rust, and have worked for &gt; 10 years on performance-critical code in C++ and C.')
