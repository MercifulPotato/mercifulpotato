Yes, that Captain Crunch. One time he asked me, in reference to the actor&#x27;s name being mentioned in the media, &quot;Who&#x27;s Brad Pitt?&quot;.<p>I laughed my ass off, because I decided he was the only person in LA County to have asked that question anytime recently. Incidentally, I guarantee you he has no idea who Diego Maradona is.<p>Crunch also once asked me, 2 days after the election, &quot;Did Obama win?&quot;. He was traveling overseas and was &quot;out of the loop&quot;. I saved the email and laugh about it to this day.<p>(If you don&#x27;t know who Crunch is, and you&#x27;re using this website, that&#x27;s funny.)')
