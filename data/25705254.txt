Even using both hot and cold sources to get a comparable temperature, it isn&#x27;t as easy to get into the shower when the weather is colder.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the coldness of the water only bothers me for the first 20 seconds of the shower, so I&#x27;ll use a bit more heat then turn it colder.')
