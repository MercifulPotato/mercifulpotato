We did this with our embedded Computer Vision Library (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pixlab.io&#x2F;downloads" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pixlab.io&#x2F;downloads</a>) and it did works quite well.<p>Corporations really hate anything GPL related and will ultimately purchase commercial licenses at high cost to get rid of GPL if they are interested enough in your product.<p>Note that dual licensing was first popularized by Sleepycat software makers of BerkeleyDB now absorbed by Oracle. They were profitable during their short lifespan thanks to this approach.')
