They are akin to programming for the law. And generally speaking they just tell you what you should already know about the terms under which you use the service, so that you can&#x27;t sue the service for absurd things.<p>For the sake of demonstration, I just went and read the first seven sections of Personal Capital&#x27;s TOU. Not a single surprise in there, so far. To give one example, section 5 just says that for the sake of displaying the information you are agreeing that personal capital can retrieve on your behalf, personal capital has your authorization to act legally on your behalf. This is to prevent some idiot from suing them for fetching account info that said idiot inputted into personal capital. Another section says, hey, we aren&#x27;t responsible for mistakes you make with your investments, even if you base your decisions on the information we show to you. Which is a perfectly reasonable thing as well -- you literally could not run a service like this otherwise.')
