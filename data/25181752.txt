True, unlikely in a referendum, but not impossible. Say the polls say its 55&#x2F;45 for your team, and its raining heavily (weather is known to influences outcome). Would you be motivated to go? Maybe you would, but some would not.<p>Another one (not referendum specific; my comment regarding strategic voting wasn&#x27;t specific to referendum either). Say your preferential candidate is Charlie. You have no idea what other people vote. You&#x27;d vote for Charlie. However, say you know its going to be between Alice and Bob. You really don&#x27;t want Bob to win. So you vote for Alice.<p>If you consider mass media and hype surrounding survey polls, these cause strategic voting between whoever ends up popular. Consider, for example, the way a candidate gets chosen for Republican or Democratic party. Prime example of strategic voting.<p>Some see these examples as opportunities to get their preference [for a candidate or political goal] in higher regard. I don&#x27;t; I see these factors as factors which potentially harm the democratic outcome on the long term. Now, like Earth, democracy is strong and adaptive. It can take a bump. But it isn&#x27;t endlessly going to accept stomps and beatings. Hence, I believe we need to try to maintain the integrity and authenticity.')
