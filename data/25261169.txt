I&#x27;d recommend reading these books and then reading Matt Pharr&#x27;s &quot;Physically Based Rendering&quot;, also available for free online (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbr-book.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbr-book.org</a>). Starting with a pathtracer based on Peter&#x27;s book and then slowly integrating elements of PBRT (the pathtracer featured in PBR) as needed has been a great pedagogical exercise: RTIOW teaches using a bottom-up approach, while PBR very top-down. If you&#x27;ve written the pathtracer described in RTIOW, you end up with a much fuller understanding of many of the choices made in PBRT.<p>Also, PBR is getting a fourth edition this year that goes into fully GPU rendering—it&#x27;s a great time to start learning about pathtracing!<p>*Rayrender Github:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;tylermorganwall&#x2F;rayrender" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;tylermorganwall&#x2F;rayrender</a><p>Website&#x2F;Docs:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rayrender.net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rayrender.net</a>')
