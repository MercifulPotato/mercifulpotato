I expected a lot while reading all the reviews on Amazon and even here on HN.<p>The book is good and give some few insights, but I&#x27;m still waiting for an &quot;aha&quot; moment or &quot;wow this is something I didn&#x27;t know&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t want to go into details to not spoil it for everyone who wants to read it, but it seem like an average book about startups so far.<p>I may be wrong and the other half of the book is more interesting.')
