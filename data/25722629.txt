I heard from several teachers that &quot;process of entering meditation&quot; is what the beginning of the practice is about.<p>I also read that meditating in a quiet room with no distractions is sort of like the &quot;5-pound weights&quot; of meditation, where you begin to learn how to practice... But the real payoff is knowing how to meditate when you are in a stressful situation, when the techniques can really help. I read this in Wherever You Go...<p>Because I don&#x27;t get many opportunities to go to hour-long guided meditations or to take a 14-day silent meditation retreat, etc., I decided that I would combine these two ideas, and jump straight to the &quot;10-pounders&quot;.<p>I decided that whenever I was a) waiting for something b) annoyed by something, or c) at an overly long work meeting, I would seize on this wonderful opportunity to meditate and just start meditating, without changing anything about myself externally, on my breath.<p>Breathing, external sounds, and tactile sensation, are three things I&#x27;ve heard teachers suggest meditating on, one or two at a time. Breathing works well for me, but not for everyone.<p>When I am &quot;meditating on [something]&quot;, it means I&#x27;m paying attention to it the way I pay attention to the tip of the pencil when I&#x27;m drawing, or the paintbrush when I paint, or the cursor area when I&#x27;m typing on screen. With breathing, I sometimes think about how each breath out is connected to the next breath in, all the way to the beginning... Sometimes I also think about how the breath connects the conscious with the automatic.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this for several years now, and I&#x27;ve found it to be one of the most helpful things to help in almost any situation.<p>With regards to mental state, it also helps to think about that &quot;this is temporary&quot;')
