Looking over the repo it seems there has been some software improvements so I will upgrade mine now - saving the settings will be very useful as it&#x27;s too dark for me by default. Thank you!<p>Regarding the lens, I&#x27;m using the &#x27;6mm 3MP Wide Angle Lens for Raspberry Pi HQ Camera&#x27; and I have zero problems with it. I&#x27;m hardly moving in the way I use it as a simple webcam so I have no problem with staying in focus and I just don&#x27;t get what a few people are saying about distortion, I must be blind. I looked up one of the recommended alternatives, the &#x27;Fujinon HF9HA-1B 9mm 1.4&#x27;, I can only find it pre-owned on ebay shipped from China for Â£70 (+ a load of tax I am sure). I will happily stick with my regular lens.')
