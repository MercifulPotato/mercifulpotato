But that doesn&#x27;t begin to address the question of whether advertising is a net loss.<p>For one, the advertising also serves as a collective moat against new competitors, which could enter the market and eat up both Coke and Pepsi&#x27;s market share. Maybe their biggest gain from it is that a bankrupt soda company from the 80s didn&#x27;t replace them, and that a similar company today wouldn&#x27;t have room to enter the market.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t account for more complex effects like a net increase in sales for all companies in that market. E.g. maybe Rolex, TAG Heuer etc. all benefit in the long term from expensive watches being seen as fashion accessories.<p>If Rolex stopped their advertising spend one month and saw little immediate change, then TAG Heuer etc. might follow suit. But both might only experience the real loss years later as &quot;luxury watches = must buy&quot; faded from the psyche of their current and potential customers.')
