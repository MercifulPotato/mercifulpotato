Who decides what is moral and what is not? Who should have the power to decide what 2.7B (or whatever number of) users see?<p>LGBT is just an example, because in many cultures it is immoral. As is the nipple.<p>I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea for a private company, to be able to decide arbitrarily what is moral and what is not.
