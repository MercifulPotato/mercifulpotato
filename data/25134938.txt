E.g. is it the case that people in these countries are emitting pollution due to their lifestyles, or is the pollution mostly from energy, transport and manufacturing in the pursuit of selling products to western countries?<p>Good point but I think much of it could also be attributed to countries going through their own industrialisation processes and generating wealth (however that end product gets used). Are we to condemn them all to poverty? Much of China is still rather impoverished.<p>Also - are you suggesting we should shut down our economies in order that we don&#x27;t produce anything in China for example? If not then _how_ they produce the power&#x2F;do industry is in their hands not ours and it&#x27;s an issue to address.<p>The big issue in China is the CCP have no reason to care or abide by any global rules on this (or follow the example of any goody 2-shoes western country). They have endless coal plants with very little CO2 mitigation and the corrupt&#x2F;totalitarian nature of their govt makes it very difficult to have them improve on this.<p>&gt;Is there any evidence of deaths attributable to shut downs so far? Thereâ€™s over a million deaths worldwide due to covid, how many attributable to non-covid causes? E.g. suicide etc.\nThere&#x27;s a strong correlation between economic strife and deaths. I&#x27;m not going to get into the missed medical appointments etc. as that is not relevant here but that&#x27;s a covid factor too.')
