I have primarily a static site (using Jekyll, but Middleman would apply) but now need to add some server side stuff (e.g. with Sinatra). I see how I could dump my generated site into the Sinatra &#x2F;public directory, but then I&#x27;m serving everything through the sinatra server when I really only want to hit that when I need the dynamic content&#x2F;calls. How would I keep them separated while still having a single environment? Have tried googling to no avail, don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m asking the right questions. Any pointers would be super helpful! Thanks')
