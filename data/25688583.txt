Item(by='netsharc', descendants=None, kids=[25688689], score=None, time=1610132448, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25688173, text='&gt; As someone who cannot visit every single polling place in the country (I visited zero and voted by mail) I cannot with absolute certainty proclaim that there there was no widespread, coordinated and shockingly well-concealed election fraud. As a person of logic and reason, I strongly belief this did not take place, and I would need multiple, reputable sources of information and likely trusted peer acceptance before I would change my mind to believe it did.<p>I have the same views. There are actually some &quot;They stole my election!&quot; people on HN, so maybe they&#x27;ll read this and reconsider their &quot;reality&quot;, but Biden won by several thousands in the 3 disputed states, to pull off voter fraud to swing that many votes require a lot of work, and probably a lot of people, and the problem with having many people is that it&#x27;s hard to keep something like that secret. And if they were going to steal the presidency, why did some GOP candidates in those states still win seats, why not flip enough things Dem so that the &quot;tyrants&quot; have a comfortable majority?<p>I think Trump&#x27;s &quot;They stole it!&quot; proclamations are a scheme to keep his base heated so they can donate to his retirement fund, although yesterdays &quot;Weâ€™re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue!&quot; (only for him to take the limo back to the White House) probably goes beyond that, that was an incredible &quot;Release the hounds!&quot; moment.<p>It&#x27;s infuriating that a significant percentage of the country doesn&#x27;t listen to reason, haven&#x27;t even looked at how flimsy the court arguments that Team Total Landscaping have made, but are just screaming everywhere &quot;I know the truth, and the truth is, they stole it!&quot;. Then again, many probably would get lost in the first paragraph if they tried to read any court filing. (Not being insulting, but hey, someone must&#x27;ve thought years ago &quot;why spend money to educate children if they&#x27;re just going to vote you out.&quot;.)<p>This is turning to a rant, but it seems the seditionists in congress who are also still claiming voter fraud without evidence (like Cruz or Hawley) just want to keep the Trump base very very pissed off, and very very motivated.')
