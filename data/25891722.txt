At my current job it’s literally impossible for my team to pull off as we’re spread across North and South America, Europe, Japan and New Zealand. Instead we have two weekly meetings, one friendlier to western countries and the other better for Asia pacific, both recorded, where we review agenda items added (by anyone who wants to add something, including folks at other teams) and then a quick review of major team projects status. I personally find it much more productive than a 15-30 minute scrum stand up where people either say “same as yesterday” or drone on for 5 minutes straight, depending on their personality.')
