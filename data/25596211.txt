Item(by='scythmic_waves', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609443110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594909, text='So by &quot;graduate level&quot;, I don&#x27;t mean that at no point could any undergrad follow the material. I&#x27;d wager that you&#x27;re correct, most seniors, and many juniors or sophomores with the right sequencing, can follow the material. But that same thing can be said about _tons_ of graduate course work. From my experience, many graduate classes have a few advanced undergrads in the class.<p>By graduate course work, I mean &quot;builds on an undergraduate-level understanding of the material&quot;. And yes I&#x27;m being a little hand-wavy about what demarcates grad from undergrad (which probably isn&#x27;t well defined anyway), but I hope the gist of my meaning is clear.')
