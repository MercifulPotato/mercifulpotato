We haven&#x27;t upgraded our API version or used any of their new billing features or anything like that. Basically we get the same value from Stripe we did from the day we integrated. I thought our pricing was going to be grandfathered but this change will cost us tens of thousands of dollars. Unfortunately, we&#x27;re kind of hostage to it.<p>Anyone else at scale and have an old integration? How are you handling the fee increase?')
