There is a certain sequence of actions to make it do it...    and it isn&#x27;t hard to do by accident - it basically involves turning on every electrical thing (as you would do on a cold dark night), having a quite flat 12v battery (as would happen if you left the car unused for a few months), then turning the steering wheel while revving the engine (as happens while you&#x27;re pulling out of a parking space).<p>So park the car for a few months, then go to unpark it on a cold night...
