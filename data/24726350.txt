I also think that Google lawyer went into legal technicalities with merger doctrine, etc. (which I don&#x27;t understand) without trying to provide real life analogies (with all their caveats) which some justices tried to do instead.<p>One analogy that comes to my mind is that the steering wheel, gas and brake pedals, hand brake, etc. are like APIs of a car and are implemented differently in a gas car vs. an electric car. It makes sense for an electric car company to stick to that API rather than replace the steering wheel with a joystick or buttons and have all drivers learn this new method to drive a new car. It would&#x27;ve made more intuitive sense')
