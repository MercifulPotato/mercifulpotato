The game MAY have brought this up, there was always a loser every match. So, your parents MAY have considered this the cause of your inability to properly handle it.<p>I MAY be wrong. I have no idea about you. But that fits ME perfectly.<p>I found the thing that brought me out of that was stressful singular competition, fighting, shooting, chess, performance, etc. Things that you excel on your skill not anything you can blame someone else for.<p>I learned the value in making  a plan, executing it, and learning when and why if it didnâ€™t work.<p>Now as an adult, I find myself more ready to deal with stressful things like dogs fighting on walks, medical emergencies, criminal activity, and things I just see other adults completely lock up on. I think this comes from an inability to process loss and stress.')
