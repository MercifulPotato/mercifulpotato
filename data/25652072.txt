Cell phone providers prefer frequencies in the MHz range because they penetrate buildings well. Higher or lower frequencies wouldn&#x27;t be suitable for this purpose.<p>In addition, a lot of Tx and Rx equipment moves around. A quiet part of the spectrum in a rural area might be crowded in a city, for example, and poorly designed equipment could be subject to harmful interference')
