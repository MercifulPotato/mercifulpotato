Once the gov&#x27;t realizes that crypto is a threat and is able to position itself to form legislation, actually passing the legislation would piss off a lot of groups that the gov&#x27;t is incentivized to make happy.<p>- Crypto is technological progress, and banning it would push innovation out of the US and into countries that decide not to regulate<p>- Banning crypto is an authoritarian act, and is basically an admission by the gov&#x27;t that it prioritizes tight gripped control over our liberties (not that this point is actually all that unlikely...)<p>I&#x27;m biased, but Occam&#x27;s Razor applied to the above points makes me feel like the banning of crypto is unlikely... Am I missing something?')
