I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about cancel culture and I don&#x27;t think Jennings needs to get &quot;tarred&quot; for a tweet. That said, I also don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s being robbed of any basic human rights here and knowing this, I&#x27;d rather give the (presumably well-paid, relatively prestigious and very public) job of Jeopardy! host to someone who isn&#x27;t on record as needing to broadcast a message with no known benefit to anybody.')
