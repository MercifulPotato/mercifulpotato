The idea was to build extremely high-quality courses for AP exams and then create amazing tools&#x2F;assessments which would allow students to self-study for the exams. One of my signature tools was an adaptive assessment tool that would tell students when they&#x27;re ready to take the exam. If the student wasn&#x27;t ready then they would get a mixture of lectures, videos and small assessments to teach them the concepts needed to pass the exam.<p>I eventually closed the service down because the reality is the edtech market for these type of products is very small.')
