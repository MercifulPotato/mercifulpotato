In the case of USB ports exclusively on one side of the laptop, the only response can be merciless ridicule.<p>Those reasons are marketing and profit-seeking.  Modern society has this false assumption that new = &quot;improved.&quot;  So even if Apple perfected the laptop form factor, the next model will be regression that&#x27;s marketed as an improvement and <i>believed to be one by undiscerning users</i>.  If they didn&#x27;t do that, customers wouldn&#x27;t buy it because it would be an old = &quot;unimproved&quot; design.<p>Though, a confounding factor here is there&#x27;s a lot of personal preference with something like a laptop, so there&#x27;s probably no one &quot;objectively best&quot; design.  So some fraction of regressions are just catering to a different preference set.')
