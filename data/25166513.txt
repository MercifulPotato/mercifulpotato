I have a single application icon, clicking it once brings up the last window I had open.  Clicking it twice displays a preview window for each open window, any of which I can click to fullscreen and focus.<p>It&#x27;s literally the same as the macOS dock, complete the with the dot indicator for number of open windows.<p>Plus my upper left hotcorner displays all application windows, and I have my upper right set to display each window of the current application.<p>They&#x27;re preeeetty much identical.<p>I&#x27;d know - I use both daily.')
