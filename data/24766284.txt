State substitution laws end up meaning that when generics come on market, a lot of consumers become proce sensitive by law since the pharmacy must fill the prescription with the lower priced generic. However, anyone who is still buying the brand name at that point is highly inelastic - they really want the brand name only for whatever reason. Thats why the brand name version of a drug usually spikes up in price when a generic enters the market - theres no way to compete with the generic folks on price so at least get as much out of your smaller remaining market segment that you can by using their price inelasticity')
