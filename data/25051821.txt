My wife wants another kid and complains that out house is too small (it&#x27;s 1800 sqft). I hate my job but have no other options to support us.<p>I honestly wonder how I did not listen to all the advice of other people about not getting married. Even at this same job I was much happier years ago. Part of that was because I hadn&#x27;t been disillusioned yet, but I think part of it was also that I had the option of just quitting and taking a lower paying job or moving. Now I&#x27;m not allowed to try either of those options.')
