How does that make Linux on the desktop &quot;not ready&quot; or &quot;incomplete?&quot; In my opinion (and I recognise that this is just an opinion), Linux has been a superior experience to Windows for a long time. All common problems have several robust solutions. Uncommon problems often also have a good solution (which isn&#x27;t guaranteed on Windows either, at least not without spending a lot of money). The idea that Linux isn&#x27;t &quot;Desktop Ready&quot; is a tired trope. Just because people <i>don&#x27;t</i>, doesn&#x27;t mean they <i>can&#x27;t</i>. Linux doesn&#x27;t have a marketing department (and I wouldn&#x27;t want it to).')
