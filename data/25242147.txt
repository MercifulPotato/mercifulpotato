Item(by='tiew9Vii', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606613068, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25241017, text='&gt; Linda Barnes and her husband had to visit six charging stations as one after another they were either out of order, already had a queue or were the slow, older versions that would never be able to provide a fast enough charge in the time.<p>Iâ€™ve been watching a few EV road tests on uk based YouTube channels. It seems the road tests which where positive of the vehicles had similar issues. The reviewers showed there was a surprising amount of charging infrastructure displaying apps with charger locations, however when they got to the chargers they may of been several at the site but only one&#x2F;two working etc with the rest out of order.<p>The article seems the opposite of a EV fud job, the couple come across as pro EV, they say they love their EV and where incredibly unlucky with the set of circumstances \n. The article seems to be highlighting some real issues that need to be resolved. Charger infrastructure in the UK looks to be progressing well but probably due to low usage state of repair is probably low after installation and if only ev vehicles can be sold after 2030 the scaling up problem needs to be resolved.')
