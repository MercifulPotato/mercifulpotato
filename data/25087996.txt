It does have a law-abiding population, geographic isolation and luck.<p>In most states, life is almost normal, and has been for months. In New South Wales, for political reasons, they aren’t going all-out against Covid, but even there, they’ve managed to control the virus through effective contact tracing.<p>Victoria, which became the worst affected state because of the second wave (from foreign arrivals), seems to have recovered well after a stringent lockdown, and is on track for full reopening.<p>Ultimately, Eurasia is probably too interconnected, and the US is too individualistic to make a dent in Covid, but Australia is not a good example of failed lockdowns, since lockdowns actually worked extremely well there.')
