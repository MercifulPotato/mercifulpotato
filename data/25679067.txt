Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610061733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25678920, text='&gt; no known human civilization has ever endured for so long<p>I have 2 points here. 1) The half life is longer than recorded history so this isn&#x27;t really fair. We&#x27;ve seen humans continually advance. Sure, there has been setbacks and some regressions but we haven&#x27;t ever come even close at reverting back to the stone or even bronze age. That is highly unlikely and if that were to happen we&#x27;d probably have bigger problems. 2) Not all waste is equal. A good rule of thumb is that high energy waste is short lived and long lived waste is low energy. Why? Because high energy waste is shedding particles much faster than low energy. Simply if you use a bucket to remove the water from your swimming pool you&#x27;ll finish a lot faster than you would if you used a tea cup.<p>&gt; no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period<p>This is false and I&#x27;m not sure where you got this information from. We chose the location for the Seed Vault (and the GitHub vault) for similar reasons. There&#x27;s plenty of other locations as well, several within the US. As for the bet, I&#x27;m betting on generations of PhD holding geologists to make that decision over really anyone else. As long as what they say doesn&#x27;t set off any bullshit alarms I don&#x27;t see why they shouldn&#x27;t be believed. They are in fact the experts in the subject matter and just rejecting their work with no real evidence is rather arrogant and surprising to see on HN. I believe them for the same reason I believe climate scientists. I&#x27;ve read their work, seems reasonable, I&#x27;ve talked to them and they seem reasonable and passionate and well studied. How arrogant would I need to be to tell them they are wrong. My expertise lies in other fields.<p>I&#x27;d also suggest reading what actual plans are and understanding the scale of the waste problem. I find that many people over estimate the scale by many orders of magnitude. [0]<p>&gt; It&#x27;s literally like saying &quot;Fuck other people who are born after me&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d say that not taking care of climate is saying &quot;Fuck other people who are born after me.&quot; You&#x27;re letting perfection get in the way of progress. We can say similar things about strip mining and rare earth materials. The things we&#x27;d need to develop battery storage to make renewables a feasible path forward. We can&#x27;t wait for a miracle in battery storage. We needed to act 20 years ago. So now we have to make compromises. And as we drag our feet we are still polluting with coal and oil. To me that is the real &quot;fuck you&quot; to future generations. That we got so caught up in perfection that we let high pollution levels continue right on while we prayed for a miracle.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatisnuclear.com&#x2F;waste.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatisnuclear.com&#x2F;waste.html</a>')
