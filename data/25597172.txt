Maybe it&#x27;s accessible to a good portion of people in the Bay Area because almost everyone knows someone who works in tech, but there&#x27;s a lot more people out there.<p>And second, if enough senior citizens were on VoIP numbers, I bet that&#x27;s exactly where scammers would target next.<p>The solution you&#x27;re suggesting isn&#x27;t so much to switch to a product that&#x27;s inherently better, but to switch to a product that only people who don&#x27;t fall victim to scams are using.')
