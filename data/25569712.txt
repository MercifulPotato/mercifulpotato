What we really need is a new RFC &quot;LinkDav&quot; which follows in the footsteps of CardDav, CalDav and WebDav to round out our data portability lives. Want to try your hand at writing a RFC? :-)<p>On the Import docs section it just says &quot;...in the HTML format&quot; - there&#x27;s a Chrome, Firefox and IE version of HTML Export from Diigo, it would be helpful to understand which one would be the best for import to LinkAce: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diigo.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;export" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diigo.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;export</a>')
