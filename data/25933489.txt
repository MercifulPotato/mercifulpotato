I don&#x27;t know whose bright idea was it (fire + teflon = very good combination), but I imagine they use heavier doses than typical outdoor gear, where it&#x27;s also an issue and being phased-out&#x2F;banned (in EU, no idea about US).<p>Not sure how much cancer is from the PFAS, but it seems believable it could be a significant factor. Washing should help, poison waters, but IMO it shouldn&#x27;t be there in the first place.<p>¹ not teflon, PFAS, but it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing, including it&#x27;s not-yet-banned replacements')
