Item(by='zamadatix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610830176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25804490, text='I&#x27;m not sure it had anything to do with &quot;a new version rolling out&quot;, the issue has always been there it just never had a trigger (massive enough load) up until this point.<p>I suppose the app that can&#x27;t send messages is the most secure of all! All joking aside if their focus is security over anything else then this is acceptable. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think most of the users have the same order of priorities so it&#x27;s bound to create some tension over time in multiple ways such as testing analytics, features that don&#x27;t get added, or just general friction due to always requiring &quot;most secure&quot;.<p>The last part I agree is probably the most concerning though, it seems like Signal&#x27;s centralized services aren&#x27;t ready to be battle tested from attacks bound to come due to it&#x27;s popularity growth. I&#x27;m not sure matrix is the silver bullet to that problem either... email isn&#x27;t resilient to DoS because it&#x27;s distributed it&#x27;s resilient because the key centralized players like Gmail can withstand constant attack without affecting service due to their scale. Neither Signal nor Matrix are ready for the attention that comes with serving billions from that perspective. It&#x27;s something I think will come with growing pains though.')
