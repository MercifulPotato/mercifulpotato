As part of the postmortem I had to calculate how many people likely tried to interact with it while it was broken. It was a lot and really made me realize the magnitude of an otherwise seemingly small production failure. My boss didn&#x27;t give me a hard time, just pointed me toward documentation about how to write the report. And crunching the numbers is what really made me feel the weight of it. It was a good process.<p>I feel for the engineer who has to calculate the cost of this bug.')
