Item(by='umvi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606167008, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25192041, text='&gt; But hey - we have to keep the restaurants in business...at the expense of prolonging the pandemic.<p>Could you elaborate on what &quot;prolong&quot; means? Say we shut down the entire country for 4 weeks and get the virus under control. Is the pandemic now &quot;over&quot; (i.e. no longer prolonged) and we can reopen restaurants again at full capacity and just treat individual outbreaks? Or is it going to be cyclical where cases start rising again and the governors start cracking down again ad infinitum? For island nations that can control who goes in and out it&#x27;s one thing, but it&#x27;s going to be very hard for USA or EU which has open borders between states to control spread of contagious disease.')
