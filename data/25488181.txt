This isn’t helpful. You can’t just say, (paraphrased) “Wow Google and Facebook had an illegal exclusivity deal! It’s so illegal and crazy I can’t offer any evidence”. I hate both companies but this reads like a tabloid. Companies are sued all the time and what the Plaintiff alleges can deviate greatly from reality. Sometimes cases are fishing for evidence to support a theory.')
