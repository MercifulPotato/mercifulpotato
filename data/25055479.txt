If the NIF crashes, the entire app (aka, VM) crashes.<p>This is anathema to some...i dunno..philosophies? expectations? of Erlang&#x2F;Elixir.<p>NIFs written in Rust (via Rustler) should never be able to crash the VM. Unlike NIFs written in C.<p>Rustler brings other quality of life improvements, like easier interop (decoding&#x2F;encoding values to and from) and managing the cleanup of objects that live in Rust but are referenced by Elixir.')
