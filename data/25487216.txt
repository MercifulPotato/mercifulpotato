Stackoverflow is paying good money to have their advertisements served to me. The worst part about this is that I found almost every single one of these Stackoverflow pages as a result of Googling, and I&#x27;m logged into Google and Youtube. Google knows that I visited Stackoverflow this many times, yet they have the audacity to charge Stackoverflow money to show me these advertisements. There is no excuse for this. Google is committing objective fraud here and is stealing Stackoverflow&#x27;s advertising dollars for no good reason. Google should be ashamed. Stackoverflow should sue.')
