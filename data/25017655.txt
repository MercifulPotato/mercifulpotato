Yes, perhaps the exact word &quot;widespread&quot; did not come out of Donald Trump&#x27;s mouth, but there can be no doubt in anyone&#x27;s mind (if they are indeed dealing in good faith) that Donald Trump has in fact been consistently and emphatically -- and, most important, <i>falsely</i> -- alleging wide spread voter fraud.
