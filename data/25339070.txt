The first big bull run was very significant, 1000x, whereas the last bull market was only about 100x. The current one who knows, but it&#x27;s looking like it will be about 10x. This volatility is a part of the price discovery process for any new asset class.<p>Fiat currency may appear stable, but it is not. It appears stable because it is used as the unit of account for all other assets in a country. In the long run, any freely floating asset will be more stable than any fiat currency managed the way modern ones are managed, via a central bank, provided that the supply change of that freely floating asset is predictable. Gold, for example, has a supply increase that is predictable. Central bank controlled fiat currencies are by definition not predictable in their supply, and this makes assets that are more suited to saving&#x2F;investment, regardless of short term volatility. Nobody can empty your savings into their own pocket by printing gold or bitcoin.')
