I think this scenario would be horrible, but its damage to the rest of the world&#x27;s supply chains? Probably less than COVID?<p>The other conflict that worries me is a major provocation by China towards Taiwan. This is the foreign policy scenario that frightens me most, and feels like the most likely potential &#x27;Franz Ferdinand execution&#x27;-type event that could lead to a global world war. But in such a war, would we be likely to see a total nuclear back-and-forth between factions? I think this is less likely than in current day India v. Pakistan. But I could be totally wrong. As Francis Fukuyama illustrates, it&#x27;s hard to predict future foreign policy scenarios with any accuracy.')
