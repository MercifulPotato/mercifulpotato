You can say this is a misuse of a steering wheel, but people still do it.  (did you know you should grip a motorcycle with your knees and use the handlebars for steernig only?  most people don&#x27;t do that either)<p>The problem here is that depending on where you grab the wheel, it may change the direction of the car.  This can sort of happen with a normal wheel, but it is not as pronounced.  With the yoke your hand will probably put torque on the wheel.<p>The second reason is bumping.<p>If you bump a normal steering wheel, it doesn&#x27;t change the direction of the car.<p>With the yoke, for example banging on the top of the wheel except in the exact center will probably change the direction of the car.  This also applies underneath, say if you bump it with your leg or body.<p>(I can imagine this going terribly wrong with a car full of kids in a model X)<p>The third reason is the stalks and position.<p>Control stalks are convenient and you can find them with your fingertip.  They are in a fixed position, no matter what way you are steering.<p>steering wheel mounted controls do not benefit from the same fixed positioning.<p>Have you ever tried adjusting the volume on a steering wheel control?   Now do it when the wheel is tilted.  same idea.<p>the fourth reason is stalks and separation.<p>Control stalks are also &quot;shrouded&#x2F;protected&quot; by the wheel.  They are behind the wheel and protected from most accidental input.  If you&#x27;ve accidentally beeped your horn, that&#x27;s sort of the idea.  It&#x27;s harder to accidentally turn on your turn signal by accident (even though it can happen).  It seems like the turn signals on the front of the wheel next to the control wheel might suffer from that.<p>And just personal preference not related to safety:<p>I liked the model S control wheels - they seemed to be pretty good ergonomically.<p>I hated the model 3 control wheels - they felt like a $5 mouse and did not have the right feel.<p>honestly, I think the wheel should be an option.<p>and I <i>am</i> glad the dashboard still exists.')
