It&#x27;s not a &quot;selling less luxury goods but at a higher margin&quot; story.<p>If we assume that the regulatory credit revenue stream eventually dries up then the case for the valuation seems to revolve around Tesla becoming the only car company and&#x2F;or Tesla being or becoming so much more than just a car company.')
