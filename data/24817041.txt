The image showed in the article [0] doesn&#x27;t separate the different energi use making it look like the NRE have more impact that they really have. You might want to look a that instead [1]. In reality solar accounted for less than a percent of used power in 2016.<p>From wikipedia [2]:<p>```Worldwide growth of photovoltaics is extremely dynamic and varies strongly by country. As of 2020, there are at least 37 countries around the world with a cumulative PV capacity of more than one gigawatt. By the end of 2019, a cumulative amount of 629 GW of solar power was installed throughout the world.[2] By early 2020, the leading country for solar power was China with 208 GW,[3][4] accounting for one-third of global installed solar capacity. By the end of 2016, cumulative photovoltaic capacity increased by more than 75 gigawatt (GW) and reached at least 303 GW, sufficient to supply approximately 1.8 percent of the world&#x27;s total electricity consumption.```<p>So the installed power in 2016 is at least 303 GW. Let&#x27;s check how much it produce (and btw, solar is not like wind or water and can&#x27;t easely be disconnected from the grid, at least for large solar farms, so broadly: solar power generated = solar power used).<p>According by ourworldindata [3], 328.2 TWh in 2016 and 724 in 2019, so it roughly double every two years. That&#x27;s the good news.<p>And the cost have nothing to do with this. The bottlneck is twofold: the installation (peopl trained to instal the solar \npanels as well as the land usage, and the other one is the production. That can keep doubling every other year, but one thing won&#x27;t, and that the mines. The growth decline already started for wind power generation because of the first bottleneck (the demand don&#x27;t follow the offers), i&#x27;m afraid the second one will limit the solar panel usage.<p>I&#x27;ve read that installed solar was 3% of installed electricity in 2019, so roughly .3% of electricity used. Electricity generation is 1&#x2F;3 of our GHG emissions, and we need to limit those to 0 by 2050, or at least by 2070. This is not hte way. It will help, but this is not the way.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbonbrief.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;Screenshot-2020-10-12-at-12.16.49.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbonbrief.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;Scree...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.c2es.org&#x2F;site&#x2F;assets&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;estimated-renewable-share-of-total-final-energy-consumption-2017.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.c2es.org&#x2F;site&#x2F;assets&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;estimated-r...</a><p>[2]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solar_power_by_country" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solar_power_by_country</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;renewable-energy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;renewable-energy</a>')
