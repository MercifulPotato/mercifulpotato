Item(by='secondcoming', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607955290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25415881, text='&gt; They themselves demanded controversial content to be removed<p>I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily true. They demanded that their ads are not shown next to controversial content.<p>An unintended consequence of this is that the definition of &#x27;controversial&#x27; is fluid and open to abuse. So if a pressure-group deems your thoughts and opinions &#x27;controversial&#x27; you get no ads. And if you get no ads there&#x27;s no real incentive for YT or whatever to serve your content; they&#x27;re not charities. Your only other option is to self-host. So advertisers and indirectly control the societal narrative, and that should be troubling.')
