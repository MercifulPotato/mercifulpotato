He was the Jeff Bezos of his time. He had a big-four accounting firm who signed off on their financials every 90 days. Henry Silverman (Avis, Howard Johnson&#x27;s, and many other companies) believed in him, as did everyone. He had been on Sierra&#x27;s board for five years. I thought I knew him well. I also thought we had structured the deal such that the software business couldn&#x27;t be screwed up. And, I had so much faith that Sierra&#x27;s market dominance was so strong that no one could ever screw it up. As you might imagine, I&#x27;ve looked back on the crash many times, and still believe I made the right move based on what I knew at the time. The problem was that I was dealing with snakes and didn&#x27;t know it. MANY people lost their jobs and had their net worth wiped out. It was indeed a sad event, but I wasn&#x27;t the only person fooled by CUC. Tens of thousands of people directly or indirectly were hurt by the financial scandal.&quot;<p>There are others, too, that are worth reading for the interested.')
