You&#x27;re not really going to make it a day without cleaning the dishes.<p>Deep cleans are a good metaphor, but maybe also just general maintenance of kitchen equipment? E.g. having a stove where half the burners don&#x27;t work half the time, an oven with wildly variable temperature, duller and duller knives, etc. seem much more akin to technical debt as they make it continually harder to produce quality results and work efficiently. However, you can ignore them for quite a long time, and you don&#x27;t need to pay attention to problems every single day. (It&#x27;s fine to lose an oven for a while, but you&#x27;d better fix it quickly.)')
