OP was mentioning &quot;mental energy&quot;, meaning they were thinking about playing the game.<p>Chess, Go, etc. are constrained environments. Playing these games makes you better at them. Maybe you&#x27;ll find a new opening, a new sequence, etc., but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll ever be able to apply it to another field.<p>Implementing AlphaGo is no longer playing the game, it&#x27;s analyzing a computer science problem and finding a solution. Number theory was still about understanding some objects that seemed natural and given, rather than arbitrary ones with artificial constraints, like these games are.')
