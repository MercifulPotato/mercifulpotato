The group pressure was only in college though.<p>I think I experience a lot of stress. I always wanted to change the world growing up, and in the last ten years (I am 36 now) I really learned a lot about how awful some aspects of the world are. I am a deep empath so I have a hard time feeling okay when I know others are suffering. And with the US economy putting the poor at such a disadvantage, I feel pretty unhappy about that stuff all the time. I am in therapy and have been for 8 years, but I still just think a lot of stuff sucks and I can&#x27;t really ignore that. Just think of the 2 million people in prison in the US. That system needs to change, and it&#x27;s very easy to learn about that and struggle to not feel okay on the day to day because of that knowledge.<p>However, marijuana helps, and is part of my coping strategy. Along with time outdoors and a lot of creative endeavors.<p>I also really hate working for other people, so I am always trying to start startups or something. I don&#x27;t like working a regular job. But this means that even though I have high value skills, I&#x27;m always experiencing some financial stress due to my desire for independence.<p>I am not trying to say my work accomplishments are caused by my marijuana use, but that one can use marijuana daily and still accomplish great things. I do well despite my marijuana use. Possibly because of it, but that would be harder to prove.<p>To me, marijuana seems fine. I don&#x27;t want to do it forever. I am finally in a good place in my career where I am doing what I want. We still have to get through the &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot; on our project and I suspect there will be a lot of stress for some time, but hopefully we will get more traction and the stress will die down and the pandemic will end and I can find other ways to feel okay without vaping every day.<p>But for now, I&#x27;m okay with it.')
