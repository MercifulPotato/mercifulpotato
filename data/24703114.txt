Posts are removed when they&#x27;re flagged by users and the mods don&#x27;t seem to intervene. I wonder if they even have the power to intervene. I remember one post where dang (moderator) was basically trying to negotiate with one or two users who had flagged the thread to unflag it, after the title was changed (or maybe it was something discussed in the thread, this is a bit vague in my memorey, sorry). The post stayed flagged.<p>Bottom line: it&#x27;s not the mods, it&#x27;s the users. That&#x27;s HN.')
