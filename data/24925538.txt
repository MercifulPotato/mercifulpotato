People tend to blame a lot of issues resulting from immature implementations on some unspecified &quot;Wayland&quot; (whatever that means).<p>All I can find is that in the past Mutter had <i>lower</i> latency for its Wayland implementation when compared to it using X.org, but it seems that Mutter&#x27;s latency story has always been iffy in the past. FWIW it seems that Sway for example has finely grained input latency tweaks built in while being Wayland compliant [1].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swaywm&#x2F;sway&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;1.4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swaywm&#x2F;sway&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;1.4</a>')
