Remember, we&#x27;re trying to optimize for <i>all-cause mortality</i> across the <i>entire country</i>.<p>&gt; Sweden could be a special case, but Brazil literally had 0.1% of its population wiped out.<p>Every year, Brazil loses 0.65% of its population to all-cause mortality. COVID-Mortality in Brazil may be high, but it is pretty much on par with Chile, which has had a severe lockdown.<p>&gt; In Manaus there were five time as many excess deaths as confirmed COVID deaths. If that&#x27;s not healthcare collapsing I don&#x27;t know what it is.<p>Yes, for a brief period, hospitals in certain cities did indeed get overwhelmed. That&#x27;s very visible.<p>What isn&#x27;t visible is people that would suffer and die in the next years because their livelihoods were destroyed because of a lockdown of questionable efficacy.<p>In Chile, you have starving protestors clashing with the police. In Brazil, approval for Bolsonaro is at the highest since his presidency started. Put two and two together.')
