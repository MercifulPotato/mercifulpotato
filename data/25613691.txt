That&#x27;s not what they are arguing against.<p>So why are you still looking for issues when there&#x27;s solutions avoiding their stated objection?<p>&gt; Even compiling the compiler and then use that compiler to compile your code doesn&#x27;t help<p>So what&#x27;s the threat model now? that MS will risk their reputation, established business models and subject themselves to liability to poison the bootstrapped compiler to detect when a modified F# compiler is being built so they can inject vulnerabilities into all new modified F# compilers ensuring they&#x27;re similarly poisoned whilst avoiding detection from easily disassembled byte code (that can be crossed checked against its original source), Does that sound plausible?')
