This is more challenging for short stories as they don&#x27;t have a ISBN, may appear online, or in a fiction magazine or in an anthology.<p>So, I may put down my thoughts on short story X that I read in book Y, but if I look up book Z that also features that short story, my thoughts on the story would also appear there.<p>In short, I&#x27;m looking for a site that also records short stories like the ISFDB [1], but allows users to add reviews.<p>So far, I haven&#x27;t found one. I&#x27;m now putting down my notes on short stories in a Zotero database.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;isfdb.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;isfdb.org&#x2F;</a>')
