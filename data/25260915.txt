Item(by='mwcampbell', descendants=None, kids=[25261711], score=None, time=1606783365, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25259886, text='&gt; We are now living in the era of the $200 Chromebook for every child. But the ideal  scenario Papert imagined is far from realized.<p>There&#x27;s no contradiction in those sentences. The $200 Chromebooks are a realization of what another commenter described as Shaw&#x27;s neofeudal vision. Contrary to what Papert suggested, the kids themselves can&#x27;t maintain them (at least not without sitting through a scary warning every time they boot into developer mode, IIUC), let alone assemble them. Outside of developer mode, Chromebooks can only receive OS updates from Google, and only as long as it wants to provide them. And as for the dispute between Shaw and Papert on the expected lifespan of a computer, while some new Chromebooks will receive updates from Google into 2028, I expect that their practical useful life will be much shorter, unless we software devs can somehow stop the bloat treadmill.<p>Un-disclosure: A few weeks ago, this would be the part where I mentioned that I was a developer at Microsoft, on the Windows accessibility team. I&#x27;m no longer there. Of course, they&#x27;re not really any better than Google when it comes to really empowering kids like Papert envisioned. Indeed, the fact that both of them want to sell their systems and services to schools is IMO a big part of the problem.')
