If they do not hit these metrics, then the outsourcing company owes service credits.  The incentives do not align with making customers happy and solving their problems.  Everything is geared towards deflecting users with self-help options, simple scripts for the agents, and walking the line of hitting those metrics with the fewest number of warm bodies.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty hellish business.')
