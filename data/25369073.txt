Obviously, companies can decide what they want to spend money&#x2F;computing resources&#x2F; storage&#x2F;bandwidth on. I&#x27;m not sure why that appears to be contentious.<p>As for senators sending &quot;a strongly worded request&quot; that this material be removed, I&#x27;m also puzzled by why people would conflate that with actual governmental censorship.<p>From where I&#x27;m sitting, I&#x27;d guess that Google&#x27;s algorithm has decided that the whole &quot;stolen election&quot; narrative produces fewer ad dollars than its counter argument. Maybe &quot;the election wasn&#x27;t stolen&quot; is more widely accepted as consensus and therefore, there&#x27;s less risk of companies reducing their YouTube ad buys.<p>I genuinely don&#x27;t understand people&#x27;s outrage when in order to accept this move by YouTube as either being ideological (&quot;they&#x27;re doing what they think is right! And they&#x27;re wrong!&quot;) or motivated by being afraid of Congress (&quot;those handful of senators in a party that doesn&#x27;t control the majority are strongarming a multibillion dollar corporation. They couldn&#x27;t possibly pour an unimaginable amount of money into lobbying for policies and candidates that are favorable to them. They&#x27;re helpless!&quot;)<p>I genuinely do not care what editorial decisions YouTube makes. I do not rely on YouTube for my worldview, and I don&#x27;t rely on it shaping other people&#x27;s worldviews.<p>It seems that <i>some</i> of the people that are mad about this aren&#x27;t mad that YouTube holds so much sway over so many people, but rather some are angry that that power isn&#x27;t being used to further their interests.')
