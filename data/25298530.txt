You&#x27;re directly stating it. This isn&#x27;t in debate, what&#x27;s in debate is if, even if the percentage is better, more total suffer. Is that actually a moral good?<p>It&#x27;s like saying &quot;we&#x27;ve killed 90% of your cancer cells, but weren&#x27;t able to kill all of them. The cancer will still kill you, but we killed a greater percentage of it! yay us!&quot; It doesn&#x27;t make sense in certain scenarios and is only helpful as a delta - plus, to even suggest that we have less poverty than ever in history is unsubstantiated with fact.')
