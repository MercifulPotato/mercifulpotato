Social connections are essential to happiness[1], at least for most people. The number and kind of connections vary, but the &quot;abuse people and grow rich&quot; model doesn&#x27;t make most people happy.<p>That may be counterintuitive, but it&#x27;s a mis-extrapolation from the fact that being poor really sucks. There are diminishing returns. More things are required, which for many people is some kind of connection.<p>Those connections are not sufficient, even if necessary. One may still want to give up, and there&#x27;s no easy answer to the nihilist question. All I can offer is to note that you haven&#x27;t given up already and therefore have some intution that there is some emotional state you might look for -- even though I assert that &quot;meaning&quot; isn&#x27;t actually it.<p>[1] I&#x27;m actually using &quot;happiness&quot; as a shortcut for some generally positive emotional state, the kind where you don&#x27;t feel morose and ask plaintively about &quot;the meaningless of life&quot;. That state may not actually be &quot;happy&quot;. &quot;Satisfied&quot; or &quot;content&quot; may be more accurate, but still incomplete, and &quot;happy&quot; conveys the notion better.')
