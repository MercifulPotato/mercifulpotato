I <i>did</i> say we should practice radical compassion and if somebody says to us &quot;hey this phrase bugs me or hurts my feelings&quot; there&#x27;s very few reasons I can imagine why we shouldn&#x27;t accept that and consider using different language.<p>I&#x27;m happy to trade &quot;live my life&quot; for &quot;walk in my shoes&quot; in order to make folks who use wheelchairs feel more included in my communities. Why not? What do I lose? It&#x27;s not like &quot;walk in my shoes&quot; is some deeply important idiom to me and if I never say it again I will be forever a less-happy person.')
