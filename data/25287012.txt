I realize that Apple and Samsung say they didn’t do that but I don’t think they are being honest. This thing where tech workers take tech companies at face value when said companies have repeatedly demonstrated their dishonesty is... really something.<p>b) At any rate, “Apple deceitfully handicapped older products to cover up a more serious (but fixable) flaw, knowingly  pushing customers into unnecessary upgrades” is really not any better than “Apple deceitfully handicapped older devices to push consumers into unnecessary upgrades.”')
