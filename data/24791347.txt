Developers shouldn’t <i>have</i> to know and understand their infrastructure. It’s great if they do, but making it a requirement is just adding complexity for complexity’s sake.<p>Kubernetes is high level if you’re an infrastructure or ops person. It’s not high level if you’re a developer. This argument sounds an awful lot like “learn C before you learn JavaScript because you’re going to need to know C anyway” combined with “C is a high level language”. That might technically be a true statement but it’s only true for a very small number of people.<p>In my opinion the the goal should always be to have a platform where developers don’t need to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Software development is hard enough as is, and Kubernetes isn’t exactly easy.')
