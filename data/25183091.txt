When CC went under, I was fairly certain that BB was on the chopping block next, and I though Fry&#x27;s would be the last one standing. Forward 15 years and the fortunes of BB and Fry&#x27;s seem vastly different. Although I&#x27;m not sure how they accomplished this, buying last second supplies over the last few years when I ran a business shifted back to BB, because they managed their inventory better than Fry&#x27;s and had more items in stock when we needed it in a pinch. So convenience and sufficient selection, with good enough prices are somewhere in that playbook')
