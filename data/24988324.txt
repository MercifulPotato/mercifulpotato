They often took down the screen reader with them, so the only thing you could do was a hard reset. An example of such a crashword is the mistyping of wednesday, where n is replaced with h.<p>People were posting those crashwords in chats, on MUDs, or even as usernames. Some places where a lot of blind people hung out even contained specific filters for those.<p>There were also programs that didn&#x27;t escape SAPI5 tags properly, so, by posting particularly clever bits of XML, you could change parameters like the pitch, speech rate, volume, or even the currently active voice, and make users, particularly younger users, scared of weird ghosts in their computers.')
