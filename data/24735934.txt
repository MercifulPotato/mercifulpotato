It&#x27;s my fuzzy understanding that page table entries are 64bit on amd64, so if you have 64GB of shared buffers (which is quite a lot) you&#x27;d have 128 mb overhead just to map that with 4kb pages. Which is to say the overhead is proportional to both the shared buffers size and the page size.<p>It is not a constant factor. Saying it is about 2mb is misleading.<p>It&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m missing something special about postgres, but that&#x27;s how shared memory between processes works on Unix systems in general.<p>MySQL uses threads which are much lighter weight because they don&#x27;t need their own page table entries, and they don&#x27;t need to do as many TLB flushes when switching contexts between them. It&#x27;s one of the architectural decisions they did right I think. Postgres went with processes so it&#x27;s easier to kill a connection cleanly, without leaving a things in a bad state. I think there are other ways of solving that problem though.')
