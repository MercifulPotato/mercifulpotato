Google atleast used to be known for their aggressive focus on engineering performance &amp; latency.<p>Anyone remembers when Google bought the Chromium team, Chrome was first launched, and it was lauded as the fastest and lightest browser? Fast forward today, and Chrome is the epitome of sluggishness, a godzilla of a browser. Gmail? Same â€“ horrible, bloated, slow. Google G-Suite? Same. Android? Symbol of inefficiency, barely usable after throwing tens of gigs of RAM, CPU and huge batteries. Google Cloud Console? Piles of steaming slow foam.<p>It&#x27;s almost as if, show me a product that Google does that is fast today, other than the bare minimum Google home page search box.<p>On one hand, they&#x27;re facing erosion of product management. On the other hand, it&#x27;s no longer an Engineering-driven company in the sense their engineering is not able to drive atleast that UI&#x2F;UX to work performant.')
