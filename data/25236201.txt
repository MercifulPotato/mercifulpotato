Cherenkov radiation is light that is <i>emitted by</i> particles going faster than the local speed of light.<p>You&#x27;re not supposed to measure the speed of the Cherenkov radiation.  You&#x27;re supposed to measure the particles that are <i>causing</i> Cherenkov radiation.<p>If you measure those fast particles, you&#x27;ll see that they will cross a tank of water just as fast as they will cross a tank of vacuum.  They can cross faster than a beam of light will.')
