It is technically possible. <i>But nobody does this.</i> It has nothing to do with &quot;the type ecosystem has been around longer&quot; — it has to do with the fact that the types <i>do</i> something in Java, and always have and always will. You cannot compile a Java program and just not check the types.<p>But people <i>do</i> write Python libraries without type annotations, and that&#x27;s fine. There&#x27;s plenty of not-explicitly-typed Python in the world because that&#x27;s all there was for a long time before the introduction of optional type annotations. And a lot of people prefer to write Python without type annotations at all because that&#x27;s one of the benefits of a dynamically typed language — explicit types are unnecessary.<p>I think your argument is useless because you&#x27;re intentionally conflating these things and arguing that people <i>could</i> write type-less Java, but since this is not actually done in practice it has no bearing in this conversation.<p>The point originally being addressed was that <i>in Python</i> you either need fully annotated libraries or else you cannot simply &quot;use MyPy with Any turned off&quot; as the far-parent comment suggested. And my point has been that this is a genuine concern in Python because there&#x27;s lots of Python code without annotations because Python the language doesn&#x27;t <i>require</i> or even <i>use</i> the annotations, so they are (from the perspective of the language) purely artifacts of no consequence. <i>This is not the case in real, actually used Java code.</i><p>Please stop making arguments in bad faith to &quot;prove a point&quot; or whatever. The point the entire time has been about the use of type annotations <i>in practice</i>, and you appear to be intentionally disregarding this in an attempt to... I don&#x27;t even know. What <i>are</i> you after here? Do you just not like that somebody disagreed with you? Like, I&#x27;m genuinely unsure what your purpose is other than to be contrarian. The concern about &quot;are all the third-party libraries I&#x27;m using fully annotated?&quot; is a genuine one in Python that is never even thought about when writing Java (have you ever paused to wonder this when writing Java?), so your argument amounts to a semantic debate that has no basis in the real world.')
