Item(by='yowlingcat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608128812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441822, text='&gt; Personally I&#x27;d welcome some sort of intervention by one of the three-letter agencies - this time it could be actually for a good cause.<p>Have you ever read a book by Hannah Arendt called Eichmann in Jerusalem? The whole point of the book is the sheer banality of evil -- that the bulk of evil is not the sensationalist stuff that makes up movies, but its boring, bureaucratic machinations and tacit complicity of civilians under the regime.<p>So all I can say about your idea is it is at best naive and at worst cynical. First of all, it&#x27;s naive because it supposes that military intervention ever works when that flies in the face of history showing that nation-building (especially of the American sort) never works unless it&#x27;s the kind that comes about indigenously -- if it was so easy to fix problems, why has American military intervention post WWII been an almost complete failure?<p>Second of all, it&#x27;s cynical because it&#x27;s easy to support such ideas when you&#x27;re not the citizen who has to suffer through the consequences if things get worse. What would be your response if your idea simply doesn&#x27;t work? &quot;Better luck next time?&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t a game.')
