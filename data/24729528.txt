It has greatly improved my life from a convenience and cost perspective. They also recently raised their wages for all warehouse employees such that it&#x27;s one of the best places to work for unskilled labor in many locations. Amazon has made many small time merchants rich through their platform, and it&#x27;s software engineers are among the highest paid in the industry, so I have to strongly disagree about the zon, but the rest of it agree wholeheartedly.')
