Onboard USB ports lead to a controller which talks to the CPU via PCI-e, for example.<p>PCI-e lanes are a limited resource on a CPU and really fast.  Dedicating one to a keyboard, for example, is probably inefficient.<p>I have heard (don&#x27;t know too much about it) some Intel NICs are able to place network packets right in the CPUs cache for maximum speed, this probably can&#x27;t be done via PCI-e.')
