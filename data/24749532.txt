If you criticize that, you&#x27;re given myriad reasons why.  All I know is, it&#x27;s easier to find information on Reddit sometimes than Google, to the point where I add &quot;reddit&quot; to the search keywords, even though I barely use Reddit as a commenter or follower of subs.<p>And <i>everyone</i> hates the SEO junk that now dominates the first few pages.  It&#x27;s an ugly thing and not in the service of people.<p>Here&#x27;s an idea.  Separate Google seller of ads and room in the search results, from Google the &quot;Wikipedia-like&quot; provider of information for humanity.')
