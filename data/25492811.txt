He further presented himself as a victim of Obama&#x27;s disrespect, especially since the &#x27;shoe on table&#x27; incident.<p>[EDIT:\n&quot;while getting Obama to give him a record $38 billion aid&quot;<p>Longstanding American policy to bolster its client, also a part of the Camp David accords. I do think the aid agreement should not be renewed next time since it&#x27;s counterproductive to both sides.\n]<p>&quot;He colluded with Flynn and the Russians to undermine Obama and promote Trump.&quot;<p>Wrong. Note however that focusing on this conspiracy shows where the true power lies. When America interferes in Israeli politics it does so openly and without even much mention, because there&#x27;s no point, it&#x27;s that powerful (e.g. Clinton helping Peres and Barak, or V-15&#x27;s funding).<p>&quot;He gets whatever he wants from the US.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s why he got the same terms from Obama as he did from Trump, right? After all, it&#x27;s the same Nethanyahu. Nah. It&#x27;s American policy that changed.<p>All your list is part of Nethanyahu&#x27;s mystique (&quot;I speak perfect English! I can get the Americans to work in our favour! Even when the administration doesn&#x27;t support me, because I have so many connections and am so convincing it doesn&#x27;t matter!&quot;), which is very good for him electorally, but most Israelis have woken up from that.<p>P.S.<p>&quot;That&#x27;s more US political power than Chuck Schumer.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a trick question, right? Since Schumer has almost no power - no stage presence, minority in Senate. He can&#x27;t even threaten the filibuster. \n(What would he filibuster? The Judicial filibuster has been cancelled, and the Republicans barely have a legislative agenda.<p>After the GOP keeps majority, everything will be decided by Biden-GOP negotiations, and Schumer will have to sign the dotted line.)')
