She was streaming the The Voice on Hulu.<p>Is this some weird type of disinformation campaign against uber? I don&#x27;t like uber but it&#x27;s weird seeing a made up story like this. Only other place I have seen these is in some worker organizing efforts (which I generally support - but the made up stuff can just circulate like crazy).')
