And they&#x27;ve built a platform that targets mentally ill or vulnerable people in order to draw them into church, to monetize them through donations. That&#x27;s the short-term goal. To help them is the facade for it, but ultimately the aim is to convert them to the politics of the far right.\n&lt;<p>So get this, a church wanted to &quot;radicalize&quot; (recruit) people from downtrodden groups and then had the nerve to ask for donations!
