Being a grown adult is a huge advantage in men&#x27;s gymnastics and a massive disadvantage in women&#x27;s.<p>(I have a kid of each gender in local gymnastics programs and I have to carefully keep this stuff in mind. It&#x27;s great that the kids are strong, and gymnastics makes people absurdly strong, but I don&#x27;t think I would ever let my daughter anywhere near a high-level competitive program.)')
