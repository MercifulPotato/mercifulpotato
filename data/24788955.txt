That in itself is bullshit. If I had a billion to spend on insisting the sky had polkadots very few would believe it and most who say &quot;the sky is polkadotted&quot; would be taking the piss. Confusingly the zeitgeist itself is bullshit that unwittingly self-describes itself as the menance.<p>Really the example chosen was harmless - what makes the bullshit believed isn&#x27;t plausiblity but because &#x2F;they want to believe it&#x2F; and you cannot censor the inner desires, fears, and self-justifications. \nBut the facts don&#x27;t stop being true even if they believe the bullshit. That is what makes successful rationalizations so dangerous as reality comes home to roost as they insist it is safe to play in the street because cars always swerved out of the way before.<p>Really')
