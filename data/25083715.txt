They choose a provider that works for them on the budget and timeline that they have, and they build on that. Expanding to multiple providers isn&#x27;t always feasible depending on a company&#x27;s business model and financial state - it takes time and development resources to do so, which can both be very sparse for company with tight profit margins.<p>You have to start somewhere. Unless you have been handed a substantial amount of starting money and baked &quot;we need to be provider agnostic&quot; into your company beliefs from the beginning, it&#x27;s rarely an early priority.
