These were once bustling places full of holidaying industrial workers but as the UK&#x27;s industrial base declined so did these resorts; better service and weather was available overseas for not much more in terms of real cost.  My hometown is now a standard English costal town, renovated 50 years too late by private developers to whom the local authorities have sold or leased land at rock bottom prices, a heady mix of drug addicts, tracksuited iPhone Facebook addicts and old dears struggling with their trolley bags.  Still a lovely place to be when the weather is fine, but basically, purgatory.')
