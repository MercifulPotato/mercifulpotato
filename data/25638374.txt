However, anyone who rises to this kind of status by definition becomes elite even if they weren&#x27;t before, so it&#x27;s kind of a self fulfilling failure.  True revolution can probably only come from many non elite people seeking the same goal. This kind of revolution would most likely be squashed by someone elite.')
