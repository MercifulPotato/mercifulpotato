How do you feel about that?<p>I’m amazed at how many of my friends have MMJ cards or go to recreation stores and have no problem with their ID being scanned — fully unaware that they’re permanently rescinding their 2nd amendment rights so that they can get a little high.<p>This (IMO) is why Biden is unlikely to support federal legalization of pot, by the way. They want to keep it on the books with decriminalization and unenforcement policies so the ATF policy stays in place.<p>Anyway, my broader point is that buying marijuana, even in legal states, is not at all the same as buying beer or tea. You’re not made a second class citizen by buying tea or beer.')
