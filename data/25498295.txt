They then strike an agreement with the current owner to buy the company by having the company take a large loan (actually issue bonds, but it comes to the same thing) to pay off the current owners.  That&#x27;s called a &quot;leveraged buyout&quot; (in finance debt is often called leverage).<p>They then make those cuts and use the difference between revenue and costs to pay off the debt.  They then try to juice up the corpse in various ways to find someone to sell the company to before the long-term impact of the cuts becomes obvious.<p>This happens in any industry with stable revenue streams.  And healthcare has exactly that characteristic.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourfuture.org&#x2F;20120913&#x2F;sick-money-how-mitt-romneys-bain-investments-are-exploding-the-deficit-and-harming-our-health" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourfuture.org&#x2F;20120913&#x2F;sick-money-how-mitt-romneys-b...</a> for an article on this exact phenomena.')
