I frequently use “lots of things” on my computer: man pages, other installed documentation, will browse source code of libraries I’m using, or indeed my own previous work. I can do this if, say, I have no Internet connection, but that doesn’t mean I’ve got a fully-formed bug-free implementation of my goal floating around in my photographic memory.')
