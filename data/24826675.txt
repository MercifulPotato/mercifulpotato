Anytime I forget to bring headphones to listen to my iPod, I know I have an extra set in my backpack.<p>I purchased 10 USB chargers that attach magnetically. I keep 2 at the office, 1 in my gaming console, 1 in my computer, 2 in my car, 1 in the wall with an adapter next to my bed and have the other 3 set aside. The metal connectors wear out after a year or two of constant use. I recommend getting the 360 degree ones. I also bought two 3m USB extenders so I can plug in my console peripherals from where I sit while gaming. One for now, one for later just in case. Overall cost of this was ~$60 but it&#x27;s some of the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent. The convenience is incredible and since all the adapters are the same, they work with all my devices as long as they&#x27;re not being connected for data transfer reasons.<p>The best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought that has improved my life, has been an &quot;extra&quot; of anything I find myself using frequently.')
