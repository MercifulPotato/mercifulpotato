Our neighbours would also rescue and hand raise kangaroos from accidents, and release them on the property; the rescue roos were less scared of people than the native roos.<p>Anyway. One of the rescue roos, who we called Wattle, used to come around and play with our cat sometimes. The kangaroo - a medium female gray - was probably 170cm tall, and the cat was just a cat. They used to chase each other around the yard, for minutes at a time, and did so many times. It was hilarious.<p>Fun side fact: kangaroos love eating banana skins. Who knew?')
