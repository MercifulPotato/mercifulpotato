They optimize for a different thing. Rust definitely rocks at high-performance, resource management, fine grained control over all the aspects of the program, at the expense of developer&#x27;s time. Scala rocks at developer productivity and building abstractions, sacrificing a bit of performance.<p>However, I must say that Rust is also a very productive and quite powerful language (albeit IMHO not as powerful as Scala) and Scala is actually not that bad at performance either - probably better than a vast majority of other languages out there (albeit not as powerful as Rust or C++).<p>As far as ecosystems are considered - this is really hard to say. Rust has the whole C (and most of C++) ecosystem at hand plus a few really amazing Rust solutions like Cargo. Scala is limited mostly to JVM and JS, which are great ecosystems, but it is not true they offer everything. And there are still some caveats when using Java tools with Scala (e.g. profilers, debuggers or build systems).')
