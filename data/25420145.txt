C code is not written with the possibility of stack unwinding in mind and this introduces the possibility of non-visible, non-local control flow at every function call. The simple possibility of that would massively hurt codegen. One of the benefits of writing in C over C++ is that you donâ€™t have to worry about non-local control flow like exceptions.')
