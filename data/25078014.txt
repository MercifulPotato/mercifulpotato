Quite literally <i>every single fucking study</i> I&#x27;ve read that looks at this always says the exact same thing: being unattractive is correlated with lower salary, or being less likely to get a promotion, or being less likely to have other people think you are &quot;nice&quot;, etc. etc. I just feel like being unattractive is correlated with about every negative outcome one can think of, and at this point I just want to scream: I get it! Being ugly sucks. You don&#x27;t have to tell me twice (or five thousand times).')
