If you buy an apartment to rent, say, you can count on having return in the form of rents every month and on the property appreciating over time. So you can justify a very long payback period because at the end of 20 years the asset will be worth more than at year zero.<p>Solar panels generate cashflow in the form of electricity but they depreciate over time. So the payback period (in the form of cashflow) has to be much shorter than for an apartment or home.')
