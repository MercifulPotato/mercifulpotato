Your point is that there is a bar that kicks out patrons. Noted. So some people will avoid that bar. Why pretend that it’s open to all.<p>Clearly it’s only open to those who fit the bartender’s definition of acceptable conduct.<p>HST: Sensible people would opine that if the bartender doesn’t have want non bartender approved behaviour, he should clearly paste the instructions and definition of what’s acceptable and what’s not. Also: not serve alcohol or substances that encourage unruly behaviour.<p>In the current scenario, anything pro-trump is not acceptable. Done. We have established that. Case closed.<p>Conclusion: Big Tech is against free speech.<p>We need a baseline understanding of the rules of the game. Why are they acting coy about it? Why not state it and move on?')
