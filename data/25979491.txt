If you&#x27;re at a FIRE point, there&#x27;s no downside to trying to do possibly-job-ending things at your workplace. You&#x27;re ready to leave anyway.<p>And anyone who&#x27;s been at Google for a few years, even not at L5, will have no trouble finding a job elsewhere that pays as much (or more - last time I had a Google offer they flatly refused to match fintech salaries). Just make sure your name doesn&#x27;t get into stories like this and resign a bit early if it seems like you&#x27;re losing.')
