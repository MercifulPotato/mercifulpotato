I&#x27;m sure that the majority of political &quot;programs or demand&quot; have always been advanced with paranoid rhetoric. These are your enemies. This is how they deceive you. They are motivated by evil.<p>I think the most common mistake to think of the solution as civility and&#x2F;or facts or evidence based politics. The &quot;paranoid style&#x27;s&quot; primary (IMO) attribute is presenting the opposition as beyond salvation. They disingenuous, immoral, lying, evil people. Believe nothing they say. Question their motives. etc.<p>The actual opposite of this is broadly &quot;Gandhism.&quot; Pared down: Assuming that your opposition is decent, responds to generous gestures, and can be convinced of your position because it is true. That doesn&#x27;t mean that they aren&#x27;t your opposition, but the idea is to recruit and oppose simultaneously. You&#x27;re not trying to defeat anyone.<p>Ultimately, politics is a proxy for conflict. People understand conflict. It&#x27;s usually about creating a seething solidarity among your side to defeat an opponent. The &quot;paranoid style&quot; is also the rhetoric of generals motivating their troops. Your enemy is cruel and wicked.')
