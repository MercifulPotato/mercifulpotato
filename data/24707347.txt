That&#x27;s all it is, and yes, it is a non-story.<p>It&#x27;s infantile to suggest that Palantir&#x27;s stock is doing poorly because it is &quot;evil&quot; by some subjective judgement of the author, or because of Thiel&#x27;s unforgivable support of president Trump. These two things could be true and the stock would still be skyrocketing if Palantir&#x27;s financial performance supported it.<p>Investors just took a look at the balance sheets and decided (correctly, imho) that the company simply isn&#x27;t worth its rosy original IPO valuation of $41 billion.<p>As an aside, if you&#x27;re a software engineer and worked in the valley over the past decade or so, you noticed that Palantir has been trying to make a big deal out of itself, projecting a glamorous romantic image of its technology, talent, and success.<p>Since then, many of us have encountered some of the many engineers who left the company over the years, and especially over the past 5 or so years, and have come to realize that much of that was myth-making, smoke and mirrors.<p>Palantir seems to have an inflated self-image, and that has reflected in its branding and marketing to potential recruits in the past. It has also reflected in their original incredibly optimistic IPO valuation, which was simply unjustified by the volume of business they do.<p>However, all of that still has nothing to do with them being &quot;evil&quot;. If they managed to sell their &quot;evil&quot; technology to more companies, their stock would be skyrocketing. Their problem isn&#x27;t that potential customers see their technology as &quot;evil&quot;, but as less than compelling value offer. Due to their high burn rate and governance structure, investors now share the same opinion regarding their stock.')
