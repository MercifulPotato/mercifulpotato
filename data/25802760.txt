I feel like I am like that - I hate doing anything that requires me to develop only a superficial understanding (e.g. messing around with Kubernetes configuration without understanding how it all works on a fundamental level). I also don&#x27;t like systems that are hard to debug - I want to be able to make assumptions and test them, and that can sometimes be notoriously difficult with cloud-based infrastructure.')
