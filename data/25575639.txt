Your experience is not universal.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, I did not mean to sound patronizing, but rather enabling for people in similar situations to be aware of the choices they have.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve personally witnessed victims escalating the conflict into much worse situations.<p>Of course punching someone in the face can always result in them falling in a really bad way and just being dead right away!<p>My experience comes from a schoolkid age where body weight and muscle strength were still low enough to make that rather unlikely I would guess. Even if something bad had happened, I was still below the ago of criminal responsibility, so while neglecting the emotional and physical consequences for other people, consequences for me would have been a slap on the wrist.')
