Still wondering what @t0mas88 is using...\nThe upcoming Lidl remote is very interesting indeed, because it has 4 buttons which could be wired to a regular 2 button up&#x2F;down push switch as cheap friends of hue alternative. \nThe ikea 5 button remote is a little bit less suitable for this, with its combined on&#x2F;off button.')
