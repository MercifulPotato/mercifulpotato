QAnon and other BS is a virus that exploits the way platforms determine recommendations and whatnot.  The insurrection was not created by Facebook; at most you can only say that Facebook should have been more aggressively policing extremists on their platform (and in fact they have been improving their approach to moderation for years -- unfortunately the problem has been getting worse faster than Facebook has improved their handling of it).  Parler and Gab, on the other hand, were created as a protest against the moderation that happens on other platforms (even though that moderation is itself insufficient), and that is what they were held accountable for:  explicitly and deliberately not conducting moderation.<p>This &quot;both sides&quot; argument is getting tiresome.  Parler was created to be a safe haven for the very extremists Facebook is being criticized for not aggressively banning.  One side made the effort and came up short, the other side attacked the effort itself.  There is really not much of a comparison here.')
