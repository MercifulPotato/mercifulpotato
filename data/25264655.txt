Item(by='tcgv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606826826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25261651, text='Thanks for the detailed explanation, I understand your point now, but I&#x27;m still not convinced that it can&#x27;t be avoided&#x2F;managed properly.<p>The primitive jungle class example you provided is actually just a condensed view of a jungle, holding counters of &#x27;bananas&#x27; and &#x27;gorillas&#x27;, it only entangles two &quot;counters&quot; which is perfectly fine:<p><pre><code>   class Jungle:\n      int bananaCount;\n      int gorrillaCount;\n\n      removeBananaFromJungle():\n         bananaCount -= 1;\n</code></pre>\nNow lets say we improve it to add actual &#x27;banana&#x27; and &#x27;gorilla&#x27; classes, it may look something like this:<p><pre><code>   class Jungle:\n      List&lt;Banana&gt; bananas;\n      List&lt;Gorilla&gt; gorrillas;\n\n      removeBanana(banana):\n         bananas.remove(banana);\n</code></pre>\nIn this example &#x27;Jungle&#x27; is only an aggregate of &#x27;Banana&#x27; and &#x27;Gorilla&#x27;, whose behavior is abstracted away in their classes. Moreover &#x27;Jungle&#x27; only implements association logic. It&#x27;s completely possible to define another aggregate class for a space station that reuses bananas and gorillas in a different manner:<p><pre><code>   class SpaceStation:\n      List&lt;Banana&gt; bananas;\n      List&lt;Gorilla&gt; gorrillas;\n\n      removeBanana(banana):\n         bananas.remove(banana);\n</code></pre>\nYou could even allocate bananas and gorillas separately in your program (or unit tests) and play with them if you desire, without an aggregation class managing them. The important thing here is to <i></i>promote cohesion and avoid coupling<i></i>.<p>Sure, you could say that both &#x27;Jungle&#x27; and &#x27;SpaceStation&#x27; are duplicating logic, but it&#x27;s simply association logic at this point, nothing that prevents bananas and gorillas to live happily apart from each other. Furthermore, it&#x27;s highly likely that as the these classes evolve they may handle removal of bananas very differently, for instance, in the space station it will need to be disposed into the void, and in the jungle the disposed banana may be used to fertilize the soil.')
