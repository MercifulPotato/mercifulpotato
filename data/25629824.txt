Exciting stuff.<p>One important note (based on some comments here): generally, these in-CPU FPGAs have <i>very</i> fast reconfiguration.  Not sure if it&#x27;s 1, 10 or 100 cycles but it&#x27;s not milliseconds.  Actually, (in past examples) configuration might take milliseconds but it would load a number of planes of configurations: plane 0 might be MP3 audio device; plane 1 might be MPEG2 video device.  Then reconfiguration is: switch to plane 1.<p>This AMD proposal looks like it&#x27;s much more tightly integrated into the CPU so it&#x27;s got to be even faster.  Combine that with the deep knowledge of processor internals you&#x27;ll have to have to code for this thing and I&#x27;m having a hard time seeing you and me having much luck tinkering.  This is probably 99.99% data center with gnarly NDAs and field support.')
