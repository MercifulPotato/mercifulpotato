I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if native runtimes already do some of the same work; it&#x27;s just good practice when designing mixed-trust systems on Linux.<p>Docker&#x27;s specific implementation may offer other hurdles, of course, but AWS Lambda could easily use one of the many other implementations of OCI.')
