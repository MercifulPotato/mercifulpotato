It might be so, but there is a genuine reason behind not discussing the rules: they&#x27;re always off-topic. For people like me who come to HN to read an interesting discussion about tech issues, anything mentioning downvoting is almost automatically useless in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t bring any new information, it&#x27;s not interesting, it doesn&#x27;t affect me in any way.<p>Yes, if I were in charge of HN I would solve certain issues differently, and so would you, but it&#x27;s a private forum run by someone else, so we have to obey in order to participate, whether we like it or not. The very fact that we&#x27;re even having this discussion now means we prefer this place to any other in this moment. So you can&#x27;t say these rules don&#x27;t work.')
