When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always. None of the marketing copy should include the words &#x27;decentralization&#x27;, &#x27;privacy&#x27; etc. Normal users don&#x27;t care about any of this.<p>I think this isn&#x27;t quite the case-- these projects &quot;nearly always&quot; suffer due to decentralization being a priority.<p>Outside of perhaps darpanet, the decentralized projects that succeed do so because the decentralization is merely a value-neutral means to an end that satisfies a central use case.<p>E.g., compare usage of git to usage of every tool that tries to decentralize more parts of git in service of the general virtue of more decentralization.<p>Edit: clarification')
