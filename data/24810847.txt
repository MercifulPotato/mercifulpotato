In 99% of companies you are in a position because a company needs someone to do that thing specifically, and you might have your eye on something else internally but it&#x27;s less risk for management to hire someone new into that position than it is to leave your position uncovered. And you are not there to learn, it&#x27;s nice if you can learn of course, but the company is paying you to do the thing you do right now, giving the reason that you simply want to learn something new isn&#x27;t a compelling reason for an internal transfer for most companies, for that reason.')
