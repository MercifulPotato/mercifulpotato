(they list 3 diseases that can be effectively treated with shorter courses, and 2 that cannot)<p>Assuming that this is true, the correct response is to  prescribe shorter courses of antibiotics for diseases where that is indicated, NOT to stop telling patients that they need to finish the prescription.')
