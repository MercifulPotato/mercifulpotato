Item(by='giantrobot', descendants=None, kids=[24820709], score=None, time=1603005940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24810497, text='You don&#x27;t see the Internet breaking in your scenarios yet in all three the extra liability on the part of the host completely changes the calculus of even bothering with the endeavor. <i>You</i> may not want to start a Quora competitor but someone else likely does. The <i>needless</i> extra liability either breaks the business model entirely or makes it too expensive for a new player to break in. So the extra liability just locks in the big players.<p>You&#x27;re also far too focused on sites you seem to dislike. Making hosts liable for user content will also affect every single industry forum, mailing list, or chat system. A flame war on a Linux distros mailing list could very easily get that distro sued out of existence just defending itself. Even an innocent error on a wiki could open up a bunch of volunteers to legal liability.<p>The core problem that you&#x27;re ignoring or not seeing is user content doesn&#x27;t need to <i>be</i> libelous or illegal to end up in court. There&#x27;s legal trolls that sue people for stupid or frivolous shit all the time. Simply defending yourself costs money which is something a Linux distro or a fan maintained wiki don&#x27;t tend to have in abundance. It&#x27;s hard enough to sue some mailing list member or wiki contributor that it tends to only happen with legitimate issues. But if the bar is lowered that hosts become liable for user content the legal trolls will descend. It&#x27;s not just the legal trolls with civil suits, there will be plenty of DAs and AGs looking for easy wins (to score political points) that will go after sites for stupid reasons.<p>Sites that can&#x27;t afford some moderation service or liability insurance will just avoid user generated content. They&#x27;ll also remove existing content, you know - scrub it from their site, because there&#x27;s no way of knowing it won&#x27;t attract a lawsuit. You assume defamatory content gets tagged by the poster as &quot;#defamatory&quot; and it&#x27;s then immediately obvious.<p>Stack Overflow might take down an obvious troll post but what about a post pointing out a bug in a software product? If some developer became sufficiently upset they could sue SO because someone pointed out a major bug in their software. A completely above board discussion of a bug could easily be seen by the developer as defamatory. Just responding to a suit would cost SO money let alone actually defending themselves. There&#x27;s a wide gulf between dealing with obviously offensive&#x2F;malicious content and being under constant threat of legal action no matter how good your moderation.<p>If you don&#x27;t publish anyone else&#x27;s content you&#x27;re fine. I don&#x27;t give a shit about you. Maybe your personally published content is worthwhile, maybe it&#x27;s complete shit. I don&#x27;t know or care. But I do know there&#x27;s some YouTube channels I really enjoy that wouldn&#x27;t exist without YouTube as a platform. I have also benefited a great deal from Wikipedia among several other wikis that would not be able to operate if they were constantly threatened in court. I&#x27;ve definitely benefitted from product reviews, restaurant reviews, and OpenStreetMap contributions. All of <i>that</i> content I know has been worthwhile and I would much rather it exist and the platforms that enable it to exist.')
