Once the community starts doing things one way that&#x27;s it, even if it is a dumb way, the herd mentality causes the dumb way to become established. Redux is one of those dumb ways.<p>&gt; <i>Because 30% of the business logic was inside Redux-Saga, I marked it as a high risk.</i><p>Business logic should be written in POJO. Plain Old JavaScript Objects. Using a library such as Redux is a dumb way, but this is the community-embraced, herd-mentality way.<p>&gt; <i>I will not encourage using it for enterprise applications.</i><p>Use Web Components. Using the flavor-of-the-month JavaScript libs for a large application that must live years or decades is not justifiable.')
