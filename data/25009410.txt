You could come up with one, theoretically. Heck, you could distribute the OG coins via proof-of-work if you wanted to, which is more or less what I believe Ethereum would do, as it started out as a proof-of-work chain and would swap at some point.<p>That actually might be the best way, as you&#x27;re proving that you believe the coin is worth something in the beginning by burning work, giving your initial stake consequences.')
