So it&#x27;s a huge potential <i>threat</i> to their businesses. And if self-driving makes rides much cheaper, that can significantly boost the size of the market. But that does not imply that they can&#x27;t be successful and profitable businesses in a world without self-driving cars, which is the frequently-made claim in the top post.')
