I strongly suspect the latter.<p>Keep in mind that moderating a public forum is mostly a solved problem, people have done so (often benevolently) for decades. The social media companies&#x27; pleas about moderation being impossible at scale is bullshit - it&#x27;s only impossible because they&#x27;re trying to eat the cake and have it too. When the incentives are aligned, moderation is a solved problem.')
