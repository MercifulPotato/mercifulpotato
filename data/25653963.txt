The majority of regulations and standards in consumer&#x2F;public facing engineering works are written in blood.  Saying that we &quot;tried a bunch of different ones and found one that worked best&quot; does a disservice to the people that died for us to learn our lessons.  Retreading the cowboy attitude that led to these regulations is not something that should be encouraged.')
