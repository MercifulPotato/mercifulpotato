It will just take longer as it will have to use slower more personal communication channels.<p>That&#x27;s a good thing. Let&#x27;s say there are dozens of radical theories circulating, and suppose one of them really is the next Galileo type situation, and the rest really are just utterly insane.<p>If they all have to spread by the slower more personal channels any given person will likely only be exposed to maybe two or three of them. They aren&#x27;t overwhelmed by them, and that gives them a better chance of figuring out that the stupid ones are in fact stupid. It is usually much more work to refute a theory, even a stupid one, than to come up with it, and the slow spread gives time for the refutations to be developed and put out there.<p>If they were all on the fast mass audience channels, people get exposed to so many of them that they don&#x27;t have time to really figure out if they make sense, and (2) even if a good refutation is out it is easy to miss it in all the noise.')
