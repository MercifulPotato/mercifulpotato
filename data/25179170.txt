Hmmm.<p>Maybe I should have wrote &quot;5G will displace wifi&quot;.<p>If I had to guess, Apple&#x27;s notion for personal networking will be multi protocol. Bluetooth, wifi, 5G, UWB, NFC, etc. In combination. And Dediu&#x27;s point is the 5G will finally be able a viable wifi replacement for a large fraction of Apple users.<p>Like all tech, wifi will peak, plateau, then long slow decline.<p>Question related to your point:<p>Will self-hosted 5G be an option? eg Will Microsoft be able to (feasibly) run their own campus 5G network?<p>Zero trust networking and software defined networks, for both consumer and enterprises, will definitely become the preferred solution. So me running my own LAN becomes less important. In that world, maybe self-hosting becomes &quot;virtual&quot;.')
