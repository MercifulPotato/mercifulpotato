There are three million US citizens in Puerto Rico without representation in Congress.<p>&quot;Statehood is too easy&quot; is probably the wrong critique. The problem is that there is not clear enough guidelines for enforcing some criteria for what constitutes a new state. Thus we have a false positive like Wyoming, which shouldn&#x27;t be a state with its minuscule population, and we a false negative in Puerto Rico, which is anachronistically governed like a colony .<p>I don&#x27;t have the numbers in front of me, but I don&#x27;t think the original senate had states that had 80X the representation by population, as we have today between CA and WY.')
