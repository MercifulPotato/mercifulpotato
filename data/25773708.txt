My taxes pay into their and their peers education, it pays into their and their peers healthcare costs, it pays into my own retirement so that they will not have to worry about feeding me when I grow old. It pays into a social security net so that if there is an economic crash they will still have food on the table and a warm home.<p>This means the number in my wallet and bank account may look smaller, but I still live a rich life with money to spend however I want.<p>It&#x27;s the exact opposite of complacency.')
