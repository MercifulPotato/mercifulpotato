It seems to be the most common modern use (&quot;check your privilege&quot; and so on). It sounds as if those people don&#x27;t deserve it.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, because I think it used to mean exactly the opposite, having a privilege was an honor. Is the phrase &quot;it was a privilege to have known you&quot; still being used?')
