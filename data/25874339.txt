And we didn&#x27;t. Why do you think China rose out of poverty so quickly?<p>Now, China is not only technologically competitive, but an authoritarian regime. Theft of IP no longer represents trying to get to where the rest of the world is, but rather trying to dominate it. At the same time, every advantage the CCP gets is quickly utilized not just to intimidate neighbors, but to oppress the Chinese people.<p>Even if we go so far as to say the situation is exactly the same otherwise, (I might get hate on HN for this) &#x27;why&#x27; you do something matters too. If you do it for freedom and democracy vs. authoritarianism, that matters.')
