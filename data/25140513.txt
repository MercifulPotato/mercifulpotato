It&#x27;s compared by underpaid and overworked poll workers, definitely not by handwriting experts. There&#x27;s also the problem that they&#x27;re often having to compare a digital pen-and-stylis signature to a &quot;wet&quot; signature on the ballot.<p>Additionally, most people below the age of 30, and anyone without reason to spend time signing legal documents, won&#x27;t have a consistent signature that matches the one on file that they provided when they were 16. It&#x27;s also no coincidence to the discussion that those signatures also have a comparatively extremely high rejection rate among black people.<p>All of these are demographics that tend to vote a particular way, by the way, which is why you hear the other side complaining.<p>Once again, it&#x27;s purely about expanding democracy.')
