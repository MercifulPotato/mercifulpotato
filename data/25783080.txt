And while I&#x27;ve had great results for a few specific recipes, I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s not a universal egg replacement, and it&#x27;s hard to tell which recipes it will and won&#x27;t work in.<p>I bake a lot of gluten-free and grain-free breads and biscuits, and aquafaba is a great egg replacement in these. Sometimes it even produces a better texture. But in other recipes, like cookies, it doesn&#x27;t work at all; the dough loses its shape completely and deflates into a puddle.<p>I&#x27;ve also read about using aquafaba to make meringue or mousse, but I haven&#x27;t had good luck with that so far. The chickpea taste is strong, and does not go with sugar at all.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried using any beans other than chickpeas. Maybe it would work better with different beans.')
