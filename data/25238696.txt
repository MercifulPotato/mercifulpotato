Brake pad PM2.5 is 3x that of tires but both pale into insignificance next to exhaust PM2.5 at almost 10x that of brake pad and tire emissions added together.<p>The nice thing about EVs is those exhaust emissions are moved away from the tailpipe in populated areas to power generation facilities.<p>The efficiency of electric vehicles is almost 3x that of the gasoline cycle of drilling, transporting, distilling, transporting again, combusting then achieving almost 30% motion from the chemical energy of gas.<p>So because of this efficiency thereâ€™s just less emissions overall even though the emissions are away from population centres.<p>Then lastly, the emissions are consolidated in one place so capture and cleaning becomes viable.<p>EVs are not perfect but they are so much better than gasoline powered vehicles that if you can at all accomodate the switch, then it would be great to consider it.')
