Item(by='kevincox', descendants=None, kids=[25051752], score=None, time=1605035717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25049971, text='&gt; KeepassXC is pretty good about intelligent merging<p>Forgive me if I am not understanding the tools, but my impression is that if the file changed in two places at the same time Syncthing doesn&#x27;t give the app a chance and just duplicates the file with two names.<p>So do you mean that you select all of the conflicting files in KeepassXC and it merges them? If so that seems like a nice option, I didn&#x27;t realize it had that feature :)')
