The ordering key is the only unit a user has to deal with: think user ID or database row primary key. Throughput is limited to 1MB&#x2F;s per ordering key, but the number of ordering keys is limited only by what can be represented in a 1KB string. One can have millions of keys if desired and they don&#x27;t need to be known in advance.<p>The system scales automatically as needed, so there is no need to think in terms of partitions or worry about repartitioning when load increases. Order is preserved through this scaling without the user having to do anything.<p>Disclaimer: I work on Cloud Pub&#x2F;Sub and am the primary engineer on the ordering feature.')
