The insurrectionist hew from red states that are lagging the rest of the country hard.  Less educated, under or unemployed, very little upward mobility, extreme feelings of powerlessness (hence the gun fetish to feel powerful) and truly are not really represented by anyone in government except their local officials and congressmen&#x2F;senators.
