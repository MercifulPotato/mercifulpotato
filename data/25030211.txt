I like the polished look and the usability. To be completely honest, I don&#x27;t need to have a shell running on my phone. I&#x27;m not going to write a shell script to automate anything on the tiny screen of my iPhone 8. iSh is an emulator anyway! But, like many other curious users, I don&#x27;t want to lose the ability to do it. Especially when the hardware is a lot more capable that what the OS supports. I understand that Apple does it for &quot;security&quot; purposes!! They should at least enable this on iPad OS. May be warn the users about the &quot;perils&quot; of &quot;foreign code&#x27;! I&#x27;ve been using iSH since the TestFlight days. I played around and downloaded packages. Even downloaded Perl! Now that&#x27;s gone. I can sideload it using Xcode, but not everyone has a Mac to do it.')
