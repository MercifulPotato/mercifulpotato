This low success rate—and the fact that 4 of them occurred in one year, 1999—are what linger in the space community’s memory.<p>&gt; For example, an examination of the timeline reveals an often-missed observation: the first 9 of 10 missions were successful, a 90% success rate. The FBC approach broke when proposed missions began getting more ambitious without a change in schedule and cost cap. The early successes made everyone overconfident and the missions became too aggressive for their constraints, leading to failures (Launius and McCurdy 2005):<p>&gt;<p>&gt; “In hindsight, it becomes apparent that [NASA’s] success in the nineties had led the review and selection committees to accept very ambitious and complex proposals with a very high science return on budgets and schedules that were quite optimistic.”<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elizabethafrank.com&#x2F;colliding-worlds&#x2F;fbc" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elizabethafrank.com&#x2F;colliding-worlds&#x2F;fbc</a><p>Pathfinder and Sojourner demonstrated new technologies and were done on a budget <i>smaller</i> than one of Viking&#x27;s experiments.
