He believes he is by default an expert on the &#x27;user friendliness&#x27; of programming.<p>His comments don&#x27;t really make much sense, and come across as whining that should be ignored.<p>&quot;People hate command lines - not only do they LOOK scary, they give weird unhelpful error messages andâ€¦ you have to type everything.
