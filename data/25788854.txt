He believes he is by default an expert on the &#x27;user friendliness&#x27; of programming.<p>His comments don&#x27;t really make much sense, and come across as whining that should be ignored.<p>&quot;People hate command lines - not only do they LOOK scary, they give weird unhelpful error messages andâ€¦ you have to type everything. Ugh. &quot;<p>You have to type to write programs. I truly believe that this person has had a conversation with friends about how programs should write themselves by you just telling them vaguely what problem you&#x27;d like to solve. And unhelpful error messages? You know what would be an unhelpful error message? &#x27;ls&#x27; outputting a commandline tutorial every time I mistype a directory name so that people like this can have his hand held and continue to be intellectually lazy.<p>I have no patience any more for lazy know it alls in regards to programming.')
