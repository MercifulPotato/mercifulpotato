It was only for 8 months until I had the hardware removed, but it was constant, jaw clenching, phone-ringing-in-the-ears white-out pain that lasted for months.<p>There&#x27;s no position in you can sit in to relieve it. You can&#x27;t move or adjust to make it go away, even for a minute (there were a few times it went away, but very few). It&#x27;s not like when you cut yourself doing something dumb and the initial pain subsides. This pain  just. kept. going. Initially I was on Dilaudid, and then morphine, but the constipation was awful, and mental disassociation and hallucinations were scary. I started Oxy, but was scared of addiction so I didn&#x27;t take it as often. I just kept popping Ibuprofin like candy. I even meditated, but it didn&#x27;t do much because it&#x27;s hard to learn something like that on-demand.<p>The pain finally went away after the hardware removal. But you know what? I have a persistant fear of being like that again. I can&#x27;t imagine what I would do if it was every day and there was no known source like OP.')
