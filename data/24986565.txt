The island is beautiful and just teeming with life.<p>There has been a tremendous effort to help the ecosystem recover from the damage done by whaling. I don&#x27;t know what can be done but I really hope the best for the island. It&#x27;d be a shame to lose it, both for a wildlife and for future generations.')
