They might need a new chipset if the newer memory type wasn&#x27;t actually addressable with the FPGA (not enough pins, not enough signalling capacity, not enough voltage flexibility, etc).<p>For the majority of users, they don&#x27;t change the cpu, motherboard, or memory for the life of the computer (in many cases, some or all of these parts are soldered to the board). Paying more for flexibility that will never be used isn&#x27;t good for anyone.')
