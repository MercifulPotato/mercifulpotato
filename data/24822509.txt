It writes as if other salt deposits didn&#x27;t originate in some kind of ancient body of water, and it uses the fact that they&#x27;re harvesting a brine to imply that the entire bloody ocean is still hiding under the Appalachians, so that by buying their salt you&#x27;re buying &quot;sea salt&quot; (and all the naturalist voodoo that might entail) but without any of the contaminants of modern oceans.
