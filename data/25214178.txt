Using &quot;web&quot; interchangeably with &quot;internet&quot; is just confusing to me and that&#x27;s what I was trying to clarify. I did learn however that Telegram&#x27;s usage of hCaptcha suggests that this is a technology bigger than what we usually call the web.<p>&gt; The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.<p>Edit: but to be fair I totally brought this semantics debate upon myself by raising the question of the difference between the web and the internet. Not sure why I took on a whiny tone about that, haha')
