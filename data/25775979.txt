But even so that’s not representative of the whole.  Also death threats happen all the time.  And I know everyone thinks these people are idiots but the fact none of those Molotov cocktails burned down buildings, and none of those guns shot people, proved they weren’t trying to murder.  Because if they were lots of people would have been murdered.  That guy in Las Vegas is someone who wanted to murder.  And lots of people were murdered when he fired from that hotel. These people did none of that.  They are all idiots true but that’s about it.')
