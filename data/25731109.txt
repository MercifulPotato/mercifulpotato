The intent is to look back and see if you accomplished your goal or not. If you don&#x27;t have a measurement, then you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve meet your goal. Something such as &#x27;I want to be a good parent to my kid&#x27; Isn&#x27;t specific, nor is it attainable. Setting a goal of &#x27;I want to spend an hour of time a day with my child&#x27; is both specific and measurable.<p>&gt;&quot; Sometimes, they are so far off in the future that you don&#x27;t think about them until it is too late because you thought you could do them.&quot;<p>Seems like the contradicts the &#x27;Relevant&#x27; part of SMART.<p>I see this as a framework to help you focus in on your goal instead of making wishes at the start of ever new year. &#x27;I&#x27;m going to lose weight this year&#x27; Okay, how are you going to do that? Are you going to exercise and eat less? Okay, how much or both and how will you know if you met those micro goals? Given what we know about weight loss at the moment, what&#x27;s a reasonable goal weight for March, June, August?')
