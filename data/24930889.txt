In particular, why the former (belief) would influence the latter (behavior)?<p>I firmly believe, based on overwhelming evidence, that genetics makes most people perform terribly in technical roles. Fortunately, there are a few bright, above-average exceptions that perform amazingly. If someone proves they&#x27;re competent, I&#x27;ll treat them competently, but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t make sense to assume that the average person could be anywhere <i>near</i> competent.<p>Edit: answer to your second question: I try to be inclusive, I don&#x27;t believe in drawing lines, at least not when it comes to belief (only behavior).')
