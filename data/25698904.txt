The cause of the act in both cases is the perpetrators warped sense of ownership.  Specifically ownership of other&#x27;s thoughts, body, and time.  They would feel entitled to that ownership whether met with resistence or not.  In this case censorship seems reasonable otherwise you end up tacitly fostering the perpetrators view of ownership with your submission.')
