Note these ones:<p>&quot;<i>Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;<i>Please don&#x27;t fulminate. Please don&#x27;t sneer, including at the rest of the community.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;<i>Please don&#x27;t use uppercase for emphasis. If you want to emphasize a word or phrase, put asterisks around it and it will get italicized.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;<i>Please don&#x27;t use Hacker News for political or ideological battle. It tramples curiosity.</i>&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
