However you will find it quite hard to write down what you mean in this case since your statement doesn&#x27;t work even if you talk about other situations.<p>Like should you hire a guy to manually set a field in new entries in the database every night instead of writing a short script to do it for you? That is a non code solution, so your answer would be yes. But I&#x27;d say no, that is a dumb solution. You could say &quot;But don&#x27;t follow this rule when it obviously does apply&quot;, then I say that figuring out when the rule applies and doesn&#x27;t apply is a part of being a great software engineer. Short platitudes like what you wrote sounds great but are actually mostly nonsense.')
