Relative pitch would be enough to be able to &quot;auditorize&quot; (like &quot;visualize&quot; but for sound) works in his mind.<p>Having studied music from an early age when as he says his hearing was superlative, he would have internalized the timbre of each instrument through its playable range, and could use that knowledge to choose what (absolute) pitch to choose for various passages. He would not have to &quot;hear&quot; the absolute pitch in his head; melody and harmony are invariant to transposition.<p>That said, he may have had perfect pitch, but that in itself would not enable him to hear a complex orchestral piece in his head.<p>BTW none of the Beatles had perfect pitch.')
