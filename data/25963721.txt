Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25964191, 25967828, 25964125], score=None, time=1611959998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25961614, text='I think the &#x27;political optics&#x27; win for Johnson is going to more likely be: &quot;We are the first major country to reach near full vaccination&quot;.<p>Bibi in Israel is facing intense political ambiguity, and they are paying 3-4x (for the vaccines) what other countries are paying, and have apparently been doing some behind the scenes shenanigans for acquisition, I mean it&#x27;s Isreal, that&#x27;s what they do (no offence to those who might take it that way but they are the most realpolitik country on planet earth). They are <i>way</i> ahead of anyone else and I suggest this is Bibi&#x27;s political salvation plan.<p>Boris, similarly.<p>It&#x27;s a little bit conspiratorial, but wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there are some behind the scenes actions by UK gov. to make sure the UK is first.<p>Also consider that the EU is frankly playing a losing hand and they look really bad from this.<p>This is a major existential crisis and if China, US and UK end up with full vaccinations months ahead of the EU it&#x27;s going to be very, very damaging.<p>At minimum, the EU has to make a very big public stink about it to ensure people know&#x2F;believe that the EU is doing what is possible, to mitigate the damage and possibly to be able to push the blame a little bit to others.<p>Finally - there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the UK offering the EU help, and that it would also end up being good PR. The problem with the claim is not that it&#x27;s &#x27;sickening&#x27; but rather it&#x27;s frankly not a huge material PR win. It&#x27;s a nice thing but it&#x27;s only worth a news cycle or two.<p>Having the UK immunized a few months ahead of the EU, irrespective of the underlying realities, is going to be something that will be remembered and analyzed for a decade.<p>Frankly, in the end, I actually think it&#x27;s far too risky for any EU&#x2F;UK politicos to be playing underhanded games, the blowout would be devastating. I just think it&#x27;s a matter of operational reality that the UK is doing well on this (note they are doing very poorly on infections), though I do feel EU has dropped the ball on securing vaccines from a wider base. Even Canada has put in options to purchase from a variety of sources.')
