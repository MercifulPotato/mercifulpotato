If the companies responsible for making these decisions were optimizing just a tad bit more for practicality and usability rather than just profit, ECC would be the standard and that would be the end of that. Similar to how a lot of luxury and non-luxury cars will have seemingly essential and cheap equipment only available as part of an expensive options package - the cost of producing and installing the extra equipment is a mere fraction of the total package cost, a large majority will end up buying the package anyway (and 100% would if money was no object). One might argue that this practice is part and parcel of modern industrial markets, and is almost fair - prices are arbitrary and consumers get to pay for the value they get out of something, there is no optimal, moral way to determine what someone&#x27;s margins should be, yadda yadda. In my opinion, usually the market will choose what are acceptable margins on a given product and&#x2F;or service, but with 2 thousand dollar parking sensors and double-the-price ECC memory, with artifical segmentation, I&#x27;m paying not for the manufacturing and delivery of a product with a feature I want, but instead I&#x27;m having to pay for the opportunity of being able to have the product with the features I want + the manufacturing and delivery.')
