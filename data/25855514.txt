What&#x27;s considered the &#x27;same outcome&#x27;. If I kill baby Hitler, would the universe create another just like him? Or someone else will do same things? If someone else does them, surely it won&#x27;t (for example) kill as much people. So someone dead would now be alive in the future (or vice versa). And now the outcome isn&#x27;t the same yeah?<p>Sorry but this is bs.')
