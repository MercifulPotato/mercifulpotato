I made the switch a couple years back and haven&#x27;t looked back, with one exception- my city&#x27;s utilities company blacklists protonmail, so in the handful of times I&#x27;ve emailed them (specifically there were three times they&#x27;ve shut off my water because someone with a very similar looking address didn&#x27;t pay their bill) with proof of something-or-other, it supposedly doesn&#x27;t make it to their communal or &quot;personal&quot; inboxes. This is the only time I&#x27;ve had this kind of problem though- protonmail has served me well.')
