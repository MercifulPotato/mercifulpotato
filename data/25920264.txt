A machine learning model is basically remembered weights. Everything we&#x27;ve learned is what we remember as solidified in our neurons, etc.<p>Note that learning is not about discovering yourself. You also learn if you&#x27;re capable of remembering (and optionally applying) something that somebody else taught you. Students e.g. learn a formula for X, the periodic table, etc.<p>And this contraption not only remembers (that is, learns), but also has an algorithm to figure the solution in the first place (that is, tries and discovers).<p>So the title &quot;machine learning&quot; or even &quot;AI&quot; is perfectly legitimate. It&#x27;s not GAI, but it&#x27;s also not 2020 (not that we have GAI in 2020).')
