They wouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near as insane as they are.<p>These same forces are causing the stock market and real estate to go apeshit in the middle of a pandemic-driven massive recession, which is in some ways even more insane than Bitcoin.<p>We are in a chronically demand-constrained economy. Until we actually recapitalize the consumer, nothing will change. We&#x27;ll continue to print money forever in an attempt to revitalize the economy, and all it will do is inflate more bubbles and probably even nuttier ones.')
