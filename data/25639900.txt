The common thread I&#x27;m finding in the people that don&#x27;t mind their commute is generally that... their commute isn&#x27;t terrible.<p>Mine&#x27;s 45m-1h to work, and 1h-2h home in a city with notoriously awful traffic design and flow. It&#x27;s basically just 5 miles of gridlock. In the heavy urban traffic I find it actually _adds_ a lot of stress to my day--it definitely feels like a mad max style survival adventure more than anything.<p>I used to commute 45 minutes each way on a nice dual line divided highway with very light traffic. Barring the odd blizzard, I found it like you describe... A great chance to let my mind switch states between home&#x2F;work. And it was nice to have an hour and a half every day where I _couldn&#x27;t_ beat up on myself for not being productive and could actually just truly sit and enjoy listening to a podcast or something.')
