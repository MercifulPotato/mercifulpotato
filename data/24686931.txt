FYI, IAAL; I don&#x27;t claim to be the world&#x27;s greatest, but my clients seem to appreciate it when I tell them that I think that Contingencies X, Y, and Z are acceptable business risks for their situation — after explaining the nature of the risk — and I&#x27;ve never had any kind of malpractice claim, knock on wood.<p>Example: Many years ago, on the afternoon of the last day of the quarter (when lots of business gets closed for financial-reporting purposes), a software-company client&#x27;s VP of sales — with whom I&#x27;d worked for years — called me and described a situation, saying &quot;the customer wants to change our contract to say X.&quot; I asked a couple of questions and then said &quot;there&#x27;s always the possibility of Bad Situation B coming up, but it&#x27;s unlikely, and it&#x27;d be manageable if it did — go ahead.&quot; The VP said &quot;Thank you — bye!&quot; and slammed down the phone. (That VP went on to CEO positions at two other companies and uses me to this day.)')
