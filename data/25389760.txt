It cannot verify that you agree on what those types and operations mean.<p>For example, `Iterator` isn&#x27;t very useful without being able to agree on what `Iterator::next`&#x27;s `Option` means. So implicit structural traits รก la Go is somewhere between useless and actively harmful.<p>You can have nominal traits while allowing orphan instances (that is, implementations of foreign traits on foreign types). Scala and Haskell both have that. But IMO neither has a good solution for the conflicts that inevitably arise in that case.')
