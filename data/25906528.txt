Based on my very limited personal experiences, you gotta commit to making a change (see above videos). Many addicts just aren&#x27;t ready to leave their vices for a better life. No amount of rehab will help someone if they aren&#x27;t ready to commit to a change.<p>&gt; society failed them.<p>Sorry if this sounds conservative, but trying to blame other people for your problems doesn&#x27;t really get you any where. Society throws problems at everyone, some more than others. Laying around complaining or rejecting it doesn&#x27;t improve anyone&#x27;s situation.<p>People need to apply critical thinking skills and tackle their own issues (hence the need for an addict needing to commit to the idea of solving the problem of their addiction).<p>Ex-homeless&#x2F;addicts getting together to correct &quot;society failed&quot; them problems via AA meetings is an excellent example of people that apply critical thinking skills and try to help.')
