Is inflation a product of regulations? of corruption? or was it caused by central banks and politicians&#x27; stupidity?<p>Those are all very different situations that require very different approaches, but because the &quot;inflation-good deflation-bad&quot; mantra has been repeated for so long (without any actual proof!) idiots now can&#x27;t see past it, and think it&#x27;s fine because they call themselves economists.')
