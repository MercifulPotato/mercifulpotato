Not everyone is going to be interested in STEM, but building intuition about the world is important. Seeing the pattern in odd&#x2F;even, thinking about stuff orbiting in space instead of the simply the everyday world where the sun appears on one side and sets on the other. It reminds me of that US thing where a tweet said that $500M distributed amongst the entire US population would be over a million dollars per person, instead of over one per person. I think it got picked up by the news, without anyone noticing that $500M&#x2F;328M != $1.xM.<p>It makes me think of people complaining about some of the high school maths. While, most of it isn&#x27;t <i>needed</i> for the average person on most days, it happens in everyday life that you can save yourself some time and effort by using a little math.')
