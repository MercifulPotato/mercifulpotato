I think sentience is an interesting enough phenomenon that others with sentience will be interested. As soon as you understand the mind of the other, there’s a basic interest in meeting other minds.<p>The real issue is simply the vastness of time and space, and perhaps an underestimation of the difficulties involved in bridging those. Especially economic costs of space travel.<p>And it’s kind of like the point made in this clip about the silliness of Fermi’s paradox... it’s like assuming if no lobster shows up to your dinner party, lobsters don’t exist.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;TK0vmOCHiDs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;TK0vmOCHiDs</a>')
