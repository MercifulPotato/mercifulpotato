Even if you are right, it will still be here in that age group.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a nature paper from last week that shows incredible correlation between Sun UVB at 34% of equator and the date that a wave starts. Covid will be gone by June, just like last year, thanks entirely to that effect (and possibly arrive again in Sep&#x2F;Oct, or not). I&#x27;m not interested in meterology, but it&#x27;s possible that even if I&#x27;m right, by end of March covid will be very dim in correlation with UVB exposure.<p>The amount of data actually attributable to cause and effect is incredibly miniscule. I do data science for a living. The headlines are basically all wrong, most discussions are, and quite a bit of the primary data cannot be right.<p>added: p.s - Did you actually read the papers before calling me a lier (or after?) or just did it based on headlines. I&#x27;m not holding it against you either way, just wondering.')
