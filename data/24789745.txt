The increase regulations that would need to be added would probably not be worth it for open source projects. People who get funding would likely need to submit a lot of documentation, there&#x27;d also probably be weird rules about non U.S. citizens etc... and laws would need to be passed.<p>I think 18F&#x27;s modular contracting methodology is highly effective for this sort endeavor, if you can take the opinion that they&#x27;re the sponsor and benevolent dictator driving that part of the codebase (and the code developed is open sourced upon confirmation acceptance criteria has been met).<p>Thank you for switching to an open development model.
