It doesn&#x27;t feel the same though since Twitter feels like a much more hostile environment to put thoughts out. Twitter seems to prioritize your take on what you&#x27;re sharing moreso than the content you&#x27;re sharing. This leads to endless arguments based on just reading headlines and importing baggage into the article that isn&#x27;t there.')
