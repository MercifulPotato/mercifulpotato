I genuinely believe in the next 10 years or less, twitter will be looked at the way we look at cigarettes.<p>There was a point when cigarettes were looked at as a mere nuisance, but eventually we as a society realized how terrible they are for us.<p>That’s twitter.  And to be clear: I mean twitter specifically.  Facebook and the others are bad as well, but twitter is <i>by far</i> the worst.  Tech journalists don’t tend to write about it though since they are the ones using it.  They’d rather write about Facebook.<p>You know: those dastardly OTHERS who are RUINING things and need to better.  Pay attention!')
