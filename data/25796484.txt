Item(by='biztos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610744778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25795625, text='&gt; Police unions may protect bad apples via union.<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that at least some police unions work strongly against the interests of <i>society</i> -- but I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence that they work against the interests of their members.<p>Sure, if you&#x27;re an honest cop it probably stings that a murderer can collect his pension like nothing happened; but on the other hand, you know the same protection would be available to you if you were accused.<p>Or consider that, famously, the NYPD doesn&#x27;t consider itself beholden to the Mayor.  I can&#x27;t believe that attitude would work without the union.  And the unions can also very publicly take political positions that are contrary to their employers&#x27; or even the majority of the citizenry -- which looks to me like a serious demonstration of power.<p>At least in the case of police unions in the US, I can&#x27;t see how they are a negative example from the point of view of people who might end up as union members.')
