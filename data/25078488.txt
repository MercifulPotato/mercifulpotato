You might be interested to read about it here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinarpe&#x2F;kevinarpe-rambutan3&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;rambutan3&#x2F;check_args&#x2F;RCheckArgs.py#L149" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinarpe&#x2F;kevinarpe-rambutan3&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master...</a><p>I have used that library on multiple projects for my job.  It makes the code run about 50% slower, on average, because all the type checking is done at run-time.  I am OK with the slow down because I don&#x27;t use Python when I need speed.  My &quot;developer speed&quot; was greatly improved with stricter types.<p>Finally, this isn&#x27;t the first time I wrote a type checking library&#x2F;framework.  I did the same for Perl more than 10yrs ago.  Unfortunately, that code is proprietary, so not open source.  :(  The abstract ideas were very similar.  Our team was so frustrated with legacy Perl code, so I wrote a type checking library, and we slowly applied it to the code base.  About two years later, it was much less painful!')
