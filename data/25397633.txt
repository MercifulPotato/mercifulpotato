I haven&#x27;t used it on big projects (plus I&#x27;m not a web dev currently) but I found it to be more &quot;config when you need to change the defaults&quot; than &quot;no config&quot;. But that&#x27;s great. It works out of the box for a lot of stuff and you add some dotfiles when you want to customise.<p>I do want to try snowpack too though.')
