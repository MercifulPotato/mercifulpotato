Usually a side project is about chasing a curiosity in a piece of tech or a workflow change or something. &quot;Could I build a faster CI pipe in Terraform?&quot; &quot;Could I write this Kafka consumer in Java?&quot; &quot;Can I containerize this?&quot;. Things that aren&#x27;t really about &quot;completing&quot; or &quot;shipping.&quot;<p>I think that people like me often forget that one of the biggest drivers for working on projects past when they become interesting is the money I receive for working on them. If I&#x27;m not being paid, it becomes difficult to fathom struggling for 10 hours on building something past when it&#x27;s particularly interesting. Once any personal project would require basically any UI work, that&#x27;s about when I bail (as I have no interest and actively dislike pretty much every UI-based technology I&#x27;ve ever encountered).<p>Getting paid to work is important to me.')
