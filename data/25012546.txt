Could I ask a somewhat unrelated question about using Let&#x27;s Encrypt with Caddy? I&#x27;ve been trying to help some folks (in education) get wildcard subdomain certificates to work on their Google Cloud machines via lego_deprecated&#x27;s purported gcloud support in Caddy v2 (we&#x27;ve tried to follow the instructions and all), but we&#x27;ve been running into issues and it&#x27;s been incredibly frustrating to figure out how to resolve them. I recall one of the errors we got was <i>&quot;No TXT record found at _acme-challenge.subdomain.domain.tld&quot;</i>, but it was hard to see all of them because most of the errors we&#x27;d see would be rate-limit errors. Things were so much easier and everything worked in Caddy v1, but ever since we upgraded to v2, we have no idea how to make it work with gcloud (the instructions haven&#x27;t gotten it working for us), and there seems to be a lack of any working examples on the internet. Do you know if anyone has had success with gcloud at all? Would you have any guidance on how to proceed? Currently they&#x27;re running on expired certificates and we have no idea how to renew them via Caddy, and it&#x27;s not clear to me how to even do it out-of-band either.')
