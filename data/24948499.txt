The level of pain that they inflict completely changed my pain scale.<p>I started doing something that I read in a fiction book series (The Dresden Files) - basically a little visualization that helps me compartmentalize the pain. It helps a ton, though the fact that the attacks are relatively short probably help in that regard as it takes a lot of concentration.<p>The reason I bring that all up is that people tend to discount what they can do about a problem, mentally. Youâ€™re not going to get rid of the pain, but you might be able to work out a way to deal with it better.')
