All of the projects I&#x27;ve been on have had changing specs, right up to and through release.<p>I love the architecture weenie role. It&#x27;s tons of fun. But eventually you need to build something and only with experience do you discover the first set of complications, then marketing starts promising features and you&#x27;ve got the next, and management refuses to allocate more time.<p>Did you do something wrong at step 1 by building a prototype before knowing it would be perfect? And if so, how could you know that and what would you do to get there?<p>I write the code, and tag releases, but I don&#x27;t determine what ships. I, and 95% of us, are not engineers and even those who are have abrogated their responsibility to make the bridge stand - we&#x27;re all just building individual struts because someone told management that things done in a vacuum will all fit together properly in the end.<p>So I agree I guess, but don&#x27;t at the same time.')
