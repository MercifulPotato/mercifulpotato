Google is synonymous with privacy invasion. The fastest way to convince me <i>not</i> to use a product is to put the word <i>Google</i> on it.<p>What I <i>do</i> disagree with is the Australian approach.<p>For instance, privacy is ignored. If I understand correctly, privacy issues are not addresses in any way, shape or form and would remain as-is under their proposal.<p>So what we&#x27;re left with looks more like a good old-fashioned, heavy handed, targeted, mafia style shakedown of a foreign company that would hand Rupert Murdock a slice of Google profits without him having to compete for it.<p>This is <i>not</i> free trade or free enterprise and just begs for similar protectionist retaliation against Australian interests. Fair enough if they never plan to conduct commerce with foreign entities.  Otherwise, they are just shooting themselves in the foot in the long run.')
