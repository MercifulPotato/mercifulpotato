Things like speaking for Koko or &quot;correcting&quot; for her when it seemed like Koko was signing something nonsensical.<p>For example, Koko had an apparent fascination with nipples. In front of cameras, Patterson would always say Koko actually meant something else because nipple rhymes with whatever word she&#x27;s trying to say but in private, according to other caretakers who worked with Koko, Patterson often showed her nipples to Koko almost like a greeting and made other female workers do the same to their discomfort. She would also ask Koko leading questions to get desired responses for cameras which doesn&#x27;t demonstrate intelligence.<p>Patterson apparently also spoiled Koko, feeding her things that weren&#x27;t good for her nutritionally, but went to great lengths to keep Koko to herself, going so far as to keep her separated from the male they brought in to keep Koko company.<p>So while I would be excited at the prospect of intelligent animals, I think Koko is unfortunately not a good example.')
