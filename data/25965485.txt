How about considering it a failure for a student to graduate without being in excellent athletic form, on par with the student being unable to do algebra?<p>If the people in charge wanted to make that happen, they could do it by spending a tiny fraction of the public money at their disposal on propaganda, but all indications are that they don&#x27;t want a population that&#x27;s in great physical shape, even though it would obviously be good for them.<p>People who are in great shape when they graduate high school might still become fat, but people who graduate from high school fat will almost certainly spend their lives that way.<p>They could also regulate extremely sugary foods like how tobacco, which is less harmful, is regulated, where you have to be 18 to buy it and have to ask for the cashier to get it for you, rather than having it in your face at the checkout aisle.<p>Whining about how hard it is on their website is exactly the sort of reason why they have no credibility. They&#x27;re not really trying, and pretty much everyone can sense that, even if they don&#x27;t have it spelled out for them.')
