In my experience it&#x27;s never to do with stage fright. The candidates don&#x27;t seem flustered. They just cannot program. Even if it was stage fright, so what? Instant no hire. Your work will be evaluated by people post-hiring too: you have to be able to perform the job you are hired for when asked to do so. Panicking the moment you&#x27;re asked to <i>do your job</i> is an excellent indicator you should not be in the team.<p>At my current firm, I hired most of the engineering team. In the early days we relied heavily on website applications and external agencies. A non-trivial number of candidates would struggle with a task like &quot;read a text file into memory and print out the lines&quot;. Not FizzBuzz, if anything that&#x27;s even easier: FizzBuzz trips up some inexperienced candidates because they don&#x27;t know about the modulo operator, which is relatively rarely used. But almost any kind of program will use files.<p>At some point we started pulling sourcing and recruiting in-house. We also dropped some bad agencies and got a bit more savvy about which ones were cheating. The candidate stream got better at that point and total failure became less common. Unacceptably poor performance was still a frequent issue though.<p>Disappointingly, to me, a lot of candidates and even people we hired would try to claim that asking candidates to load a text file from disk was somehow unfair because &quot;real programmers&quot; don&#x27;t work with files anymore, they just use web frameworks to do everything. Needless to say, that was not the kind of software engineer we were trying to hire.')
