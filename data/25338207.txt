I had a combo of AMD ryzen 2, nvme drive, windows 10, and couldn&#x27;t for the life of me get windows to discover the drive and install, whether using uefi or bios. I haven&#x27;t ever dealt with Windows without it just working, so I was unprepared, and my Googling did nothing. I&#x27;m not a dumb guy, but I determined with this combo of hardware it was impossible for me to get Windows installed. Combine that with a new kid, and I decided just to get a Playstation 4 (this was months ago) and not have to mess with anything.')
