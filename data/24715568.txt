Here&#x27;s a cool one I found:<p>&quot;A pilot trial is a small study conducted to help design and assess the feasibility of doing a larger, full‐scale trial. They also investigate whether the methods and procedures are able to obtain the data that is needed to answer the question that will be addressed in the larger study.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6046600&#x2F;#:~:text=1.1.,addressed%20in%20the%20larger%20study" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6046600&#x2F;#:~:tex...</a>.<p>You can contrast that with a clinical trial:<p>&quot;Clinical trials are research studies performed in people that are aimed at evaluating a medical, surgical, or behavioral intervention. They are the primary way that researchers find out if a new treatment, like a new drug or diet or medical device (for example, a pacemaker) is safe and effective in people. Often a clinical trial is used to learn if a new treatment is more effective and&#x2F;or has less harmful side effects than the standard treatment.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nia.nih.gov&#x2F;health&#x2F;what-are-clinical-trials-and-studies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nia.nih.gov&#x2F;health&#x2F;what-are-clinical-trials-and-...</a><p>Getting a flu shot is important. <i>Please</i> get yours this season so we can help reduce the spread of yet another deadly respiratory virus that kills thousands of people each year.<p>There was a lot of debate about masks. As you can recall, a lot of frontline health professionals were dying because of a lack of PPE while carrying out \nincredibly risky procedures like intubation.<p>Gondi, S., Beckman, A.
