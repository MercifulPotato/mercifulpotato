You are very unlikely to ever run into someone you know and the volunteers are literally waiting and wanting to help you.<p>I get that you&#x27;re introverted -- I&#x27;m the same way.

I have anxiety answering the calls but I do it anyway because I know that I can help someone that needs it.<p>The person that you talk to, you will never see or hear from them again. It&#x27;s a fleeting moment of one human helping another.')
