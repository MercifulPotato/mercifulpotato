In a perfect universe, we&#x27;d all be using fully e2e-encrypted messaging systems. But:<p>&gt; The only decision people need to make is centralized or decentralized system.<p>They already have this choice; Matrix and others exist for quite some time already. Yet it is evidently clear that your average citizen will flock to whatever messenger is the easiest to use and is already used by their friends&#x2F;family. Security&#x2F;privacy are second thoughts at best, if at all; and even if it were important, grasping the different implications of all the available options isn&#x27;t exactly easy either.<p>And since we can probably agree that the vast majority of folks already &quot;fail&quot; to make the right choice in this regard, I&#x27;d much rather have a regulated, government-controlled messenger than some company like Facebook. The former is accountable to its citizens, the latter to its shareholders - if I have to pick my poison, the choice is clear.')
