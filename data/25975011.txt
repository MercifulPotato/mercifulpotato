Israel, Canada and so on.<p>I personally find what the UK did ethically wrong. As it stands, there&#x27;ll be no recourse for the EU that isn&#x27;t as bad or arguably even worse.<p>British people patting their own back about the ingenuity of mandating exclusive contracts for UK facilities - which factually is the same as export controls - is in my eyes quite detestable.<p>The EU did everything wrong they could do wrong. But at the very least, they don&#x27;t mandate an &quot;EU first&quot; clause.')
