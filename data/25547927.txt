You are saying microkernels are more modular in feature selection than monolithic kernels. That is not an inherent property if microkernels, nor is it true in practice. Nothing says a monolithic kernel can&#x27;t have much more fine grained build time feature control than a microkernel where only entire services can be disabled (by not running them). Any reasonable monolithic kernel targeting embedded systems, including Linux but also anything smaller, will have a ton of build time options to slim down the system as needed.<p>A microkernel with feature control at the process&#x2F;service level would actually have much <i>worse</i> feature control than Linux, because Linux build time configuration options are often quite a bit more finer grained than that. For example, you can build Linux for uniprocessor systems, which makes global build-time changes that disable certain kinds of locks, which makes it smaller globally. A microkernel could or could not have the same build-time feature; it is not guaranteed to.<p>As others have pointed out, microkernels have performance overhead and that reason alone makes them unsuitable for an N64. On a game console you need all the performance you can get.')
