Cover every windy plain with wind turbines<p>You&#x27;d extract quite a significant amount of energy from the weather system, assuming we&#x27;d globally and optimally achieve this. What could be the consequences? Winds could locally diminish, thermal convection could be reduced, lots of effects could happen we don&#x27;t understand yet.<p>In which way would this interact with local climate? Would this cause local temperatures to rise?<p>Just pointing out potential unintended consequences this could have without offering a solution. My takeaway from past good ideas (automobile, chemistry, electricity, globalization, ...) is that there is at least one _big_ unintended consequence of action.<p>I&#x27;d rather try to reduce our environmental and thermal footprint altogether by reducing our energy consumption, trying to keep up the standard of living people are used to. Just my opinion, but the uprising of populist parties suggests we should not overdo good intentions.<p>Also, if a radical approach like the proposed one would fail, populist parties would exploit that failure to the fullest amount possible.')
