GitLab Premium, which is $19&#x2F;user&#x2F;month. [0]<p>&gt; Does GitLab have some killer feature I&#x27;m not aware of that justifies spending 2-10x that of the competition?<p>At least some of the described features seem to be closer to GitHub Enterprise ($21&#x2F;user&#x2F;mo) or AzDo Basic+Test ($52&#x2F;user&#x2F;mo) than the lower tiers on those, but that&#x27;s not consistent across the board and the three don&#x27;t describe features in a way which makes side-by-side comparison easy. But I don&#x27;t see Premium as clearly overpriced compared to the competition.<p>&gt; $99&#x2F;m for Ultimate eds? It doesn’t even explain on the pricing page what you get for that, beyond a couple of bullet points of biz-speak<p>There’s a detailed feature breakdown of all three plans on the pricing page, with links to more details about each feature.<p>Unfortunately, its in a stupid scrolling table that only lets you see a few lines at a time, though.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;</a>')
