Time spent is easy to measure - something like time from idea to deliverable is usually good enough. I don&#x27;t think you need to be precise. You just need a general idea of what kind of work takes ages, and what can be done quickly.<p>Measuring impact is trickier. It should be a signal of how well you&#x27;re achieving the goal of your project. If you&#x27;re working on, say, a budgeting tool, you will want to measure how much money your customers have managed to save, or something along those lines.')
