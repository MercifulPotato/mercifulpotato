You&#x27;re free to pick and choose among its many, many neighbouring municipalities, <i>none of which happen to be governed by the San Francisco city council</i>.<p>2. These are fantastic examples of measures that at worst, mildly inconvenience the most affluent members of its society, and at best are harmless social signaling of issues that don&#x27;t matter.<p>It speaks more about your priorities when you point out things like happy meal toy bans, while ignoring the insanity of having an entire city that is completely unaffordable to the people working in that McDonalds, or a healthcare system that completely fails the most regular customers[1] to that McDonalds.<p>As for zoning laws, they are absolutely libertarian, in the sense that the people who have made it are using them to pull the ladder up behind them. What&#x27;s the point of owning property, and having wealth and political influence if you then don&#x27;t spend that influence to protect the value of your property?<p>Land, in large part, derives its value from how difficult it is to acquire. I could hardly think of a more land-owner friendly system than one with extremely onerous zoning and construction requirements. If you&#x27;re feeling pressured by this, you are one of the have-nots (whose life in a libertarian-paradise-for-the-haves is not that great - see my original post on what being a have-not gets you in the SFBA.)<p>[1] I&#x27;m referring to, of course, poorer people.')
