That is the source of the &quot;fundamental randomness&quot; and it is not explained by decoherence.<p>For a slightly more mathematical (but still very understandable) explanation of what decoherence solves and what it doesn&#x27;t solve, I recommend this article [0] by Sabine Hossenfelder.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backreaction.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;understanding-quantum-mechanics-5.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backreaction.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;understanding-quan...</a>')
