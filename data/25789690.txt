(I&#x27;d like that journalist had a technical check in addition to the spell check.) The cylinders are used to give a mix of pure oxygen and air to the patients in ventilators.<p>(Also in some places, they use the oxygen cylinders to give a mix of air and oxygen to patient that don&#x27;t need a ventilator, but are in a bad condition. A ventilator is a quite invasive treatment, and is better to avoid it when possible.)<p>From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ventilator#Function" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ventilator#Function</a><p>&gt; <i>In its simplest form, a modern positive pressure ventilator consists of a compressible air reservoir or turbine, air and oxygen supplies, a set of valves and tubes, and a disposable or reusable &quot;patient circuit&quot;. The air reservoir is pneumatically compressed several times a minute to deliver room-air, or in most cases, an air&#x2F;oxygen mixture to the patient.</i>')
