Item(by='valcker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609870501, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25646419, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve gone back to consuming a limited amount (~1.5 cups) only between 10am and 6pm. I used to have none on weekends feeling a bit off to reset but eventually even this seemed pointless, so 10am-6pm every day has been working well.<p>That! I lived on zero coffee for many years, however, it is much more difficult to do so once I became a father. I am consuming a maximum of 2 cups of coffee: first one around 10am, the second one in the afternoon but strictly before 5pm. I do that Monday-Friday and I either consume less or no coffee at all on weekend.<p>I also use decaf if I want to a coffee (as a drink, not as a boosting drug) and if I already consumed my daily 2 cups.')
