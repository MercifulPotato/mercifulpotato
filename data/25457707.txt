The reality of the Big Enemy wasn&#x27;t really relevant, they just had to be real enough to make the stories plausible.<p>This Cold War isn&#x27;t going to be about People vs their Governments. This is actual focused groups with goals and ideas making sure that their opponents can&#x27;t recognize the battle is underway, much less respond coherently.<p>The goals and timing are puzzling me too; I feel there&#x27;s some looming pressure point I haven&#x27;t perceived yet.')
