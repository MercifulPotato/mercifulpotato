So calling Trump as “their presidential candidate” could be misleading.</i><p>Sure, they didn&#x27;t support Trump directly. But they really only supported GOP candidates, and whether those candidates in turn supported Trump doesn&#x27;t seem to have ever been a factor. They certainly never explicitly supported any opposition to Trump, not even conservative opposition such as the Lincoln Project.')
