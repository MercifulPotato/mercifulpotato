For me terrible torture-chairs in economy are much more annoying on long flights than some small delay on takeoff or landing.<p>I once spent 5 hours on plane waiting for takeoff in Frankfurt, but it was due to lack antifreeze and engine heating machines (whatever they are called correctly) and I don&#x27;t see a way how airline could have influenced that.
