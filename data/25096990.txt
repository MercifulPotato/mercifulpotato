You could also trust your existing trusted certs (prior to OCSP update) when doing the OCSP update, which, again, is no worse than plaintext HTTP.<p>Apple knows this. They have cryptography experts.<p>Taken in context with their backdooring of their e2e messenger and collaboration with military intelligence on FISA 702, I tend not to give them the benefit of the doubt any longer. Apple knows how to take pcaps.<p>There are only so many times the OS design gets to leak either keys or plaintext remotely before you need to stop assuming ignorance over malice.<p>I don’t know how many times that is, but it’s less than ten, probably less than 5, and because it’s a count of legitimate “assume ignorance”, then “goto fail”[2] also counts in the tally.<p>Between this OCSP plaintext telemetry leak, and iMessage default key escrow, scrapping their plan for e2e backups at the behest of the FBI that fixes the key escrow backdoor[3], and “goto fail” not authenticating TLS, we’re at 4.<p>I’m not even counting the recent story about Apple’s history of willing collaboration with intelligence agencies to make a custom classified firmware for the iPod to aid in espionage.[1]<p>As Goldfinger’s famous saying goes: <i>“Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time it’s enemy action.”</i><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24212520" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24212520</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;apples-goto-fail-tells-us-nothing-good-about-cupertinos-software-delivery-process&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;apples-goto-fail-tells-us-noth...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive&#x2F;exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusiv...</a>')
