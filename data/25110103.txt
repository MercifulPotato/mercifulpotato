As the author already mentioned, performance can vary a lot. When you&#x27;re doing poorly, you often don&#x27;t feel very different, but then you sit down to play chess and realize you&#x27;re basically sleep walking. What you&#x27;re looking for is a fully awake, high alert, high awareness state of mind. Factors like diet and regular exercise can make a huge difference in my experience.')
