FIRE = Financial Independence, Retire Early. Moving to a low cost of living (LCoL acronym on those forums) will be important given the amount you have saved and what I presume is a fairly lengthy retirement (I assume you aren’t in your 70s!).<p>I think the conclusion you will come to is that it would be good to move to a LCoL location, keep your job or somehow stay in the industry but in a more flexible manner where you work far less and make a bit of living money so you don’t eat into your nest egg very much.<p>Also, word to the wise: inflation is unpredictable and current government estimates are likely massively underestimated for things that actually matter to you - healthcare, housing, etc. So be careful with the standard 4% withdrawal, equity market returns, and inflation expectations. Garbage in, garbage out!')
