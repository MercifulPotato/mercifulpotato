Item(by='jMyles', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604162918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24951902, text='I certainly do not fit the picture you paint.  I&#x27;m not a Trump supporter, nor do I adhere to any of the silly theories you suggest.  I believe wholeheartedly in robust rights, recognition, and respect for marginalized groups.  I believe no person is illegal.  I have been out in the streets of Portland joining BIPOC leadership in calling for abolition of police and prisons many dozens of the past 150 nights.<p>Distrust of the FBI doesn&#x27;t stem from Trump-support and is not related to &quot;refusal to accept whole classes of humans&quot;; it chiefly stems from the fact that it&#x27;s a historically racist and xenophobic institution that threw itself headlong into trying to violently disrupt civil rights activism, and has never done any serious internal healing since.<p>The deep, lasting, institutional corruption of the two major political parties <i>is</i> based on fact and observation, including the fact pattern I have laid out in the comment to which you responded, which again, to my knowledge, is not in dispute.  Whether or not it amounts to another in a long line of actual instances of self-enrichment at the public&#x27;s expense is something that I do not trust (and I don&#x27;t think any reasonable observer can trust) the FBI to investigate and conclude on its own.')
