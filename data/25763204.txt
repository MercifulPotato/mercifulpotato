Item(by='52-6F-62', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610551970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760579, text='&gt; <i>I have not heard of beer companies, kitchen equipment suppliers, map makers or PoS terminal providers demand that the bar ban a particular customer on threat of refusing to service them, either, so that proposal seems rather more realistic than the one we are actually talking about here.</i><p>It absolutely happens in beer companies, kitchen equipment suppliers, etc.<p>Ex: I doubt you would find a high end distiller advertising that they&#x27;re sold, especially without a distribution deal, in Mick&#x27;s Souse Hole, North Etobicoke.<p>There is all kinds of heavily established strata and bartering lines in all manner of business. That&#x27;s nothing new at all.<p>If a given business or client establishes itself as an unworthy partner, no deals are made or existing deals are brokenâ€”at least to the limits of the moral stand on either side. In all industries.<p>It just happens, some businesses, or industries in general, care less to establish moral boundaries than others. But in any industry: &quot;bad for business&quot; is &quot;bad for business&quot;; and &quot;bad for business&quot; is avoided.<p>I suppose my point beyond talking about beer companies is: this is <i>nothing</i> unique to Twitter et al. Twitter [et al] is just highly visible.<p>I don&#x27;t think Jim from Etobicoke, Canada, one eye closed and slobbering, has a case for arguing he should be represented on the Pernod label just because he wants to be. I doubt most people do. But most people don&#x27;t care what Jim or Pernod do.')
