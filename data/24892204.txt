I still have a music library, and rip dvd&#x27;s with handbrake. Ripping a dvd with a 12 core desktop machine is a breeze, and so are other general computing tasks.<p>I know I&#x27;m probably a dinosaur. I run a lot of desktop applications for work, and run most my models locally. I use the shell to automate tasks, and rarely use the &quot;cloud&quot; and try to limit browser tasks.<p>What&#x27;s funny about this post is that I&#x27;m actually in the market for a new laptop, and am quite paralyzed in the process. I can&#x27;t get myself to spend $1500 on some mediocre machine where everything is soldered on the mobo, I can&#x27;t replace the battery, and that will become garbage in 2 years.')
