Normalising the statement of preferred pronouns is very important for people who&#x27;s gender identity differs from their assigned sex at birth. I state my pronouns on both my social media and work emails.<p>Your statement of being &quot;LGBT &#x2F; neutral&quot; seems strange to me, being neutral on whether other human beings should have the same rights I enjoy does not seem to be something I can be neutral on. I accept that myself and others with privilege must help create a more equal society for everyone, even in the relatively small changes such as stating our pronouns.')
