Plus, the statement that you have to patch <i>all</i> packages is false. In many cases, all you have to do is set the right build flags and environment variables, which is handled by standard helpers in nixpkgs.<p>I&#x27;d also like to add that nixpkgs has the most extensive testing for packages compared to any other distros I&#x27;ve seen.<p>&gt; Packaging for nix is more like porting software to another operating system.<p>Dramatic, but again, simply not the case.<p>&gt; note that they have automated tools for patching the most common problems, so the problem is even worse.<p>This is a <i>good</i> thing. Manual patching for the most common problems isn&#x27;t sustainable, especially if you maintain a large number of packages. Just ask packages maintainers of any major distros.<p>&gt; I was able to merge some pretty large patches to nix-packages from an anonymous and sketchy-looking github account, and they weren&#x27;t scrutinized much<p>All packages in nixpkgs has a mandatory review process as you should very well know. As scary as you make it sound, I&#x27;m pretty sure at least one committer have taken a look at your code to see if there was anything malicious in it.<p>&gt; Moreover, Nix breaks the chain of trust for the language packages.<p>After a quick look, it seems like you can still use the unmodified erlang package manager? The patched version you&#x27;ve mentioned seems to be there for facilitating creation of Nix packages and it looks like the main intent was to remove the ability to download packages from the internet. If this is the case, it wouldn&#x27;t be a security problem at all because the dependencies would have to be prefetched and their hashes precomputed.<p>&gt; &#x2F;nix directory is readable by all users, so you cannot use Nix to manage secrets<p>Why not store secrets in a private location, just like you would on any other distros??? What is it that other distros have that Nix is missing? I&#x27;m not seeing your point here.<p>With that being said, note that this feature is being worked on, and systemd <i>very recently</i> introduced a new feature for secrets management [1].<p>&gt; You cannot install opam packages without dealing with incompatiblities, you cannot easily install games from Gog without dealing with incompatibilities<p>Matbe take a look at buildFHSEnv.<p>&gt; do you really need such degree of reproducibility for your very own dev machine?<p>Yes, it saves me from having to do a clean install of my system every few months. I haven&#x27;t done a clean install at all the last few years since I started using NixOS.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NixOS&#x2F;rfcs&#x2F;pull&#x2F;59#issuecomment-624723733" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NixOS&#x2F;rfcs&#x2F;pull&#x2F;59#issuecomment-624723733</a>')
