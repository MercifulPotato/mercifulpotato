Item(by='gojomo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604176371, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947366, text='If you have to supply your own less-apologetic paraphrase (&quot;sorry you feel offended&quot;), rather than quote any such constructions in the actual text, is that really a fair reading?<p>Other than the apparently-magic word &#x27;sorry&#x27;, your suggested wording doesn&#x27;t address most of the specific asks of ~btilly&#x27;s complaint above. (Don&#x27;t worry, his proposed rewording didn&#x27;t, either!) Perhaps, because it&#x27;s exactly tuned to what <i>you</i> saw as worst about his treatment, it&#x27;d adequate for <i>you</i>. But not necessarily for any others demanding more groveling.<p>It&#x27;s also not consistent with the NumFOCUS committee&#x27;s substantive position, which is <i>not</i> that they had prematurely concluded anything, but rather that they had erroneously communicated that they&#x27;d concluded something. That&#x27;s a salient difference, even though the two errors look the same from Howard&#x27;s perspective! (The two distinct failures would require different internal correctives, too.) You wouldn&#x27;t want a public apology to lie about the actual internal errors identified just to be extra-palatable to third parties, would you?<p>So, don&#x27;t quit your day job to specialize in public apology writing just yet!<p>And to entertain that idea of professionally-improved apologies a bit a more, realize that in certain situations, no matter how good the apology, or how well it hits certain notes, some on the warpath will always want X% more, &amp; be able to find specific faults.<p>Short &amp; emphatic, as per your (&amp; ~btilly&#x27;s) rewrites? &quot;Wasn&#x27;t specific enough, too patronizing.&quot;<p>Detailed with even a whiff of actual analysis as to the real org&#x2F;psych reasons for an error? &quot;Not empathetic enough, making excuses, rationalizing the behavior&quot;.<p>Long enough to include <i>all</i> of the emotional cloying, <i>and</i> the exhaustive victim&#x27;s-viewpoint confession of sins, <i>and</i> promises for changes? &quot;Tone-deaf, insincere because if they really believed this they couldn&#x27;t have made the error in the 1st place, seems over-wordsmithed.&quot; (But also: risks setting unrealistic expectations for the future.)')
