Instead of focusing on crime, it goes with music, food and death.<p>- The Deuce&#x27;s from 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s New York sex industry and gentrification.<p>Both of these are quite similar and at the same time different compared to The Wire. I like all of them a lot, but there are different opinions, specifically for Treme which never gathered any large audience.<p>Anyhow, if you ask this question, you might need to see them both.')
