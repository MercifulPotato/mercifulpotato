The TB3 add-in card for my HP workstation costs $200 for 2 ports. HP doesn&#x27;t market a 40g ethernet card but an Intel model costs $400 at retail, also for 2 ports. Then I need either 2 $25 cables for ethernet or 2 $129 cables for TB3. It&#x27;s the same price either way. Of course, the two setups don&#x27;t accomplish the same things; they are comparable only in reach and speed.')
