It&#x27;s comforting to know that people aren&#x27;t so different from each other.<p>But I think that what you are attributing to stupidity would be better attributed to culture, size, or strength of authority -- the countries that have handled the pandemic well score favorably in one of those attributes. Here in the &#x27;states we are strongly individualistic and historically distrustful of government, and bad actors have been stoking those flames for a while so we are in a particuarly vulnerable state right now.<p>Now, in <i>my</i> opinion, stupidity is humanity&#x27;s seeming refusal to not act more switfly about climate change, but I&#x27;m sure someone else would argue that&#x27;s attributable to some other, er, attribute')
