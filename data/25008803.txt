All the good games&#x2F;exclusives on Gamepass are also on PC where they run better&#x2F;look better anyways. At this point, your best (full coverage of exclusives) option is to just get a decent PC, and then also get a PS5. There is no longer a need to have all 3 for the full coverage. And again, &quot;full coverage&quot; being the key point in that take.<p>If it boils down to PS5 or Xbox only, then my 2 cents is the PS5 is still your best bet because of the exclusives on PS platform are significantly better.')
