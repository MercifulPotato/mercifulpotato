This is why it&#x27;s SO important to keep this sort of stuff in schools.<p>Sliding compound miter saw is a magic tool.<p>Now just wait until you get a MIG welder and a bandsaw, you&#x27;ll be UNSTOPPABLE and the world will suddenly look a whole lot different!<p>Sidenote: I&#x27;m the program director at a nonprofit where I teach&#x2F;create curriculum.  One of the workshops that I love teaching is a week long where we teach the following skills to a group of 12 kids:<p>Welding: learn to run a mig welder well enough to make art, furniture etc.  Welding is easier than you think!<p>Woodworking: learn how to use a miter saw, and make 2x4s into smaller pieces and then reassemble them into larger pieces of different shapes!<p>Arduino programming: make lights blink on and off in exactly the way you want them to, and learn some C++ and core programming concepts in the process.<p>Laser cutting: learn how to take things out of your imagination and create beautiful things on the laser.  Lasers <i>always</i> blow peoples&#x27; minds at how cool the the things they can make are, and how easy it is to use them.<p>These specific skills mean that these teenagers leave with a totally shifted perspective on the world around them.  The experience you had realizing that the railing you wanted to fix was actually something that you can <i>interact with and modify</i> is what we&#x27;re doing for these kids, but doing it with: things made of bits (computing), things made of wood, things made of metal, and things made on a computer (CNC).  I&#x27;m really passionate about it.  If you know of a group of kids that would enjoy this type of workshop, please email me!')
