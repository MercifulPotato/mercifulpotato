It&#x27;s easy to forget what you are trying to solve and get lost in the details. Then you end up with the perfect solution to the wrong problem.<p>For instance, clothes came out if the washing machine dripping wet.<p>Step two is to get a better idea of what causes the problem. That&#x27;s usually a list of facts and symptoms that can help the investigation.<p>For example, the washing machine still makes noise, and still pumps water out. However it doesn&#x27;t shake as much as it used to.<p>Then and only then can you start coming up with theories on what the problem could be and how to fix it.<p>Maybe it doesn&#x27;t shake because it doesn&#x27;t spin, but the electric motor still turns, so it must be disconnected from the drum. The strap must have broken.')
