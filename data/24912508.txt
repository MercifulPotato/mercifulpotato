It went operational and we observed 2 operators effectively doing &quot;pair operating&quot;. We just thought it was weird Italian style socialising - one had the keyboard and the other was chattering away with a commentary.\nBut they were surprisingly effective!<p>I accidentally learned when teaching a course at a site with too many people for the available machines, that pair exercises was very effective - I got lots more questions and overall learning went way up. If the pair discussed it and couldn&#x27;t find an answer they would have the confidence to ask. On their own, neither would probably bother and just wait for me to go through things.')
