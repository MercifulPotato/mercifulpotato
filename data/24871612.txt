Same with adding Puerto Rico as a state.<p>Edit: As pointed out below, this is wrong.  Since DC already has 3, it would actually lower the number by one, so this would in fact give an odd number.<p>&gt; The House can and does have ties, even with an odd number of members; members abstaining or missing votes in the House are more common in the House than the EC.<p>Yeah, but when that happens, they just vote again.  The are never deadlocked from a tie.<p>&gt; You could extend the same EC voting arrangement to, say, (to pick an odd number of territories) Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands as D.C. has now.<p>It would make sense to do this for Puerto Rico, whose population is greater than 20 states.  But all the other territories are smaller than the smallest state, and that would give them outsize power.')
