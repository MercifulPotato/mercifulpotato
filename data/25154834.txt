A life in the rainforest is difficult and short.<p>But I don&#x27;t intend any criticism of Bezos. He has done the math on warehouse employee satisfaction as a contributor to corporate goals, and made his decision.<p>The scrappy days of packing his own shipments are long past, and that experience gives him not-much insight into the working conditions for the people in his warehouses.<p>That&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s not a basis for deification.')
