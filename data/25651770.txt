I&#x27;d be curious to see how well it can perform on a multi-object image setting which currently presents the main challenge in the field. Also, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if these results were limited to openAI scale of computing resources. \nAll in all, great progress in the field. The phase of development here is simply staggering, considering the fact that few years back we could hardly generate any image in high fidelity.')
