There was not a great intro into the tech or design decisions. The talk mostly focused on community adoption numbers and announcing a v2. I didn&#x27;t know much about Arrow in the first place so there wasn&#x27;t a lot for me.<p>On a tangent, are there any other series these days like Andy Pavlo&#x27;s Quarantine DB talks? I have a really hard time finding the covid equivalent of meetups. Most local meetups seem to have just stopped rather than go online.')
