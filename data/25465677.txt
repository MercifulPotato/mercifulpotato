From a layman point of view, I would take a list of instructions executed during common case OS usage and then extract the most common patterns (basically compression) and put them into silicon. These wouldn&#x27;t be easy to understand if you don&#x27;t know exactly what the OS is doing and how. I mean of course you need some cleanup and well thought-out design for future software development, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if in the future, to get the full experience of a new OS you will also need to update the hardware.')
