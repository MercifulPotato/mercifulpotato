(I don&#x27;t doubt it&#x27;s possible, but the incentives are very much aligned with &quot;let&#x27;s count this bot activity as a real user.&quot; It doesn&#x27;t even need to be malicious -- I fell into that trap myself.)<p>EDIT: Odd, I&#x27;d like to report a bug in that site. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;EsGyvnT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;EsGyvnT</a> It doesn&#x27;t seem to load. Or rather, I saw it briefly flash the statistics, once, before it went back to loading. The 0.3 seconds I saw the stats looked impressive though. :)<p>The only thing in dev console is a warning that seems unrelated: &quot;&lt;ApolloProvider&gt;.provide() is deprecated. Use the &#x27;apolloProvider&#x27; option instead with the provider object directly.&quot;<p>Ah, the root cause is that the graphql fetch takes ~32sec: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;q769ozR" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;q769ozR</a> So, never mind! Just a bit slow.<p>---<p>Anyway, it claims 400,000 active users in the last month. What counts as an active Mastodon user? It also claims 400 million Mastodon posts (total?) which I suppose are tweets.<p>Interesting... Twitter has about ~17M tweets per day, iirc. If this growth is legit – a big if – then Mastodon may be gaining more momentum than it seemed.<p>Actually, twitter gets 431M tweets&#x2F;day: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jasonbaumgartne&#x2F;status&#x2F;1332003350192271360" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jasonbaumgartne&#x2F;status&#x2F;13320033501922713...</a><p>Hmm. I wonder how much exponential growth would be required for Mastodon to catch up to twitter...')
