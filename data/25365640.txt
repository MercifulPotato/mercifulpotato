Either can be fast or slow.<p>The debate around SPA and SSR is so heated and centered on the front-end bit that people forget that UX performance depends a lot on the server. Websites are client-server <i>systems</i> regardless of the front-end architecture.<p>I&#x27;d wager that the case of GCP is no different and that the perceived slow UIs are caused by problems all across the stack.')
