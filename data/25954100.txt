If not why not? The behavior of certain members is closer to the classic definition than anything the brokers have done.<p>I’m not an impartial player. I’m largely disgusted by the pass the insiders at wsb have gotten for their part in a recent market condition that is going to cost retail traders tons of money before this is done. It looks exactly like the mobbed up boiler rooms we used to see in the markets just transitioned to new technology.<p>I’ve in the past worked for hedge funds and prop trading firms but none implicated in any of this (they mostly don’t exist anymore). I have no current position in GME (I made $0.40 this week pretax trading GmE shares on Robinhood). I’ve traded on Robinhood for a few years after leaving the trading industry but more than 99% of my trades and positions are in vanguard indexes.<p>I’ve not worked for a trading desk, hedge fund or prop trader in more than 5 years and don’t have any outstanding trades, agreements or contracts in place that I know of.<p>What else would you like me to clear up before you impugn my reputation more?')
