That&#x27;s the point of rapid charging though, you won&#x27;t use it often but it ensures that for the rare long distance journey you are provided for. European drivers also tend to make several long driving trips a year for holidays in the summer and for skiing but I would expect that rapid charging (and some of the imminently coming generation are 350kW) will be required for that to work.')
