Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607593472, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25371401, text='&gt; I agree that we can territoriality in the animal kingdom and I&#x27;m can also admit that we see territoriality in humans (at least some of the time). However, you claimed that property rights are an incarnation of the territoriality, which is a quite a leap from territoriality exists in humans.<p>Perhaps I was unclear. Property is the human incarnation of territory. This is an observation based on their similarities, treating humans as animals. When one animal claims an area and reacts with hostility to the conduct of other members of the same species in that area, it is said that the animal defends a territory. Property <i>rights</i> are a social norm that some humans use as a means of defending their territory. Rights are merely norms that allocate to individuals certain activities, behaviors, or other social goods. The territory (or property) exists because an animal believes that it exists and acts as though it exists. Of course this can be violated, its just an idea in someone&#x27;s mind that manifests as territorial behavior. Property rights are a social arrangement where people respect each other&#x27;s property.<p>Please note that I&#x27;m not assigning any moral weight to this notion. I&#x27;m merely describing human behavior in these terms and letting the reader come to their own conclusions. Rights (and property rights) take different forms in different communities. Thats because norms are social constructs and therefore intersubjective.<p>&gt; Just a side-note I do think it&#x27;s drawing parallels and conclusions from behaviour in the animal kingdom is fraught with problems.<p>Perhaps so. I think it can be problematic to consider humans as separate from the animal kingdom. Probably both perspectives have strengths and weaknesses.<p>&gt; But I would argue (and this is how I understood the OP, that the state is a social construct&#x2F;formalisation of our social interactions, which does guarantee property rights (and others). So property rights do not exist without a social organisational construct such as the state. Now, the argument becomes a bit of a question of how broadly do we define state. I would also argue btw, that the concept of nation is much more closely linked territoriality than the state.<p>This is conflating norms with the state that enforces them. Norms exist in all communities, most of them are not state-enforced. Frequently communities have norms that conflict with the formal statutes. In fact, the idea that there are agents of the state who you &quot;are supposed&quot; to obey is itself a social norm. Sometimes those social norms change but the people with the guns still attempt to enforce statutes.<p>Just as a side note, I find formulations of the type &quot;the state guarantees property rights&quot; to be problematic. The state may enforce some laws and fail to enforce others. The state may enforce some norms and fail to enforce others. The state may engage in widespread and long-standing violations of property rights (civil asset forfeiture). People can resolve this by considering those rights to be &quot;whatever the state says they are&quot; but this equivocation leaves us with no basis on which to criticize state actions related to rights.<p>&gt; So property rights do not exist without a social organisational construct such as the state.<p>Property rights do not require an organization to enforce them. They (can) exist as community norms. Organizations enable large-scale coordination of actions that can shape those norms.<p>&gt; I would also argue btw, that the concept of nation is much more closely linked territoriality than the state.<p>I agree but this also depends on how one defines terms. Some scholars use &quot;state&quot; and &quot;government&quot; differently as well.<p>&gt; But would you not agree that we need some sort of social organisation to guarantee these rights?<p>No I don&#x27;t agree that is necessary in all cases. In some cases its clear that an organization would be necessary to enforce the norms that I prefer. Perhaps a criminal organization seeks to expropriate all the left-handed redheads in an area. But then how would someone respond logically if we considered the organization that seeks to expropriate as the government? They&#x27;re enforcing a concept of rights, just not the one I like. If rights are just what the government says they are, and we have people ready to enforce a particular concept of rights, how are we justified in determining who is the government and who is the criminal? It does us no good in this case to define rights with respect to the rights-enforcers because we have no basis to criticize the rights-enforcers for enforcing a different concept of rights. It must be that norms exist independently of the enforcement organization.<p>&gt; So this is how I understood the OP, when he said (paraphrasing) property rights derive their existence from the state.<p>Couldn&#x27;t we equally consider the state to have been derived from property rights, if we imagine the state to have arisen in order to enforce those rights?<p>&gt; So the way I understand this, is that territoriality might be the reason for forming&#x2F;formalising property rights in society<p>Territoriality is human nature, the purpose of formalizing it and enforcing it is to enable large scale coordination and minimize the amount of violence. People are going to have territory and they are going to have territorial conflicts. Rights are a social construct that enables people to have similar theories of acceptable conduct without having to know each other or agree as individuals on everything. Property rights allow people to have their territory and then settle territorial disputes in a way that creates (non-binding) precedents. This allows people to live in greater densities and avoid coming to violence over trespasses.<p>&gt; property rights are an incarnation of territoriality. Maybe a formalisation of territoriality is a better word?<p>Territoriality just means that people are built to have an idea that something belongs to them. The specific property norms of a society are what determines what specifically they consider to be property. Property rights are just the rights surrounding places and things. Rights are social arrangements that allow people to live inc lose proximity and make arrangements with a reasonable security and reasonable expectation without having to get everyone to agree to everything all the time. Someone has the right to life, that means if someone deprives them of their life we already know it was wrong, we don&#x27;t have to wonder if they had some verbal agreement that made it ok or if it was ok for Arthur to kill Bradley because Bradley was &quot;in the way.&quot; Many norms are tacit and not formal. We could say the body of law is a formalization of the social norms.<p>&gt; I thank you, this is definitely an interesting discussion.<p>Likewise, thank you for replying.<p>&gt; First let me say I appreciate your non-confrontational arguments (you have been admittedly much better than myself) in a thread which is really quite a &quot;sh*tshow&quot;.<p>LOL no kidding, but thanks for your non-confrontational approach as well. The world may burn around us but if we can keep our heads perhaps we can set an example for the lost and hopeless.')
