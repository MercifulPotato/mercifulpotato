Unfortunately, it looks like this tool in export-only.  Ideally, one wants a single source of truth, and if your reviewed artifacts can&#x27;t be imported for execution, then your code review can&#x27;t be reviewing your source of truth.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong: it&#x27;s much better than reviewing JSON diffs, but in highly regulated&#x2F;conservative industries, we&#x27;d prefer to be reviewing the actual code that gets compiled&#x2F;interpreted.')
