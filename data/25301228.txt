Traditionally this was done by building libraries from many tiny object files (e.g. one source- and object-file per function: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ifduyue&#x2F;musl&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;stdio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ifduyue&#x2F;musl&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;stdio</a>) since linkers would only work on &#x27;object file granularity&#x27; and libraries are simply a container for object files, but the more recent and more flexible DCE strategies allow the same optimzation without splitting the library source code into hundreds of small files.')
