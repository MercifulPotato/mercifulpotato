Item(by='bzbarsky', descendants=None, kids=[25439288], score=None, time=1608093767, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25438843, text='&gt; Could a check to see if the name is &quot;localhost&quot; or &quot;*.localhost&quot; suffice to satisfy the &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot; requirement?<p>To satisfy that requirement you have to check for those names and if that&#x27;s what the name is _not_ ask the &quot;configured caching DNS server&quot;.  Which means you need to do what?  Calling OS APIs will do that DNS server thing unless the name is in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts.  You could manually parse &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts and see whether it&#x27;s there, I guess...  That&#x27;s basically Mike West&#x27;s suggestion.<p>The parsing of &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts would presumably have to exactly match the parsing that the system DNS code does, including error recovery behavior, etc.  Otherwise you might treat as localhost something that is not mapped to localhost in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts or vice versa.  This is all doable, but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d want to do if I were tasked with this decision, absent strong indicators that this work and the extra maintenance burden and attack surface (every parser ever is attack surface) is really worth it.')
