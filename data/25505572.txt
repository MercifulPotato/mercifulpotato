(Don’t  tell me about the fucking Sudan I mean in USA terms.) I’m not sure how I feel about it other than that I would help anyone in my life who needed it. There is someone close to me who I have helped a lot and will continue to. This is why I made the money, because I think our societies are brutal and terrible and will trample all over whatever and whoever they can. And nobody is ever going to fix that. That includes me, I can’t either. I can help those around me though.')
