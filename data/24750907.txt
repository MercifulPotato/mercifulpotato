My first cell I had to convince people to not text me because I didn&#x27;t pay the extra ~$35 a month for texting, which I think got you 500 monthly texts. Friends that didn&#x27;t know or when it was &quot;an emergency&quot; would send a few texts and cost me extra couple bucks a month.<p>For calls you used to get a pleasure with a set amount of minutes, such as 200, 500, and 1000 per month. Most carriers let you &quot;roll over&quot; unused minutes and typically anything after 9pm didn&#x27;t count. Though I remember cingular offering 7pm as the unlimited time if you paid an extra fee (don&#x27;t remember the cost).<p>Slowly larger plans, then unlimited became more normal. I can of remember it becoming more cost effective the same time more people were getting internet through cable or dsl, instead of dial up. So 2002-2005ish?')
