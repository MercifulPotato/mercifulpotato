To simply post a link may signal to the original poster that the downvoter couldn&#x27;t be bothered, or that he just pushed a button and ran.<p>Second, even for a broad class of entries downvoted for a similar reason, each one has some nuance which may get lost if all the poster has to go on is a preachy page.')
