Some of them, like the ones that come from potatoes, are fine if they are either uncooked or cooked then cooled. The reason potatoes taste so good is that they are extremely nutritious in every other way other than starch. They&#x27;re a super food with an achilles heel.<p>You can research resistant starch and where it&#x27;s found and under what circumstance on your own, but here is a starting point:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;nutrition&#x2F;resistant-starch-101#types" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;nutrition&#x2F;resistant-starch-101#ty...</a><p>Also, since you seem to like the details, I also found that other than fibre, my natural Torontonian diet was pretty deficient in potassium, which makes recovery from working out take longer. So I went out of my way to eat more of it and I was able to make much better gains working out. It also felt less painful to work out while I was working out. Try not to eat it at the same time as salt, since IIRC the uptake pathways compete with each other. And note that the lowly banana is only a good source of potassium <i>per calorie</i> not in general. Eating one per day does very little, which surprised me.')
