The polynomial method is deep, dangerous overfitting. It’s the same reason why you don’t make a hand-made decision tree: you don’t know which features of the data are important or not. Presuming you do know, like basing the car’s steering on a polynomial fit of the three directional probes, will be a disaster in non-toy problems.<p>This example shows why you _do_ need machine learning. The toy steering problem is a place for you to work out how the car can learn to drive with as little structure or assumption baked in as possible. Putting less a priori structure on it directly means you need models with higher capacity to figure it out.<p>To put this all more succinctly, “never use machine learning when business logic would do” is a statement about how commonly needed machine learning is, not business logic.')
