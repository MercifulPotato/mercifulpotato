I have some experience with ‘Grammar of Graphics’ approaches, having taken a few classes focussed on R and Tidyverse.<p>The docs are comprehensive, but I found the example charts often too basic for the ideas I was trying to implement. This might be more reflective of my greenness in the area than any deficiency in the library.<p>I understand it’s relatively new to the scene so it’s not expected to have full functionality just yet. This assignment made me appreciate how simple ggplot() is, in particular when it comes to faceting graphics.')
