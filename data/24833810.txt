Group chats don&#x27;t work properly with messages frequently getting lost and not delivered to all users. We&#x27;ve tried to switch several times for groups that need encrypted group chat with disappearing messages, group admin, and usernames instead of phone numbers (basically making them the only game in town) but it just doesn&#x27;t work right 100% of the time which is a deal breaker.')
