Tasks consist of constructing 3D shapes from a given set of blocks - inspired by how children learn to build complex structures. The release v1.2 supports many interesting goal shape families as well as exposing many causal variables in the environment to perform do_interventions on them.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.google.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;causal-world&#x2F;home<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rr-learning&#x2F;CausalWorld<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;causal-world.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;index.html')
