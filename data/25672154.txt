I sincerely think you would benefit from being a part of the process next time around -- it&#x27;s kind of fun and you learn a lot.<p>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helpful to keep going point by point, but this started because you said the video wasn&#x27;t adequately explained. An observer says she was ordered to leave the room even though some counting continued. Other people in the room (including other Republicans) describe it differently. Investigators who watched the tape say it doesn&#x27;t look like anyone was told to leave, but there&#x27;s no audio on the tape. I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;re going to get much more of a definitive answer than that.<p>But there&#x27;s just a massive gap between &quot;ballots were briefly recounted on video without Republican observers&quot; and any sort of fraud. The tape shows the ballot boxes involved were supposed to be there. And it would require a truly impressive conspiracy to manifest thousands of bogus ballots into the process at this point. It just isn&#x27;t plausible.')
