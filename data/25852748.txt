From what you&#x27;re saying, you&#x27;ve consumed enough anime and EDM to make an informed decision on whether you &quot;like&quot; them or not.<p>I think this is very different, for example, from eating chinese food in the US and deciding that one doesn&#x27;t like chinese cuisine (without being aware that most of the chinese food that americans experience is a very poor representation of what mainland chinese food looks like, never mind _good_ chinese food)<p>The point about being open about video games you don&#x27;t like seems to reinforce that idea: maybe the game genre itself is not to your liking, but it turns out that the social aspect is worth it. This was the case for me and LAN FPS back in the day: had I dismissed the genre, I would not have experienced the fun of LAN parties.')
