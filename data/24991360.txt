OK, that&#x27;s religious.  But say I&#x27;m an atheist, and I think that a fetus is genetically human and also genetically a different individual from the mother, and I think that that implies that it has human rights and can&#x27;t just be killed for someone else&#x27;s convenience.  That&#x27;s the same position, but now it&#x27;s not religious.<p>That is, I think that every conviction that a person can have for religious reasons (at least, every one that affects politics or society), people can have the same convictions for non-religious reasons.  I see no valid reason for saying that the non-religious ones are &quot;less valid&quot; than secular ones, or that secular ones should win by default.<p>Now let&#x27;s say that here&#x27;s a Catholic university.  I&#x27;m an atheist, and I want to be the president of that university.  They&#x27;re going to say &quot;no way&quot;, and I don&#x27;t get to claim discrimination, because they&#x27;re religious.<p>But let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a Haskell Foundation, and I want to be president of that, even though I&#x27;m a hard-core C++ bigot.  They are <i>also</i> going to say &quot;no way&quot;, but they&#x27;re going to say &quot;incompatible with our goals as a foundation&quot; or something.  But it seems to me to still be quite similar.  People who don&#x27;t believe in the identity of your organization are a bad fit for positions of authority in your organization.')
