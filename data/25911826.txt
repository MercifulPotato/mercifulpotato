This score will be calculated based on criteria such as: ease of disassembly, price and availability of spare parts and access to repair information.<p>The problem I foresee with this is that the label can only capture information accurate at the time of purchase. By the time you need to repair, probably a few years down the line, and possibly with a different owner, how accurate would that information be? How useful is it to consumers in this case?')
