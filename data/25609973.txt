One of the things mentioned in the paper is that the dataset had some buggy filtering applied to it (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2005.14165.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2005.14165.pdf</a>, page 9), that minimally impacted benchmarking some, there&#x27;s a whole section on how they tried to deal with it.  The gist though is that a cleaner training run, even on slightly more data, may (should?) actually produce something a bit better.<p>Does anyone know if OpenAI has retrained&#x2F;updated gpt-3 yet?')
