However, maybe I should read some  of their papers too then because basically all the advice around masks, lockdowns and so on has been proven wrong by observational data. Totally unclear why; perhaps there&#x27;s some basic issue with germ theory. It seems unlikely but there aren&#x27;t that many possible explanations. However these policies (the &quot;non pharmaceutical interventions&quot;) have in the Anglosphere all been proposed by epidemiologists, not virologists.<p>Oh, the Drosten PCR test is under fresh fire today by a team in Denmark for having design issues, and of course we may observe the claim that PCR testing has no false positives must have come from either microbiology or virology (not that there&#x27;s much difference).<p><i>the scientific community (not so much individuals) is much more likely to be right than random people</i><p>It&#x27;s clear now that this isn&#x27;t the case at all. The successes of physics and chemistry tell us nothing about fields like social psychology because the norms and practices within those fields are totally different. There is no &quot;scientific community&quot;. Wildly different thresholds for statistical significance are one such difference that hits you immediately when comparing fields, but the issues are far deeper and more complex than just that.<p>Epidemiology is a pseudo-science. I&#x27;ve read so many papers by now that are just ludicrous and would never be accepted (I hope!) in more rigorous fields, that you can&#x27;t really convince me by making vague allusions to the awesome powers of <i>SCIENCE!</i> Epidemiologists aren&#x27;t wrong as random individuals, they are wrong as a bloc, as a set of institutions, as an entire field. That&#x27;s exactly why peer review doesn&#x27;t help: the papers are reviewed by peers who have standards just as low as the people they&#x27;re reviewing. And unfortunately in academia, peer review is the only tool they have to catch problems.<p><i>But they do, largely, agree on some key issues, most notably, that this is a dangerous virus. It is my understanding that not even Tegnell (from Sweden) denies this.</i><p>That&#x27;s a vague and unscientific statement, so sure, of course epidemiologists make it. &quot;Dangerous&quot; is entirely relative. Dangerous compared to what? Statistically it&#x27;s about as bad as a bad flu wave, which is the sort of event that&#x27;s been seen many times in the living memory of even quite young people. Most people wouldn&#x27;t say that&#x27;s dangerous, even though in some senses almost anything can be dangerous to some people. After all, lots of people die from drowning. Is water dangerous? In some contexts, sure. In others, no.')
