In our country, processing mobile payments is expensive and the service fails every now and then. So far we haven&#x27;t been able to open a bank account, though. All the &quot;new&quot; information mentioned in this article we have already provided when registering the C-corp with Atlas, so I&#x27;m not sure if we need to do something else. Has anyone experienced something similar?')
