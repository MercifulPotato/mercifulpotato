It’s an early version, but I wanted to get the MVP out ASAP and see if this is useful to other traders as well.<p>The app is simple, and you can get started in seconds. Just open the app, and you see a chart with a random asset at a random point in time, and you know neither one of them. You can choose to reveal them in the settings if you want.<p>The goal is to make a profit (and learn) by making trades and fast-forwarding time to see how it played out, making your feedback&#x2F;learning loop many times faster. No more waiting hours&#x2F;days to see how the trade played out.<p>The mobile version has a minimal UI, so if you are looking for more settings (like candle size), make sure to check out the app on the desktop web.<p>For now, all the assets included are Crypto, since I already had the data, and that’s the asset class I’m most familiar with.<p>Some will argue that you only really learn in live trading with real money, where emotions are included etc. And yes, I agree that the psychological factor is a big part of the game. But multiple components contribute to success in trading. While some can only be trained with real stakes (psychology, emotions), some can be practiced quite well in isolation, like pattern recognition. This app focuses on the latter.<p>Tech stack for the Devs: Node&#x2F;React (in TypeScript). Postgres DB. Hosted with Vercel (previously Zeit&#x2F;Now). ECharts for charting.<p>Super interested to see if this helps anyone improve their performance and skills.<p>Thanks and good luck with your trading!')
