Item(by='ericmay', descendants=None, kids=[25717405], score=None, time=1610296477, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25715996, text='&gt; But, Iâ€™m not going back in until valuations go back to some kind of sanity.<p>This may be never, or may not be on your time horizon. Be careful.<p>The other thing you&#x27;re missing out on is cash dividends. It&#x27;s not like &quot;stock goes down I lose exactly the amount the stock goes down every time&quot;.<p>I would personally never recommend this investment strategy (100% Treasuries) under any circumstances. When evaluating risk, you have to consider that not making any money is also risky. Markets go up, markets go down. If markets evaporated (this has never happened) then your T-bills will be worthless because we&#x27;ll be eating beans and freezing to death.<p>Don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking that skipping the crashes and surges are of equal weight. Even if you took all your money and invested at the very top of the market in 2007&#x2F;2008 right before the crash, you&#x27;d have more money than you do now.<p>I hope this doesn&#x27;t come across as mean-spirited. I genuinely want you and others to read this and of course have a discussion but also learn more about investing and risk&#x2F;reward.<p>Please reach out if you want to chat. If you find this annoying or unhelpful I understand and wish you the best of luck.')
