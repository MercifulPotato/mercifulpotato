It underestimates some of the drive of these people to make make a few bucks.  How much would say 200 raspberry PI&#x27;s cost to network up?  For proof of work to &#x27;work&#x27; you need to get past the cost they would make on it.  All you are doing is slowing them down which they can make up in volume of cheap devices.  It does not &#x27;solve&#x27; it.  I have seen them setup rooms of low end Android devices to do things.  This is not out of the realm of possibility.')
