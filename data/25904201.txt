In one serious incident, I was not able to be seen at either a local GP or a local &#x27;walk-in&#x27; emergency room due to standard winter capacity issues, and so had to shell out 250 quid to see a private GP, who didn&#x27;t even have the equipment to suture me up, so my friend, who works as an NHS GP, did it for me in his apartment. Dental coverage is extremely limited here too, although it does cover basic cleaning&#x2F;checkup services (so it&#x27;s better than Canada in that regard).<p>As for days PTO - sure, but it&#x27;s going to depend again on the company. You may or may not be able to actually take that PTO at fear of reprisal (indirectly or directly). At least on paper they can&#x27;t stop you from doing it I guess. Fair point on the maternity as far as I can tell.<p>At the end of the day, would I trade the above benefits (with the exception of maternity leave) for 200k USD per year? Uh - yeah, for sure.')
