AirBnb and discounter-airlines has turned the tourism industry upside down.<p>Now, I do believe, that it&#x27;s NOT AirBnb &quot;fault&quot; - AirBnb just accelerates the inevitable (like most technologies do) but the impact is still huge.<p>I have friends who live in Lisbon and Barcelona and from their eyes: tourism, that used to be a profitable &quot;fancy&quot; industry - with middle class people bringing their money to spend it - has turned into something different. These days &quot;tourists&quot; can be a group of 12 football fans, who&#x27;ve spent Â£18 on a RyanAir ticket and all stay in the same Airbnb room (as a group), getting drunk and vomiting on the streets.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s definitely a bad thing (everyone deserves the right to experience travel) I&#x27;m just saying I can relate to (many) EU cities opposing this, claiming they&#x27;re not getting any value from these crowds.')
