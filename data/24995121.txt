We accidentally shipped an un-stripped&#x2F;obfuscated tarball of our GitHub Enterprise Server source code to some customers a couple of months ago. It shares code with github.com. As others have pointed out, much of GitHub is written in Ruby.<p>Git makes it trivial to impersonate unsigned commits, so we recommend people sign their commits and look for the &#x27;verified&#x27; label on GitHub to ensure that things are as they appear to be.<p>As for repo impersonation â€“ stay tuned, we are going to make it much more obvious when you&#x27;re viewing an orphaned commit.<p>In summary: everything is fine, situation normal, the lark is on the wing, the snail is on the thorn, and all&#x27;s right with the world.')
