If you are interested in medical devices, I <i>highly</i> recommend going there and checking it out.  It&#x27;s an absolutely MASSIVE grounds with THOUSANDS of vendors showing everything from MRI machines to boroscopes, ambulance equipment...anything related to the medical field.<p>Something which absolutely surprised me when I was there a few years ago was the amount of IoT health devices available in other markets outside of the US.<p>There were blood pressure braclets, tons of smart watches that measure health data, connected scales, connected...everything, and TONS of platforms wanted to warehouse this data.  My coworker and I were there looking for exactly those sorts of things, and it was great to see so much.<p>It was actually a bit depressing to see how much stuff is available, just not available in the US.  The connected health revolution is definitely coming.  Something I was a bit frustrated about this year is how much of this would have been helpful as a covid19 early warning system.
