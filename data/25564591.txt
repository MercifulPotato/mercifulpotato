Do we really want aircraft at only 500 feet? I wouldn&#x27;t want even a typical general aviation aircraft going over my house at that height. Make it an Airbus 380 and it might be entertaining.<p>The solution is to raise the height for normal aircraft. That makes room for drones. We could give the drones from 500 to 1900 feet, putting normal aircraft at 2000 feet and above.')
