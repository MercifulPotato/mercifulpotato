The 1300mbps and UniFI makes me think you are using a wireless connection, and those often deliver much lower bandwidth than they should, and always have more latency than I expect.<p>Use a wired 1Gbps connection. If it works acceptably -- which it has in every single setting I&#x27;ve tried -- then it <i>is</i> your network, though it might not be where you usually look (e.g. speedtest measures your overall bandwidth, but if you have many retransmits, you might have horrible interactive experience even with sufficient bandwidth).')
