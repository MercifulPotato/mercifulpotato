CNN accused him of being dishonest and called for him to announce publicly to his country that &quot;actually I&#x27;m lying&quot;.<p>Was he &#x27;lying&#x27;? Yes. Should he have told the truth to Kim Jon Un&#x27;s face for the sake of &#x27;honesty&#x27; and destroy all the diplomatic progress he had made at a time when KJU was flaunting his nukes? Maybe. Probably not.<p>Back to Fauci. Was he &#x27;lying&#x27;? Yes. If he had told people &#x27;masks work and will save your lives but health professional lives are more important&#x27; would that have had the same effect? Maybe. Probably not.<p>Also, since we love our fallacies in this place. Accusing someone of being dishonest for no good reason is effectively a variant of the outcome fallacy (judging the quality of an argument&#x2F;action based on knowing the eventual outcome, rather than judging whether it was a reasonable course of action given what was known at the time). We simply do not know had Fauci been &#x27;honest&#x27; whether the death toll would be halved or doubled right now. We can only speculate.')
