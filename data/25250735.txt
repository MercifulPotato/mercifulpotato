Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=[25250853], score=None, time=1606710426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25249030, text='&gt;we can no longer work at a stable company, marry a pretty wife, have a couple of kids, retire 40 years later, and live off of a plump 401k.<p>This is what nearly everyone in tech who isn&#x27;t spending their free time shitposting about their side projects and the nuances of programming languages is doing.  Sure you can&#x27;t work your whole career at one company anymore but that&#x27;s just a reflection of macroeconomic conditions, the stability is still there for the people who&#x27;s skills are in demand.  Pretty much no competent programmer, or electrician for that matter, is unwillingly unemployed for long enough to matter.')
