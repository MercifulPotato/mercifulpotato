Item(by='seppel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606117794, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25182883, text='&gt; A number of exchanges like bitfinex are in on the scam and are just holding the tether in cold storage<p>But how can that be a scam if <i>they</i> hold the tether? It can only be a scam if someone else now has the tether and they have the real money. I&#x27;m trying to understand who is getting scammed here.<p>Moreover, why are they printing tether if they already have too much?')
