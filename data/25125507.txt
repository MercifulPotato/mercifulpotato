When you&#x27;re saving a file, you&#x27;re also overwriting its entire contents. Good luck reverting back to the file before you saved it.<p>There is no automatic model for &quot;this change is worth tracking&quot; and &quot;this change is not important enough to annotate&quot;. That&#x27;s the model that git is enabling, and it has nothing to do with the &quot;save&quot; button in an editor. If anything, it has more to do with the &quot;track changes&quot; feature in Word, but more powerful because it allows you to group multiple edits in the same change.')
