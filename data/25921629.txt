Item(by='LeifCarrotson', descendants=None, kids=[25925778], score=None, time=1611698950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25920911, text='Annual average revenue per (active) user (from North America) is about $180 for Google, $150 for Facebook, and $80 for Twitter. As you might expect, Amazon has far higher revenue per user ($700), and Apple is about $140, but they&#x27;re both more like $30 when you only count their advertising revenue instead of much lower-margin retail and hardware manufacturing businesses.<p>Searching for &quot;ARPU&quot; news will give articles with new takes every time anyone publishes new quarterly numbers, but those are roughly accurate. Obviously, they can be distorted to tell whatever story you want by messing with market segmentation, time period, and what kind of revenue&#x2F;profit&#x2F;margin&#x2F;expenses&#x2F;capital you want to invoke, but those are rough numbers.<p>To be clear, those are first-party advertising companies, this isn&#x27;t the value of a page view to a random blog with side-roll ads from some third-party advertisers&#x2F;trackers. I have no idea what Taboola&#x2F;Outbrain chumboxes generate other than that they both have $1B revenue and there are about 5B Internet users worldwide, which means the average user is worth $0.20 per year to them. And it&#x27;s reasonable to assume the majority of their revenue comes from wealthy English speaking adults, so maybe your demographic is worth $5 or something like that.')
