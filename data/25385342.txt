I&#x27;m not going to go on a whole rant about the link between software quality and hardware speed, but I will say this:<p>If we can write an app that does the job for a low power device, we can write the same app for a high power device and not make any compromises. I wonder why we don&#x27;t do that. As in, why don&#x27;t we develop software that runs as fast as it can? Some companies do, and it&#x27;s really nice to see, and especially game developers are notoriously good at this. Yet, if I want a cross platform chat service, I usually have to put up with code running in a JS interpreter, through a JIT compiler, in a sandbox in a sandbox in a browser, burning CPU cycles so hard my laptop thermally throttles.')
