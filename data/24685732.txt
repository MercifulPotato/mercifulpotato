If you cannot afford one, it&#x27;s better to either use a software implementation, have a really good service contract with the vendor or just let a VM provider take care of your infrastructure.<p>+1 for this. Hardware raid absolutely has its place, but if you expect to be able to rebuild an array without restoring from a backup, you absolutely need to have spare parts that are tested in advance.<p>Also, RAID is not a backup. RAID provides high(er) availability. You need to have backups still!')
