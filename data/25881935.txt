Also, they said &quot;the specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made&quot;. But in the official Blizzard Weibo account, they had mentioned they applied the ban to &quot;protect China&#x27;s national dignity&quot;.<p>Good videos about this:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uXEP02K3g5M" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uXEP02K3g5M</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;oBpcAEMd7tc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;oBpcAEMd7tc</a>')
