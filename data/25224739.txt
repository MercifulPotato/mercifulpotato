Initial experience is great. A year passes. The touchscreen fades. The wi-fi chip doesn&#x27;t work with my new router. The notifications app doesn&#x27;t work with my phone&#x27;s OS upgrades. I&#x27;m jealous of the cool new model at my friend&#x27;s house. I&#x27;ll be shopping again in the near future.<p>Instead, I could get a complicated dumb toaster, such as the Panasonic FlashXpress. It&#x27;s got a ton of buttons that all do different things. Every morning for the next three weeks is going to be an experiment; I&#x27;ll need to learn the ins-and-outs. Eventually, I can play it like a musical instrument. From there, I&#x27;ll be able to use it until it dies, probably ten-plus years. The toaster will not be something I think about, really, at all. It&#x27;s just a tool that sits there and does the job well.<p>So here&#x27;s the question. Do you prefer the immediate conveniences of using the latest and greatest, next year be damned? Or do you prefer the long-term convenience of not ever having to think about it?')
