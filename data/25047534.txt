Gosh, I can&#x27;t wait for it to become remotely practical.<p>It&#x27;s been a few years -- wow, almost a decade -- but I remember a paper that claimed to prove that &quot;no fully homomorphic program can be written such that the secret key was guarded in all cases,&quot; i.e. it&#x27;s theoretically possible to trick a FHE program into giving up its own key, <i>unless</i> your program is basically trivial.<p>It was one of those papers that you run across, then never see again, and wistfully wish you&#x27;d saved a reference to. Tantalizing idea, if true, but probably not true.<p>EDIT: I just went back to finish the article, and they linked to it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;3-540-44647-8_1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;3-540-44647-8_1</a> Welp. Looks like it was a good paper!')
