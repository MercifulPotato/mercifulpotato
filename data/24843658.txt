I was wondering if I will have to pay taxes in both countries? Am I required to disclose to my current full time employer about the additional work? Any other pitfalls I should be aware of?<p>Edit: In light of martell&#x27;s comment, this will be my previous company to me(individual) relationship. From the contract&#x27;s perspective, it will be from India to Canada. I was present in both countries in the same year. I am an Indian citizen and a Canadian Permanent Resident')
