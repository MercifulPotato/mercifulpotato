See below.<p>&gt; Trump supporters believe this because they have been lied to repeatedly for years without corrections they found to be believable. How do we correct these firmly held (but false) beliefs?<p>The reason these beliefs don&#x27;t excuse anything is because they arguably do not believe them in the first place.  These people are not stupid -- they do not have a problem thinking things through when it suits them.<p>The problem here is a culture of impunity.  These people thought they could do this <i>and</i> face no consequences.  Look no further than their shock and dismay at the (<i>very</i> light) treatment they&#x27;re getting right now.<p>Yes, we should hold the liars accountable.  But we should be just as harsh on the people who actually stormed the Capitol.  We need to break this culture of impunity <i>now</i> -- by meting out harsh consequences -- before they try it again.')
