And that re-opening the markets and putting absolutely no controls whatsoever on them for 17 years after the SARS 1 outbreak is significantly increasing the chances of a pandemic?<p>And that it&#x27;s not impossible that the virus could have escaped from a lab (since the SARS virus did multiple times before [0]) by accident? Though there is some real debate about that so I&#x27;m not blindly advocating that theory, only saying it&#x27;s not entirely implausible.<p>I mean I&#x27;d love to hear your arguments as to the contrary, since you accuse me of &#x27;state level character assassination&#x27; by... providing a large number of references to incredibly evil behaviour by the CCP? Please feel free to rebut any &#x27;specific&#x27; which you accuse me of refusing to discuss?<p>I am making specific criticisms none of which I see you have chosen to rebut or discuss rather you are instead trying to smear me. Am happy to hear your actual arguments...<p>[0]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the-scientist.com&#x2F;news-analysis&#x2F;sars-escaped-beijing-lab-twice-50137" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the-scientist.com&#x2F;news-analysis&#x2F;sars-escaped-bei...</a>')
