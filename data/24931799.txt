Customers want to hear &quot;The burger is great because its cheesy and juicy&quot;.<p>The scope of how you are selling, whether its skills or physical objects, is very important. Calling yourself a generalist is just setting yourself up for failure for a job search.  Sell yourself to the role, don&#x27;t cast a &quot;generalist&quot; net and get upset when nobody thinks you are a correct fit for a role.')
