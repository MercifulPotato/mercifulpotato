I made that engine a dependency free library such that all the math, contracts, threading, and scheduling could be 100% tested before integration. This forced the messy integration into the core application which then was E2E tested with hundreds of randomized tests.<p>The key concept at play was beating all the math into the ground such that it was damn near perfect because a single flaw would lose data.')
