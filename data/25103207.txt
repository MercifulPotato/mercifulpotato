Item(by='grecy', descendants=None, kids=[25103257], score=None, time=1605463218, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25103017, text='&gt; <i>and somehow, in 9 years, the infrastructure will be amazing...</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t have to magically be &quot;perfect&quot; on Jan 1, 2030.<p>In the UK around 2.3 million vehicles are sold per year[1]. Which means in 2030 about that many electric cars will be sold, and so on for each year. The ICE vehicles that were sold in 2029 won&#x27;t magically stop being used, they&#x27;ll just slowly fade out.<p>So in reality they have until well into the 2030s (even 2040s) before the very vast majority of vehicles will be all electric.<p>Of course this is a big challenge, and it will require effort. Anything worth doing <i>is</i> difficult.<p>The other choice is we sit around and do nothing. I know which option I prefer. And at 38 years old, it isn&#x27;t up to me. Talk to people who are 15-25 and ask what kind of air they want to breath and what kind of world they want to live in. This is a decision for them, not for us.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marklines.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;flash_sales&#x2F;salesfig_uk_2019" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marklines.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;flash_sales&#x2F;salesfig...</a>')
