In the case of Americans calling the 2016 Russian propaganda a &quot;hack&quot;, it isn&#x27;t a literal computer hack, it&#x27;s leveraging Facebook to brainwash the populace into believing an alternate reality in which Clinton is running an underground pedo ring or whatever nonsense conservatives will buy into these days.
