Elements within the cell actually regulate the unwinding itself, that&#x27;s one way genes are turn on&#x2F;off.<p>And in addition, once DNA is unwound, split into a single strand and transcribed into RNA, the RNA itself becomes a regulating mechanism through siRNA.  So the very act of transcribing DNA has regulating effect up the transcribing itself.')
