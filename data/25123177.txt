Item(by='Macha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605617807, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121416, text='&gt; &gt;How do I delete a branch?<p>&gt; and then I have to ask them:<p>&gt; &gt; Well, what do you want to do? Do you wanna delete a local branch, and then just get it recreated when you pull again from the same remote? Or delete the remote tracking branch? Or delete the remote branch?<p>I struggle to think of a reason why you would want to delete a remote tracking branch only. Maybe as part of a bulk cleanup if your tab complete list gets too cluttered and you want to remove ones that don&#x27;t exist on the server, but that&#x27;s an advanced topic.<p>So for most users, it&#x27;s &quot;Do you want to delete your copy or the server&#x27;s copy&quot;? This is just the kind of user focused language that the author highlights as simple and complains git makes it hard to think about.<p>The git UI sucks. I&#x27;d rather we were in a world where mercurial won for that reason alone. But it didn&#x27;t, and I gave up that argument years ago. But the example given feels more about DVCS in general, which removing the distributed part feels like throwing out the baby with the bathwater.')
