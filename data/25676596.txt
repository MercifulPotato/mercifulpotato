Selling cigarettes, serving hamburgers, and driving come to mind. Some will value a state-mandated solution to these problems over the idea of individual liberty (including the risks of causing death to oneself or others). Some people will value the latter more. There&#x27;s no one answer that fits every situation, which is how we wind up with peaceful societies than can take different approaches to solving these problems.<p>Personally, I think liberty is a more powerful construct than groupthink or group-forced behavior and actually leads to better outcomes for everyone than group-controlled plans or solutions.')
