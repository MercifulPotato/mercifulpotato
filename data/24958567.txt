The only downside, it has no use beyond web. If you&#x27;re new to programming, no. Better focus on Python, Node, Go, Java, or even JavaScript. There&#x27;s still a strong and in certain niches growing demand for PHP, but definitely not suitable for a beginner, as lots of that work involves maintaining and &#x2F; or upgrading legacy code.')
