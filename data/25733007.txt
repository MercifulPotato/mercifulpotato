Item(by='CivBase', descendants=None, kids=[25734492], score=None, time=1610388315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25730166, text='To be fair, any social media platform built on the idea of protecting free speech will be the <i>only</i> platform on which &quot;disgusting content&quot; can be posted.  That means it will inherently have a disproportionately large amount of &quot;disgusting content&quot;.<p>And that&#x27;s before considering the insane uphill battle any social media platform has to fight to become as popular as the likes of Twitter, Facebook, etc - assuming the presence of &quot;disgusting content&quot; does not limit its ability to ever scale that much to begin with.<p>Btw, I&#x27;m using the phrase &quot;disgusting content&quot; to quote the OP because I can&#x27;t think of a more appropriate phrase, not to indicate sarcasm or cast doubt on the nature of the content.  I&#x27;ve never been to Parler, but I trust that there was some pretty awful things being said there.')
