Yes, we are doing similar work at FAST as well, but one is not a replacement for the other.<p>And here&#x27;s a link to NANOGrav: [2]. I promise that you&#x27;ll hear more about NANOGrav in a year or two, depending on how publication timelines work out. And it wouldn&#x27;t be possible without Arecibo - now that it&#x27;s gone, we have to seriously contemplate how to move on beyond our 15-year data set (already in the can).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;nature&#x2F;status&#x2F;951423495107481602" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;nature&#x2F;status&#x2F;951423495107481602</a>\n[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanograv.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanograv.org&#x2F;</a>')
