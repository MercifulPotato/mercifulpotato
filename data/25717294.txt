Or, how much health risks would be decreased when quitting drinking &#x2F; smoking, etc...\nOr, what&#x27;s more dangerous -- flying or driving?\nOr, what&#x27;s more profitable on average -- lottery or startups?\nThere is a trove of such information online, bu it&#x27;s scattered and badly organised, and every time I try to check to find a better and safer options, it&#x27;s too hard.\nWould such wiki &#x2F; service be viable?')
