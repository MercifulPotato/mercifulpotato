But this is the root of the problem: Denmark&#x27;s energy policy is almost solely about publicity!<p>Since the end of the 1970s, our neighbours in Sweden have consistently followed an energy policy, that deliver cheap[0] and stable energy from hydro- and nuclear power, while emitting much less CO2 than us. Check at any time of day, and I can assure you that the emmissions from our electricity consumption will be higher than in Sweden[1].<p>While Denmark has almost phased out coal power, we&#x27;ve replaced it with &quot;biofuel&quot;; imported wood from Brazil, Estonia and the US. This is especially neat, as a technicality in the IPCC emmissions ratings views wood as a sustainable fuel, as the forest can be replanted and the emmissions will be stored in the wood until this is cut down and burned anew.<p>Our strategy was described as &quot;accounting fraud&quot; by IPCC scientist William Moomaw and &quot;climate fraud&quot; by Daniel Kammen, professor at Berkeley and a former IPCC lead author and Obama advisor. Denmark&#x27;s seemingly incredible track record has even fooled our population: 78% of Danes believe that our primary source of renewable energy was windpower, when this was actually just 22% of all renewable electricity generation (biomass being 68%), which accounts for 35% of total electricity consumption [2].<p>This is problematic to say the least: Not only are our energy prices among the highest in the world - how does 40 cents pr. kWh sound? - we aren&#x27;t making any real difference. The Danish strategy has always been sold as &quot;a job creator&quot; and &quot;an export adventure&quot;, but isn&#x27;t that just the same type of corporate greed, now in sheeps clothing?<p>Danish wind turbine manufacturer, Vestas, was the primary recepient of billions of dollars in state aid, tax excemptions, etc., but every downturn resulted in layoffs, which always struck Denmark first.&#x27;<p>As CO2-levels have risen to a record level, we Danes keep on burning wood, straw and trash, while calling ourselves a &quot;green leader&quot;, while our strategy has also left us wholly dependent on electricity imports from Germany, Norway and Sweden.<p>The inability to act sensibly is depressing and I hate how the entire issue of climate is being politized in such a way, that a civil discussion is close impossible, while lobbyists are having a field day.<p>So please spare me the praise of Denmark&#x27;s policies. If nothing else, our deceptions are making things worse.<p>[0] Electricity prices in Copenhagen are ~ 50% higher in Denmark, than in Sweden. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php?title=Electricity_price_statistics&#x2F;da" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electricitymap.org&#x2F;map" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electricitymap.org&#x2F;map</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyheder.tv2.dk&#x2F;samfund&#x2F;2019-09-06-danmarks-klimaregnskab-er-svindel-lyder-kritik-fra-internationale-forskere" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyheder.tv2.dk&#x2F;samfund&#x2F;2019-09-06-danmarks-klimaregn...</a> (Google Translate should be able to translate most of the article pretty accurately)')
