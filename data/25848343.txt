Maybe a few fixable quirks. And I don&#x27;t use Thinkpads.<p>I try to use Windows or macos, and it&#x27;s a coin toss. Windows handling USB like hot garbage (hub balancing&#x2F;buffer sizes leading to devices unable to activate, webcams glitching, input lagging at random intervals), display issues (macos doesn&#x27;t support displayport MST), dock connectivity problems (macos freezing or crashing when connected except when it suddenly works for a day, Windows playing disconnect&#x2F;reconnect sounds in a loop when the machine goes idle), and more, including just today out inexplicable crashing.<p>Install Linux or plug all the &quot;made for windows&#x2F;macOS&quot; hardware into a Linux box, and all the problems went away.<p>My conclusion, supported by having been a proprietary kernel driver developer for Windows, FreeBSD and Linux, is that any hardware and driver combo tends to be a coin toss, irrespective of platform.<p>But with Linux, drivers that would otherwise be abandoned after a project was shipped, get a chance at being fixed and improved that their proprietary counterparts can never even dream of.')
