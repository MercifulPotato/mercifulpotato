But such simulations would be innacurate just like how weather prediction is innacurate for more than a few days in the future: the problem is that the body (just like the weather) is a complex system where the butterfly effects becaomes a real thing. So it&#x27;s not a question of &quot;models&quot; or &quot;compute power&quot;: even the slightest devition in the model will break all predictions results in a cascading manner over time.')
