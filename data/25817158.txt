It&#x27;s almost as if the targeting models are, in an abstract sense, extremely over-fitted.<p>&gt; Targeting only by the demographic of the publication is not so great because publishers usually only have a vague idea who their actual demographic is.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, coarse granularity targeting is a feature, not a bug. I often <i>discover</i> legitimately interesting things I didn&#x27;t know existed but are adjacent to my interests in venue-scoped advertisements.<p>Even if I didn&#x27;t find targeted advertising morally objectionable (I do) I would still consider it <i>functionally inferior</i> to more coarse-grained venue&#x2F;demographic&#x2F;etc-based placement.<p>Targeted advertising doesn&#x27;t help me discover new things, it tries to preempt purchases I&#x27;m already likely to make, and put them in front of me. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s actually very useful.')
