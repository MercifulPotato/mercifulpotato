E.g. look at what we do for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prettyfwd.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prettyfwd.com</a>. I haven&#x27;t yet added a JS snippet to autoscroll to a specific message if you pass it in the UUID for that message as a URL parameter, but it&#x27;s been on my TODO list for a while.<p>Example thread, where each message is formatted for the web and has a UUID: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prettyfwd.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;5XVkc401RiCTO9hwsSRziQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prettyfwd.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;5XVkc401RiCTO9hwsSRziQ</a><p>The other problem with most mailing list archives is that they look terrible and have poor readability, poor SEO, and generally terrible lighthouse scores.
