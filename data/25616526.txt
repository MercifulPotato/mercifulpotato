If someone is paying $300 under those circumstances it is because they have a large, complex transaction.  Transaction sizes vary, transactions costs aren&#x27;t as random as you are implying.<p>&gt; someone could have paid $1.50 for a transaction in the same block as your $9 transaction, depending on its size and how quickly the sender needed to have it confirmed.<p>That&#x27;s not how it works. Most transactions are small, you can&#x27;t somehow cut them down to a fraction of the size it takes for a basic transaction from one address to another.<p>&gt; Someone also paid $.50 to be in that block<p>What transaction is what block are you talking about? I didn&#x27;t mention a specific block, some have had even higher average transaction costs.  Where did you see that?<p>&gt; but they were okay with waiting for an hour before it would be confirmed.<p>Again, that isn&#x27;t how it works. If you put a transaction fee that is too low, you wait until there are no higher value transactions for yours to be included into a block.')
