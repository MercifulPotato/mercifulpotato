It&#x27;s just human nature to not want to update your apps if they&#x27;re working fine under Rosetta or using Carbon and 32-bit APIs.<p>And for every developer who took the time to update their apps to modern libraries (and would not have done if not forced), how many just moved to a non-native framework like Electron instead?
