The rms issue is the rms issue. I would be delighted if you worked on some of the other injustices in the world as well.<p>My experience with people going after corruption (n&gt;3):<p>No one is perfect. Everyone breaks some laws, does something taboo, holds some controversial view, or does something improper. If you&#x27;re going after power structures, they&#x27;ll take that and pull on it to destroy you unless you back down.<p>This was done to an extreme in Communist regimes. For the most part, people didn&#x27;t go to prison for criticizing the government. People who criticized the government went to prison for some other, complete inane but technically correct reason.<p>For a public examples, See Hunter Biden. Compare to Donald Trump. Yes, there appears to be corruption with Hunter. No, it&#x27;s not out-of-mainstream for DC. Yes, it&#x27;s greater than Trump&#x27;s family. Only Biden has the resources to defend himself -- half the country is supporting him. Unless you&#x27;re a presidential candidate, something like that WILL take you down.<p>Allowing that to work really benefits the power structures who can do PR and hire investigators. And it really harms anyone out of the mainstream or with unpopular views, where a simple cancel culture can kill your career.')
