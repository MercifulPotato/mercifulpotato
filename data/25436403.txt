We shoot our fullframes as we walk&#x2F;hike&#x2F;climb&#x2F;ski&#x2F;whatever and move on, to snap another 50 or 200 on that day while not slowing down. Ever been in altitude? You will damn sure appreciate the enhanced options RAW format out of <i>good</i> sensor will give you in postprocess. Ever did a night photo of nature, mountains, stars, milky way etc? Well good luck with JPEGs on those. And I could go on and on for quite some time.<p>I am not even going into how tools don&#x27;t make picture better, that&#x27;s pure clueless rubbish.<p>Your post sir doesn&#x27;t make much sense whatsoever.')
