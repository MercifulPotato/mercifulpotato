If you know anybody near Colmar or Bergame or working in any hospital around there, lockdowns (decided by the state or not) were more than necessary. Maybe not nation-wide, sure, i think this could have been a mistake, but smaller than doing nothing.<p>I&#x27;ve already said that, but my cousin (emergency care) in Colmar was sending his &quot;best&quot; patients in army planes to another cousin working in Brittany (reanimation). He worked 12 to 14 hours a day, for 45 days straight. That was one hotspot, and Colmar was hit a bit less than Bergame, i&#x27;m pretty sure any italian having familly there would have many more horror story than i have. At least they didn&#x27;t have to select patients in Colmar (well, not as much).')
