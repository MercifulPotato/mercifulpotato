You already updated 15 registers, so now you need to undo all of that.<p>If instead you had executed 16 separate LD instructions, all of them would have retired and update state by the time the last one gets the bus error.<p>Itâ€™s all doable of course, but it means your OOO algorithm and physical implementation need to handle a lot more state in flight.')
