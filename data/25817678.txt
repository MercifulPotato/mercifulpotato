A tap on my wrist is actually less distracting because I don&#x27;t have to grab and unlock my phone to see what it is. Its just a quick flick of my eyes down to see if its important. The watch also uses different taps for different kinds of messages so sometimes I know without even looking if I should bother.<p>Previously I would have pulled my phone out of my pocket to look every time it vibrated. Its also a super quick swipe and tap to turn on do not disturb mode on the watch so you get no notifications or calls (there is an exemption list too I think)')
