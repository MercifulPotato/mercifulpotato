Gyms closed for weeks where I live. At the moment they are still closed again. I didn&#x27;t want to build a home gym with heavy weights, especially because hopefully gyms will open again some day.<p>I also didn&#x27;t want to lose the muscle I built which made me segue into body weight training and calisthenics. Previously I had never been interested in any of that but for the moment it is something I&#x27;m really enjoying and I&#x27;m making good progress with. I think I will stick to it in addition to the weight training even when gyms are opening up again.')
