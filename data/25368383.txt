An almost imperceptible high that occurred for a few minutes just after ingestion. However this should be impossible as the time taken to metabolize THC is typically an hour or two.<p>My only guess is that some of the THC is absorbed orally, but in a small quantity. That might explain the high feeling. Can&#x27;t say I would know what the mechanism for this is, just a guess.')
