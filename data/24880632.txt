It is currently in beta and I hope to see it grow in features in the future, mainly sharing.  It feels a lot like Google Photos or Apple Photos.  What I like is it presents all of my photos (which I took with my mirrorless camera) in a neat presentation with a random sample––I’ve re-discovered so many memories this way.')
