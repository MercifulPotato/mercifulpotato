What I _am_ (seemingly) married to is the crazy level of selection.<p>For example, I need a tool to clean out the dryer vent in my home. Local stores (Home Depot, Lowes, Ace, Mom&#x27;n&#x27;Pop, etc) all have tools for just such an occasion and often at a comparable price. But Amazon has 20+ in varying lengths, materials, designs, tiers (Git-R-Done &lt;---&gt; Artisanal) and approaches. The same can be said for almost any other category.<p>Have any of you found alternatives that solve this particular issue? Or are we simply doomed to choosing between either a) supporting Amazon&#x27;s dominance or b) going back to the world of ACME Dryer Cleaner? Is there a middle ground?<p>[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25038734')
