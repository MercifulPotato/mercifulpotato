However, doing this with an input device that has one too few degrees of freedom makes it very awkward to use.<p>When you have a well-defined &quot;ground&quot; plane in your scene, then turntable-style rotation is the most intuitive, where horizontal dragging rotates around the ground plane&#x27;s normal, while vertical dragging changes the azimuth angle. This makes the final orientation independent of the cursor&#x27;s path, on the other hand, orientations where the ground plane would be skewed are unreachable.<p>Some people swear on Ken Shoemake&#x27;s ARCBALL [2] technique, but I personally found it less intuitive than the turntable method (although I might have implemented it incorrectly ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;3D_rotation_group" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;3D_rotation_group</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tommyhinks.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;shoemake92_arcball.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tommyhinks.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;shoemake92_ar...</a>')
