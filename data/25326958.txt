Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607291228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326820, text='That seems an odd claim though I can&#x27;t disprove it. Why would I buy an artificial tree every year <i>and</i> have to dispose of it every year. I mostly have a small artificial tree (along with a very old pre-decorated even smaller one) because it&#x27;s a nice thing I can grab from my attic, put up in a few minutes, and stick a few decorations on it.<p>I did the live tree thing for a while after I bought a house and my neighbor even has a Christmas tree farm now. But, absent kids and not usually in the habit of throwing Christmas parties, I&#x27;m just not inclined to put a lot of energy into decorating for Christmas. Having to buy an artificial tree every year would sort of see to defeat the purpose of saving effort.')
