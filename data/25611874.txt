It is true it is very stable though you should try to separate the reality with the propaganda set up by those states, especially the US one. For example:<p>&gt; Or is it a doomed experiment, just like all other previous authoritarian regimes in history?<p>The Pharaonic system which was may be the most despotic ever created lasted for nearly three millenia. The current age of all “democracies” (~ representatively guided states with some kinds of power separations) pales in comparison.\nAnd regarding the robustness of those regimes the only continental country to not crumble when confronted to the shock of the blitzkrieg was the USSR (operation barbarossa lead to the death of 5 millions people in 200 days to give an idea).<p>I am not trying to defend authoritarian regimes but the questions of which political system is the fairest, which one is the most legitimate, which one is the most stable and which one is the most robust are not the same and should not be conflated')
