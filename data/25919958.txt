I never did figure out what the date was for since it was never displayed and the clock did not automatically adjust for daylight savings time.<p>On top of that it had a dedicated button for toggling between AM and PM when setting the clock, which served no purpose whatsoever after that point. I wish I knew what the designer was thinking when they came up with that.')
