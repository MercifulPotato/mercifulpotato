As mentioned by others on this thread, it used to be the thing to do - the day you bought a car (always secondhand in my case, I&#x27;ve never owned a new car or motorbike), you&#x27;d buy the Haynes manual, and look up the service schedule in it, and do it.<p>I changed my first car engine (unassisted) when I was 13.  Vauxhall Viva that had thrown a big end.  The Haynes manual told me everything I needed to do to change it, and I did it all myself - no parental or other adult help, other than arranging engine crane hire for me.  It didn&#x27;t run, but that was because the engine i&#x27;d bought was scrap, internally!<p>I&#x27;ve saved probably hundreds of thousands of pounds by fixing my own cars, and I&#x27;ve done pretty much everything possible on the cars I&#x27;ve owned since - complete engine rebuilds, gearbox rebuilds, everything.  I still work on cars today as a sideline (mostly I teach music technology and produce music) - buying and selling cars that need work that people have shied away from as garages are generally pricey and often a rip-off.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t for the skills that Haynes manuals helped me gain, I&#x27;d never have been able to afford to build and run a rally car (maintenance was a most-weekends job when I was doing say 6-8 events a year, and would have cost more than I earned in a year), and do a WRC event in it.<p>I emailed the guy at Haynes in charge of creating the manuals when I bought one that had next to no detail about gearbox rebuilds (when a previous edition of the same manual contained full details).  Instead of the normal corporate reply, I got a passionate, heart-felt reply from a technical writer clearly aware of the demise of the home mechanic, the increasing complexity of modern vehicles and the pressures of print publishing - and this was around 20 years ago. He even sent me their gearbox rebuild manual (a more generic tome) which I still have, and have used several times.<p>Thanks Haynes.  You&#x27;ve taught me more than any course I have been on, and saved me an absolute fortune.')
