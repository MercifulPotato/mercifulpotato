Anyone can fork the repo and continue to maintain it. I know that isn’t the ideal situation but it’s not that bad. If Apple, Microsoft, or Mozilla really cared about the vulnerability mentioned, or about adding features to a repo, just fork it! And make sure your changes can be merged upstream in case the maintainer becomes active again')
