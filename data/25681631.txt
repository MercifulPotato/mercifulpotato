Police stations were burned to the ground. Federal courthouse under sustained assault for months. $2 billion in property damage, thousands of police injured.<p>2. Those are what people have <i>actually</i> been charged with yesterday. Similarly, just because a BLM protestor is screaming <i>kill all cops!</i> while throwing rocks at a police car, it doesn’t make an attempted murder charge appropriate. Nor should everyone standing around chanting the same thing in the vicinity be charged with attempted murder.<p>All I ask is for a little logical consistency instead of the absurd political flame war.')
