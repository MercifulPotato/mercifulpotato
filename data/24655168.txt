I wasted a lot of time years ago making crappy homebrew perf-circuits, before just getting comfortable with KiCAD.<p>Regarding the delay.. I find it&#x27;s not so bad because I&#x27;m juggling a few projects, so I always have one on order, and tackle other things while I wait. It&#x27;s not like your entire hobby career is going to end in a month.<p>Regarding $2 JLC orders, my experience has been it&#x27;s always available once per order, for a 2-layer &lt;100mm x 100mm. Definitely have gotten that discount many times.')
