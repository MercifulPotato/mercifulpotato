Just that being kind and compassionate is not what you need to be. As you say, &quot;an immovable wall&quot;, which is hardly kind or compassionate. By &quot;nice&quot;, if you mean polite, of course. By &quot;nice&quot;, if you mean kind and compassionate (reiterating those adjectives), no, unless you mean &quot;polite&quot; by those as well.<p>&quot;Helping the other co-founder get to the decision&quot; is only going to be achieved with leverage given that it&#x27;s clear they&#x27;re not looking to find an equitable (hah!) solution. They&#x27;re trying to get as much control and equity as possible. It may be the OP has no option but to accept it (keeping 3% and moving on). Or it may be the OP has better options. But the point is that the other party has made their intentions known. They haven&#x27;t come to the negotiating table saying &quot;This is what I want, how can I get you to agree&quot;, they&#x27;ve come to it with &quot;This is what I want; accept it&quot;, and when provided what the OP wants in return, turned it down, rather than seeking some middle ground or otherwise budging.')
