I&#x27;m already acting as a reverse proxy to the host. Would it make sense to rewrite calls to my own CDN so that requests could be done in parallel from browser side and then I could cache all Google Fonts, JS libraries, etc? Surely would need to be an optional feature that could be on&#x2F;off by customers. But if we know performance is negatively impacted by third party loading of popular libraries, would cloning them and rewriting make sense?')
