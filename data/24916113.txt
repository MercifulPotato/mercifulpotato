But the intent of making it from cumbersome to impossible for right handed, broken armed, or disabled people, or just missed the bus and being late, to use the key would be very clear also.<p>What’s clear to me from this overall SNAFU is that they’re after the eyeballs. The content only matters as an eyeball attractor.<p>I’m wondering if in the EU youtube-dl could fall under protection for interoperability.')
