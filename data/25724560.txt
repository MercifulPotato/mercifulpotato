The both sides-ism doesn&#x27;t work when one person is suggesting upholding the law and the other routinely suggests killing people who they disagree with politically.<p>&gt;“Second term kicks off with firing Wray, firing Fauci. Now I actually want to go a step farther, but I realize the president is a kind-hearted man and a good man... I’d actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England, I’d put the heads on pikes, right, I’d put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats. You either get with the program or you’re gone – time to stop playing games.””<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;steve-bannon-makes-beheading-comment-about-fauci-on-war-room-podcast-.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;steve-bannon-makes-beheading...</a><p>It&#x27;s also hard to compare the two as Olbermann is a sports presenter turned Political Opinion show host while Bannon was the head of a news organization, became head of a party&#x27;s Presidential campaign and then served in the White House. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any insider who has made anything close to the kind of unsubstantiated rhetoric Bannon has or used their journalistic positions (rather than Opinion show) in the way he has. There are a few podcasts by former Obama staffers but I can&#x27;t recall any of them ever calling for murder.')
