If your device exists to connect to public endpoints and uses mDNS for local discovery then any public DNS server should be fine. All these devices want is a clean connection to the public internet and you’ll never see them officially supporting blocking. At best DNS filtering is a hack that currently works because most people don’t do it and there’s little pressure to work around it. The device is free to exfiltrate all your private data through the connection to  the manufacturer’s servers. It doesn’t really need DNS to do it.')
