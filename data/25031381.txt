Although how this works in a presidential system where there is only one President, it&#x27;s unclear why someone with 70 million and 1 votes should get 100% of the power and the person with 70 million gets zero.<p>&gt; There is an argument for the minority to have some powers.<p>Agreed, and I think the veto and supermajority powers are good examples.<p>&gt; And your arguments about the the higher value of rural populations is equally ridiculous. &quot;One person one vote&quot; is a fundamental principle, and for every oh-so-important-farmer in Montana<p>I don&#x27;t think they are as ridiculous as you make out. I&#x27;ll let the arguments made in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tyranny_of_the_majority" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tyranny_of_the_majority</a> stand for themselves.<p>I&#x27;d note that many democratic countries put in place specific representation for under-represented minorities, and that isn&#x27;t generally seen as awarding the presidency to the minority.<p>&gt; Tying political power to land isn&#x27;t democracy, it&#x27;s feudalism.<p>This <i>sounds</i> right, but it&#x27;s important to note this isn&#x27;t the same thing.<p>This isn&#x27;t about allowing only landowners to vote. I&#x27;d argue very very strongly against that!')
