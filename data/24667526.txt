It&#x27;s all so ABSURD. Look at me, trying to put the &#x27;right&#x27; wires into the &#x27;right&#x27; holes on these boxes of metal and plastic. What the hell even ARE humans?&quot;</i><p>I thought about our laws, borders, our giant pieces of metal we shuttle around on strips of asphalt we&#x27;ve poured, making sure to carefully follow all the Big Metal Box Driving regulations.<p>If you could take a step back from modern human life and look it &quot;for the first time&quot;, like a child -- you would fall over laughing too.')
