Thank you to the author for writing all this information up in a nice organized and clear way. Like the author, i&#x27;ve only seen most of this info scattered around various videos and articles hidden in with a bunch of other stuff and there&#x27;s a ton of info i&#x27;ve never read before and all the examples from modern indie games are great.<p>The thing that taught me the most about scrolling was playing around with hacking metroid and super metroid. Scrolling in super metroid is fairly sophisticated, if still limited by hardware.<p>Learning to figure out the scrolling PLMs was a big part of figuring out how to make your rooms flow without breaking. In the vanilla super metroid, the scrolling system is used to pretty good effect to conceal secrets or build tension.<p>Up until doing some rom hacking, i&#x27;d never really appreciated scrolling before. I&#x27;d used modern engines that pretty much handled all that stuff for you, but it wasn&#x27;t until peeking back at older games did it really become apparent just how big a deal scrolling is and how much effort is actually put into making good scrolling.')
