A LOT of people moved to Pathfinder as a kind of 3.75th edition, rather than picking up 4th edition.<p>It was only when 5th edition came out and it became popularized in the mainstream that WotC regained its seeming ascendency.<p>And I get it, 5th edition is much more streamlined and accessible than its predecessors (not that they were Fate-level challenging or anything).<p>Tangentially, I think 4th edition and now 5th edition lost a lot of the creative soul of earlier editions - the lore is much more heavily integrated with the rule set and feels a lot more prescriptive. but that could just be nostalgic bias as I grew up with 2ed.')
