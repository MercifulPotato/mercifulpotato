I chatted about similar things on your launch post here. You also address this explicitly on your product which I appreciate.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that these browser notebooks try to get at the desire and feeling for rapid exploration and iteration. Losing context by having a crashing logic error is a massive blow to that ideal.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that your or anyone elses product is only for &quot;rapid prototyping&quot; but it&#x27;s still true that larger projects could be bit by the same errors. When I crash my native code I C-c and I&#x27;m back in an instant. When I crash browser notebook code I lose a bit of time and unsaved code. I crash browsers often in creative coding where I write many loops and don&#x27;t always do them right.<p>It may also be that my chrome and firefox experience on linus is worse than standard, I don&#x27;t know. But I have crashed my entire browser in chrome when using observable, and I thought that wasn&#x27;t supposed to be possible.')
