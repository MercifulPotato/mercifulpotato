Same issue with single-person bathrooms.<p>Reminds me of the of the old business problem - the kiosk coffee drive-up has line 6 cars long during morning rush. Then they stop coming when commute time is over. What could&#x2F;should the business planner do?<p>Could put in another window, hire double the employees, get the line down to 2 or 3 cars during rush. But that costs a bunch (almost double the run rate).<p>OR, could raise prices. The line will get shorter. Revenue goes up with no investment, and you&#x27;ll serve about the same number of cars each commute time (there&#x27;s always a line, so it doesn&#x27;t matter how long when calculating cars served during rush, its the same total). Which is a better answer.<p>See the demand is pretty inflexible, and only lasts say 7-9AM. Meaning your customer count is pretty much fixed. Two windows doesn&#x27;t actually serve any more people, but costs about double, losing you money.')
