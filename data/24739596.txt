Most things that are &#x27;taboo&#x27; attract considerable attention, and are likely to be promoted by attention-based algorithms.<p>In particular, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of young girls advertising their personal porn pages. I don&#x27;t so much have a problem with that legally ... but I certainly have concerns about normalizing sex work among our 18 year olds.
