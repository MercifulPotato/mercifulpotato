This got shared a ton (like tens of thousands of times).  A few days later there was a mob in the capitol chanting &quot;Hang Mike Pence!&quot;.<p>Lin Wood didn&#x27;t say that on Twitter, because he had been previously banned on Twitter for similar rhetoric.  Not sure about his status on Facebook, but Parler was absolutely where this stuff was happening.<p>The denial here is just wild.  Like... this is all over the news.<p>Edit: some collated examples that just went by on my twitter feed, including the Wood threat: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;drewharwell&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348463074295107585" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;drewharwell&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348463074295107585</a>')
