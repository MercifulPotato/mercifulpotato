Spam folders has turned big tech into gatekeepers.<p>I run a data driven self help website and there is no paywall or advertising on the website. Everyone clearly signs up for emails. I still get above 0.5% spam+bounce ratio which means I need to ask Amazon for forgiveness everytime I email.

I&#x27;m sure they get &quot;marked as spam&quot; by more than 0.5%')
