I had to file tons of forms to opt out.<p>I couldn&#x27;t figure out why, there was no reason for that since I&#x27;ve got no ties with US and I&#x27;ve visited as tourist only couple of times. Then I realized my phone number I used in communication with the bank is Canadian (live in Canada, but EU citizen). Please note that the country code for Canada and US is the same (+1). What a joke.<p>The problem is the EU banks are forced to be compliant with this thing, but they have no clue who is US citizen and who is not. So they can just guess.')
