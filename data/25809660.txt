Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610879752, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809377, text='&gt; What about the end user who paid good money to own a computer and run whatever he wants on it?<p>You paid good money to Apple. You didn&#x27;t pay good money to the app developer.<p>iOS app prices are ridiculously low because of the crap store &quot;race to the bottom&quot;, which fortunately didn&#x27;t affect the Mac as much. This is one big reason why Things for iOS is so cheap: the market demands it, not because it&#x27;s magically cheaper for a dev to make an iOS app. If you take away the Mac-level prices for Mac apps, developers like Cultured Code might go out of business, and then you won&#x27;t get <i>either</i> version of the app.<p>If Mac app prices start to go as low as iOS app prices, you&#x27;re going to see almost all developers completely abandon writing native Mac apps, and then Macs might as well just run iOS instead. To forestall that possibility, Mac devs might abandon their much cheaper (or even free) iOS versions to avoid getting undercut by their own products.<p>Paying money to Apple for a Mac doesn&#x27;t automatically license you to use third-party apps. That&#x27;s not how it works legally.')
