I was a kid back then, don&#x27;t remember it well, need to wiki up. \n  * Old People&#x27;s Bush: Gulf War, and I guess wiki would tell more stories.\n</code></pre>\nThese all are large conflicts with non-trivial outcomes. Lots of troops involved, lots of casualties caused, serious consequences for the countries attacked. Now, what are the casualties for that T&#x27;s conflict with Iran? What are the consequences for Iran?<p>Checked wiki [1]: 7 combatants dead on the U.S. side, 22 on the Iran side (of which 19 is friendly fire), in the grand scheme of things - no consequences so far.<p>Also, if we need a relatively neutral third party, then English Wikipedia calls these events not &quot;war&quot; but &quot;crisis&quot; [1] and does not list it in their list of U.S. wars [2]. Feel free to try to add it to that list and prove your point to fellow wikipedians, I&#x27;d watch how it would go.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2019%E2%80%932020_Persian_Gulf_crisis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2019%E2%80%932020_Persian_Gulf...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States#21st-century_wars" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_wars_involving_the_Uni...</a>')
