Well he could print, but only from applications that used the really, really old Windows printing API. So basically you could print from Notepad, and that was it.<p>We tried everything to get printing to work, but could not figure out the problem. This led to a wipe and reload of the OS. After I got it reloaded, I tested out printing, and it worked great. Success!<p>Next day, he comes in and is again not able to print. Turns out that the problem was due to the drivers from his personal HP printer at home. The printer was auto-detected, and Windows automatically downloaded the new driver for that printer. That somehow fucked up the entire printing subsystem again so no printers would work at all.')
