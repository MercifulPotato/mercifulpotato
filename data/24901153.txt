It&#x27;s a very nice guarantee, but it comes at a complexity cost, usually a performance cost (although there are clever ways to approach the perforance of a non-consistent system), and in particular it means the filesystems can&#x27;t be used when the network connection is down.<p>Which distributed file systems do provide this guarantee? I can&#x27;t think of one, so hopeful to learn something new today.')
