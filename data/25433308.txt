To my surprise i experienced  the following issues, which i never imagined given the hype i had received when i was using Windows.<p>1. Slack is still hogging CPU (through Slack renderer helper) \n   - Found old thread from 2017, which seemed still relevant: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14087899\n   - One more from reddit: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Slack&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jvxx0m&#x2F;anyone_else_experience_high_cpu_usage_on_mac&#x2F;<p>2.
