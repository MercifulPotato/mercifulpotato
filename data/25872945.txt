We won&#x27;t quote the exact text here, but the Agreement requires that developers allow Apple to impose additional restrictions on applications above and beyond the application&#x27;s own license. Among these additional restrictions are the well-known &quot;5-device limit&quot; and a prohibition on redistribution of the application. It is also quite clear from the terms of the Agreement that the developer of an application is not the distributor of the application in the App Store--Apple is.<p>&gt;  The additional restrictions required by Apple directly violate the GPL Pidgin is licensed under (Pidgin is licensed as &quot;GPLv2 or later,&quot; and cannot transition to GPLv3 for a number of reasons not suited for this topic). GPLv2 forbids adding restrictions above and beyond those included in the GPL&#x27;s own text, thus any distribution via Apple&#x27;s App Store is a direct violation of the GPL. This is the root of the problem.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.pidgin.im&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WhyNoiOSVersion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.pidgin.im&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WhyNoiOSVersion</a>')
