They came in county-by-county, in partisan-leaning lumps. There was a running joke on Twitter on Wednesday about people who have never been to Georgia suddenly acting like they knew where Clayton County was. It was a whole shared cultural experience!<p>I&#x27;m still struck by the fact that you&#x27;d have had to not be paying attention at all to not understand that the results weren&#x27;t arriving uniformly from across the state, or that different locations in the state have different partisan leans.
