Totally honest mistake I&#x27;m sure, but I wanted to set the record straight.<p>We spent a little over a week working at Timestream benchmarking. Trying different approaches to batching metrics for ingest, threading differently, running multiple EC2 instance, etc. to improve performance.<p>Once we felt like we were getting the best we could, we started our final ingest which we let run for nearly 40 hours (~2 days).<p>The other value is absolutely correct, however.
