That is perhaps the only lesson we can take is that the American system&#x27;s greatest power is its rule of law and the constitution.<p>Many are worried that America&#x27;s rule of law is also being slowly deteriorated. Once you go down the path of authoritarianism, there is no turning back.<p>Only in extremely rare cases like South Korea managed to go from authoritarian military junta that came to power, built up its economy by exploiting and oppressing labor movements, , to a democratic state with civil elections only really started in 1993.<p>Even now South Korea still has problems with following the rule of law. It used to be that the judicial committee is &quot;independent&quot; from the President but recently the Moon administration has completely destroyed this delicate mechanism that was built to prevent authoritarianism. UNHRC openly calls Moon a semi-dictator now and Moon is getting cozy with the CCP and turning its back on the US. Before, this setup allowed for the arrest of past two military dictators that came to power after Park Chung Hee&#x27;s assassination by his own spy chief. Now it&#x27;s gone.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that democracy is truly a gift when it works, its noisy, people fight but thats exactly what is needed but it can easily be taken away.<p>This is what worries me most about Trump, with the recent military manuevers within the country (squad of apache helicopters, troop transports, Trump heading to a USMC command bunker) makes me suggest this is a man with nothing to lose and evrything to gain with the military and police behind him (police were seen removing the barricades in capitol hill rush).')
