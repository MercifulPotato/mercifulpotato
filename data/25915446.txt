There are some tricks like turning off Multi AZ and taking a snapshot manually before starting the process but still - for large instances you could be waiting anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours for RDS to finish. With large instance types I have seen RDS take a full hour just to provision an instance, in the meantime you&#x27;ll sit there hitting F5 not knowing if it will ever finish.')
