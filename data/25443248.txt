But even that is rare. Most links in an article point to other articles written by the same newspaper.<p>As an example, suppose a newspaper writes an article about something related to Wikipedia. I would expect to see the word &quot;Wikipedia&quot; hyperlinked in the article many times, but none of those links would actually lead to Wikipedia; they would lead to random other articles of the same newspaper that happen to mention Wikipedia. It would be probably impossible to get to Wikipedia from the news article by merely following hyperlinks.')
