When I was young our newspaper used to have cryptogram puzzles in them based on a simple substitute cipher. The first thing you look for is repeating letter patterns like double letters and common word patterns like words ending in &#x27;ing&#x27; or &#x27;tion&#x27; for example. In his cipher he tends to drop a letter in words like &#x27;button&#x27; and adds double letters to words that don&#x27;t have them. Plus in his plain text letters to the press and police he tends to spell everything correctly.')
