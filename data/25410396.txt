For both of them, I had to email&#x2F;chat various people for help getting used to the code, but everyone was extremely pleasant and helpful (and happy to help).\n- Drive treated it like an internship, where a TL curated a set of low-priority issues and I just went and chatted with folks when I had questions. Again, everyone was very helpful.\n- Other Go tools I&#x27;ve worked on have had really intuitive codebases, or were quite small, and have been easy to dive right in. That&#x27;s helpful too, though I do end up chatting with people a lot.<p>If I had to make a general statement I guess I would say: don&#x27;t allow 20%ers if you don&#x27;t have the time for an intern. Treat the 20% like an internship: free labour with a little bit of extra onboarding. It&#x27;s ok to not have that time, but I think most people are usually happy and excited to provide that help! =)<p>Oh, actual tip: having a myproject-users@ &#x2F; myproject-devs@ mailing list, or a #myproject-devs chat channel, goes a long way. Then, chatting and asking questions can be informal and ad-hoc.')
