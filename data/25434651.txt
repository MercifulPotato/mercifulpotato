I simulate all kinds of permutations of events and branches of conversations. When I get the chance some of these get tested in the real world and the information I gather from that is fed in to my next round of simulations. Ten years ago I couldn’t socialise at all. Now I can pass as normal in a lot of different situations. I think I’ve managed to build up some kind of subconscious model of how other people work.<p>Even when I’m not actively doing this, my thoughts take the form of conversations.')
