The Firefox codebase may be old, but even with teams of good, experienced C++ programmers I still see memory errors of the type that Rust is designed to prevent.<p>Anyway, you are unlikely to avoid pointers completely in a good C++ codebase. Value semantics are very often the <i>wrong</i> semantics for the code you are trying to write. You can end up with dangling references as easily as you can end up with dangling pointers. If you use std::shared_ptr everywhere, then what you have is a slow &amp; inefficient GC.')
