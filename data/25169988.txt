I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m not trying to shame anyone.<p>I&#x27;m simply saying, no matter your situation, do the best you can because that&#x27;s what you have control over. Also, it&#x27;s easier to change yourself, than to change the world. I mean if you&#x27;re fighting to change the world, more power to you. I hope you succeed and make the world a fairer place.')
