They can do that if they want.<p>&gt; What I find more interesting is that when that same argument is used in other situations, such a small businesses deciding to open during the lockdown, it is routinely down voted and shouted down.<p>The key concept is that it would be a violation of Facebook&#x27;s First Amendment rights to forbid them from banning their users (i.e. force them to carry their messages).  It would be compelled speech&#x2F;compelled association.<p>Your example about businesses defying covid lockdowns is a completely different thing.  Being a private company is not a license to do whatever you want: Facebook still has to comply with the law, as do those businesses.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for something that <i>looks like</i> a contradiction, the one you&#x27;re looking for is antidescrimination law: why can Facebook ban users of type X because it&#x27;s a private company, but it&#x27;s illegal for a wedding cake maker to refuse customers of type Y?  If you&#x27;re looking at it simply as a legalistic First Amendment thing, the situations look they should be the same.  If they&#x27;re not, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a simple First Amendment thing, and other principles and context have to be balanced with First Amendment principles.')
