Here&#x27;s a script that emulates keyboard input and just works. ASCII-only, sadly.<p>Also, in VirtualBox, when you turn host-guest clipboard sync on in the VM settings (or set it to &quot;Bidirectional&quot;), it automatically syncs host clipboard contents to the VM clipboard, even if you never actually paste the clipboard contents into that VM. If you&#x27;re running untrusted software in a VM and have guest utils installed, this might be a data leak vector you&#x27;re not even aware of. So, install this script and only use guest-host clipboard sync if you really need it.')
