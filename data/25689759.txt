My office&#x27;s threat model isn&#x27;t even in the same league, and yet it still seems to have more thought put into physical security than the Capitol building. It would appear that, unlike in the hypothetical you&#x27;re constructing, in the real event, people didn&#x27;t even need keycards in order to freely move about the building after getting past the exterior doors.')
