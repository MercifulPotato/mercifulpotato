When I hear “the tools to understand what is reasonable” and write of “finding the truth” and “collaborating using the tools of reason” I think of things like statistics courses and advancing the theory of systemantics. Reading your reply, it’s hard for me to tell exactly what you’ve heard, but it sounds like you may have instead understood this as my desiring to <i>impose</i> my beliefs of truth on others, which is not what I meant at all.<p>It sounds like we’re actually in violent agreement; I also think that we should be seeking each others’ perspectives. We’ve approached this conversation from different angles; the tack I’ve taken is to assume that is a given and consider ways to encourage it to happen productively. Of course people are not “<i>just(!)</i> unreasonable”; but even if the things they feel strongly about cannot themselves be reconciled by reason, it is still a useful tool to effect action based on those beliefs. I (and, it seems, you) seek tools to help reconcile differing beliefs and ensure that shared goals—whatever they may be—might have the most effective plan of action.<p>With that said, a few comments on particulars:<p><i>&gt; When you read threads like this one, do you get a strong sense that a large percentage of the people in here have actually ... perform a comprehensive and careful examination of the other styles of thinking &amp; belief systems that are out there?</i><p>Not really, no, but I also didn’t get the impression that <i>you</i> had done that, either, so there you go. I haven’t, either, very much; it’s an incredibly large field, so I rely heavily on encountering them by happenstance (though I do try to increase the chances of that occurring), which brings me to my next point:<p><i>&gt; 75%+ of the people in here are running largely on heuristics</i><p>Running on heuristics is all we <i>can</i> do; the world is too large and complex for anything else. The best we can do is tune them carefully and be prepared to change them (using, of course, more heuristics; as you noted in your first paragraph this is heavily influenced by existing priors).<p><i>&gt; Another thing you may notice in culture war threads like this one is the lack of curiosity&#x2F;uncertainty&#x2F;humility...</i><p><i>Any</i> online thread is likely to be skewed towards a lack of visible curiosity; that is frequently satisfied by merely reading, whereas the most prolific way to <i>produce</i> content is by debate.<p><i>&gt; if people on HN can&#x27;t even manage it, how reasonable</i> [! —ed.] <i>is it to expect joe sixpack to pull it off?</i><p>Under present circumstances, perhaps not. But I’d still like to keep nudging things in that direction, and maybe someday we’ll get there.')
