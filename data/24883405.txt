The sci-fi patina was less of a Branded Genre Thing and more of a wink-and-nod to make the critique acceptable in the public sphere.<p>Solarpunk, like all the other ___punks, is just another Thing that people like. This is why you sometimes hear authors dump on &quot;genre fiction,&quot; because making aesthetics the guiding star of a story doesn&#x27;t usually make for compelling fiction.<p>As far as social commentary, why do we have to name everything - what if instead of a &quot;Solarpunk Future&quot; it was just...the future? Branding something has an interesting effect: it turns it into a fandom. Branding draws borders. It turns ideas into a tribe, and makes in-groups and out-groups of us all. Now instead of discussing specific solutions for our very real, very big problems, we descend into discussions of what is or is not solarpunk, or cyberpunk, or the relative merits of each.<p>Let&#x27;s stop branding everything and just talk about real problems and real solutions, not which literary or artistic aesthetic is the best &quot;path forward.&quot;')
