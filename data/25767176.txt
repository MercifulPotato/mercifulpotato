We intend to work at the same time in different parts of this project, so we will need to coordinate our work in a way that allows us to know what has been done and what needs to be done.\nI&#x27;m wondering what would be the best (perhaps standard) way to do this. I&#x27;m thinking that modelling our project could probably help us do this fluently, but I&#x27;m unaware of what kind of model we should use.<p>If having an example project helps to the answer, I think the scope will be something similar to developing a gameboy color emulator. We&#x27;re about 5 people, working at different rates.<p>Do you have any suggestions ? Thank you.')
