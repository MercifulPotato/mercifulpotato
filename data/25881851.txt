Like having a choice how long my bounty can stay up (in months maybe, minimum 6). Receive an email after that time to remind me. Show in each issue how much of the bounty is up for how much longer for sure.<p>Add an RSS feed and weekly newsletter where I can subscribe to see new additions for a specific language.<p>It is not clear who is holding the bounties while waiting for issues to be resolved? It is not clear what fees are involved? How is this platform financed?<p>I also suggest you add the faq link to the header ;)')
