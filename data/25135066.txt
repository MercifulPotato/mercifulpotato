I recently started playing around with SDR and went to look up what I &amp; Q are, found this page (it is one of the very few explanations) and got completely confused. My main objections:<p>1. It&#x27;s actually a fairly simple concept but this page jumps into pages of formulas and irrelevancies. It is also missing motivation for why I&#x2F;Q exist. No way is this &quot;for dummies&quot;<p>2. This: &quot;I&#x27;d say the true signal is complex, and the real signal is an incomplete projection of it&quot; is factually incorrect. The signal coming down the antenna is real.<p>I feel like I could explain it better in 1&#x2F;4 of the text. Would anyone be interested in that?')
