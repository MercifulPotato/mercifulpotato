Item(by='xenadu02', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607182209, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25314340, text='&gt; This law was intended to allow sites to delete abusive or illegal content without being sued.<p>That&#x27;s not true at all. The law was created because lots of sites big and small were being dragged into lawsuits over comments or posts made by their users. The nuisance cost alone was having a chilling effect and courts were divided about liability.<p>The law is very straightforward and obviously good: liability lies with the person making the statement, not with the person hosting the platform.<p>Repealing it would mean the cost of hosting any user-provided content would be far too high to be worth doing. Even something as simple as a product review would subject the site (and their hosting provider) to liability.')
