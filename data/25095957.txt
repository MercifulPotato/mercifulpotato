While I still think there&#x27;s plenty to go, I think there&#x27;s been clear communication about what the project has worked on, what you&#x27;re trying to do with it, and acceptance that certain features, while important, aren&#x27;t as important as more core features. (My personal pet one is custom emoji, MSC1951).<p>I still think that this is one of the more important open-source future-facing projects around and will continue supporting it, and urge others to, as well. If you dislike the hegemony of centralized services, then throw some money towards projects that support ideals you believe in.')
