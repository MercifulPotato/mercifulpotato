And live better lives than they would have at home.<p>But I think the counter-argument is something like this. Countries with an unlimited pool of low-skill labor have a lot of bad features. One of these is a class gap, between haves and have-nots, who feel they don&#x27;t share common interests. Another is that the incentive to invent ways to reduce labor input is reduced, why bother if it&#x27;s cheap? And inventing ways to do more per person is precisely what economic growth is.')
