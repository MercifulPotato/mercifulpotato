People wear masks. Nobody is protesting them.<p>There are big trucks with polital &#x27;T&#x27; signs, houses with &#x27;B&#x27; signs. BLM rallies. And people put pink heart signs at the police station out of support. There are a lot of voices, and I love that we all here support that.<p>Our county is spiking at the moment and it&#x27;s directly related to a series of outdoor college parties (one was attended by thousands of people) where they went mask-free. It wasn&#x27;t out of protest, they were just being ignorant, rebellious kids.')
