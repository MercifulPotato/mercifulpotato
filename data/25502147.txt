But there are pretty large areas with no car entry, and small residential parts are often shared car&#x2F;bike&#x2F;pedestrian zones were cars are not privileged.<p>I also think the goal shouldn’t be car-free, but to have clear separation of the “liveable” space with shops, parks, administrations, schools etc., and the “transportation” space  with the trains, cars, cans and trucks. Speaking of Tokyo it often layers the two, with lower level streets&#x2F;buses&#x2F;truck roads and upper level walkable space. Seems to be the best compromise, albeit more expensive to build.')
