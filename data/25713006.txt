Item(by='lliamander', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610272964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25712035, text='&gt; You&#x27;re taking Kamala&#x27;s comments out of context. She has, even at the time, disavowed rioting and looting, but encouraged peaceful protest<p>Only after the protests had been raging for months.  Nor did she call out the specific groups responsible for the violence.<p>And in any case, actions speak louder than words, and her bail efforts fall into that category.  Now, you&#x27;ve questioned whether those bail funds went to the rioters.  Let&#x27;s be clear: the organization that she was donating to explicitly doesn&#x27;t filter who they bail out based on the circumstances of the arrest.  This was not an effort to merely help the peaceful protesters unlawfully arrested by authoritarian cops (which no doubt there was some of that) it was for everyone.  There is no way rioters weren&#x27;t included in that group. And it&#x27;s clear that the politicians and celebrities who donated to that fund didn&#x27;t care.<p>&gt; To compare the two is highly disingenuous.<p>It is not at all.  Democratic politicians and public figures have been providing cover for rampant criminal behavior for months. AOC brushes it off as &quot;making people uncomfortable&quot;. Chris Cuomo of CNN asked &quot;Where is it written that protests have to be polite or peaceful?&quot; live on air.  Joe Biden only really started condemning the violence after Don Lemon and others pointed out that the rioting was hurting the Democrats in the polls.')
