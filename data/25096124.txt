All this investigation concludes is that it doesn&#x27;t happen when closing and immediately re-opening an app. Is it every week? Every reboot? Every hour? If it&#x27;s less, that&#x27;s  essentially the same as doing it on every launch.<p>* There is no justification for sending this information in cleartext. I don&#x27;t follow the &quot;browsers and loops&quot; argument. This is a system-service that only has to trust a special Apple certificate, which can be distributed via other side-channels.<p>* Many developers only publish a single app or a certain type of  app. So it still is a significant information leak. It&#x27;s really not much different from sending a app-specific hash. Think: remote therapy&#x2F;healthcare apps, pornographic games, or Tor - which alone could get you into big trouble or on a watchlist in certain regions.<p>I assume they will push a fix with better timeouts and availability detection.<p>But Apple simply has to find a more privacy-aware system designs for this problem which does not leak this kind of data without an opt-in and also does not impact application startup times. (revocation lists?)<p>I imagine this data might just be too attractive not to have. Such a &quot;lazy&quot; design is hard to imagine coming out of Apple otherwise.')
