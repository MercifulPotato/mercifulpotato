Instead, I&#x27;m thinking about nuking my Facebook account (dating back to 2005) and having to create a fresh one for Oculus useage only when they force me to for the Quest 1 to keep working.<p>I guess it&#x27;s now or never, since once the account merge is required I&#x27;ll have a bunch of real money purchases tied to my Facebook account and can&#x27;t just up and delete it anymore.')
