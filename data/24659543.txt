Item(by='unishark', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601619835, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24659234, text='&gt; Different cultures definitely consider different things to be acceptable &#x2F; polite &#x2F; etc in the same situation (e.g., do you take your shoes off when entering another person&#x27;s house?). I&#x27;ve heard that there&#x27;s groups of Indians (possibly the descendants of certain castes?) that place a high value on entrepreneurship and that &quot;go get&#x27;em&quot; attitude you often see in motivated sales &#x2F; business people.<p>I have been told something to this effect. That some families, for example, are &quot;business oriented&quot; and raise their children to view everything as negotiable and for the taking. While other families may be focused on engineering or something else. It fits with strong parental involvement there, and the expectation that the children must support the prior generation. Easiest to push children in a direction you know. Basically multi-generational career goals.')
