It&#x27;s clearly dangerous to allow these views the shroud of legitimacy by giving them space in the public square. It&#x27;s gone so far that anything other than a rejection functions as a legitimization.<p>By allowing the lie of election fraud to be presented as just another thing to be discussed on HN, HN is enabling those people and their cause, which is to overturn the results of a legitimate election.<p>The irony is anyone was to be banned it would probably be me for making this comment. Think on that! ; )')
