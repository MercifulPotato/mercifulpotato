If we look t the history of automotive development and manufacturing over the last 40-50 years, every major change has been &#x27;made real&#x27; by Japanese automanufacturers. That doesn&#x27;t mean they are first to market, but it typically means they are first to market with something that works for the main stream. This includes manufacturing techniques, platform engineering, hybrids, navigation and in car computing, etc.<p>They are just quiet about it. In part, this seems to be cultural, in part it seems to be where our major news comes from and the fact that it rarely reports on stories in other languages (and even more rarely reports on them well). There have been many discusisons on HN of the goods and bads of Japanese work culture, but one possible outcome of that hierarchy and control being a longer term strategic focus, and internal commitments to quiet &amp; purposeful innovation.')
