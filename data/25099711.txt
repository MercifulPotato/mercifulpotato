It&#x27;s one thing to claim space lizards are controlling Facebook, it&#x27;s another to start saying you want to shoot up busses full of Facebook workers.<p>Unconvincing? Replace &quot;Facebook&quot; with &quot;Democrats&quot; and you get worryingly close to Parler.<p><i>But there is another problem.</i> These sites don&#x27;t just happen. If they were bottom-up spontaneous forums - someone starting with phpBB and taking it from there - they&#x27;d be tolerable. (And likely less extreme.)<p>They aren&#x27;t. These are deliberate attempts to farm and concentrate certain kinds of people with certain kinds of sentiments so they can be used as political leverage for certain interests.<p>They&#x27;re not free speech at all - they&#x27;re farmed speech.<p><i>That</i> is the problem. The people who farm them are knowingly and maliciously using them to spread lies and enflame violent sentiment so they can profit from both, financially and politically.')
