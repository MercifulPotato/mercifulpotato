This time, I&#x27;m using Guix as my package manager.<p>It&#x27;s a wonderful combo. Bleeding edge, reproducable, roll-backable, any version I choose, packages if I  want them via Guix. Apt and the occasional .deb file as a fallback or for system services (nginx etc). And Debian as the no-bs, no-snap, solid foundation of everything.<p>To me this is the future.')
