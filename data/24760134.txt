I would feel less like I was imposing.<p>You must be well-off with well-off friends.<p>My friends would feel pretty bad if I were to pay for their hotel, and it is not an insignificant cost to many (especially since I&#x27;m living in the Bay Area).<p>Crashing on a spare couch? No problemo.<p>(Even if the economics of the spare couch work out in the favor of the hotel room. There is a utility in the spare couch beyond letting guests sleep on it, and that understanding takes away all the feelings of <i>imposing</i>, at least financially.)<p>However, all of that ignores the fundamental difference. You&#x27;re not <i>my guest</i> when you&#x27;re in a hotel. I can&#x27;t wake you up for breakfast and make you coffee. We can&#x27;t watch movies on the couch until either feels sleepy. And so on.<p>You can&#x27;t <i>rent</i> the experience of <i>sharing your home</i> with someone if you don&#x27;t have a home to share.')
