This is not correct.<p>Example: I type “housing insurance” into Google and the “organic” results are dominated by the mega insurance companies.<p>Without targeted advertising, the ads are also dominated by mega insurance companies because they have the biggest advertising budgets.<p>With targeted advertising, I can see an ad from a provider specific to my location that I didn’t know existed who offers way better rates because of the different risk pool.<p>The same applies for thousands of other products&#x2F;services that are localized.<p>Similarly, the ads for someone interested in DIY vs someone who is happy to pay for skilled labor are drastically different when you search “drywall repair”.')
