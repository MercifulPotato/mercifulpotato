They&#x27;re society&#x27;s skeleton. But bodies are more than bone, and societies are more than people doing the bare legal minimum.<p>Look at what the law requires of parents, for example. Food, shelter, clothing, school attendance, a lack of physical abuse. But parents who do the legal minimum and no more are awful parents, and awful people. But more laws wouldn&#x27;t help. What kind of law could guarantee love? What kind of police could enforce it?<p>Community spirit is not something that can be expressed in a contract. Acting like people should have foreseen a particular asshole and tried to defend against them contractually is victim-blaming. The actual solution is for assholes to hear from the community that the behavior isn&#x27;t welcome.')
