I did too until I suffered from it for a period of 6 months. I injured my neck and my right arm went numb. The pain from my neck down to my finger tips was a constant 10 out of 10,  24&#x2F;7, even in my sleep. There was no amount of pain killers that would help.<p>I freaked out my whole family telling them that if it doesn&#x27;t go away I don&#x27;t think I can make it. There was a point where I got an axe and asked my wife to hack my arm off at the shoulder. Miraculously, it finally healed somehow and I just remember thinking how wonderful it felt to have a second chance at life.<p>I understand now why people with chronic pain want to end their lives. For some poor souls it seems like the only way to get rest&#x2F;peace from the constant and exhausting pain.')
