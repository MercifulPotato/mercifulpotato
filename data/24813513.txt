Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602969942, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24813363, text='&gt; BTW my point was never “your chance of dying in a car crash is &gt;= COVID”...although that statement would be very true for &lt;40 age populations. My point was more broadly that people have a risk aversion to COVID that is unmatched by their attitudes towards risk in all other areas of life.<p>Which was based on your observation of driving VS Covid19 mortality, or at least it appeared to be from the comment.<p>People have a very natural risk aversion for a new disease that is extremely likely to kill their parents or grandparents, that has unknown long-term effects, that has no known treatment, and that risks becoming endemic if not contained soon (and that has already killed more people than malaria).')
