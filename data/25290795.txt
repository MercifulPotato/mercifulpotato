Ezra Klein wrote the following on Vox.<p>&gt; A few years ago, it became popular on feminist Twitter to tweet about the awful effects of patriarchal culture and attach the line #KillAllMen. This became popular enough that a bunch of people I know and hang out with and even love began using it in casual conversation.<p>&gt; And you know what? I didn’t like it. It made me feel defensive. It still makes me feel defensive. I’m a man, and I recoil hearing people I care about say all men should be killed.<p>&gt; But I also knew that wasn’t what they were saying. They didn’t want me put to death. They didn’t want any men put to death. They didn’t hate me, and they didn’t hate men. “#KillAllMen”<p>Ezra admits that viscerally it didn&#x27;t sit right and it took some understanding to come to the conclusion that what was being said wasn&#x27;t what was actually meant.<p>This is the exact same argument people like Peter Thiel make, &quot;take Trump seriously not literally&quot;.<p>The idea that people have to read through the lines of hyperbolic and aggressive speech and understand the intentions and history is absurd. It just seems obvious that incendiary and zero sum language is going to push people into more extreme (and authoritarian) politics.')
