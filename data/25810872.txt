He is quite right, but I won’t give away the plot.<p>Spoiler alert, this is how he proposed, it&#x27;s quite sweet:<p>Anna describes how Dostoevsky began his marriage proposal by outlining the plot of an imaginary new novel, as if he needed her advice on female psychology.[5] In the story an old painter makes a proposal to a young girl whose name is Anya. Dostoevsky asked if it was possible for a girl so young and different in personality to fall in love with the painter. Anna answered that it was quite possible. Then he told Anna: &quot;Put yourself in her place for a moment. Imagine I am the painter, I confessed to you and asked you to be my wife. What would you answer?&quot; Anna said: &quot;I would answer that I love you and I will love you forever&quot;.
