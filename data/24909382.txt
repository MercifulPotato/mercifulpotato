When I attended, total number of AP courses taken was the primary measure distinguishing students. There were entire core classes that were not offered as non-AP courses. It is a major metric in what makes the school so highly rated in magazines.<p>The school does teach advanced classes, but the best stuff isn&#x27;t in the test-driven structure. I&#x27;m married to a college professor and friends with many of them. The idea that APs are equivalent to college courses is largely bunk.<p>&gt; a limited amount will be lost by allowing administrators more leeway to discriminate against Asians.<p>How precisely is a random lottery that requires certain education history and grades to enter discriminating against asians? Asian students still disproportionately make up lottery-eligible students.')
