Aren&#x27;t things like road or education typically part of the state&#x2F;city budgets?<p>I&#x27;m not American, but I used to live in NYC, and thus paid my taxes there. I was always under the impression that: federal budget is for the armies&#x2F;FBI&#x2F;CIA&#x2F;NSA&#x2F;FDA and other three letters agencies. On the other hand state taxes, city taxes, and sales taxes are for roads, schools, hospitals, firefighters, police and the MTA.<p>I&#x27;m surprised the federal budget even has a line item for Education, or Housing &amp; Community!')
