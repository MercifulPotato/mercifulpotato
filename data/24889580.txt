There&#x27;s the same MPI, code optimization, AD, etc. tools but just in an easier higher level JIT compiled package. There&#x27;s also some more things to play around with in the compiler since in theory JIT compilation can be used to give additional accelerations that cannot be done without run time information.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean everyone switched, but it seems to be a good chunk of PDE codes, climate models, astrophysical models, etc. But Fortran is by no means a bad language: I think it&#x27;s quite a great language if you don&#x27;t need interactivity.')
