We had a tremendous time, we had bbq one night together, it was an enjoyable not planned semi-communal experience. \nNowadays, the experience Airbnb offers is mostly that of a poorly managed hotel that has properties all over the world. It can be worthwhile when traveling in groups, but otherwise I tend to prefer hotels.')
