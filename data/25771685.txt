Full-fledged objects are a wrong abstraction of the data in more cases than not.<p>The right tool is a wrapper &#x2F; DSL over SQL, which allows to interact with the database in a predictable and efficient way, while not writing placeholder-ridden SQL by hand. Composable, typesafe, readable.<p>ORMs do fine in small applications without performance requirements. The further you go from that, the less adequate an ORM becomes, and the more you have to sidestep and even fight it, in my experience.')
