But I usually find that people that make this argument don&#x27;t actually believe that these companies have the right to their private property, they just use it because they&#x27;re ideologically opposed to the people getting banned for whatever reason. They&#x27;ll say that a private company has the right to it&#x27;s property and then in the next breath call them evil for having a lot of property and demand that they get taxed out of existence.')
