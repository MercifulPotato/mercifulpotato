There is not a single point worth discussing in your last two posts. I&#x27;ll leave my original reply to you standing as is - Crimea was annexed by Russia in violation of international law, as the paper I&#x27;ve linked to also concludes.<p>On a side note, there is no respect in your posts at all. On the contrary, after two ad-hominem attacks you even make up a completely new topic of &quot;political correctness&quot; that has nothing to do with anything that has been said so far.<p>&gt; <i>I honestly don&#x27;t know if you are a deliberate propaganda mouth piece or just an unfortunate victim of it.</i><p>Right... have a good one!')
