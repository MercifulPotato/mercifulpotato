Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[24726733], score=None, time=1602216330, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24726600, text='Banned means that an account&#x27;s posts are killed and only users with &#x27;showdead&#x27; turned on in their profile will see them, with the exception of posts that enough users vouch for as good (which certainly hasn&#x27;t happened in this case). If you turn on &#x27;showdead&#x27; on, you&#x27;re committing to see the worst of what the internet has to offer here. If you don&#x27;t want to see the bottom of the barrel, turn off the setting and you won&#x27;t.<p>We don&#x27;t delete posts outright except when the user who posted it asks us to. So yes, banned accounts can continue to post, except the posts go into purgatory, where only users with that setting turned on will see them. This is a tiny minority of readers.<p>That balance is the best we can hope for on a site that allows anyone to create an account. If we stopped banned users from posting altogether, they&#x27;d just make a new account and post the same stuff except now they wouldn&#x27;t be banned anymore. Edit: In other words, it&#x27;s an optimization problem and that seems to be the optimum, even though it&#x27;s not entirely satisfactory.')
