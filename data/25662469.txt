They were accused of stealing the 2016 election and started the NotMyPresident movement.<p>They spent years claiming that Russia rigged the election and Trump was not a legit president.<p>Now republicans handled everything really, really bad which made a lot of people feel betrayed by everybody.<p>You could really see that something was not right when some journalists claimed (I think even on the NYT) that if Trump won there would be a low impact civil war.<p>I hope they manage to deescalate the situation.')
