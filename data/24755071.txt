I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised that if the right-wing gains more power, we&#x27;ll see another modern biblioclast with e.g. historical records of the holocaust and&#x2F;or slavery removed. The (failed) Confederate state&#x27;s remnants already tried that by writing their own elementary school history books wherein slaves were depicted as well-treated helpers (look up the Daughters of the Confederacy, or e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facingsouth.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;twisted-sources-how-confederate-propaganda-ended-souths-schoolbooks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facingsouth.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;twisted-sources-how-conf...</a> ).<p>The effects of the losers writing the history books in the South are still felt today (it&#x27;s only been a few generations, and the pro-Confederacy history books were still being used up until the boomers generation).')
