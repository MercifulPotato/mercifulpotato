I usually use TripAdvisor when traveling, and appreciate the reviews - which don&#x27;t have a vested interest as far as I can see. Possibly it isn&#x27;t detailed enough for big cities with lots of great hole in the walls. Maybe we should suggest it to them? They used to have a great section where you could ask locals for advice and suggestions - which led to great ideas when traveling. I just checked, and it&#x27;s called the travel forum. That would be interesting, to post there, with a specific question, and see who answers? I just checked locally, and people are still monitoring, so it may work. Good luck.')
