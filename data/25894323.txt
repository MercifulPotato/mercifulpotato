Since I was going to be pretty miserable anyway, I decided to reduce my sugar and salt intake as well. At the beginning it was pretty bad, eating very bland tasting food every day. But after a while, that normalized. And everything started tasting a lot better, and just a tiny bit of salt would enhance the taste.<p>Of course the downside was that that was like getting off a drug that all of society is addicted to. Anything I didn&#x27;t cook myself from fresh ingredients tasted extremely salty or extremely sweet. Eating a Snickers bar was like biting into a block of pure sugar and just felt very wrong. Going to a restaurant was tricky because you can&#x27;t exactly take the salt out of a meal or extract the sugar from a dessert.<p>I think we can adjust to many things... which is why I&#x27;d love to try this thing, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to be in the position where I can&#x27;t eat certain things without it anymore...')
