Item(by='chihuahua', descendants=None, kids=[25970867], score=None, time=1612026630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25967192, text='What made that first project rewarding is that I had to figure out the math for doing certain geometric calculations: find the angle between the line through these 2 points and the line through these other 2 points. Find the orthogonal distance between this point and this line. Etc. Also, writing code to poll the COM port to communicate with the input device. Those are interesting problems to solve. You get a sense of accomplishment from solving them.<p>Fortunately, in my professional work, I&#x27;m not affected by office politics, and I can handle the overhead of project management. It&#x27;s just the lack of opportunity to write code that does something interesting (figure out an algorithm that does something non-trivial with this data) that bugs me.')
