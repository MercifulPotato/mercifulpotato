And in tech specifically, we&#x27;ve been seeing more companies where the founders&#x2F;existing leadership retains enough of a share that they can ignore the board, never mind their employees.<p>Unilateral control over a business&#x27;s destiny can doom it if the leadership is making poor decisions even when the rank-and-file oppose them. It&#x27;s all easy to say the company should simply go to ruins but why should it? What if the good or service is solid, should the customers and the market suffer because the failing company has deprived them of it? Should the workers be punished because they had insufficient leverage to oppose those decisions? Should a ton of money and effort be wasted for an apparently pointless enterprise? If we live in a society that seeks to maximize life expectancy, and if corporations are people, why should we not seek also to prevent avoidable business failures, at least for those enterprises that are building useful products?')
