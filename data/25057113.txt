I think it’s because there’s a pervasive underlying presupposition that conservatives are less intelligent or at least less educated than liberals, so maybe you subconsciously want to be associated with the smart, scientific group and disassociated from the uneducated, anti science group? I suspect that’s part of it in my case. Also, in my personal experience, if you want to avoid negative consequences, you’re better off keeping conservative opinions to yourself. The same is not true of progressive opinions.')
