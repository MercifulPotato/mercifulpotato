Google One prices seem reasonable (except the lack of middle tiers). Even the price aside, they also claim to not use data for ad targeting, and I personally haven&#x27;t seen ads based on my media content (but obviously I&#x27;m just one anecdote).<p>I feel like the only real concern around Google is accidentally violating some obscure policy, and getting perma-locked out. Then why not stay on Google Photos in addition to duplicating it somewhere else, instead or moving away completely. Haven&#x27;t really looked elsewhere in depth, but nothing else seems to offer even close to the polish and especially search functionality.')
