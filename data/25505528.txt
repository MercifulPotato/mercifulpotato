I can tell you that <i>at least</i> half of those 8.5 million folks jaywalked in that same period.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in NYC since 1966 and I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> seen anyone receive a citation for jaywalking.<p>What&#x27;s more, &quot;jaywalking&quot; in NYC is generally referred to as &quot;crossing the street.&quot;<p>In the busiest of intersections, it&#x27;s often useful to wait for the light, but that&#x27;s no guarantee that the operators of vehicles will yield -- even if the signal is against them.<p>As such, I generally don&#x27;t even look at the traffic signals; I watch the traffic coming my way and only cross if it&#x27;s safe to do so, regardless of the status of the signal.<p>In fact, crossing at a marked intersection <i>with</i> the  signal is no guarantee of not getting struck by an automobile.  I&#x27;m at least as vigilant when crossing in a crosswalk with the light as when I cross against the light or in the middle of the street.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyc.streetsblog.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;07&#x2F;nypds-racial-bias-in-jaywalking-tickets-continues-into-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyc.streetsblog.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;07&#x2F;nypds-racial-bias-in-...</a><p>Edit: Added link to answer my own question about citations for jaywalking and added ancillary verbiage as to the rarity of such citations.')
