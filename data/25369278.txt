In the world of lab-grown meats, you are taking cells from animals without their consent.”<p>I&#x27;m an ethical vegetarian and this logic puzzles me. For the world to eventually move to lab-grown meat, there&#x27;s (possibly) eventually going to have to be some living animals from whom some cells are harvested so they can be grown into tissue and organs.<p>True, the animals can&#x27;t consent to that, but that seems like an interesting hill to die on given other non-consensual alternatives. If an animal were hypothetically sufficiently intelligent and given an ultimatum between &quot;painlessly scrape some cells out of me and live the rest of my life on a pasture until a natural death&quot; vs. &quot;(probably mercilessly) torture and kill me and trillions of my relatives for eons to come&quot;, I wonder which they&#x27;d choose.')
