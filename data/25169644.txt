Which is a weird privilege - they are allowed to be different to the rest of us.<p>Another weird thing about the immune system is that although it is most well-known for it&#x27;s role in protecting us against pathogens, it actively protects us from cancer on a regular basis.  The cancers that do appear in humans are possibly only a tiny percentage of the number that have existed.<p>The article focusses mainly on B cells.  But T cells are a really key anti-viral cell.  CD4 T cells coordinate the immune response (B cells included, as well as CD8 T cells, NK cells, innate cells etc etc ).  There are a similar number of immune cells in our body as their are neurons, and they theoretically can interact with any other immune cell, communicating in several ways.  We are nowhere near understanding how it all works together yet!')
