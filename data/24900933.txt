Item(by='hiram112', descendants=None, kids=[24901842], score=None, time=1603743861, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900530, text='&gt; Why can&#x27;t &quot;we don&#x27;t want this trash on our site&quot; be the reason?<p>That&#x27;s a perfectly fine stance, and it has worked well for traditional publishers like the NY Times and Washington Post for decades. They control all their content, and publish exactly the narrative they want. OTOH, if NY Times publishes an OP Ed that slanders and doxes me, causes me to lose my job, etc. then I have the legal right to sue them. See for example the Covington Kid[1].<p>Facebook and Google want to have their cake and eat it too. They want free rein to pretend like they&#x27;re just aggregating content, but this election shows that they are definitely using both AI and humans to control what&#x27;s published. So why should they enjoy all the rights of both a &quot;tech platform&quot; and also a traditional publisher, with none of the responsibilities and liabilities?<p>Section 230 was crafted explicitly for tech. It can be modified or removed, too.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=covington+kid+lawsuit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=covington+kid+lawsuit</a>')
