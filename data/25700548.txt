Perhaps you&#x27;ve read this paper[5] on <i>scriptless attacks</i> and you know that all of these have been mitigated?<p>&gt; The surprising result is that an attacker can also abuse Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in combination with other Web techniques like plain HTML, inactive SVG images or font files. Through several case studies, we introduce the so called scriptless attacks and demonstrate that an adversary might not need to execute code to preserve his ability to extract sensitive information from well protected websites. More precisely, we show that an attacker can use seemingly benign features to build side channel attacks that measure and exfiltrate almost arbitrary data displayed on a given website.<p>Even better, you have the <i>faith</i> that there will never be a repeat of these kind of things <i>and</i> that no attackers will bother to go down this route in future. What part does faith have when deciding upon the risks of running things downloaded from untrusted sources?<p>Still, the anti-tracking is good enough reason for me.<p>&gt; I am sure the boffins down at ublock are already working on detecting and mitigating this behaviour.<p>Let&#x27;s hope so.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorhill&#x2F;uMatrix&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The-popup-panel#the-type-cells" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorhill&#x2F;uMatrix&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The-popup-panel#the-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ivacy.com&#x2F;internet-privacy&#x2F;disable-webrtc-leak&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ivacy.com&#x2F;internet-privacy&#x2F;disable-webrtc-leak&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cve.circl.lu&#x2F;cve&#x2F;CVE-2011-0132" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cve.circl.lu&#x2F;cve&#x2F;CVE-2011-0132</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;owasp.org&#x2F;www-community&#x2F;xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;owasp.org&#x2F;www-community&#x2F;xss-filter-evasion-cheatshee...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de&#x2F;media&#x2F;emma&#x2F;veroeffentlichungen&#x2F;2012&#x2F;08&#x2F;16&#x2F;scriptlessAttacks-ccs2012.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de&#x2F;media&#x2F;emma&#x2F;veroeffentlich...</a>')
