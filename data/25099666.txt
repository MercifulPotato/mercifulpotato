CT?) certificates anywhere issuer points it to, and that nsurlsessiond (NSURLSession Daemon) will be allowed to attempt any connections other Apple processes will tell it to. From what I observed, opening a single podcast in Podcasts.app sometimes results in nsurlsessiond connecting to resources under multiple different domains.<p>My pessimistic view of today&#x27;s techworld tells me to follow the money on this and that I might not be able to block in-system ads in some future.')
