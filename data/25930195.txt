I have very few social media platforms and that ones I have are limited or automated so I don&#x27;t interact with them often.<p>I had to be deliberate about telling people I&#x27;m not going to see their post about xyz so they would have to text or call me if they want to invite me. Sure I probably miss some events but the ones I go to I know I&#x27;m wanted at.<p>Socializing passively at a gym or Jiu-Jitsu or some type of class is the main way I&#x27;ve built friend groups over the years.')
