If you are searching for that still, which is totally reasonable, then I&#x27;d say it could take you a year or two if you do some passive activities that bring you opportunities.  My suggestion if you are struggling finding something that is meaningful you need to travel and you need to try a bunch of different things to see what matters to you, interact with many different people in areas that you wouldn&#x27;t normally you&#x27;ll be surprised what they can teach you.  Attempt things you think would bring you meaning, you may find they don&#x27;t.')
