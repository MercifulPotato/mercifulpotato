My initial thought was to upgrade to the Bose 700 ($340), but the Airpods Max are $210 more expensive. If I assume 3 years before my next upgrade, this equates to $6 more per month.<p>The in-ear segment was a slam dunk for the AirPods Pro - no exciting options competing there (Sennheiser&#x27;s True Wireless were a <i>huge</i> disappointment). In the wireless over-ear segment on the other hand, it is <i>very</i> competitive and there are great options. The H1 chip isn&#x27;t that much of a leg up, compared to how well Sony, Bose and the others handle connectivity to multiple devices. It&#x27;ll boil down to the basics for me: audio quality and noise cancellation - if Apple can nail those, the price increase would be worth it in my book.')
