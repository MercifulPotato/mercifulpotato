Dates of interest might be &#x27;migration&#x27;, &#x27;planting&#x27;, or &#x27;harvesting&#x27; dates.<p>Setting up stones to cast a specific, and unique, shadow on a particular date is easy to do on that date. And I&#x27;ve done it on hiking trails for things like solstice dates for other hikers to discover later.  Since the transformation of the shadow is predictable with motion of the Sun, I&#x27;ve also used it on trails where I experienced good conditions, so that when I come back to that trail, I can look at my &#x27;date ducks&#x27; and they will tell me if it was earlier or later in the season when I set them up (assuming they haven&#x27;t been moved of course).')
