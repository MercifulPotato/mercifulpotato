When it causes concern, it&#x27;s typically off the charts. &quot;Normal&quot; SED rate is about 0-15, while an out of control systemic condition can drive it far north of double or triple the high reference point (not just slightly over).<p>The SED rate doesn&#x27;t identify its cause, so ANA and CRP can be ordered after a high SED rate (along with tests such as CBC, urinalysis, etc that would indicate other possible causes). CRP and ANA tests are pretty specific to autoimmune diseases.<p>ANA is most often associated with SLE (lupus). Not all AI diseases have positive ANA screen, and even in SLE once it&#x27;s in a managed state both SED and ANA titer would ideally be back within spec.<p>I&#x27;d be curious (if you do regular blood work) do you have a SED rate within spec but an ANA titer out of spec? Or &quot;just&quot; a positive ANA screen test?')
