Item(by='Blikkentrekker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611240176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25858906, text='&gt; <i>They do literally cite in words where they got their sample data in the first two sentences of the linked article.</i><p>No, they do not. They say they used the U.K. biobank, but otherwise do not tell how they selected upon “European ancestry&quot; in that bank.<p>&gt; <i>This, and referencing an apartheid test for ethnicity, suggests you are no longer speaking in good faith. I have already explained why this is biologically highly relevant to this case.</i><p>And I have argued why it isn&#x27;t by the argument that an individual that is biologically “white” or almost fully white can culturally be considered “black”, depending on the culture, and obviously vitamin-D production cannot be assumed to care about such cultural divisions.<p>It has long been noted that many persons in the Anglo-Saxon world, particularly the U.S.A. that are referred to as “black” are genetically speaking effectively “white” and almost completely “of European ancestry”; — the article and those who replied to me are entirely unclear whether they are included or not in the sample.<p>&gt; <i>There is no harm in claiming this research result applies in general to people with European descent, a known problem of bias in existing data sources that is known to have an impact on the quality of medical care, and whereby you can make your own decision as to whether this might apply globally.</i><p>There is absolute harm in using vague terms of which no one exactly knows what it means.<p>What do you, for instance  believe the actual selection of “with European ancestry&quot; signifies here? What concrete, testable definition of “of European ancestry” was used?<p>&gt; <i>There is potential harm in claiming this research result applies globally, since you are working with highly biased data, and applying solutions that appear to work for a distinct subset of the population might work ok but also might be harmful to the other 90% of people.</i><p>Indeed there is, but there is no false dilemma here. — both can be as ridiculous as the other and in fact do not exclude each other, because the term “ancestry” is used, not “residence” which indeed implies that the result holds for persons of European descent, globally. One can be located anywhere in the world and still be “with European ancestry”.')
