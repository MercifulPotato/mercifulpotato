It&#x27;s that every American they have personally talked to about any visit to a hospital seems to have a horror story about (at very least) crazy bills, hours on the phone with insurers for months to years afterwards, etc. That&#x27;s also not unbiased since people like telling these stories, but at least the denominator is two digits not seven. (The stories may also not reflect the latest reality, as you say.)')
