If interior floors were cobbled and at angles, our feet would be required to work a lot more and our stance would change to fit. We&#x27;d also probably wear thinner and more flexibly-soled shoes.<p>As it is, a constant flat hardess, coupled with shoes, only serves to constrain the foot and work singular positions.<p>I know if I&#x27;m on foot standing all day in the workshop (concrete floor) my feet hurt a lot more than if I&#x27;m out walking on the street for the same sort of duration.')
