And we know it as fact: people don&#x27;t vote based on scientific evidence.<p>So why not?<p>My argument is simple. Modern science does not concern itself with telling people what they want to hear to maintain authoritative reality. Religion was a science of telling people what they wanted to hear to maintain authoritative reality. Same methodology, different paradigm. Different objective.<p>My point is that either way, you area generating reality. So we say, yes but science is more accurate as true, so we have washers and dryers and cars and medicine. But we also have atom bombs and given extinction event and multiple potential ways to wipe ourselves out. We are also more ideologically divided than in any period in history, I&#x27;d argue, and precisely when it is most necessary that we be informed and unified.<p>So science is a more powerful paradigm for building certain technocultural realities at the expense of others. I would say it fails in ways that the older science of cultural uniformity and authority succeeded.')
