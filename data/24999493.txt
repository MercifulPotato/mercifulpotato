As farming became more efficient complex societies could support more overhead.  Egypt was such an ideal location for growing and transporting food 4,000 years ago, but limitations changed over time.<p>So as you point out it’s not complexity that matters it’s a more complex and hard to quantify equation that includes complexity and several other terms. Further, societal collapse currently looks very different.  Multiple countries experienced a collapse after a civil war, but they don’t fall in the same way Rome or even older civilizations did.')
