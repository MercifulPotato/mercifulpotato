If you can select randomly from a list of names, and then try several of the A&#x2F;AAAA records from that result, then you may have some delay if you pull a dead server from a cached record, but it won&#x27;t be too bad. SRV records and really smart clients should work pretty well too, but not a lot of people have really smart clients.<p>The vast majority of ISP caches won&#x27;t keep your low TTL records in cache for years, but some do; this is a problem if you have to move your load balancers ever too though.<p>Depends on how stable your servers are vs your load balancers, and how many connections you need; and if you have enough IP addresses to give public IPs to your servers. Also, if you really absolutely need to control the load precisely, DNS isn&#x27;t going to ever give you that.')
