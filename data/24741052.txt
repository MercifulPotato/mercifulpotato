I also made the mistake of buying a new Lenovo laptop directly from Lenovo some years ago, they canceled the order but didn&#x27;t give the money back. Their support was completely useless, every time I called they said I had to send an email, and my emails went completely unanswered. When I tried contacting them through the consumer protection organization (PROCON), they sent a nonsense answer (as if I had received a defective laptop and wanted to send it back). I had to sue them in small claims to get my money back (plus moral damages); their defense in court was that I hadn&#x27;t paid (with a printout of their internal systems showing the boleto as unpaid), even though the initial petition had a copy of the bank receipt. The lesson I learned was to never buy from Lenovo, since I can&#x27;t trust I would be able to contact their support when needed.')
