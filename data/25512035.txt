Most companies offering IPOs aren&#x27;t well-known tech companies with an informed market ready to buy. They&#x27;re more likely totally unknown and lack investor interest. Making a direct sale without underwriter support (who will buy a portion of your offering to act as a market-maker and stabalize the price) can potentially fail to raise the necessary capital. Yes underwriters demand fairly steep fees, but they also take huge risks themselves.')
