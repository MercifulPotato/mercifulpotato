There&#x27;s no standardization on the XR process and I think it&#x27;s vendor specific.<p>“Aderall” is a mixture of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, in a 3:1 ratio. Unlike some other drugs, both enantiomers have a therapeutic effect, but slightly different effects on the brain.<p>If one takes pure dextroamphetamine (“Dexedrine”) instead, that is also available as an inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine (“Vyvanse”). This is different from an XR formulation, in that the drug is absorbed immediately, but lisdexamfetamine itself has no effect on the brain. However, enzymes in your red blood cells gradually convert the lisdexamfetamine to dexamphetamine. The advantage of this, is unlike an XR formulation, there should be no difference between different manufacturers.')
