A bad thing would be if our response caused more harm that the additional harm the virus would have caused but for the response, but that it caused more than it allowed the virus to cause is not a problem.<p>&gt; and the goalposts to end restrictions keep moving once the previous criteria are met.<p>No, they haven&#x27;t. It&#x27;s true that both the restrictions in place in some jurisdictions and the criteria for step down have been revised based on better understanding of the virus and associated activity-related risks, but that&#x27;s not the same thing (and has resulted in loosening of some restrictions directly and easing of some criteria, as well as tightening other a restrictions and criteria.) But they haven&#x27;t moved in response to meeting preexisting criteria.<p>You think we should just ignore new information ?')
