Take Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;_&gt;&gt; nodes in a graph (struct Node { edges: Vec&lt;Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Node&gt;&gt;&gt; }), for example: mutable cyclic traversal is somewhere between difficult (requiring some typically-significant convolution of your algorithm) and impossible. Meanwhile, a GC language can model the same thing trivially. So you start reaching for more dangerous escape hatches, or modelling the problem in some completely different way that lets you skip the problems of ownership semantics for the given domain.')
