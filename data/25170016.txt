Such as serving HTML straight from memory.<p>In other cases there are various micro or macro services to call to, state to communicate on the enterprise service bus or something equivalent, separate database servers to run queries on, etcetera. A single request might hold up several other requests due to badly-thought-out dependencies between services and physical servers. More servers wouldn&#x27;t scale exactly, and it might be difficult to find out where the next bottle neck is.')
