There&#x27;s fear in letting know authorities you have cryptocurrencies.<p>I&#x27;m not in Venezuela anymore, but I still use bitcoin on a monthly basis to send money across borders to my family.<p>And the security of it gives me a guarantee not offered by anything else, by far!!!. I won&#x27;t get my money blocked, like it happened to me with a US bank account, for trying to spend all of my money at once (~2k$).<p>So theoretically a central authority should be able to offer all of that, but in practice, they&#x27;re all made of human being&#x27;s decisions, which rules change from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and susceptible to whims. In other words, unstable and not trustworthy. We have also lived what those central authorities can become<p>Once you&#x27;ve understand how truly secure money can be, it&#x27;s hard to go back.')
