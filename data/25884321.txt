I couldn&#x27;t care less, personally, if you need to take hours, days, weeks, or even months off of work for whatever reason. Do what you need to do. However, if you are on Slack and suggesting to people you are available when you are not, that is bullshit to me. It&#x27;s not difficult to close the app or update your status to put in an ounce of teamwork so people know how to work around your <i>actual</i> availability.')
