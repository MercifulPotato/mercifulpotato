Item(by='TheRealDunkirk', descendants=None, kids=[25604763], score=None, time=1609517664, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25601372, text='&gt; Reddit is good for DIY stuff and special interest groups for personal things<p>If you say so. I used to Reddit heavily, but all the topics I followed definitely started trending into the &quot;crazy people&quot; territory. For instance, personal audio and mechanical keyboards. At one point, the &quot;average&quot; person could get on there and find a good price-per-peformance recommendation.<p>Now, those subs are taken over by the elites for whom money doesn&#x27;t matter. I mean, it&#x27;s neat that someone spent $2,000 building a custom-PCB&#x27;d, custom-switched, custom-capped keyboard -- and boy, those pics sure are sexy -- but there are only so many of those posts I can take until I realized that no one was talking about the range I can afford any more.<p>Reddit exists now as the worlds largest porn hub, with a very, very thin veneer over the top for respectability. If I google something specific -- like a question about a video game -- I specifically add &quot;-site:reddit.com&quot; because 1) 9 times out of 10, there&#x27;s actually no answer, and 2) it takes a few clicks and many seconds to get TO the answer, because of their horrendous web site.<p>And, yes, I&#x27;m bitter, and bag on Reddit whenever I can.')
