Popular options in the high end are displays like the LG 48 CX or some of the &quot;G-Sync Ultimate&quot; monitors like the Predator x27. These kinds of displays start at prices higher than a 3080 though so you don&#x27;t hear about the market as much since people usually expect to spend less on a monitor than a GPU and the 3080 is generally consider the top of most high end price ranges.')
