They assimilate and then try appropriate without building a community around it. Joyent public is kinda dead. There is a fork of SmartOS (Danube Cloud), which has far better documentation is much easier to run and actually runs in cheap DC environments like OVH and Hetzner and they have 2.5 active developers.<p>Tizen is much better in terms of battery than Android Wearable and most other wearables, has pretty decent features, but is a complete mess to get applications on and there is hardly any third party using Tizen, let alone write documentation&#x2F;tutorials on its development.<p>All I know about Tizen is from reverse engineering my shitty Galaxy Active 2 with all the on launch promised features disabled if you don&#x27;t use a Samsung phone and most of them released over a year after the original announcement.<p>Most people on xda-developers say that it will be their last Samsung wearable. And if you look at the numbers Samsung wearables has crashed in sales.')
