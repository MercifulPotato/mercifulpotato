If they get the idea that they need to hurt you, they hurt you. A friend of mine was nearly killed by a cow a few years ago - as luck would have it the cow tried to crush him into some boggy ground so he wasn&#x27;t <i>all that</i> crushed. If it had been solid ground he&#x27;d have been as dead as nails.')
