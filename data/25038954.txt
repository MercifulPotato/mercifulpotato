Costco charges $2 each for 8x10 enlargements.  Given that HPs base add-on rate is $0.10&#x2F;pg, there are environments where that could make sense.  Kinkos and Fedex routinely charge $0.50&#x2F;pg for color prints.<p>Sure, I wouldn&#x27;t print 500 pages of B&amp;W text on instant ink, but when printing things that require color, it&#x27;s not ridiculously expensive.')
