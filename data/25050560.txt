I have to imagine more and more of the internet is behind cloudflare &#x2F; cloudfront &#x2F; etc, and you probably can&#x27;t block&#x2F;grant access to a single site without catching a bunch of unrelated ones as well.  An HTTP(S) proxy approach seems like it would work a lot better.  No offense to the author, they clearly know their stuff, but this feels like they know networking pretty well and want to use it to solve a problem  that it&#x27;s no longer suited for.  I remember the internet of the 90s and DNS filtering would have worked a treat back then.<p>Why does the term VLAN not show up anywhere in the guide?  Can&#x27;t VLANs (with radius (?)) be used to segment traffic without requiring multi-port NICs (and running N ethernet cables if I want to have access to N different network segments from the same room)?  (I really, clearly, don&#x27;t know that much about networking)<p>Increasingly, I get frustrated by network- and machine&#x2F;OS-focused security measures.  I don&#x27;t want to bother with making sure all the unix user ids on all the machines on my network match in order for unix permissions to work right.  I don&#x27;t want to think about tagging traffic in iptables with unix users and only allowing traffic that belongs to my personal user to egress over the &#x27;trusted&#x27; NIC.  These things should be handled by app-layer controls, sort of BeyondCorp for everything.')
