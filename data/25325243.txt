Zipfiles start at the end ALWAYS. The format was designed to be able to just jump to the end of the file, read the table of contents, append new data, write a new table of contents. That new table of contents might not even reference the data at the front of the file.<p>It was designed this way because it comes from the era of floppy disks. If you had a zip file spanning multiple discs and you wanted to update `firstfile.txt` at the front of the zip file you didn&#x27;t want to have to insert all 10 disks and read and re-write all the data. You just wanted to insert the last disk, read the table of contents, append your new `firstfile.txt` and write a new table of contents. The invalid `firstfile.txt` still exists at the front but it&#x27;s ignored by the table of contents.<p>If you&#x27;re going do stupid tricks by scanning from the front then you&#x27;d be better off choosing a format for which that&#x27;s actually valid like .tar.gz or something')
