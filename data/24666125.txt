You didn’t do it in isolation. At the very least the reason you were able to increase revenue by a third was because there was a revenue and a customer base to start with. You didn’t create that, that was given to you to leverage off of. I assume you had infrastructure and tooling support as well. So at the very least that increase revenue should be distributed amongst other employees that build the foundation in the first place.')
