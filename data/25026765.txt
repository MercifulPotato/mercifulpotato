That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t use them for serious work.<p>&gt; why did you even open an account<p>Different use cases, different circumstances. I don&#x27;t depend on them but they give good exchange rates and zero fees when transferring or spending money abroad. It&#x27;s the &quot;it just works&quot; and &quot;fast and cheap&quot; effect that the traditional banks don&#x27;t have. And opening an account is done online, and you get access to your account in hours, compared to Barclays which took 2 months of ping pong, when I first moved into the UK (since I did not have a bill issued in my name at my UK address I could not open an account, so I could not pay my landlord rent so I could get an address to open an account, fun times). Without that Monzo account I could have not been paid in my first 2 months.<p>But if you want to know how crap Revolut really is, try contacting their support to report a bug in their app, they don&#x27;t have an email, but instead ask you to get in touch with them on Facebook.')
