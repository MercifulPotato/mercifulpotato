Lots of people enjoy a glass of wine or a beer or sipping whiskey or whatever, not because it makes them drunk, but because they enjoy the flavor (e.g., wine pairings, etc). I&#x27;m pretty sure almost everyone who does drugs does so to get high. Note that I&#x27;m <i>not</i> arguing that alcohol is better than drugs, only that I think this distinction is important.')
