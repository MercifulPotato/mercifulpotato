Smart Devices are complex things, who knows about every option and setting there is on an iPad? I would like to think I’m rather clued up on such things but I’ll be the first to admit I’m not aware of every option or settings there is on one.<p>I know the payment controls exist, you reading this probably know these controls exist, but because this type of story (inadvertently spent X on app&#x2F;play store) pops up so often it tells me that not everyone is aware of such a feature. (A client who I know is tech savvy was not aware about the parental control options in iOS where he and his wife could control their child’s access limits from their phones. If he wasn’t aware of the feature then to me that’s a pointer that such features are not talked about enough)<p>I don’t think that a single message during on boarding is enough, it might not seem needed at the time, situations change, the user think “I’ll do that later” but forget. So I would like to see more reminders about the feature. (but I do understand that there is a fine line between reminding and annoying, I’m looking at you iPlayer)')
