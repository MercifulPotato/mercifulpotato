Installing would be download the apk and open it which works today, although you generally have to set a setting somewhere.<p>There&#x27;s certainly a discovery benefit to Google Play, but anybody could build an app discovery site and make an app from that with an embedded browser, open the downloaded apks with the system intent and get the permissions prompt etc. You don&#x27;t even need the special app management permission if you embrace the system tools that are already there. You would lose automatic updates without that though (but then, a lot of people in India have auto-updates off to conserve bandwidth or storage space).<p>Google play certainly does some small curation function, but I don&#x27;t know how useful that is, and you could still have Google Play services running background scans and malware blacklists.')
