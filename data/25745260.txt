There&#x27;s no point in doing all of what the OP did.<p>IPv6 was finalized in 2017.<p>In 2020 Europe ran out of IPv4 addresses, and many Asian countries never had enough of them to start with (so quite a bit of people are effectively IPv6-only already).<p>An &quot;I&quot;SP that doesn&#x27;t provide a &#x2F;48 or &#x2F;56 IPv6, shouldn&#x27;t be legally allowed to advertise that they are providing &quot;Internet&quot; (and technically&#x2F;historically, they&#x27;re actually providing ARPANET, IPv4 having been supposed to be only a temporary, experimental version.).<p>And just like it was done for obsolete TV technologies, laws should be put in place first outlawing hardware that isn&#x27;t compatible with IPv6, then later hardware compatible with IPv4.')
