I receive much less messages than before, I&#x27;m left out of the cool conversations happening in WhatsApp groups).<p>- I thought Google&#x27;s keyboard could use some improvements, but the AOSP one is much worse.<p>- I can&#x27;t use my banking app, and their mobile web app doesn&#x27;t work with KeepassDX so I have to manually enter my account infos each time.<p>- notifications are hit and miss. The reminder app that I found on FDroid didn&#x27;t fire a reminder this morning. I had to get another Clock app, the AOSP one insisted to make an audible notification 1.5h before any alarm (it was silent on Google&#x27;s).<p>- email clients: FairEmail is good but lacks ergonomy.K-9 mail is a joke. (I like to separate my email accounts in separate clients).<p>- the icons are ugly and I didn&#x27;t find any way to change them.<p>All in all I&#x27;m not exactly living the dream right now. I don&#x27;t use social medias (except YouTube on my desktop where I can block ads) I think I would have a much harder time if I had to use web apps to connect to social medias.')
