I learned to do engineering while consuming marijuana by working on personal projects in the evenings at home. I found that in the right setting and with the right dosage marijuana seems to help me achieve a &quot;flow state&quot; of focus. Of course, too much and you&#x27;ll dash your short term memory and forget what you&#x27;re working on. Its no silver bullet but I seem to have learned a lot about how to use it by now.')
