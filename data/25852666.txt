It&#x27;s a pay-for site with a reasonable cost, similar to a ticket price you&#x27;d get at a club for a night.<p>I almost gave up on trying to wade through some of the crap on the latest and greatest music subscription services. Sometimes you just gotta let the underground artists take care of things!<p>The site owner and moderators are good people trying to do great things with some of the most talented DJ&#x27;s. Check it out every Friday and Saturday. Note: All times are in London time, FYI.')
