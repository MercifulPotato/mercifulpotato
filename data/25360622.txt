Airpods can do it between every Apple device, without doing anything.<p>I dunno, it seems like you&#x27;re the one ignoring what people are saying. Multiple people in this thread are specifically pointing out that Jabra can easily do this automated switching too, with no issues. I don&#x27;t know why you keep ignoring that.<p>&gt;The situation you&#x27;re describing where you use the Jabra headsets&#x2F;phones with an iPad, tablet, and other Macbooks requires you to connect to the devices manually.<p>No, that&#x27;s not what I said. The Jabras automatically switch between all of my devices (with the sole exception of the iPad for an unknown reason). It does not require <i>any</i> manual acts on my part.<p>&gt;If you have to manually switch anything then you either don&#x27;t have them set up correctly or you intentionally turned something off.<p>Yes, I intentionally turned off the Automatic switching feature of the Airpods because if I left it on, the Airpods would decide to randomly switch devices even when I was in the middle of a phone call, in the middle of a song, or randomly switch to a device that was sitting in another room completely unused. The Automatic switching feature on the Airpods is completely unusable to me, and after talking to other Airpods users, they found the same. The Jabras, on the other hand, don&#x27;t have any such issues, and thus the Jabras are much more seamless.')
