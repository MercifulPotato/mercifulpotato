I&#x27;m a little surprised it&#x27;s a common thing. Stripe&#x27;s secret key is the &quot;keys to kingdom&quot; so to speak. This means someone with the key can get up to all kinds of funny stuff.<p>Stripe also says not to do it:<p>&gt; Your API keys give you access to Stripe’s systems and a global financial network. That access is what card testers want to exploit, so it’s important to keep your keys safe and put safeguards around the functionality those keys provide to prevent fraud and other malicious activity.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;card-testing#stripe-mitigations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;card-testing#stripe-mitigations</a><p>&gt; Your secret API key can be used to make any API call on behalf of your account, such as creating charges or performing refunds. Treat your secret API key as you would any other password. Grant access only to those who need it. Ensure it is kept out of any version control system you may be using.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;keys#keeping-your-keys-safe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;keys#keeping-your-keys-safe</a>')
