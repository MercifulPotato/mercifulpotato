While my tiny individual contribution may make no visible difference, our collective ability to act for the common good is what will determine how many fathers and mothers bury a son&#x2F;daughter, how many children will be bereft of a parent, and how many families mourn a loved one we will see over the course of the pandemic and I will therefore do my duty.  It is the decent thing to do.')
