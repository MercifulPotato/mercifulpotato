Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25068056], score=None, time=1605142209, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25057868, text='&gt; Is there something particular you&#x27;d like to point to? I accept the SSH disaster. But that&#x27;s 12 years ago now, and it is a single example.<p>Debian&#x27;s patches to cdrecord introduced so many bugs that they eventually ended up driving the original author away from open source.<p>I <i>think</i> I remember something about the python 2 -&gt; 3 transition being harder on Debian because of changes they&#x27;ve made?<p>The packaged Tomcat on Debian is so different that every time I&#x27;ve seen someone running Tomcat they&#x27;ve installed it manually instead.<p>Debian has essentially given up on packaging Hadoop. Some of their criticisms of its build process are certainly valid, but others seem to be an unreasonable expectation that everything will build exactly the way Debian expects. E.g. if I&#x27;m understanding correctly, they essentially take the position that they won&#x27;t package anything built with Maven, on frankly spurious grounds.<p>Debian tends to end up with very outdated versions of anything from an ecosystem that uses large numbers of small libraries, or, basically, anything that isn&#x27;t written in C or Perl. E.g. Python libraries are typically a long way out of date (even compared to other distributions), and Debian&#x27;s package management tends to be less compatible with Python&#x27;s built-in tools like pip than other distributions (e.g. Debian is more likely to rename a Python library, in my experience, which then breaks reverse-dependencies on that library or leads to having two incompatible copies of it installed). So people running Python programs on Debian tend to end up with either a difficult-to-manage mix of system and non-system dependencies, or multiple parallel installs of Python.<p>You could say that Debian offers a reliable platform and it&#x27;s the users&#x27; fault for installing these unreliable things on top of it. But an OS exists to run applications, not the other way around, and I find that in practice Debian&#x27;s approach means users are forced to step outside the managed parts of it much more than with other distributions, and it handles it less well when they do, making for setups that are less reliable in practice. Put it this way: the &quot;add-on repository&quot; culture is a lot stronger in Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu than in other distributions, and I think that&#x27;s actually a weakness rather than a strength.')
