Item(by='cgriswald', descendants=None, kids=[25835668], score=None, time=1611075224, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834445, text='Writing a novel is definitely a &#x27;to each, his own&#x27; practice.<p>I can format text all day. It&#x27;s a huge distraction that allows me to also feel &#x27;productive&#x27;; which gets in the way of actually writing. Using a markdown editor lets me do the formatting that is necessary for the work (<i>e.g.</i>, italics) without being hugely distracted.<p>&gt; But it should hide the syntax just like rtf editors do (unless you want to see it).<p>I&#x27;m using Obsidian and wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing this feature. However, it currently offers the option of toggling quickly between edit and preview modes, or opening up a second view for preview, which can optionally be scroll-locked with the editing window. That works great for me.<p>I use copious amounts of <i>notes</i> in my fiction writing, that sometimes include mathematical&#x2F;physical formulas, data, and code. Obsidian supports (various amounts of) inline LaTeX, syntax-highlighting, and mermaid. (I&#x27;m also not above abusing these things for my own purposes: I&#x27;ve used mermaid graph to create a quick-and-dirty character family tree for my own reference, for instance.) And, of course, I use markdown to tie all these notes together and to the novel.')
