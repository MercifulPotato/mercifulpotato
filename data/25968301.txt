Item(by='filleduchaos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612006890, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25967732, text='Imagine that you were discussing Nazi Germany&#x27;s relations with Belgium during the second world war with someone, and were making the argument that clearly the Third Reich and Belgium were in opposition (considering little things like Hitler invading the country, or the resistance from Belgians during its occupation). Imagine that I then showed up with the absolutely stellar retort of &quot;Is that somehow different from how Belgium invaded and occupied people they didn&#x27;t like?&quot;, linking to the country&#x27;s imperial&#x2F;colonial history in Congo that resulted in the deaths of millions of people.<p>Do you understand how that could be seen as rather obnoxious whataboutism that&#x27;s both entirely irrelevant to the discussion actually being had <i>and</i> misses the point by a mile?')
