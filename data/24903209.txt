From the complaint:<p>&gt; The clear purpose of this source code is to (i) circumvent the technological protection measures used by authorized streaming services such as YouTube, and (ii) reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization for such use.<p>(i) Does YouTube have &quot;technological protection measures&quot; that prevent downloading? In the case of the AACS controversy, this was a bit more clear-cut: there was a secret key that was cracked, but what exactly is being &quot;circumvented&quot; in this case?<p>(ii) Nowhere does youtube-dl advertise that it&#x27;s to be used to &quot;reproduce and distribute&quot; without authorization.<p>I feel like this is a YouTube ToS violation, not a DMCA-strike-worthy copyright violation.')
