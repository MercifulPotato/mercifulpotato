It&#x27;s all part of graphics processing, so there is definitely some common terminology there.<p>For some SDFs you could start with IQ&#x27;s page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iquilezles.org&#x2F;www&#x2F;articles&#x2F;distfunctions&#x2F;distfunctions.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iquilezles.org&#x2F;www&#x2F;articles&#x2F;distfunctions&#x2F;distfu...</a>')
