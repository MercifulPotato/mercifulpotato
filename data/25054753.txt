Item(by='ecesena', descendants=None, kids=[25054863, 25069975], score=None, time=1605060001, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25054555, text='FIDO2 supports password-less and username-less authentication, both as a single factor, i.e. no passwords.<p>Password-less is like 2FA but without the first factor. You type in your username, next you use the security key.<p>Username-less is done via resident keys, that can also store the username at registration. The whole experience is just authenticating with the security key.<p>If you use FIDO without a password (not as 2FA, but as single factor), you want to enable client-side protection like a PIN or biometric. These keys are introducing the biometric option so you can just tap, without entering a PIN.<p>Edit: oh, this works already today, you can test it on Microsoft accounts, e.g. outlook.com')
