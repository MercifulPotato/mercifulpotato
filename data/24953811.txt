I don&#x27;t want to sound unfair but &#x27;community&#x27; this way reminds me of how &#x27;family&#x27; is often used as a blunt instrument too. You&#x27;re powerless against the larger group (or the mob) and their expectations, which are ever changing. Reform is quite a strong word (with strong authoritarian connotations) and I do wonder what the reaction would be if the proponents of this found themselves on the receiving end of it.')
