Reducing emissions to <i></i>close to<i></i> 0 is definitely very important but it seems probable that we&#x27;ll reach a steady state where some niche sources of carbon still persist, and are accompanied by corresponding capture. Some niche sources are just unbelievably hard to decarbonise<p>If in 20 years 1% of our emissions remain but they are accompanied by capture (with a multiplier to account for inefficiencies in capture) then that would be ok by me.<p>(You&#x27;d still want the extra carbon removal to reverse the warming caused by past emissions ofc)')
