In Ireland for example you do not have to collect VAT if your revenue is below 72k.<p>Presumably you should be able to afford an accountant by the time you reach that figure.<p>It&#x27;s worth mentioning that you can&#x27;t deduct VAT on your purchases if you don&#x27;t collect VAT so if you have low margins that might be an issue.<p>Edit: The thresholds in Ireland are actually 75k for goods and 37.5k for services. The figure I remembered is out of date.')
