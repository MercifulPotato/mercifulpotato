They have spent 20 years experimenting with making bioweapons, yet spent no effort on vaccines. (SARS-1 was in 2002&#x2F;2003.) That should tell you something.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the CDC could have created a vaccine after 2003 with the technology available, but it is known they refused to provide grants for researchers interested in doing so. Shame on the CDC.')
