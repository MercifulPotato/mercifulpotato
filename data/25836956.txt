I&#x27;m not really seeing any benefits from any lockdowns so far (albeit we did do well in the summer). Most of the outdoor seating is just security theater. The outside areas are just cacooned indoor tents. There are indoor basketball games being run (here in NYC) and the rules are: &#x27;wear a mask while you walk around the gym but youre allowed to sweat all over each other without one.&#x27; It all seems like a complete joke at this point.<p>I&#x27;m one hundred and ten percent on board with wearing masks and being cautious about what to do, but it&#x27;s been a year of this already. It feels like renting a lakehouse for some much needed mental health recuperation is at the bottom of the barrel as far as risk factor goes. Considering California is seeing 30,000 a day Covid numbers, it feels like &quot;stay home&quot; when 50% of the country doesn&#x27;t give a shit anymore is like throwing a cup of water on a house fire at this point.<p>Curious to hear at what point does your mental well being become more of a concern? 1 year? 2 years? 5 years of lockdown? while you have people in Florida going to nightclubs then flying elsewhere? I&#x27;m starting to feel like one of those people tying themselves to a tree with a &quot;save the planet&quot; t-shirt while other people walk by and laugh and continue to ignore the damage and live their lives. I&#x27;m not trying to sound defeatist, but I am seriously at a loss here.')
