At home I only have one so this doesn&#x27;t matter. At work I need to choose between one of several printers in the building. In a school lab: students want to print and have whichever of the 3 identical printers right next to each other print it, depending on which printer isn&#x27;t busy with some other student&#x27;s work.')
