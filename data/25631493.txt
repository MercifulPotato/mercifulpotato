Item(by='rdgthree', descendants=None, kids=[25632655], score=None, time=1609769336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25631197, text='The title is <i>technically</i> accurate, but I think the omission of scale and any sense of how far along these plans are leaves quite a sensationalist tidbit. &quot;Google workers announce plans to unionize&quot; translated to &quot;the necessary amount of employees at Google to form a union are unionizing&quot; on my first pass. I clicked immediately because that seemed significant. I&#x27;m sure this was the intention, though I can only speculate. A clear and less sensationalist (though less click-worthy) title could have been as simple as: &quot;230 Google workers announce plans to unionize&quot;<p>That being said, I&#x27;m not contesting the validity of the movement - it&#x27;s certainly possible that thousands of Googlers will sign on in support now that the movement is public, and more power to them!<p>It just seems like the reporting on this should be making it more clear where this effort stands and just how much needs to happen before it&#x27;s legally viable. Arguably, more honest reporting in that regard would help make clear to potential allies that their support is needed, and this is not a sure thing.')
