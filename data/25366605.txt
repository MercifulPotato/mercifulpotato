Specifically, &quot;lying about sanctions&quot; wasn&#x27;t what he was charged with. He was charged with lying about asking Kisylak to refrain from escalating the situation, and a large part of his call was about sanctions and the Russian response to them.<p>Here&#x27;s the Statement of Offense[1], and the direct quote is:<p><i>FLYNN falsely stated he did not ask Russia&#x27;s ambassador to the United States to refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions the United States has imposed on Russia.</i><p>In the transcripts of the call[2] he says:<p><i>But I ask Russia to do is to not, if anything, I know you have to have some sort of action, to only make it reciprocal; don&#x27;t go any further than you have to because I don&#x27;t want us to get into something that have to escalate to tit-for-tat. Do you follow me?</i><p>and later:<p><i>I know, I -believe me, I do appreciate it, I very much appreciate it. But I really don&#x27;t want us to get into a situation where we&#x27;re going, you know~ where we do this and then you do something bigger, and then you know, everybody&#x27;s got to go back and forth and everybody&#x27;s got to be the tough guy here, you know?</i><p>and<p><i>And please make sure that its uh -  the idea is, be -if you~ if you have to do something, do something on a reciprocal basis, meaning you know, on a  sort of an even basis. Then that, then that is  a good message and we&#x27;ll understand that message. And, and then, we know that we&#x27;re not going to escalate this thing, where we~ where because if we put out-ifwe send out 30 guys and you send out 60, you know, or you shut down every Embassy, r mean we have to get this to a -lefs, let&#x27;s keep this at a  level that uh is, is  even-keeled, okay?</i><p>So it&#x27;s pretty clear his original statement of offense is correct - he did talk Kisylak and ask him not to escalate, and then lied to the FBI about it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;4320055&#x2F;Flynn-Statement-of-Offense.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;4320055&#x2F;Flynn-Sta...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net&#x2F;static&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;FlynnTranscripts.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net&#x2F;static&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;FlynnTr...</a>')
