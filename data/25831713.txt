Fully charging it in 5 minutes, as the article claims, would thus require a 400kW charger, assuming an unrealistic constant charging condition. With a nominal battery voltage of 360V that would be 1.1kA, which seems quite a challenge.<p>And that&#x27;s a fairly tiny battery as far as electric cars go. A Tesla 3 with the new 82kWh battery pack would require over 1MW.<p>On a related note there was an article[1] in the news here just yesterday about how building the charging infrastructure is challenged by the fact that the cost of expanding local transformer stations has to be shared by those wanting the extra power, like say a gas station wanting to add EV charging stations. This cost can be quite high due to the power requirements.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nrk.no&#x2F;norge&#x2F;ma-ut-med-mer-enn-25-millioner-for-a-gi-elbiler-lademulighet-1.15329438" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nrk.no&#x2F;norge&#x2F;ma-ut-med-mer-enn-25-millioner-for-...</a>')
