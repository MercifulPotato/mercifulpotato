You can accomplish quite a lot through focused effort. You shouldn&#x27;t need fifty ICs to develop a profitable product.<p>Paying professionals doesn&#x27;t have to come from absurdly oversized VC rounds. Sometimes it comes from steady, profitable, sustainable growth.<p>&gt; *Note, I am perfectly on board with paying competitive salaries, my point is that given the heavy market distortion because of all the VC money, that &quot;competitive salary&quot; isn&#x27;t actually an accurate descriptor.<p>You&#x27;re right. It isn&#x27;t. We should ignore the VC funded companies, and talk instead about the big players: FAANGs. That is the new definition of a competitive salary. I suspect you&#x27;ll find it dwarfs that of many VC-fuelled startups.')
