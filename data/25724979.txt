Or just their users?<p>In either case, is Amazon acting on legitimate orders from law enforcement, or are they taking the law into their own hands?<p>Other than your comment, I&#x27;ve yet to hear anyone imply this is a legal, rather than a moral, matter.<p>Edit: I see this is the Stripe thread, not the AWS&#x2F;Parler thread. I agree Trump has broken the law, though it is true that even criminals have regular bank accounts that don&#x27;t get cancelled as soon as they&#x27;re accused. Same thing applies, Stripe was not acting on a law enforcement request. It&#x27;s vigilante justice, even if it&#x27;s on the right side of history. I don&#x27;t like the precedent.')
