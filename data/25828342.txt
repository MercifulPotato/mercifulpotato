I am pointing out that lies have forever gained traction in the marketplace of ideas, while also being co-signed by authoritative news sources and politicians.<p>&gt; If the truth (or interpretations approaching the truth) is a needle in a haystack, it&#x27;s unlikely that many people will actually ever find it. That&#x27;s a problem.<p>I agree, but I don&#x27;t believe that restricting speech or massively censoring information is the correct solution. Or a solution at all.')
