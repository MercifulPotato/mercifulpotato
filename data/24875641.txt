Not that I think my ideas are all prophetic, or ignored&#x2F;misunderstood, but that in the past some of my ideas have been prophetic but ignored, until some point in time where they were validated to be true. With that being a possibility, I struggle to know whether or not an idea that I feel strongly about, but is misunderstood or discounted, whether or not it should be discounted or discarded. It&#x27;s hard to know what the right thing to do is when you are pretty confident that you&#x27;re right, but you know you could just simply be wrong.<p>It&#x27;s mostly about trying to figure myself out that I&#x27;m bewildered, not issues that apply to society at large. But even in that limited domain, I&#x27;m still gripped by analysis paralysis for that reason.')
