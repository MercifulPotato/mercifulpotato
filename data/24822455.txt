Is the argument that Nordic people are more naturally resistant to this disease and therefore Sweden could have lost fewer people? Or is it merely that Norway and Finland were able to prevent the outbreaks among their most vulnerable since they had the benefit of the virus arriving later and so they could better prepare?<p>The most recent stat I read showed that Sweden currently has less than a dozen people in the hospital with Covid conditions. We&#x27;re 8-9 months in to this and so far the Swedes are not dropping like flies. They had an early spike in deaths and it since fizzled out.')
