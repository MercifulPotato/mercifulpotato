That said, you can get cheap, high-quality grinders that are good for pour-over coffee relatively inexpensively (Hario makes pretty good hand-crank burr grinders in the  $35-$40USD range; I bought mine in 2012 and it&#x27;s still going strong with occasional cleaning) if you want to go down that road but not sink a bunch of money into it.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting an electric blade grinder, though.  It&#x27;s too difficult to keep things consistent.')
