In the early 2000s when I was a teenager I earned money from a paper round and would regularly buy a PC magazine (Computer Shopper) and the Playstation 2 magazine. I would read them cover to cover.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are good articles online, but it seems very hard for me to justify spending the time reading them when there is so much else. There is too much choice.<p>I remember a teacher at school telling me how once he bought all his favourite films on DVD he never watched them again. Once it becomes a conscious choice to spend your time on this rather than that it often ends up spent on nothing at all.<p>I&#x27;ve come to realise that choice (or freedom) is just not the greatest thing for humans. I firmly believe most people benefit from some kind of external structure and constraint. I think declining happiness, especially for women, is mostly due to this structure being removed. I also notice that the best art tends to be made under tight budgets and strict constraints. Artists tend to produce worse work when they are given freedom to do whatever they want.')
