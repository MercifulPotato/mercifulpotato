This didn&#x27;t play at all into our decision on how many kids to have. Though, they were spaced out far enough that the older ones were aging out of car seats before the younger ones needed them. I don&#x27;t think we ever had more than 2 kids in a carseat and 1 kid in a booster seat. We are down to 1 kid in a booster seat and the three oldest driving cars on their own now.')
