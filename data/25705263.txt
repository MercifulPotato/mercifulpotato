Regardless of the merits, each side believes they know the truth, and that the other side is delusional.<p>You&#x27;re partially right. We have at least two sides. One side is CLEARLY delusional. Fueled by conspiracy theories and lies. We also have other sides, but the two sides that get the most attention are the only sides that matter.
