No backups, no sympathy, simple as that.<p>This is a really garbage opinion. Long tail reliability situations like this is a major blocking point to large scale adoption of many things. No one wants to use something where the consequence of making a mistake is &quot;well I guess you&#x27;re f*cked now&quot;. You&#x27;re ignoring the entire usability side of computing and innovation.<p>&gt; 2FA is worthless if you start to put holes in it like that.<p>No, it is not. 2FA can still prevent 99% of takeover attempts. There are other ways to verify identity (especially within a social network, where real life people know other real life people), but these companies simply do not want to put the effort it. And I can&#x27;t really blame them: it would be a large investment to verify the identity of a given, every day person. This could be something that can be paid for in order to regain access in order to cover the elevated review necessary.<p>Trust me, if Nat Friedman somehow loses his email and 2fac at the same time, I can bet you that they would someone find a way to verify his identity and let him back in to his Github account (or honestly any other account).<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;trade-off&quot; when it comes to cyber security<p>This is false. Almost every part of cyber-security is a trade-off between security and usability. If you want the most secure system, just turn everything off. Totally secure. But also totally un-useable.<p>&gt; If you can&#x27;t spare a few hundred bucks on a NAS that you can just put in a storage unit or bank vault if need be, you data can&#x27;t be that valuable anyway.<p>Not everyone has the privilege to spend a &quot;few hundred bucks on a NAS&quot; and pay for it to be securely stored somewhere.')
