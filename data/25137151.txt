They&#x27;re like part of the Family. Their failures are overlooked and even rewarded. The MAX could crash again and the circus will continue, they will pretend to fix it and move on. Their Starliner Space Craft was a failure and they were given more Government funds and time. People should have went to jail, massive fines or Boeing should have been forced to scrap the entire fleet of 737 MAX and never allowed to create an abomination like that again.<p>This Companies products are designed by clowns, who are in turn supervised by monkeys.')
