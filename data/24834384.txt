Hunter S. Thompson wasn&#x27;t objective, but he was more insightful and sharper and commited to truth than most writers of the time. MLK didn&#x27;t pull up an excel sheet when he advocated for a cause. Argumentation isn&#x27;t just about facts, it&#x27;s about expressing a state of mind and communicating authentically what one thinks, and if someone&#x27;s angry then they ought to communicate it and I ought to be able to take it, they don&#x27;t need to pretend to be Spok or something, I don&#x27;t see the value in that.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure there&#x27;s an objective definition of what a &#x27;constructive argument&#x27; is. You can have an argument to settle a conflict, understand someone better, find an answer to some question, express emotions, demand justice or a hundred other things, a lot of which don&#x27;t require anything on that list.')
