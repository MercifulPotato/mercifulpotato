This must be taken with a boatload of salt.<p>India&#x27;s labor law is cryptic, deeply socialistic and favors unions over actual businesses in weird ways. Also, it is mostly unenforceable with lot of discretion to government officials in this particular case &quot;Department of Factories, Boilers, Industrial Safety and Health&quot;. Trust their inspectors to be clueless and they add zero value. They mostly show up to collect their bribes and you are free to do whatever it wants. These things change when employees unionize under the leadership of local goons and corrupt politicians and start acting as rent seekers rather than workers.<p>Winstorm is not an angel and high chance they must have engaged in lot of labor law violation, but it is plain idiotic to think that they would do something too worse than other factories in India. If at all my money is on the fact that Winstorm factory is actually better one available to these workers and these workers should be thankful for having some job in first place.<p>Looking at the sad salary numbers Winstorm does not save any money by underpaying employees or asking them to work more hours. It is a new factory and perhaps still in the process of getting everything in order. What Indian labor did there is nothing short of ungrateful behavior that has increased the risk for all other companies to come and start factories in India. Today it is winstorm tomorrow it could be your factory.<p>Indian government&#x27;s track record on worksplace practices and safety is pretty poor. Indian government&#x27;s policies caused one of the worst industrial disasters of all times (Bhopal Gas tragedy). Government then shamelessly blamed it on American company Union Carbide and then passed laws to ensure no victim can get compensation from Union Carbide directly. Indian government then pocked something like $100M by today&#x27;s value a lot of victims did not get a single penny.')
