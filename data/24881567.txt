Loud bangs, scaring kids and pets and damaging public goods. A few years ago I whipped up a proof-of-concept mobile app that detects a sudden increase in audio levels (BANG!), syncs time over NTP and sends a message to a central server with location and timestamp. The server correlates incoming messages and does basic multilateration&#x2F;TDOA to determine the location of the fireworks.<p>I&#x27;d like to deploy this on a larger scale, offering the app to others as well, as this gets only effective with a larger number of observers. However, I have  concerns over disclosing the location of participant - the usual privacy reasons apply here, but also the fact that pro-fireworks-punks tend to threaten the anti-fireworks people and terrorize their neighborhoods with even more fireworks.<p>I found one paper describing a mechanism and protocol similar to this (&quot;PrOLoc: Resilient Localization with Private Observers Using Partial Homomorphic Encryption&quot;), but this feels pretty heavy and over my head. Also this assumes the observers know the absolute distance to the target location, instead of having a relative time from a common clock, so I am not even sure if this algorithm applies to my problem.<p>Any insights, theory or papers on this subject much appreciated!')
