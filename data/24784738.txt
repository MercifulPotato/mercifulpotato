Folks that were here when GDPR got off the ground likely remember quite a bit of the discussion was left untouched and i think we collectively did ok.<p>However it doesn’t seem that humans have figured out how to effectively navigate our differences in the more ideological aspects of governance on a forum like this.  Just think of how many times in a personal conversation you are happy to respond with nothing more than a ‘yes, but why?’ vs the same topic being discussed on HN or reddit?  Or how much more information is exchanged in the ambience of that moment vs words on a page (and it’s still difficult).  Online it’s nearly impossible and what you’re left with are echo chambers and vollies of insults.<p>For my part I appreciate the wet blanket thrown on those types of conversations on HN.  I just haven’t seen them yield fruit elsewhere and i appreciate the harbor.')
