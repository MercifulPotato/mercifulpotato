Simply, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I funded Wikimedia Antarctica.&quot; and proceed to describe what you learned: &quot;I neglected to look at relevant data before doing so. I see how that affected my thinking and I&#x27;m committed to doing that in future deals.&quot;<p>I can&#x27;t stress how much more impactful my apologies have become with people simply by leaving out that &quot;but&quot;.  Even my relationship with my wife has improved because of it and I&#x27;ve noticed she&#x27;s started to leave off the &quot;but&#x27;s&quot; as well, which really makes me appreciate her apologies a whole lot more.')
