But they did measure electron hydrogen in a different way, and got a similar result to the radius with muonic hydrogen.<p>That makes the other measurement the odd man out. There could still be something unexpected going on with the proton radius in the presence of muons vs electrons, but it&#x27;s more likely that the larger measurement is simply incorrect for some unknown reason. That discrepancy could still reveal new physics, but it&#x27;s more likely an unrealized problem with the apparatus.')
