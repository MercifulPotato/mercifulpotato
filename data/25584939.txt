I have purchase way too many products from Amazon that broke immediately, just shockingly terrible quality. And the worst part is Amazon isn&#x27;t cheap anymore, I have found that they have a 20-30% markup over their competitors and the cheap things just third party fake goods.<p>IMO buying the cheapest products on Amazon is like using disposable plates and utensils, sure the one time purchase is cheaper than buying dishes and real utensils, but over time it&#x27;s way more expensive.<p>Honestly, opening a package from Amazon for a 5 star recommended item that you had high hopes for only to find a cheap piece of garbage is infuriating.')
