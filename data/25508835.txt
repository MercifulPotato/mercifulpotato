It is best to have them fully separated so they can&#x27;t communicate. They should communicate exclusively via the user.<p>Passwords are about proving identity.  Using high entropy passwords for greater confidence of user identity is only part of the equation, the user needs to be able to identify the validity of the service as well.<p>The greatest benefit of an autofill enabled password manager is it handles the task of URL validation before offering up credentials.  When you split up that function, now it&#x27;s back to relying on humans to get everything right on verifying credentials get submitted only to the intended service.')
