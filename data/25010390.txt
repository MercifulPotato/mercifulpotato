Sure, at the margins people can choose to spend the money they have on different things, but you&#x27;re positing an equivalence here between things that aren&#x27;t remotely equal.  It&#x27;s not like suburban professionals simply choose to spend their money on expensive housing and infrastructure where their inner city compatriots have different priorities.  Poor neighborhoods are poor because the people there HAVE LESS MONEY.<p>You fix that by fixing the inequity, not imagining a fantasy resident who decides to put all her money into bitcoin or whatever.')
