With Netflix&#x2F;whatever, you have zero agency if something you want isn&#x27;t there, other than signing up for some other streaming service.<p>Even if it&#x27;s hard to find something on public trackers with the right dubs&#x2F;subtitles, it&#x27;s rarely impossible for popular content. And if the subtitles are bad, you can, for example,  download a different lower quality rip and pull the subtitles off that. The point is, in this system the user has control over the data they are consuming. This is infinitely preferable to some people than the chains of DRM.')
