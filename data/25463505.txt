Working a job is better than robbing a bank. You know this intuitively based on years of internal reasoning, now think of why? Try to make that logic explicit.<p>It&#x27;s better because robbing a bank means I have to expend more energy covering my tracks&#x2F;on the run&#x2F;etc. This strategy doesn&#x27;t scale because if everyone is robbing banks then the incentive to collaborate on solving the world&#x27;s problems is compromised. And if the world&#x27;s problems aren&#x27;t solved then everyone is worse off.<p>&gt;The most extreme form of it is that can choose to end our life (i.e. commit suicide), and no animal can do that.<p>Some mammals, e.g. whales, beach themselves.<p>&gt;So then, what are human things? Why is &quot;taking care of ourselves and our loved ones, helping others in need, better ourselves&quot; good choices?...Try to make that logic explicit.<p>Consider the counterfactual: What does a world where I don&#x27;t take care of myself and my loved ones, trying to help others, etc, look like? Scale this behavior to the entire population. I don&#x27;t think it requires a lot of imagination to imagine what an objectively worse world that would be.')
