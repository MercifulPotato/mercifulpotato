Of course you can’t achieve cohesion across such a massive country. It’s much easier for smaller states.<p>That’s also why it bothers me when people point to tiny European countries like Scandinavia as examples of how the entire US should be. Nothing scales that easy.<p>There needs to be some clearly defined things that are federal (natsec that is entirely external, currency, healthcare insurance gov monopoly, trade pacts along logical trade routes - something India is dying for where apparently Trucks transporting goods need to stop at each local powerblock with paperwork&#x2F;taxes and it’s slows everything to a grind, etc).<p>You can see the downsides of centralization in things like the drug war clashing with states who want to legalize or decriminalize. Clearly this should be up to the states. And many more things too.<p>Instead there are countless US federal agencies doing who knows what. I’ve heard some huge numbers.<p>And the push politically always seems to\nmore and more power not only federally but more dangerously in the executive branch (which we saw a massive rise in during the post 9&#x2F;11 Bush years and continued in Obama’s term).<p>We need a rebirth of federalism globally and a push back against everything going federal and centralized. Especially with populations continually growing.')
