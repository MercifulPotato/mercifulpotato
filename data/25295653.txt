Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607032256, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25291580, text='&gt;&gt; Groove wasn&#x27;t exactly a chat app either<p>&gt; Neither are Duo and Meet, which were in the list of supposed Google chat apps.<p>Duo and Meet were video chat apps, which seems to be a part of &quot;chat apps&quot;. You did include video chat apps&#x2F;meeting&#x2F;conference apps in the Microsoft list.<p>Groove is more like P2P Google Docs is maybe the closest Google analog. You wouldn&#x27;t include Google Docs as a chat app would you? (Although I do know some folks that use it as such.)<p>&gt;&gt;  Kaizala is in the process of merging into Teams, and the Lync line (last Skype for Business) is considered to have already merged&#x2F;migrated<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t understand. The entire thing we&#x27;re supposed to be mocking Google for here is that they launch chat apps, and then force users to migrate away. Now you&#x27;re saying that all these Microsoft ones don&#x27;t count, because they&#x27;ve either already killed them and forced a migration, or are already in the process of doing so.<p>I wasn&#x27;t saying that they don&#x27;t count, I was simply furthering the conversation on exactly that sort of semantic question, and relatedly also this one:<p>&gt; Hangouts was the chat part of G+, so I think it&#x27;d be double counting to include G+.<p>While the clients are nothing alike and there&#x27;s a backcompat break in the servers, Lync&#x2F;S4B provided the foundations for the tech that became Teams&#x27; voice and video chat. Does that make Lync the &quot;chat part&quot; of Teams? (Hangouts was also a briefly separate &quot;product&quot; before G+ and then again briefly after.)<p>Kaizala I don&#x27;t know anything about directly, but what I was reading suggested that it has a ton of features, especially for bandwidth limited networks, that have never been a part of Teams before whenever the merger is supposed to happen and those features are added to Teams. When those features merge, does that make Kaizala a part of Teams? Supposedly (according to sources cited by Wikipedia) Microsoft has even been considering a &quot;powered by Kaizala&quot; sub-branding on those features, for the target users. If there is a &quot;Kaizala part&quot; of Teams, is that double counting?<p>&gt;  And second, nobody forced Microsoft to buy Skype when they already had a popular app doing just the same thing, which they then killed to make room for Skype.<p>Windows Live Messenger and Skype lived side-by-side for several years and Microsoft at the time was criticized by confusingly marketing both and keeping both alive. From what I saw as an outside observer, WLM died by its own hand and a death of a thousand papercuts. Skype, too, seems to be on the long path of killing itself with self-inflicted papercuts. I do admit both of those sad tales seem politically similar to what we observe of Google&#x27;s chat efforts. That&#x27;s two products I definitely feel are comparable to all that.')
