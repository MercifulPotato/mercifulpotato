What I would really like would be a cellular modem so I don&#x27;t have to bother with hotspots on the train and maybe a stylus for marking up screenshots.<p>For my use cases, Apple expects me to carry a Macbook, an iPad, a stylus, and a pouch filled with dongles. I&#x27;m envious of the Windows folks, they get to have a single device that does it all.')
