But they do it naturally, without enforcement - so like, a function might take a &#x27;str&#x27;, but the &#x27;str&#x27; passed in was parsed into a wrapping structure already.<p>ie: Most programs in typed languages already do what you&#x27;re saying - they parse the data directly into a structure, and therefor they validate some aspects of it naturally, so even when you do see a &#x27;str&#x27; in typed code it&#x27;s very often already gone through some sort of parsing phase.')
