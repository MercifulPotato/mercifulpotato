There&#x27;s not big issues with administration here, there&#x27;s just not vaccines available.<p>I&#x27;m not sure who makes the allocation decision, but the slowest part of the administration here is the Federal partnership with CSV&#x2F;Walgreens for long term care facilities (the state has allocated 430,000 doses, the programs have administered 100,000). Outside of the LTCF program, ~90% of doses have been administered.<p>There was a 2 week period where some Walmart decided they needed to close an aisle, no one got fined, no one went to jail, blah blah blah. (Garden stores were ordered closed for a time, but that&#x27;s not outlawing the sale of seeds).')
