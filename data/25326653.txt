The high DPI resolution of the laptop screen made everything look really small and everything I tried to do to scale up the size of things just didn&#x27;t work well. Things didn&#x27;t scale evenly, sometimes the text would be bigger but not the ui controls. On MacOS I&#x27;ve found the display scaling to just work as expected')
