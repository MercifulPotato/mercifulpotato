That&#x27;s when it starts to make sense to work on paying attention to the big picture while you&#x27;re in the weeds.  But if you&#x27;re topping out at 500-1000 lines, that&#x27;s where your problems likely are.<p>(It probably isn&#x27;t helping you that you&#x27;re used to using tools that let you not think about the minutia up front and then help you to fix them after the fact.)')
