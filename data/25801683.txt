It’s Microsoft specific, but the overall concept is nice and could be implemented more broadly. The operations are described as a pipeline, which to me is much more readable (and writable!) than SQL, where it feels like I’m always bouncing my mental cursor around to figure out what a query is doing. I’m sure that’d reduce with more SQL exposure, but understanding Kusto came pretty much instantly for me.<p>Also, each operation being its own line in the pipeline makes modification an absolute breeze, simply comment out, reorder, etc lines and the result will usually also be a valid query.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;azure&#x2F;data-explorer&#x2F;kusto&#x2F;query&#x2F;tutorial?pivots=azuredataexplorer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;azure&#x2F;data-explorer&#x2F;kusto&#x2F;q...</a>')
