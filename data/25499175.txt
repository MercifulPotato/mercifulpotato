I don&#x27;t know what to believe myself.  I live and work in Silicon Valley.  I have Russian heritage of which I am proud, and the ongoing smear campaign is disheartening, even if not entirely unsubstantiated.  I am not on payroll of any secret service.<p>But here I am asked to believe a story in which there is an evil dictator that has a chokehold on an entire country, yet is somehow unable to get rid of a blogger&#x2F;YouTuber.  The blogger in question is acting completely independently and is not propped up by any government force.  It is though his pure bravery and resourcefulness that he is able to evade the evil dictator&#x27;s ploys.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think that there are parallels in this story to... Star Wars.  There we also have an invincible freedom fighter improbably taking on a fearsome adversary.  Except even in Star Wars we learn that all is not what it seems: the reason the dark lord  could not kill the freedom fighter was because he didn&#x27;t actually want to (him being his son and all, sorry for any spoilers if you still have not seen Star Wars).<p>And here I am asked to believe a story less plausible than the plot of Star Wars.  I find this insults my intelligence.')
