One the sent me for free after warranty though.<p>- blew a speaker in week 2<p>- bluetooth and wifi didn&#x27;t work together (I now swapped the chip)<p>- fan blades are very brittle (broke one accidentally when de-dusting and then took out an opposite one so it&#x27;s correctly weighted)<p>- these case screws... Super short and mounted at an angle. Easy to screw in in the wrong angle and without lock tight you might loose the before you notice one is coming out.<p>- gforce card played dead for a few weeks.<p>- do not use USB-C for power in. Even with a dell branded dock I get system freezes. It&#x27;s only fine to charge over night or while watching a bit of youtube.<p>Other than that that it&#x27;s my daily driver since a few years though and quite alright...<p>Had another 13&quot; xps at work and the matte version had auto backlight dimming when the screen showed dark content. Super frustrating for dark themes. Had to patch in a leaked fix to remove it (risking a brick) because support wouldn&#x27;t hand out one.')
