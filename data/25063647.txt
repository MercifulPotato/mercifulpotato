And frankly, I don&#x27;t get the comparison you are making to C++&#x2F;Java&#x2F;C#. TS is fundamentally different than those languages. From structural typing to a default functional&#x2F;imperative paradigm, it really is just JS with better static analysis.<p>Your IDE is <i>not</i> as good for JS as it would be for TS. The entire impetus for TS is&#x2F;was to provide better tooling&#x2F;ergonomics around JS. Whether or not you <i>need</i> better tooling is a subjective matter.')
