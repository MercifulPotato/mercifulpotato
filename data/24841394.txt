Sorry I can&#x27;t be more specific.<p>Luckily, it&#x27;s not actually quite that bad yet, but I&#x27;ve built PWAs and some of the bugs are truly awful.<p>I think it was iOS 11 where the camera didn&#x27;t even work in PWAs for months- we had to get people to use the website through the actual Safari browser on their phone. It wasn&#x27;t actually fixed until 11.3. It was brutal.')
