There are huge frictions and broken interfaces between roles: developers, engineers, data scientists, domain experts with everyone expecting the other to &quot;just&quot; do X.<p>The only friction I see with data analysis roles is that data analysts typically don&#x27;t need (or even outright refuse) to do collaborative work where there are multiple people working on the same code and data.<p>Once we take the collaborative aspect out, and we see data analysts who never had to check out someone else&#x27;s work to apply minor changes or have someone else apply minor changes to their own code, then we get to the same naive criticism directed at basic organizational practices and tools as we see here.')
