Legacy car makers are Goliaths set in the past. They&#x27;re stuck to the annual release cycle and can&#x27;t even over the air updates and a touch screen on par with an iPad from 8 years ago.<p>Legacy automakers have failed to deliver on electric cars for decades. Musk talked about this. There was nothing special about the time he entered the market with Tesla. Any one of the auto makers could (and still theoretically can) develop an appealing electric car. They&#x27;re simpler, cleaner and more efficient. But not a single one has been able to deliver a reasonable product. They&#x27;re subsidizing the price of electric and losing 7-10k per [0] and still cannot produce a compelling product.<p>The legacy car companies are basically blackberry, as someone has finally shown there exists a way to create and produce a compelling car outside of the legacy participants.<p>Tesla actually has a path forward on self driving. They have the infrastructure, real driver data, and millions of cars on the road that can accept over the air updates. Waymo has a few Taxis in a few cities.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insideevs.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;336213&#x2F;moodys-says-automakers-lose-7000-to-10000-per-electric-car-sold&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insideevs.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;336213&#x2F;moodys-says-automakers-los...</a>')
