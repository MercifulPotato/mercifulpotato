However, as you said I can still alter what I wish, whereas a lot of theories I’ve heard about Apple here recently involve turning the Mac platform into some sort of crippled sandbox in the spirit of mobile devices, or worse like some consoles that are so locked down the hackers haven’t beat it yet.<p>I do believe Microsoft would love to head down a path like that, but are too burned with the massive frankenstein of legacy tech that is Windows. I also tend to share a bleak view of the future of computing as many of the people voicing concerns, I just don’t believe that a niche set of consumers can overpower that of the majority who could care less if you ranted to them about control or privacy or whatever.')
