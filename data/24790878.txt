Or Target. Or Walmart. Or Alibaba.<p>If I use an iPhone I am limited to what Apple allows on their shelves, full stop. If Best Buy dictated everything you were allowed to buy, that would seem rather problematic, right? I can&#x27;t see any way that a corporate executive would justify not only not placing a certain brand on their shelves, but also physically blocking their customers from walking into any other store. Imagine the PR field day if an Apple store manager paid his or her employees to stand in front of the Microsoft store and physically assault any of their customers if they tried to walk inside!<p>And yet that&#x27;s exactly what they&#x27;re doing virtually. We can&#x27;t use a Microsoft app store, or an Amazon app store, or Google Play. We are beholden to the manager&#x27;s personal preferences of what we can and can&#x27;t buy.')
