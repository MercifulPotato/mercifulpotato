Otherwise, society has not shown that the behaviour was unacceptable and the perpetrators are not seeing any consequences for their actions. To give an example, hardly anyone would be able to forgive someone that has e.g. stolen your car, and continues to drive by your house with it and showing no remorse for taking it.<p>It&#x27;s also ironic that the demands for unity and forgiveness are now coming from a side who has made law&amp;order a central part of their platform, in a country with one of the most broken judicial systems and one of the highest incarceration rates in the world.')
