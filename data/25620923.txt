Sounds like you can configure it so the client machine can&#x27;t destroy all the backups? That&#x27;s a feature I&#x27;ve wanted in backup software for a long time but haven&#x27;t actually seen.<p>Tarsnap offers this feature. Pretty nifty, but the price is that you canâ€™t have the client handle backup rotation (keep hourly backups for a day, daily for a week etc), the pruning must be set up via a different machine.')
