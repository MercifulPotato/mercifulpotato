But in practice, there is a very high chance you are in the wrong.<p>Logical fallacies are binary, but the world is more stochastic, so I may be wrong, but I think these logical fallacies do not actually apply to reasoning about the real world. They only work when applied to thought experiments.<p>But I am no philosopher so I do not know for sure.')
