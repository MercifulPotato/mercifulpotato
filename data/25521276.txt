I then started writing a web app using Tide (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;http-rs&#x2F;tide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;http-rs&#x2F;tide</a>). I eventually realized that it would be difficult to use the library I had built earlier since Tide uses the async-std runtime rather than Tokio. That was very disappointing. Is there any plan to make it easier to write &quot;runtime agnostic&quot; libraries in the future?')
