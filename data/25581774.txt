Contacting companies and asking them if they would consider <i>compressing</i> their 5 day role into 4 longer days (e.g. 4 x 10 hours) - certainly not my ideal but a slight improvement<p>2. Flipping the problem on its head: A website which (anonymously) lists developers who are looking for 4 day &#x2F; week positions (e.g. A dev is searching for remote Java backend roles @ $50k for 30hrs per week)<p>3. Continuing on the path I&#x27;m already on but changing my pitch slightly<p>4. Giving up and trying something completely different<p>Thoughts?<p>If you prefer to contact privately, feel free to add me on Linkedin: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;phil-mcparlane-80606727&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;phil-mcparlane-80606727&#x2F;</a>')
