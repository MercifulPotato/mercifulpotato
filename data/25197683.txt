These networks are built upon the suffering of millions (which you can I suppose equate to rampant CO2 production, if you really wanted to) and should not be used at all. Any alternative is better than that.<p>Then of course there is the whole notion that using a lot of power is in and of itself a big evil, which is ridiculous. Even from an environmental perspective, big industries are by far the biggest offenders. By shifting the perspective of the discourse away from the real offenders towards other &quot;problems&quot;, we are doing a disservice to the actual issues.<p>At this point I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s a movement composed primarily of people who don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re talking about, sprinkled with a light dash of actual malicious actors. This makes sense, as that&#x27;s a realistic cross-section of the internet at large.')
