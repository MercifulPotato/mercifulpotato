Item(by='loceng', descendants=None, kids=[24948782], score=None, time=1604045200, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24937196, text='Then you create rules for interoperability for direct communications, you don&#x27;t force sovereign private individuals or companies (groups of individuals) for how to set their algorithms - but you can take down the walls from between direct messaging apps&#x2F;functionality.<p>Likewise if you did a UBI-like mechanism where everyone was allocated $100&#x2F;year for digital services like Twitter&#x2F;Facebook that would flood the market with revenue, non-manipulative ad based revenue too, and many more startups could survive and do R&amp;D, etc. to help break up the monopoly which primarily exists through economies of scale - if people have $100&#x2F;year though (or whatever amount is figured out to be minimum viable) then there&#x27;s excess&#x2F;buffer funds to cover higher bandwidth and computing costs of smaller competitors who can&#x27;t compete on scale metrics.<p>There are likely additional options than these above, options other than taking away the sovereignty of official individuals&#x2F;companies - which is a very dangerous path towards implementing mechanisms useful for tyranny - sovereignty being the diversification and de-risking counter mechanism to tyranny, allowing individuals to &quot;vote&quot; by which service(s) they decide to use.<p>The $100&#x2F;year for digital services is mimicking the Democracy Dollars $100&#x2F;year voucher policy idea of Andrew Yang, allowing all eligible voters to give $100&#x2F;year to their candidate of choice, which will washout for-profit industrial complex lobbyist money 8:1 with money from citizens who will have far more diverse needs than lobbyists.<p>E.g. imagine how much innovation would occur on federated platforms like Mastodon if people had $100&#x2F;year they could only allocate to such a service, and they didn&#x27;t want to find Twitter or Facebook.<p>Otherwise to parrot your comment, in conclusion, it&#x27;s even further &quot;not as simple as that&quot; - as in you need to design the system to counter tyranny as well, there needs to be balance maintained where freedom is what is outweighing control; and freedom will cost more than control - it&#x27;s quality over quantity (economies of scale), necessary cost is something we shouldn&#x27;t be hypersensitive to or hypervigilant for, however most of us are due to the now artificial scarcity mindset most of us have, where mechanisms like $1000&#x2F;month UBI will allow us as an organism to destress, Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy of Needs, and focus on&#x2F;care about the more holistic, less focused on self and survival of only self.')
