They deliberately violated Apple TOS knowing it would get the account banned, and then they try to leverage all those other developers who are going to lose iOS support against the big bad Apple who is taking away your livelihood, all so they can establish their own store and make a higher percentage of the revenue from the sales other people&#x27;s work (to be clear: they already make money from the sales of games based on Unreal, they just want to make more).<p>It&#x27;s not just Uber, it&#x27;s part of a broader trend tech companies adopting this tactic.  It&#x27;s seriously disgusting, this is the lowest thing to come out of the Silicon Valley techbros in a long time.')
