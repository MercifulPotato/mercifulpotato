One of the biggest problems we have is on-boarding new customers. The issue is the banks and service providers we work with require physically signed documents, or we have to use their online signature solution. Their solution is often a worse experience than signing with paper, scanning and emailing. The provided solutions also are about as secure as emailing without encryption, too. Interestingly enough, most of these solutions just overlay a png image of the signature (sometimes collected from the user, sometimes picked from a list) on a PDF and then sign the document with the provider&#x27;s cert. The final, signed document is delivered via email (hey, post to a webhook, it&#x27;s 2020?). It would be nice to be able to have our own, better experience that worked with our vendor.')
