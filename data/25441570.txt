The issue is that for the entire existence of Pornhub it has been breaking laws and acting <i>totally</i> unethically and this has been an enormously successful strategy. It is nuts that Visa and Mastercard are stepping in and preventing PH from doing illegal things- they shouldn&#x27;t have to, the CEO should be in jail for the way that company has behaved. Instead we&#x27;ve got this economic system where monetizing content theft, revenge porn and pedofilia has been hugely beneficial. No company has been able to exist in that industry and make a decent profit legally because of the existence of PH. That&#x27;s where we should be asking questions, not Visa getting cold feet about being complicit in those crimes.')
