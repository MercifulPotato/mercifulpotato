Item(by='neogodless', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607440976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345993, text='My main problems are:<p>* I don&#x27;t like when laptops get (too) hot on your lap<p>* Due to a medical condition 144Hz is now the minimum<p>* And my eyes definitely prefer larger screens<p>So I have an HP Omen 15 but I may return it. (I can play older games without getting too warm, but the screen is really good, but not excellent. The barrel port power on the side bothers me about 5 times a day.) And I have a Legion 5 17&quot; on order... which may never arrive. (In which case I hope I still have the Omen.) In either case, the battery life isn&#x27;t going to be great doing non-gaming things though.<p>But a friend has the G14 and loves it!')
