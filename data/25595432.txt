Right now, I work at a tech company and I can go to another tech company using the skills I picked up at my current employer if I wish. With noncompetes, I can&#x27;t do that at all. With no-poach agreements between companies, I won&#x27;t be recruited from one specific company to another specific company but if the other company puts up the help wanted sign, I could go over to the other company on my own accord. Even with no-poach agreements, I can freely move between companies.<p>Yes, no-poaching agreements are terrible but they are nothing like noncompete clauses.')
