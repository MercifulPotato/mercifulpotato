Item(by='edjroot', descendants=None, kids=[24734370], score=None, time=1602276390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24733506, text='&gt; nobody uses them because you&#x27;ll never be able to use anybody else&#x27;s keyboard<p>I doubt that&#x27;s the main reason, and it may be unwarranted as I say below. Personally, I thought it would take too long for me to be able to type as fast as in QWERTY. Fortunately, I was wrong about that too.<p>I learned the QGMLW optimized layout from Carpalx (linked above) about a year ago. I trained on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keybr.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keybr.com</a> and then on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;typeracer.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;typeracer.com</a> for a few days and in less than a week I reached 70wpm. I stopped training shortly after and now I can usually reach 90-100wpm. Not particularly fast, but I&#x27;m not any faster in QWERTY, and I believe I could get faster if I trained more.<p>Even though I almost never type in QWERTY anymore, when I do I&#x27;m still just as fast as I used to be. I never learned to type in QWERTY &quot;the right way&quot;, though, and I suppose this is actually what keeps me from confusing the two &quot;modes&quot;. Whenever I try to keep my fingers on their &quot;appropriate&quot; keys (like a properly trained typist would), it&#x27;s like my brain switches to &quot;Carpalx mode&quot; (since I did make an effort to use the right finger positioning to learn it). It&#x27;s kinda like switching between thinking in my native language and English - I can think in both, but it doesn&#x27;t &quot;feel&quot; the same, and I&#x27;m more likely to confuse the two where they overlap more. Pretty interesting, really.')
