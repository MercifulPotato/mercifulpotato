Note: cars have a longer shelf life. 20 years vs 6 years for phones. And typical turnaround is more like 10 years vs 3 years. Apple and Android dominated the phone industry in a decade. TSLA and “the second OS&#x2F;UX” will dominate that industry in 30 years.<p>Everyone now understands that Tesla will not just be another competitor in the automobile industry they have usurped the throne while everyone else was guarding the doors.<p>There needs to be “an Android” to counterbalance and unite the industry. Otherwise automakers that don’t partner with “the second OS&#x2F;UX” will dwindle and stop existing. Eg BBM, Nokia, Palm. Meanwhile, Samsung was an early adopter and is holding strong (counter example HTC, also an early adopter but dead).<p>Like HTC vs Samsung vs Motorola vs Pixel, there will still be competition for best manufacturing and performance. Automakers that adopt the unified OS&#x2F;UX, will need to make sure they don’t lose that game like HTC.<p>If the players in the auto industry don’t see this, they have already lost. Meanwhile, it might not be AAPL to make the unified OS&#x2F;UX. However, they were willing to do it with Apple Card and insurance. Partner with Goldman or (whatever my iPhone loan thing is) and provide an amazing UX. They also have tons of consumer trust and it helps get their foot into the auto market, getting the benefits (Siri, iOS apps, Maps, self driving) without taking on the risks.')
