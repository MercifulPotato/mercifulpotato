For example, here&#x27;s [1] a thread about the best VHS players to buy.<p>I&#x27;m interested that you&#x27;re trying to recover the audio only, and from an S-VHS tape. Both VHS and S-VHS could do Hi-Fi audio, and the former was cheaper, so are you sure it&#x27;s not just regular VHS tape you have? (Alternatively, some professional S-VHS decks recorded PCM audio, which you&#x27;ll need special hardware to play back).<p>In any case, as the thread on DigitalFAQ attests to, many of the best VHS machines for recovering tapes are S-VHS models, so if you don&#x27;t mind the higher prices, getting a good quality S-VHS deck is a good way to go if you plan on doing more recovery in the future.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalfaq.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;video-restore&#x2F;1567-vcr-buying-guide.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalfaq.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;video-restore&#x2F;1567-vcr-buyin...</a>')
