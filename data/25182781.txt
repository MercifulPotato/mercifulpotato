As part of that I hold a fair bit of Tether, USDC and other stable coins.<p>The reason being is that I want to keep my capital pegged to the dollar, but need something that&#x27;s native to the Ethereum blockchain. If there&#x27;s a trading opportunity, I need the ability to swap Tether for [X] token in a single blockchain transaction. There&#x27;s no time to route actual dollar deposits from a real bank.<p>Considering that there&#x27;s something like $13 billion locked in all the various defi protocols, that&#x27;s a lot of potential demand for stable coins.')
