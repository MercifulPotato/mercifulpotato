It involves a bit more ascetism and self-flagellation though.<p>I already live in a &quot;heavenly&quot; future compared to most of my ancestors.<p>I have hot and cold running water. My waste is whisked away. I can travel far and harness powerful energies with the flick of a switch. I can summon almost any food or item imaginable to my doorstep. I can open a portal to anywhere and speak with people there. There are still mysteries however, and the human body is rich with them.<p>There is a growing sense that using our powers comes at a terrible cost.<p>Many feel that the only solution is to abstain, although some factions believe that we can &quot;purify&quot; our technology.<p>Because the problem, filtered through the human psyche, is seen as a <i>moral</i> one. That it&#x27;s _wrong_ for so many things to be too easy. Ten dollars shoes, drive-thru fast food and plastic bags <i>must</i> be evil because anyone can see it&#x27;s absurd that these things are even possible.<p>Naturally, developing new powers (such as space exploration) would come with more terrible costs, and this must be stopped until we address our sins here on earth.')
