Game studios hire cinematographers etc. A revolution in AAA art workflow.<p>We&#x27;re definitely in the hybrid zone for this console generation, though PS5 lead Mark Cerny said he&#x27;d been surprised to see some full raytracing (surely tech demos). Maybe PC&#x27;s can do it, esp with 3090 and following years&#x27;, but AAA seems mostly console-first (though e.g. cyberpunk 2077 is PC-first). Cross-generation games still need the old workflow, so you don&#x27;t save until a whole studio can go fully next-gen exclusive... so, perhaps 2-3 years after PS6 gen launch in 7 years: 2030. Or the gen after that.<p>Couple of boundary counterpoints: most game engines aren&#x27;t written in assembly despite it being faster; most CGI movies are fully raytraced (though looking at Soul, they seemed to chose a less realistic Special World that was easier to render).')
