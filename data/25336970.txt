Item(by='nevermore', descendants=None, kids=[25337025], score=None, time=1607372824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25335904, text='In case you read the entire article before looking at the author, this is by mchurch so you should take everything it says with a huge crazy egotistical grain of salt. Personal vendettas and hyperbole abound.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true that all non-execute corporate jobs are meaningless, and I&#x27;ve worked at at least one company that mchurch has. Some jobs at some (many?) companies are actually slowly and methodically creating value for humanity at large, and many bosses I&#x27;ve had are not soulless whip-bearers but in fact also determined to make their lives mean something through their work.<p>That being said I think it does levy some specific good criticisms against PG and silicon valley. It&#x27;s definitely true that PG has a conflict of interest in his postings, and that the narratives about society that he pushes also happen to be ones that he benefits financially from. It&#x27;s very fair to compare his views to Ayn Rand&#x27;s. And it&#x27;s certainly true that tech and science reporting aren&#x27;t held to nearly the same ethical standards that other types of reporting are.<p>Some good points and food for thought, but don&#x27;t lose too much sleep over another mchurch rant.')
