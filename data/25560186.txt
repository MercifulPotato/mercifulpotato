Item(by='cletus', descendants=None, kids=[25562207], score=None, time=1609171134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25558874, text='One thing I&#x27;ll be interested to see if there are any heavy elements in the samples.<p>Why? Because anything from the Uranium decay chain effectively dates the creation of those elements.<p>I belong to the school of thought that believes that spacefaring life is relatively rare. By &quot;rare&quot; I mean we may well be the only one within the Milky Way (within our light cone). There are lots of reasons for this but a lot of people have put a lot of thought into this but it&#x27;s a whole separate topic.<p>Anyway, this then raises the issue of the Fermi Paradox. One angle might be the relative abundance of elements heavier than iron.<p>Elements up to iron are relatively common in the Universe because they&#x27;re created by nuclear fusion. More specifically, nuclear fusion of elements up to iron produces energy.<p>Heavier elements are produced by supernovae or the merger of neutron stars and&#x2F;or black holes (as we&#x27;ve detected by LIGO in recent years). It seems like a neutron star merger is almost required for the relative abundance of such elements we have on Earth. That might be one reason why spacefaring life is &quot;rare&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some discussion of this for Earth-bound materials suggesting they were created 80-200 million years (IIRC) before the Earth was.<p>So I&#x27;m curious how old samples like these. Are they from the same event or do they have a different origin? Examining such samples from other parts of the Solar System may tell us about the relative likelihood of such events on cosmic timelines.')
