Ban encryption to make my job easier! Give me a backdoor to everyone to make my job easier!<p>I am a developer too but I try not forgetting that I am also a user. As a user I don’t feel obligated to make developers job easier who screwed me many times before, I love dealing with Apple and I like keeping it that way.<p>If you think you can do it better, go do it on Android and if it happens to be good I may switch. There’s no monopoly.<p>I don’t know why developers think they have right to access me. Apple made the thing and I bought it from them knowing what I am getting into and I have no complaints. I am being taken care well and I will ditch Apple if this changes.')
