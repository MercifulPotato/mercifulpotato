I&#x27;ve recently decided to do some deliberate practicing around typing. I&#x27;ve been using keybr [1] which is a great site that randomly makes up phonetically accurate pseudo-words and has you type them. The goal there is to have you practice weak combinations of keys, and they have an excellent stats dashboard to show you your progress over time. I was able to raise my typing speed from ~90 wpm to ~110 wpm as measured on that site over about 40 days through 10 minutes of practice per day.<p>Based on my experience with that site, which I really love, I&#x27;d love to see some additional tracking of keys. The downside of your core idea is that you can&#x27;t really do the trick of forcing deliberate practice of weak key patterns to engrain them into you.<p>Some other suggestions for stats, based on what exists on keybr and what I&#x27;d like to see<p>- Time practiced today and stats for today<p>- Daily streaks to encourage practicing<p>- Cumulative time practiced<p>- A 7 day running average of your typing stats<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keybr.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keybr.com</a>')
