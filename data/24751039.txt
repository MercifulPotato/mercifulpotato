Item(by='rallison', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602471740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745483, text='This is an odd resource, at least with respect to IFR. I didn&#x27;t look to see if the CFR section was more reasonable. They don&#x27;t date the commentary in the IFR section, but it seems like it&#x27;s mostly March&#x2F;early April? If so, we obviously know a lot more since then.<p>&gt; We could make a simple estimation of the IFR as 0.35%, based on halving the lowest boundary of the CFR prediction interval in Europe.<p>I mean, sure, maybe an ok guess way at the beginning.<p>&gt; In Swine flu, the IFR ended up as 0.02%, fivefold less than the lowest estimate during the outbreak (the lowest estimate was 0.1% in the 1st ten weeks of the outbreak).<p>We simply weren&#x27;t doing the surveillance needed for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic during the pandemic to have reasonable estimates for quite a while. We are doing much more of that for Covid - we have serology studies, and we have fairly accurate death numbers (at least in some countries), the key pieces to put together more robust IFR estimates. We didn&#x27;t have those for H1N1. I also find it a little odd this page just generically references it as Swine flu, vs being specific about it being the 2009 iteration of it. I&#x27;d expect that from a news outlet, not an Oxford associated group.<p>&gt; In Iceland, where the most testing per capita has occurred, the IFR lies somewhere between 0.03% and 0.28%.<p>Iceland contained their outbreak (yay!), and had very few cases overall, and just 10 deaths. Their CFR is 0.28%. Given their massive amounts of testing, it&#x27;s hard to understand where the 0.03% comes from (and, obviously, is wildly low). But mostly, there were so few cases in Iceland that&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard to draw many fatality rate conclusions.<p>But mostly:<p>&gt; Antibody testing will provide an accurate understanding of how many people have been infected so far, and permit a more accurate estimate of the IFR.<p>&gt; *Estimating CFR and IFR in the early stage of outbreaks is subject to considerable uncertainties, the estimates are likely to change as more data emerges.<p>Seems to be consistent with this having been written up in March&#x2F;early April. Since they haven&#x27;t updated it, and the reasoning even at the time was fairly poor, this doesn&#x27;t seem a useful resource (at least for IFR).')
