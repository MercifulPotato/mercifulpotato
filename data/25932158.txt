I&#x27;m imagining `grep` written in modern a modern language like JS and I shutter when I think of the hundreds of micro-dependencies like &quot;left-pad&quot; that would need to be downloaded to make it work.<p>You don&#x27;t have to imagine: `ripgrep` exists and has all of 10 direct dependencies, 4 of which by the same author because they extracted features &#x2F; systems from ripgrep (or developed them separately from the start) as they were useful on their own e.g.<p>* regex, for obvious reasons<p>* ignore to match and apply ignorefiles (gitignore and friends which ripgrep takes in account by default)<p>* bstr for conventional utf8 strings rather than guaranteed<p>* grep intends to be essentially &quot;ripgrep as a library&quot;')
