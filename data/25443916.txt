On the one hand, he is the ideal tinkerer, going super deep into subjects like cooking and now photography of snowflakes.  He has tons of money, yet he makes it difficult for ordinary people to access his work.  The cooking books are thousands of dollars if I&#x27;m not mistaken.  The snowflakes, you can&#x27;t see in high res unless you pay for it.<p>The thing that&#x27;s confusing to me is that someone who is usually this passionate about something gets joy from sharing it with others freely.  This guy seems super greedy.')
