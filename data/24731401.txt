Teach people by negative reinforcement to not assume what they read is true unless they&#x27;ve vetted the source.<p>Or: Have a counter-disinformation group that responds to political disinformation by creating more disinformation that points in the opposite direction.<p>To some extent all of the above is done already, organically.  In fact, to the extent that Facebook et al. manage to hide the stupidest crap, that would tend to make people believe that what does stay up must be true (or, at least, must have passed Facebook&#x27;s fact-checkers).')
