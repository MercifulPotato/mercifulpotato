What I mean by that is one has strong vivid thought about some doom that will come or some horrible thing that happened in the past and they are strong emotions.  It&#x27;s easy to get caught up in them and lose the present moment.  When you lose the present moment your mind can not differentiate between now and a memory, so it thinks the memory is now and responds accordingly.<p>Memories and emotions are not &quot;real&quot; in that they are not the present moment, and being able to stay grounded in the present moment while having these thoughts can help.  In metaphor, it&#x27;s like pinching yourself while dreaming.<p>What imo helps the most is realizing everything is impermanent &#x2F; temporary.  If you have a particularly gruesome emotion you can know you don&#x27;t have to do anything, because it will go away on its own, like a rain cloud, in due time.  So you can relax even while freaking out.')
