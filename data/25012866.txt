The pitch “The problem with micromanagement is it doesn’t scale... until now”<p>Jokes aside micro-management has its roots in insecurity and lack of being able trust. Perhaps for a small number it’s also about a power trip but for most it’s simply a lack of understanding of how to delegate and a false belief that you’re the only person that “gets it”.<p>That said one of the greatest feelings a manager is seeing people step up, take things on and do it in a newer and better way. You have to allow them to make mistakes which they will at first.
