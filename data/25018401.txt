Polls communicate experts best guess at how the vote is going to turn out based on the data they have collected. It&#x27;s likely to be a <i>lot</i> more accurate than a non-experts guess, or even the guess of an expert without any data. It&#x27;s also not even possible to share the raw data because of privacy concerns.<p>The forecasts you see on sites like 538 and the economist are even better, because it doesn&#x27;t just communicate experts best guess (democrats win by +7), but experts best guess at how accurate that guess is too (something like democrats win by +7 +- 6, except in a lot more detail and nuance).<p>On HN the catchphrase for this is basically &quot;don&#x27;t let perfect be the enemy of good&quot;.<p>Note: I made up the numbers in this post.')
