I found one article that is particularly negative, but not necessarily objective [1].<p>The closest gas station to me, on foot, has converted its mechanics bays to a great taco shop, its &quot;office&quot; to a liquor store with a great selection of spirits, and it has a full-size car wash operation wrapped around it.<p>So it seems like the most likely conversion would be that the gas station would swap gas pumps for chargers, in phases. Of course the best layout for chargers where charging takes the time it currently does is not the same as the best layout for fuel pumps, so it will be interesting to see how the transition goes.<p>So at present all the gas stations that I know of that seem viable are embedded in businesses that take up even more space, and the retail fuel business is just a part of it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.franchise.city&#x2F;buy-a-gas-station" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.franchise.city&#x2F;buy-a-gas-station</a>')
