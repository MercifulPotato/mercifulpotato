This is why we have a wide variety of opportunities for public participation and observation.<p>Filing dozens outlandish lawsuits is certainly a way to demonstrate fealty to the administration, but as we&#x27;re seeing, it&#x27;s not particularly productive.<p>Funding propaganda efforts to exploit people&#x27;s ignorance in pursuit of undermining public confidence in the electoral process is shitty behavior at best and sedition at worst.<p>Conflating all of these and describing them all as &#x27;questioning the outcome&#x27; is unlikely to change anyone&#x27;s mind about any of it, but it does serve to highlight a profound lack of understanding about how elections work.<p>In my youth we had the FCC fairness doctrine to prevent corporate media from descending into polemics, but that rule was removed in the 80&#x27;s, and then the FCC abdicated oversight of internet content in general, so I&#x27;m not sure how any of this is supposed to be fixed at this point.')
