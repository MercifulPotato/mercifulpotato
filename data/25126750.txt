The point of version control systems is to make developing software easier. It&#x27;s a tool that exists for the convenience of its users. It&#x27;s reasonable for people developing software to ask for the ability undo a change or restore a repository to the way it was a second ago. Telling a team of people using Git &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work like that&quot; is unhelpful because it&#x27;s not impossible for a version control system to work like that and the point of any software is to help them do what they&#x27;re trying to do.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that Git has to accept any feature under the sun and it might be that Git isn&#x27;t most appropriate tool for teams that want such a feature. But there&#x27;s nothing holy or fundamental about an implementation detail of how Git does things that makes their use-case hard.')
