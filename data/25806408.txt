A site I was working on got falsely flagged by netcraft.com (which they admitted after I spent a week explaining it to them). They do some kind of active AI cyber defence bollocks and have netflix as a customer. Their Automated Idiot classified our login page as trying to phish netflix.<p>The fun part of this is that I could have prevented this if I had seen the warning email that Google sent me, but since Gmail classified it as an email phishing attempt, I never saw it (straight to spam folder). How ironic.<p>Consequences:<p>- Our website was blocked in all major browsers, not just chrome<p>- AWS, who also look at the blacklist and were contacted by netcraft automatically, threatened to delete our account. I had to convince both parties that we did nothing wrong<p>- One week offline')
