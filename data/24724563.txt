Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602195732, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24724510, text='&gt; each time the excuse was &quot;ha ha sorry things are such a mess, that&#x27;s just how things are when you work at a start up!&quot; First of all, &quot;haha we&#x27;re a startup&quot; is not a valid excuse for being late to meetings and ignoring communication.<p>Pretending to act like a startup has become a cover for being sloppy at big companies. People want to pick and choose what it means to work like a startup, and usually they choose the aspects that give them flimsy excuses for bad behavior.<p>In reality, my experience with actual small startups has been that people are better at arriving to meetings on time and following through with commitments because small teams mean everyone knows each other. If you don&#x27;t show up to the meeting, we can see you across the small office and hold you accountable.<p>It&#x27;s the big companies where accountability starts to disintegrate. People know they can get away with dropping balls all over the place as long as they get their OKRs finished for quarterly review. Things start to slip through the cracks because that person you&#x27;re dealing with is just another e-mail address, not your close coworker who sits on the other side of the room.')
