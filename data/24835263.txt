Even as a purely profit-driven incentive, but hopefully also because empathy is a thing that exists.<p>My colleagues without citizenship, gender-minorities, and ethnic minorities in general are, for example impacted disproportionately by the policies of the current administration. If one of these colleagues talks about &quot;politics&quot; that aren&#x27;t directly relevant to the mission, but impact them deeply as humans and emotional beings, they shouldn&#x27;t be shut down. For them, it might instill a degree of confidence in the organization if the company, instead of ignoring their plight, chose to actively support them.')
