I think you’re being confused by not actually modeling what’s going on.<p>Smaller nuclear detonations are less efficient in that they directly liberate less energy from their fuel.  A nuclear explosion in space also radiates most of it’s energy as X-Rays which on earth you heat the atmosphere but in space mostly just do nothing.  So their directly turning less nuclear energy into motion.  Further, a smaller percentage of that force is then collected by the pusher plate compared to the Bell nozzle at the bottom of a traditional rocket. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bell_nozzle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bell_nozzle</a><p>Now as nuclear is so much more energy dense than chemical energy on paper they look better.  But compare ISP’s and you see just how much energy is lost.<p>All of that can be simplified by just looking at ION thrusters ISP and vs the ISP of hypothetical  Orion rockets.  At that point it’s just a question of what percentage of mass is reaction mass vs the reactor + fuel and it turns out you can get reaction mass well over 80% making at least 60% more efficient before considering the pusher plate assembly’s mass  vs physical ION engine’s mass.<p>PS: And that’s when looking at existing ION engine designs.  Hypothetically, you could eject matter at a large fraction of C using energy giving orders of magnitude higher ISP, at the cost of lower energy efficiency etc.')
