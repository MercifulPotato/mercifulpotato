This article argues that instead of slightly raising the average among the 99%, we should instead help the top 1% and given that we now focus our budget on a lot less people, each of them will see bigger improvements.<p>Among other things, the article says &quot;healthy childhood of few concerns without the relegation to daycare is the root of greatness&quot;. Unless they are independently wealthy before having kids, most normal parents will need daycare because they still need to work for money.<p>My personal opinion is that recent years have clearly shown us that we live in a winner takes all system and that wealth doesn&#x27;t usually dribble down. Large companies keep billions in profit offshore, where they don&#x27;t pay taxes (that could help education) and where the money surely won&#x27;t help the middle class find jobs with livable wages.')
