When I was a kid there was nothing to do inside. We were outside most of the time, riding bikes, building forts, wriggling through the storm drains, built a gokart, biking everywhere, impromptu games with the neighborhood kids who were also outside, throwing rocks, climbing trees, all very ordinary stuff for the times. I even tried to build an airplane out of scrap lumber, much to my dad&#x27;s great amusement. Using a hand saw would sure make my arm ache :-)<p>There are a lot of kids in my neighborhood, but I never see them. They&#x27;re inside presumably playing video games.')
