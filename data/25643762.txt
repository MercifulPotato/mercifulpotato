There&#x27;s no question about that, the only question is how the abstract concept assumptions pertain to the real world (infinite tape? maybe a problem, maybe not?; is the execution speed bounded? or maybe we can somehow count to infinity by exponentially increasing the speed? things like that).<p>On the other hand nobody has any clue what the quantum measurement &#x2F; wave function collapse actually is. There are theories&#x2F;interpretations but no truly satisfying answers in the same way as for example Newton&#x27;s equations were a satisfying answer to the elliptical movement of planets, even though we later found out in the 20th century that F ~ 1&#x2F;r^2 was actually an approximation.<p>We simply don&#x27;t know, and we have no idea when shall we know.')
