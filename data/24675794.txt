Less than 1% of Michigan has burned in the last 200 years of settlement: there&#x27;s a ton more precipitation, plus it&#x27;s under snow for four months a year, so fallen trees and leaves decompose in a couple years and don&#x27;t increase the fire risk.<p>My house in a Michigan forest has a very, very different risk profile from a home in a California forest. And California is a big state, I&#x27;m sure there are forests that have similarly low risk profiles.')
