Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25029614], score=None, time=1604871006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25028747, text='No, a GLA45 - not sure why there&#x27;s confusion, as a matter of fact I know a GLA45 is available in the US as well?<p>And.....well, I can present my maths clearer, sure. But I think you&#x27;re missing the part where I said I had the car since 2016 - so obviously got 4 years of use out of it. Had I sold it day one then sure, I can&#x27;t beat the depreciation. But assuming a well structured finance agreement you(with some luck) beat the depreciation around year 2-3. By year 4 you should be able to sell the car with some &quot;profit&quot; for yourself unless something bad happened.<p>I don&#x27;t know the equivalent financial product in the US, but here in UK I had what&#x27;s called a PCP - personal contract purchase. It means that the bank loans you money for a car, you buy it, it&#x27;s in your name(not owned by the bank, it&#x27;s not a lease), but you pay off <i>what the bank assumes</i> will be the depreciation over 4 years, and then after 4 years you can make the final &quot;lump sum&quot; payment of whatever remains and that&#x27;s it, or you return the vehicle to the bank and pay nothing more. So it&#x27;s in some ways similar to lease, but in some ways it&#x27;s better(the car is always yours from the start so you are always free to sell it at any point without asking your bank for permission).<p>So in my specific case, I was paying £400 a month for 4 years, then the &quot;lump sum&quot; payment at the end of the PCP was set at £20k. I have reached the end of my agreement, but found a buyer willing to pay me £24k for the car - so I sold it to them, paid off the bank, and was left with a nice £4k in my account(which I then used to purchase another vehicle).<p>Now, MB UK wanted £3600 for fitting the new head unit(it was a lot of electical stuff in the car that would have to be replaced, tons of labour). Had I paid for it, that alone would have wiped off what I made&#x2F;saved on selling the car at the end. It would have been(financially) an incredibly bad investment, as like I said, the value of such mod is zero or less.<p>And(once again, for the 3rd time), this wasn&#x27;t a reason to swap. I have and am losing money on the next vehicle that is currently standing in my driveway. But certainly a lot less than on fitting a new headunit to my previous Benz.')
