It is extremely hard to detect fraud when the poll observers aren&#x27;t allowed to do their job, or when their challenges are ignored.<p>I get that the optics are bad: throwing out hundreds of thousands of ballots doesn&#x27;t make anyone look good.<p>But what&#x27;s the point of election laws if ultimately it doesn&#x27;t matter when they are broken?<p>I&#x27;m not an expert in election laws, but I would be very curious if this standard of proving fraud has generally been applied for previous election cases in the same way.')
