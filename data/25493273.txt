I&#x27;ve been saying since ~2013 that Elopcalypse was the best thing to happen to Finnish ICT sector. Sure, it was painful and horrifying, and a lot of really good talent left the country for good. (Headhunters and recruiters for major tech companies basically camped in hotel conference rooms for the first half of 2011, courting anyone and everyone who had ever written code for Nokia projects.)<p>But the fact is that Nokia had become a massive (if lucrative) black hole for tech talent. A <i>very</i> large part of the Finnish technology scene was working for Nokia, either directly or indirectly. There was little room for small-scale innovation, because Nokia projects just hoovered up everything.<p>Finnish startup scene of today is a direct beneficiary of Nokia&#x27;s collapse. All that talent had to find <i>something</i> to do to pay the bills. They knew how technology worked, and had ideas that had never got tried out.<p>Slush already existed in 2011, but it got huge <i>because</i> from 2012 onwards there was so much desperate energy directed at making new ideas work.')
