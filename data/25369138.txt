So it will be wasteful to store the entire index in memory 24x7, which is what Typesense (and Algolia) do. ElasticSearch on the other hand has mastered searching log datasets by storing the primary index on disk, so I&#x27;d recommend using ES for log data, instead of Algolia &#x2F; Typesense. The tradeoff with ES is performance, since the ES index needs to be fetched from disk.<p>For any other structured dataset (like the dataset in this app), Typesense would be a good fit.')
