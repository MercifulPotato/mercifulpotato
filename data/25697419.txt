You&#x27;ve been doing it a lot lately, and it&#x27;s exactly the opposite of what this site is supposed to be for.  We ban accounts that do this, regardless of which politics they approve of or oppose.<p>I&#x27;m not going to ban you because you&#x27;ve also been posting some good comments. But if you&#x27;d please review <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a> and use HN in the intended spirit, we&#x27;d be grateful. The rules apply regardless of how wrong other people are or how badly they behave. The commons is fragile, especially right now, and we need community members to contribute to protecting it, not destroying it.')
