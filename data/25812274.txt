If you were to ask me which one I&#x27;d use for a net new project, it would be GCP -- no question. Nearly all of their services I&#x27;ve used have been great with a feeling that they were purposefully engineered (BigQuery, GKE, GCE, Cloud Build, Cloud Run, Firebase, GCR, Dataflow, PubSub, Data Proc, Cloud SQL, goes on and on...). Not to mention almost every service has a Cloud API, which really goes a long way towards eliminating the firewall and helps you embrace the Zero Trust&#x2F;BeyondCorp model. And BigQuery. I can&#x27;t express enough how amazing BigQuery is. If you&#x27;re not using GCP, it&#x27;s worth going multi-cloud for BigQuery alone.<p>But there is something to be said of AWS. Their SDKs are complete and predictable, their APIs are very fast and consistent, and AWS IAM, while having a steep learning curve, never leaves you guessing around what your principals have access to. For me, the real challenge with AWS has been introducing multiple AWS accounts. Governance just flat out sucks when you begin to scale past a handful of accounts (but it is getting better).<p>Azure on the other hand, has terrible consistency issues between their APIs, their SDKs are awful, and it just feels like the entire product is an extension of the MCP System Administrator persona of old, where it&#x27;s expected that someone&#x27;s job will be sitting in front of a UI and clicking around to get things done (the whole blade thing with their portal has to be one of the worst user experiences I&#x27;ve ever seen). However, I do like their Logic Apps, and Azure Policy with auto remediation (when it works as advertised -- ref API consistency and how long it takes for things to propagate through their system) has tons of potential. But they still have a ways to go before I&#x27;d consider it for my workloads.')
