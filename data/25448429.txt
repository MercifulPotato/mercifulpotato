The reality is that a <i>lot</i> of people don&#x27;t directly use a significant portion of what they learn in school. Even if they got a CS degree and become a developer, there&#x27;s probably a lot of theoretical CS most won&#x27;t use outside of interview questions. And many of us have shifted our careers multiple times even if we&#x27;ve stayed loosely adjacent to prior roles.')
