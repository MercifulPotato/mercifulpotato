The ADM-3A (which is even simpler) was in fact implemented with off-the-shelf ttl chips and sram (but only had escapes for cursor position, and clear whole screen).<p>Given the HDL languages and cheap FPGAs we have today it is possible to do more with just FSMs and the icluded RAM&#x2F;ROM, compared to using individual ttl&#x2F;cmos parts and designing a PCB.  I mean you could do a VT100 compatible if you really wanted, but doing it with an 8 bit micro is way easier to write &amp; debug (and extend!).')
