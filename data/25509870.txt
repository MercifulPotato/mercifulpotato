Purely self-made. Handed nothing.<p>Here&#x27;s a situation I saw which changed my view from yours to the person you&#x27;re replying to:<p>My friend is successful. He did not go to college since he couldn&#x27;t afford it. Rather he worked after graduating high school and attained a senior engineering role before his peers had graduated college.<p>Well...the company he was working for folded. He desperately took whatever the next job was because he was young and did not have much savings to fall back on nor a college degree. That next job was across the country and in his words &quot;was a waste of two years&quot;. He stayed at that dead end job for resume purposes in a city he hated but had to relocate to.<p>Now I have another friend. That friend graduated college, moved to a new city. His parents paid for the first year of rent in the new city while he looked for the best possible job in software. He got a great job.<p>You see the massive disparity? The first guy essentially threw away two years of his youth working a cubicle farm job because he did not have inherited wealth to fall back on. Today, he&#x27;s doing very well but that does not change what happened to him.<p>Seeing that first hand changed my &quot;boot straps&quot; thinking. The world isn&#x27;t fair although I agree, you can make it more fair.')
