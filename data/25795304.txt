FWIW, way back when I was a beginner, there were already tools geared towards this exact &quot;no command lines ever&quot; audience: xampp[0]. You&#x27;d be surprised how far xampp plus php.net docs can take you!<p>Nowadays, there&#x27;s also tools like codepen, cloud9, etc, not to mention an endless amount of resources for learning in all sorts of formats (many of which are free).<p>The thing that bothers me is this idea of &quot;look, I&#x27;m a beginner, but your not-geared-at-beginners tool should be geared at beginners!&quot; Imagine you are a beginner at art, and you go around demanding that oil on canvas shouldn&#x27;t involve brushes and mixing paints because that&#x27;s too hard, or that metal sculpting shouldn&#x27;t involve sparks flying out because that&#x27;s too scary, and instead everything should be as easy as using crayons. That&#x27;d just be silly.<p>At some point in the mastery ladder, you will run into established tools and you just have to learn how to use them.<p>There&#x27;s certainly an argument to be made about how rough the ground is when you&#x27;ve veered off the beaten path, but if we were to make a road analogy, while something like setting up a M1 assembler under linux might be way out in the weeds, installing node.js is at worst akin to driving in from out of town.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apachefriends.org&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apachefriends.org&#x2F;index.html</a>')
