Other tech stacks will be supported soon&quot;. Apologies if this was not evident enough. Will factor this feedback into our UI design process.<p>Certainly, we arent there yet but Stripe for Auth is where we want to be. Based on our experience, we actually do compete with all the proprietary services as well and not just the open source frameworks. When someone (who &quot;has money&quot;) is looking for an auth solution, they dont look at which solution is paid. They look at which solution is best for them and that can be either open source, freemium, paid - whatever.')
