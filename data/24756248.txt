What are you going to do, drive half an hour to pick up your other car? And spend another half hour waiting? That&#x27;s incredibly inconvenient and costly.<p>The car-agnostic ideal won&#x27;t work outside of major cities. The backbone of America is car travel. People outside cities have more space and more stuff. They expect hauling and utility function in their vehicles. This isn&#x27;t changing.<p>Maybe if you can convince suburbanites to downsize, you might have a point. But that&#x27;s also a city-centric viewpoint imposed by limited space and desire to move easily. Neither of those things are desired in the suburbs.<p>City dwellers don&#x27;t get it because they don&#x27;t live that life.')
