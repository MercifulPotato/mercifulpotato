It can only be executed from within a shell.<p>It&#x27;s a little bit more nuanced than that, depending on the platform. You don&#x27;t necessarily need to have a shebang. This behaviour is guaranteed in Linux, and traditional on BSD, but not POSIX:<p>&gt; If the header of a file isn&#x27;t recognized (the attempted execve(2) failed with  the  error  ENOEXEC),  these  functions  will  execute  the  shell (&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh) with the path of the file as its first argument.  (If this attempt fails, no further searching is done.)<p>Which means that it _should_ work outside a shell on those systems.')
