Mostly because of NoScript whitelisting, Ublock improves things immediately out of the box.<p>Here&#x27;s some typical examples of my interactions with the modern web:<p>I&#x27;ll open a website and nothing will appear because nowadays it&#x27;s normal to load all content through Javascript. So I&#x27;ll whitelist only the site and its CDN. It still won&#x27;t appear because the site will be misconfigured to not load unless googletagservices has finished loading. So then I allow google. But then some other scripts from the tens of third parties will also be necessary to load it so I&#x27;ll try to randomly temporarily whitelist the least scammy looking ones until it works.<p>For e-commerce websites, I&#x27;ll allow all scripts in the tab because I know it&#x27;s a lost battle to shop without it and then during checkout I&#x27;ll often be redirected to another part of the site or to a payment processor in a new tab without script privileges which won&#x27;t work, so I allow scripts on this tab and reload the page but it breaks their process and now I have to start over.<p>With some websites I get memory leaks because of NoScript. Alibaba and Vinted were like that for a long time, I don&#x27;t know if NoScript or Firefox fixed something on their end or if the websites stopped doing the stupid shit they were probably doing, but for a long time I couldn&#x27;t open those without using 10s of gigabytes of ram and crashing Firefox.<p>I put up with all of it because I don&#x27;t like being spied on but, man, am I mad that I have to go through this.')
