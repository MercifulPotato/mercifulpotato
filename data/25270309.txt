Some people in the FOSS community just want to leave things as-is to hinder propiertary software, and it&#x27;s the same story with device drivers. You can debate the merits rightfully so, but then there&#x27;s still companies pushing out binary blobs which break every few kernel updates. As a FOSS developer it&#x27;s an eternal fight between good and evil with no winner in sight, as a propiertary developer it&#x27;s pain in the ass to maintain old and new software between all the permutation of Linux distros, and as a user I get to cry because of the lack of popular software and backwards compatibility. Snaps and flatpaks are an ugly hack, literal ductape around this very fundamental problem, and clearly not the solution. GNU&#x2F;Linux should have adopted COM and&#x2F;or an adequete proglang with stable ABI a long time ago, and should have tried to control wasted effort put into duplicate software ecosystems (KDE and Gnome).')
