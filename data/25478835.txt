If we want to talk about the legitimacy of his stock holdings being worth as much as they are, then we need to have a different, but similar conversation which is how much value has Amazon added to the world and how much should early stage entities involved with Amazon be rewarded for adding that value. If we assume that Amazon is fairly valued and that Jeff Bezos&#x27;s holdings of Amazon are in line with his contributions, then it again makes sense for him to be worth what he is worth.<p>If we assume that it&#x27;s illegitimate for someone to prosper that much behind growth and optimism that growth will continue (ie he didn&#x27;t sell his stock), then the legitimacy of the net worth of every single direct or indirect (eg via ETFs) investor in Amazon, every single indirect beneficiary of investments in Amazon (eg recipients of pensions whose funds hold Amazon), and every single employee with an equity stake needs to also be questioned.<p>Sure there are some differences here such as stock options, but even if we divided Bezos&#x27;s net worth by 2 or 3 to account for this I don&#x27;t think it would make much of a difference.')
