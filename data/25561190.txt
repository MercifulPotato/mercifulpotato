If you bought gold 30 years ago and sold now, you&#x27;d have about a 5x return. You would have done significantly better if you bought stocks 30 years ago and sold them at the bottom of the market in March. If you sold now, you&#x27;d have done more than twice as well.<p>BTC might go up, might go down. But it&#x27;s a risky asset and there&#x27;s only so much money that can flow into a non-productive asset.')
