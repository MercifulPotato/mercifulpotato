Item(by='harha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608644166, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504771, text='I&#x27;ve got the Brio and I&#x27;m not impressed by the quality, but then again, it works pretty well out of the box for video calls or general recordings, so I guess it&#x27;s ok. Not sure if I could have gone much cheaper and still had something that&#x27;s better than the built-in camera of my laptop.<p>My first choice would have been a real camera (my mirrorless is a bit too old for 4k and being usable as a web cam over USB) and a real microphone (this was a good investment) and adding an extra EUR 200+ to such a setup would be nicer than the Brio, but when I travel more I&#x27;ll be happy to have it.')
