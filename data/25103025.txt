I checked a better route planner, a great app to plan electric vehicles trips, and driving from Brighton to Glasgow today in 2020 is 7h10m of driving and 36m of charging with a tesla model 3. Let&#x27;s round up to 1h of charging. I don&#x27;t think it is a problem today, and even less in 10 years with better cars and a bigger charging network. Sure you may lose some time because you will have slightly longer breaks, but it&#x27;s fine in my opinion and don&#x27;t forget that electricity is cheaper than gaz (unless you charge to 100% on Ionity without using a car from a Ionity constructor).')
