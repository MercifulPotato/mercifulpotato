Only offering macOS forces their customers (e.g. you) into the Apple lock-in, eliminating them from choosing the best hardware for the task.<p>Directed at you: I would try to avoid such software, and look for alternatives. (I expect this to be futile?).<p>x86 is available across the world as well. Others already pointed out comparable form factors.<p>Also, computerhardware reliability is pretty good these days. Maybe you could set up a scheme to reuse your tech stack?<p>On the extreme end, server hardware can run for years with 0 hardware-related downtime (and offers nice things like redundant power supplies, 19&quot; rack cases [but much deeper than audio stuff?]). And brutal performance: Even my 450 Euro used&amp;modified (new nvme disk, faster CPUs), 5y old, 1u(!)
