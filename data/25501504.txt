The catch with health care is that we&#x27;ve developed better (and much more expensive) methods. Spending has increased dramatically. My grandparents grew up on a farm and when they broke a bone they set it at home. They saw a doctor on very rare occasions and when they did, treatment was limited. Their health care spending was very small, but so was the scope of their treatment. When my grandparents got cancer, they died. There were not nearly so many expensive options available for end of life ailments.<p>It&#x27;s possible to live with the same kind of spartan health care today, but almost no one would because we are fantastically more wealthy than past generations.<p>Willingness to buy more is exactly what we would expect to see if wealth has risen over time, as I am arguing. The status quo rises dramatically as overall wealth increases.<p>Education is tricky as it&#x27;s largely a fashion product at this point. Knowledge itself is often freely available in ways impossible to imagine decades ago. It&#x27;s the prestige and pedigree that cost money. Fashionable limited-quantity things get wildly expensive as wealth increases.')
