Sure they will make a lot of gestures and speeches, give a few cents to homeless and poorly maintain some roads, just so people won&#x27;t lift their heads from their smartphones.<p>The real problem here is that it&#x27;s 2020 and we still have entities that centralise immense power without considering conflicts of interest.<p>This is not a US phenomenon, it&#x27;s happening everywhere, it&#x27;s been happening since the beginning of time and it&#x27;s the real cause of inequality between the 0.01% and the rest.')
