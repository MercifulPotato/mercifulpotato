Item(by='wutbrodo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606320502, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25208659, text='&gt; it seems unlikely that while in medical school someone can also complete a full-time two-year business program and start a doctorate.<p>If you&#x27;re very ignorant about a topic, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to do thirty seconds of Googling to make sure a claim is actually implausible before you accuse someone of lying.<p>MD&#x2F;MBA programs exist that add 1-2 years to one&#x27;s med school[1]. On top of that, &quot;over the course of his medical education&quot; quite explicitly doesn&#x27;t simply mean &quot;in med school&quot;, unless for some bizarre reason you don&#x27;t consider one&#x27;s residency (and possibly fellowship) years to be part of one&#x27;s education. Lastly, and I can&#x27;t believe I have to explain this, _starting_ a doctorate doesn&#x27;t actually take any time. In the limit, it takes one Planck time[2].<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not a &quot;peer&quot; with my doctor because whether it&#x27;s rote memorization or not, they&#x27;ve got at least 7 years of training I don&#x27;t, and much more if they&#x27;re a specialist and not a GP. You do not have a &quot;substantial headstart&quot; on any research relevant to your problem unless you&#x27;ve had it for years and are seeing a new GP just to get a referral to a new specialist. In which case, honestly, your old specialist can probably just refer you somewhere else.<p>You&#x27;ve entirely missed the point of my comment. You seem to think that doctors are equipped with future-tech Neuralinks to personally feel the day-to-day manifestation of every one of your symptoms and Black Mirror-style grains to review your entire life history and extract the parts which may be relevant to your medical issue. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but they&#x27;re not: for any non-trivial medical issue, doctors have the difficult task of compressing the entirety of your life into the data that are relevant to your current condition, and doing so in a very short time.  If you think that they&#x27;re capable of doing this without active participation from you, then I pray you never have any medical issues, because you are going to have a very bad time in the healthcare system.<p>&gt; There are plenty of specialties much more challenging than family med<p>Yes, obviously. Part of &quot;know what you don&#x27;t know&quot; is realizing that the complexity of some medical issues means that the &quot;general technical knowledge&quot; side of the scale is weighted heavier than the &quot;intimate insight into the specific problem&quot; side of the scale. I&#x27;m not suggesting that one starts arguing with an oncologist about which course of chemo they should be on.  But then, I&#x27;m pretty sure that was obvious to everyone reading my comment who _didn&#x27;t_ write a response constructing a series of towering strawmen.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freeman.tulane.edu&#x2F;academics&#x2F;graduate-programs&#x2F;double-degrees&#x2F;mba-mds" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freeman.tulane.edu&#x2F;academics&#x2F;graduate-programs&#x2F;doubl...</a><p>[2] I&#x27;m not a physicist, this is an attempt at a lame joke, don&#x27;t @ me')
