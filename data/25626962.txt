Item(by='loeg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609723030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25626100, text='&gt; The TDP on EPYC chips is a lot higher.<p>EPYC TDP ranges from &quot;a lot lower&quot; (35W embedded, 120W regular) up to &quot;comparable with&quot; (180-240W, a single 280W model) relative to Threadripper (180-250W last gen; current gen is all 280W).  It&#x27;s definitely not a lot higher on the Epyc side.<p>&gt; I think of Threadripper as mid-tier, and EPYC as the high-end.<p>This oversimplifies to the point of not being a useful intuition (or is arguably even incorrect).  Threadripper is a SKU with a moderate number of cores at relatively high clocks; (high-power) EPYC SKUs have a lot of very efficient cores running at lower clocks.  They both have a niche, but Threadripper has unambiguously better single-core performance due to the ~20% higher clocks.  And single-core IPC still matters in many applications (to oversimplify: Amdahl&#x27;s law; but also, latency-sensitive applications).')
