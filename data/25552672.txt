Item(by='remram', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609090871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551487, text='There was an attempt with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saythanks.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saythanks.io&#x2F;</a>, however it doesn&#x27;t offer a way to distinguish projects (so you get thank you notes but you don&#x27;t know which project it&#x27;s for) and they are not public. I&#x27;m sure something similar with more customization options would go a long way (even though the best you can hope for is that it dies when GitHub replaces it by a built-in option).')
