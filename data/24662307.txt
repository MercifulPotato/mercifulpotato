I would however question how effective that is in term of competition in a competitive market where smaller and more agile companies can leverage the ability to internally use GPL in order to push out products faster and cheaper without wasting unnecessary time to re-implement tools used internally.<p>As a example, I have never seen a gaming company having internal policy against GPL. Developers are limited in including software that would disrupt the primary business model, but otherwise limiting developers on what they can do when experimenting or internally developing would only delay launches and steal developer time which could be allocated to improve the game.')
