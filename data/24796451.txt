They may be looking for stories that appeal to their prejudices and be willing to suspend disbelief for those stories.<p>But no-one is going to tick the box saying &quot;please show me stuff that is actually definitively false, and potentially dangerous to my person&quot;.<p>So the problem will simply move along to how the &quot;misinformation&quot; tag is being applied and the biases at play there.')
