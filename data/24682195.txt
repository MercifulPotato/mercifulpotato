That is not consistent with an intelligent agent pushing changes to a simulation in real time.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely consistent if the intelligent agent is pushing such changes with Kolmogorov complexity as part of the criterion for selecting which changes to push.<p>Well, unless by “in real time” you specifically mean “while respecting the subjective experience  and record of time for entities within the construct”; if you don&#x27;t assume consistent laws on some level, nothing stops changes pushed fromm rewriting apparent history within the simulation to be consistent with the new model. If you assume you have an accurate unmodified record of the past observations—you are already assuming consistent laws.')
