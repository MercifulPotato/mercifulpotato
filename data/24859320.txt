Battery cell &amp; pack production will be a strategic requirement for any vehicle manufacturer that wants to produce in volumes &gt; 100,000 vehicles&#x2F;year.<p>Also, the goal posts aren&#x27;t fixed -- if your commodity battery packs cost 10% more than those the competition have access to, but are still expensive enough that they make up a substantial portion of the total vehicle cost, you won&#x27;t be able to compete.<p>So even though battery cells will eventually reach a point where it&#x27;s &quot;easy&quot; to make an EV, there will already be enough competitors that make it economically impossible for new entrants to compete.')
