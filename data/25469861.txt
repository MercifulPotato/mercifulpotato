However you&#x27;re submitting this comment under a story with a video of drones flying autonomously through a forest, in a world where facial recognition is commonplace, and commercial drones can easily carry the weight of a polymer firearm.<p>There is value in the inherent friction a state encounters when deciding to kill someone. A lot of people have to say yes, and a person usually has to pull some kind of trigger.<p>Reduce that friction, reduce the amount of people involved, and it is a guarantee that coups and purges will be too tempting of an option for power seekers.')
