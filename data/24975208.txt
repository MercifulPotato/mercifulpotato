I don&#x27;t think people buy enough of the &quot;non-standard&quot; forms to really justify selling them to consumers (restaurants are a different story).  There are a few exceptions, for example Monterey Market in Berkeley, CA has a wide range of potato variants (fingerling, banana, purple) depending on what&#x27;s available.')
