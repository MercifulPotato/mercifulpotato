I&#x27;ve watched the rise and fall of the &quot;ceo of your product&quot; mentality. Mentored dozens of PMs, interviewed hundreds. The one common thread I&#x27;ve noticed across a wide range of successful PMs (and absent from unsuccessful ones) is caring deeply about their team, what motivates them and what they love doing. If you can&#x27;t apply the same empathy you have towards customers to your own people, you burn them out.')
