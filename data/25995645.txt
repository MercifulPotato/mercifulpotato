I expected input lag and streaming quality to be problematic, but I&#x27;ve been a frequent stadia player ever since my (free) premium bundle arrived around Christmas and issues have been rare.<p>The only thing stopping me from spending more money on games is the fact that I expect it to just evaporate one day and take the games I &quot;bought&quot; with it. Moving to a licensing arrangement to let me play the games I already own&#x2F;could retain even if Stadia goes away, would help a lot in this regard.')
