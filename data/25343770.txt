Claiming that a Western country &quot;could have just done like China&quot; is basically saying that that Western country could have just junked all its civil liberties.<p>&gt; And although Australia largely shut itself off from foreign crop labor, and is struggling to harvest crops given this, there&#x27;s not all that much appreciable damage that I can see.<p>Things are different in the EU. After decades of the single market, keeping people fed absolutely relies on getting those harvests done with imported labour.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve heard Covid tests were given to truckies at state borders, but that seems possible for US states or European countries to do, even with limited resources.<p>Tests were in short supply for a long time. By the time they were available, it was too late to lock down as effectively as Oz or NZ. Again, you underestimate just how special those two countries are among Western nations.')
