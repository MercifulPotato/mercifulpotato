I&#x27;m well aware many would refuse generated artifacts, even compiled to source artifacts. For others not so strict, they may accept it since the WASM blob would be the same across targets, unlike an executable, so it lessens a burden as maintainers only have to generate it once for their distribution. It was never something I suggested the Rust maintainers provide a blob for, either.<p>Regardless, it was worth mentioning as a potential option. I am one of the handful of maintainers for an experimental distribution where packages are either compiled or interpreted from tarballs and this would be something we&#x27;d consider. I&#x27;d MUCH rather have the GCC front-end option, however. So far, we&#x27;ve simply not packaged Rust and have accepted that as dead-ending our Firefox package. This may potentially revive it.')
