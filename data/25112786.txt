Most people don&#x27;t love working, which makes it easy to pin it on a specific type of people but you can see it in really anyone. And it can be caused by a lot of external factors, being tired because you don&#x27;t go home to a place you can feel safe and rest, being consistently shit on because of your culture, not having a great upbringing, being sick, and sometimes some people just cant set their minds to a task the same as others. Things like this can be helped by having a stable job and being treated the same as other people around you.')
