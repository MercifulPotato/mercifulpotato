Definitely faster than Cairo, which has already more than decade and half under it&#x27;s belt.<p>There are alternatives to Cairo, but not drop-in ones; they would require porting (Skia, for example). Other than that, Cairo is basically &quot;done&quot;. Yeah, there is occasional need for release with small fixes, but as a software-based rendering library it is not going anywhere. Not that announcing deprecation is otherwise widely respected; the Xorg-server was declared obsolete years ago, the last major release was in 2018, but hey, some still think there&#x27;s a future and in a few years are going to be surprised by &quot;sudden abandonment&quot;.')
