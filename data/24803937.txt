That&#x27;s not the swapping I was discussing.<p>I meant this bit:<p>&gt; After the baby is shown the first two toys, they are placed under boxes and secretly swapped. Despite originally having chosen B, the baby instead gets to interact with A.<p>If the baby actually tracks the swapping (probably unlikely), then I think it&#x27;s not the case that they &quot;originally [chose] B&quot; - unless (quite possible) I am misunderstanding something, which is why I seek clarification.')
