YouTube&#x27;s Standard License authorizes certain videos to be viewed only by streaming through YouTube&#x27;s web player or an authorized client. This is enforced by obfuscating code in the player. By circumventing that code, youtube-dl veers into &quot;illegal piracy tool&quot; territory.<p>Note that it wouldn&#x27;t matter if youtube-dl contained no deobfuscating code at all, but merely downloaded and evaluated the JavaScript Google&#x27;s web client uses to deobfuscate. The result is the same: youtube-dl circumvents copyright access controls and is therefore illegal.')
