To become so engrossed in the movie that you notice no artifact is the goal of most moviemakers. (I&#x27;ve studied filmmaking for 30 years.)<p>The same director, Robert Zemeckis, made Cast Away. There&#x27;s a scene where Tom Hanks has removed the tape from a videocassette and tied strips of it to a tree, as streamers, to tell him when the wind changes direction. The strips of tape are blowing in the wind, and slowly they start blowing over to the other side, to show that the wind has finally changed direction. (He needs to know this as part of his plan to sail away.) Anyway, the tape was all computer animation! I guess they couldn&#x27;t get it to act how they wanted with real tape and some fans. So they painstakingly animated it, and I would have never known, had I not heard it on the behind-the-scenes commentary.')
