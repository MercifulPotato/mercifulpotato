Time creates context: so even a vapid political article from years ago can present worthy insights since we know a lot more about the topic, context, and outcomes. Lindy effect: chances are that an older item worth discussing now is even more important now. And philosophically: we know exponentially more about the past than the present, and history rhymes, so we should talk more about the past.<p>More details on my approach are in the launch post [1].<p>---<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LemmyNet&#x2F;lemmy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LemmyNet&#x2F;lemmy</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;100millionbooks.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;news&#x2F;introducing-hystoria&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;100millionbooks.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;news&#x2F;introducing-hystoria&#x2F;</a>')
