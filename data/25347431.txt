I still believe in an open ecosystem for audio, and have the desire and need to use headphones on ANY equipment I choose.<p>I use cans for video calls primarily, with listening second. Personal favourite is the original Sony MDR-1000X - they just work, and work anywhere, and have a cable if the battery dies. ANC is good enough. Sound quality is good enough. I&#x27;ll buy a newer model when they cease to function.<p>I also have a pair of PowerBeats Pro, and they are mediocre. Left only changes half the time. Audio quality middling. Ignoring the lack of ANC, they weren&#x27;t worth the expense and poor value. It&#x27;s left me with the impression that Apple&#x2F;Beats haven&#x27;t got a clue about sound reproduction.<p>I also use Audio-Technica ATH-50 headphones, but rarely because no mic. Clear but too sterile except as studio monitors.<p>Also a set of Y50s that were inexpensive but served well for lightweight on the go sound&#x2F;voice. Better than the Beats that came after them.<p>Price is not a good indicator when so much is spent on marketing.')
