[1]<p>In fact it doesn’t sound like the cities have any significant role except to provide a dump of signal phase timing data. This article suggests that most traffic lights use unpredictable phase timings based on traffic levels, but that is false - most are predictable according to the time of day.<p>Of course, both parties have an interest in making this system sound like more of a technological achievement than a political one, and they are marketing it accordingly, using terms like “vehicle to infrastructure”, “networked traffic lights”, etc.<p>Audi’s end of the deal is to provide reciprocal data to local authorities:<p>&gt; “We aggregate the recorded data into reports that we will make available to the city authorities. Traffic lights can then be given more efficient phasing and traffic will flow better,” adds Hainzlmaier.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traffictechservices.com&#x2F;how-it-works.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traffictechservices.com&#x2F;how-it-works.html</a>')
