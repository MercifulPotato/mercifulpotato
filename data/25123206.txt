Once you get the mental model right, git is immensely simple to use.<p>I highly recommend sticking with the command line.<p>Github on the other hand, was designed to solve a whole different problem.<p>FWIW if you&#x27;re on Linux (unsure about Windows and Mac), I happen to have zsh and oh-my-zsh[2] installed. They add a ton of incredibly useful git aliases. So for example, seeing a tree view of your project is a simple `gloga` command.
