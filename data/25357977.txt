Item(by='stinos', descendants=None, kids=[25358009], score=None, time=1607518376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25357517, text='<i>new appetizing vegetarian recipes</i><p>I personally don&#x27;t see what is lacking in this area, can you elaborate on what you think is missing?<p>Do you have vegetarian or vegan cookbooks? Just like there meaty counterparts, they usualy have more recipes than you can try in a year or so. Very appetizing, and there are local ones (focusing more on the typical ingredients from where I live) as well as more global ones. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t fully understand what you mean. Only when I just switched to not buying meat it was a bit of a problem to find meals, but that&#x27;s completely logical if you have no experience and only books with meat in the recipes.<p>Wrt India: I just bought a really nice Indian cookbook half a year ago, only vegetarian meals, and only the &#x27;real&#x27; Indian food i.e. what indian people actually eat at home which depending on where you live is quite different from what restaurants offer as Indian.')
