It&#x27;s crazy fast, might solve one of my issue, is super simple to use, and the UI is gorgeous.<p>I&#x27;ve a few questions though:<p>- how do you compare to other privacy focused analytics tools, such as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usefathom.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usefathom.com&#x2F;</a> or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simpleanalytics.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simpleanalytics.com&#x2F;</a>?<p>- it seems like you just launched your SaaS a couple of weeks ago. Why didn&#x27;t you launch it earlier by removing some not strictly necessary&#x2F;MVP features, such as the security login emails,  the ability to manage multiple websites, a less scalable but simpler architecture ... ?<p>- how much time have you spent developing the product? I&#x27;ve been working on my personal SaaS for more than one year, planning to launch it in the next few weeks. I&#x27;m still working at my 4&#x2F;5 full time job, and I really wonder how you managed to deliver this beautiful product while still working fulltime. That would be a wonderful opportunity for blog article BTW.<p>Great work!')
