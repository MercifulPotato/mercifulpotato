If they do you get perfectly correlated numbers.  If the angles are 90 degrees apart you get completely unrelated numbers.<p>The problem comes in when the angle between your two measurements is anything else.  The chance that the measurements match is based on the cosine of that angle.  There&#x27;s no way for this to happen if the measurements are independent.<p>If you try to write two equations, where the first equation takes the secret particle state and first angle and gives you 1 or 0, and the second equation takes the secret particle state and second angle and gives you 1 or 0, you won&#x27;t be able to reproduce the odds you get in the real world.  Only equations that know both angles will work.')
