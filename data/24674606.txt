But I think the potential for self-deception and long term foolishness is still there across the board.<p>&gt; With meds, I find it much easier to step back and get a clear picture of not just my work, but my whole life.<p>Executive function boost is non-negligible for sure, but it is still bound to operate in the short term.<p>Think your bioeconomics as a ledger, your energy levels as income and what you want to do as payments. Stimulants alter this ledger and as long as you can use them you will think you have a lot more income and you can sign up for more things to do. But do you really do have more income in the long term? Are you borrowing from your future income? Your future dopaminergic system? Your future neuroticism levels? I know the research is either missing or contested, but everything from evening crashes to need for increasing the dosage to long term dependence risk suggests that we <i>are</i> borrowing something from somewhere.<p>&gt; I become more attentive to my family, less irritated by distractions.<p>Let me play the devil&#x27;s advocate for a second: How do you know being more attentive to your family is the right thing? Maybe they are real assholes taking you for granted and getting irritated with them would make them get their act together and have a better chance in long term sustainable relationship. How do you know the distractions are not irritation worthy? Maybe they are things you need to get to the root of instead of enduring continuously.<p>I am exaggerating to make a point, and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re mostly fine, but the danger is that thinking you have more &quot;income&quot; than you do will affect all your decisions in a way that accumulates and might not be long term sustainable. It can make you more <i>conforming</i>, and this will be praised by your family, boss, for the case with kids, their parents, but can we say with certainty that being more conforming all the time is really in one&#x27;s best interest? Anger, irritation, anxiety, depression and even boredom, they are not there just as human failings but also as normal processes that can counter-balance over-exertion, over-exposure, weakly defended personal boundaries, meaninglessness, resentment.<p>Only way to know how continuous stimulant use is affecting you is to take a long break after multi-year use and evaluate where your life is, which for some people can be too late.')
