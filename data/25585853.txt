We have these feeble and unenforced &quot;stay at home&quot; orders which are full of loopholes and largely ignored. If you go out for a drive in your town today (against stay-at-home guidance), you&#x27;ll see all manner of stores open, people out and about horsing around, even restaurants. We&#x27;re hardly taking any precautions at all. We don&#x27;t know if lockdowns work because we haven&#x27;t actually tried it.<p>It&#x27;s like the Simpsons quote, &quot;We&#x27;ve tried nothing, and we&#x27;re all out of ideas!&quot; [1]<p>A few places on earth like NZ and Australia actually did stay-at-home with far fewer loopholes, mandatory quarantining, contact tracing, and they&#x27;re doing much better.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lOTyUfOHgas" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lOTyUfOHgas</a>')
