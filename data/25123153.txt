In my personal experience, learning git took a lot of trial and error, but now whatever terminal I sit down in front of, I know exactly which commands I have to run to do what I want in git.  When using a GUI, it&#x27;s fine for the easy&#x2F;common stuff, but if I want to do something more complex I have to figure out how to dig through the options provided by the tool to get the result I want.')
