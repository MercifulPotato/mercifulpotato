All of these happened in the last 6 months:<p>-  A message would get &quot;pinned&quot; to the bottom in Element. Basically, you could send new messages but a specific message would always look like it was the most recent message (even though it was not). This was a purely visual bug and the other party wouldn&#x27;t have the issue.<p>- Messages send&#x2F;receive slowly compared to other services. It could also just be the matrix.org homeserver, I&#x27;m not sure. You gotta be aware you are competing against the likes of Discord however, who deliver messages nearly instantly.<p>- Decryption would randomly break for one party and they would be unable to decrypt new messages until they restarted the client. I couldn&#x27;t identify the trigger for this as it seemed to occur randomly.')
