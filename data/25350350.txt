I don&#x27;t know if TikTok does that. Do they? The problem is also that what one country regards as political censorship another country just considers the application of reasonable laws. However, in the case of China that&#x27;s such an obvious lame excuse - I mean, they literally interrupt phone calls in which people use certain terms.')
