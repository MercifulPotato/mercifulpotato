But the comment implied neglect, which is false.  Our education system is a mess, but it&#x27;s not due to neglect, and it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with manufacturing being shipped abroad.<p>As a side note, the US has the second highest <i>public spending</i> per capita (second only to Norway, last I checked).  Our Government spends more per citizen than all but one &quot;socialist&quot; country.  We then of course spend another doubling of that in private expenditures, and, yes, get worse outcomes.<p>The US is in a very bad spot.')
