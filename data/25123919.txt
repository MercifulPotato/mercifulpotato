For me it is extremely common to work on multiple changes in parallel, on the same branch or different branches, and organizing my changes in different change lists was the best way to handle it.<p>I also find git&#x27;s default of rewriting your worktree when you switch to a different branch extremely annoying compared to simply having each branch be a different directory in the FS. Fortunately, digging around I recently discovered git worktree and I&#x27;m much happier on this front at least.<p>The file locking was always a relatively obscure workflow, so I&#x27;m surprised that you even had to see it if you didn&#x27;t use P4 a lot. I&#x27;ve only seen it in 3 occasions: working with binary files, the error message when I didn&#x27;t actually have write access, and when someone intentionally locked some files to make sure they don&#x27;t have any merge conflicts while they finish up a huge commit.')
