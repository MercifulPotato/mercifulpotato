We run a few server side batches daily to extract data from various government sources before linking it all together in (what is now) a fairly large database.<p>We&#x27;re also using this project as a way to test out a new JS UI library we built (similar to Vue, but a bit faster) to see how it stands up in a real project.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and any ideas you have for how we can improve the dashboard!<p>Thanks :)')
