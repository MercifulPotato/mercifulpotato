Many of the things done during the cultural revolution depended on people passing information, sharing ideas. The chinese fear of information and passing information has a domestic, as well as an international quality is what I am trying to say here.<p>So, there will be oppositional views on the use of Git inside China, and there will be attempts to regulate behaviour in ways which are a poor fit for what Git expects? Sure!<p>I don&#x27;t beleive this is like digital communications as a weapon of soft power, something which was actively promoted by the US department of state, and explains some of their abiding interest in Internet governance, worldwide. I think this is something the Chinese face, and brought into their own situation completely unaided.<p>Lest we forget, Git was invented by Linus Torvalds, a citizen of an economiy in the non-aligned states.')
