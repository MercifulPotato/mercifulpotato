I use the Sipeed Maixduino (or Maix Bit) for my classes. The problem with these boards is there is a lot of esoteric, non-documented items.<p>For a well documented hardware board, I would look at the Sifive Hifive1 (Rev B).<p>Since RISC-V is still relatively new, I&#x27;m sure more and more boards will start making it to market rather soon.<p>The RISC-V organization has a list of boards that they recognize here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riscv.org&#x2F;exchange&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riscv.org&#x2F;exchange&#x2F;</a><p>I think the easiest way to get started with RISC-V is to look at QEMU, which is an emulator. It can emulate the virtio bus, including graphics. I used this in my OSblog: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;osblog.stephenmarz.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;osblog.stephenmarz.com</a> which uses an emulated, 64-bit RISC-V CPU.')
