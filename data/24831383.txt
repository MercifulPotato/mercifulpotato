Basic support landing ~1 month before launch is not acceptable. We barely have a stable kernel with this initial support, and that kernel won&#x27;t have been picked up by any distributions. Further, for previous AMD hardware releases, this initial support has not been really usable from what I have read. Most of the posts I found on Reddit pointed to it taking several months after launch for the Navi drivers to stabilize. Even then, running a custom kernel in my experience is a lot more trouble than the proprietary Nvidia drivers.<p>Compare to Intel where you have initial basic support landing around 2 years before launch with incremental improvements following. This is the correct way to do open source drivers.')
