There are some really critical gotchas that make apparently like-for-like comparisons misleading.<p>For a start, Covid-19 testing is much more widespread than flu testing. The UK has been testing everyone hospitalized for any reason for Covid, which they don&#x27;t do for flu. The flu tests are also less sensitive. Not only that, but because flu tends to kill more via secondary bacterial pneumonia, apparently patients don&#x27;t necessarily have enough influenza virus left to test positive by the time they&#x27;re hospitalized, whereas Covid causes pneumonia directly. Also, there&#x27;s strong statistical evidence that flu causes heart attacks which aren&#x27;t recorded as influenza deaths.<p>The headline CDC, etc stats take all this into account to estimate the number of people who died as a result of flu, in the sense that they&#x27;d have lived if they weren&#x27;t infected. The &quot;counted like Covid-19&quot; stats generally don&#x27;t count these as flu deaths, whilst comparing with stats that count almost anyone who died after being infected with Covid-19 as a Covid-19 death regardless of whether it was directly caused by Covid in this sense. They really don&#x27;t compare like with like.')
