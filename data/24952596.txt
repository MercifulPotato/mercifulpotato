I have a thick accent when speaking English and have had colleagues ask me to try to annunciate better since they cannot understand me.<p>I know it&#x27;s my job to communicate clearly so I make the effort to try to speak in a way that can be better understood by my team. I know my team are making an effort to understand me too.<p>I appreciate being told that I cannot be understood because it shows my team want to understand me and want me to be understood.<p>If your team can get past the sometimes awkward moment where you have to say &quot;sorry; I didn&#x27;t understand that&quot;, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll apreciate it too.')
