I thought good visual design implies both utility and aesthetics?</i><p>No, it implies utility first and foremost. Aesthetics are a secondary concern.<p>At least in many design theories. There are other theories where it&#x27;s art of art&#x27;s sake, or where utility plays second fiddle, by I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re as popular - with either design experts, or even more so the general population.<p>In any case, this fails in both utility and aesthetics - the latter except in the sense that it goes for aesthetics.')
