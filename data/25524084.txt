This arrogance also occurs with citizens who don&#x27;t like it when science is questioned. Real scientists don&#x27;t shy away from questioning. Questioning is a key part of science and advancements.<p>And you have science used as a tool when it supports ones agenda. But immediately thrown away when it doesn&#x27;t align with their emotions and agenda. So we have a pandemic, people trust in the science and the policies to respond, but are all too quick to throw that all away so people can protest, go to church, or let companies film movies. So you believe in science but you are ok with making exceptions for certain things? How consistent.<p>If we allow the agendas of mobs to disrupt science, it becomes a lot less useful.<p>Many leading scientists and groups don&#x27;t have the courage to stick behind the science either, lest they ruffle the feathers of those who donate.<p>There are plenty of scientists that are bought and paid for just like politicians. We have a long track record of this with cigarettes, pharma, the sugar industry, war on fat, etc.')
