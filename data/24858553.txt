It was a media&#x2F;content start up.  We largely consider Netflix a tech startup, but their technology has two main areas: distribution and recommendations. The rest of their business (and likely the larger fraction) is in content production and procurement.<p>Quibi wasn&#x27;t supposed to be a tech startup, it was all about the content. This was their primary expertise and focus. Their main differentiating factor was that they were creating content for mobile consumption.<p>It may well be that the rapid changes in media consumption due to Covid had a major part of their downfall. That and TikTok. It&#x27;s hard to compete against free, mobile-first, viral content.')
