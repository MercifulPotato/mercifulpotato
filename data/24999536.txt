Nvidia made some huge chips on 16nm and 12nm, no doubt. Iâ€™m not so sure the transistor count comparison is all that meaningful though. Maybe compare the wafer allocation instead.<p>Clearly TSMC is heavily diversified and gets to pick their clients. Apple has also been the primary (volume) launch partner on both 7nm and 5nm, which to me indicates how much TSMC values that partnership. Imagine the slam dunk Nvidia would have had if the RTX 3000 series was on 5nm.')
