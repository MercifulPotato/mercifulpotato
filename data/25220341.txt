Dirt road? Sure, and the SUV probably won&#x27;t get as dirty. Gravel? I can probably take it without worrying. Need to clear a curb? Doable.<p>- Better visibility, and that&#x27;s even after factoring in everyone buying an SUV<p>- Marginal efficiency hit (like 10-15%), which most people ignore with electric SUVs anyway, but even with gas or diesel it&#x27;s just not enough to stop people from buying anymore compared to when SUVs truly guzzled gas. As an example, I had a BMW from a number of years ago that my SUV today outpaces in average gas mileage despite unchanged driving habits <i>and</i> better engine output as well as increased weight for the SUV. People are essentially offsetting engine efficiency gains by buying more car.<p>- More car to absorb impact in the event of a crash.<p>I can see why people buy them even before egos start to get involved around just how big the cars can be.')
