Not plantations of &quot;trees&quot; of whatever species, done as part of some large-scale anti-climate-change program.<p>All the tree-planting that we are doing to combat climate change should be done explicitly with a view to promoting natural vegetation ecosystems. Species extinctions in the next 5 years will be due to habitat loss, not climate change. There are few things more important than preventing the loss of the World&#x27;s natural habitats and preventing species extinction: in my opinion every time we talk of climate change as a great challenge facing humanity we should also be talking of habitat loss and species extinction.')
