Every feature added is is another node in a graph with multiple branches to any related features. This includes non-code related things like ux, maintenance cost, marketing, tie-in with product vision (i.e. how well does it fit into that brief description of your product, and if it doesn&#x27;t how to do you communicate it).<p>Building the software is the hard part.
