It isn&#x27;t as simple as &quot;the best ideas win&quot; as most social media platforms make it REALLY easy to manipulate the narrative.<p>For example, if some politician will negatively impact my business, I can hire a BUNCH of people to go out and write nasty comments about that politician.  I can create fake media pages to support whatever narrative I want against that candidate.  I can do all of this for relatively little money.  We see this phenomenon come up time and time again when it comes to review websites.  Most people &quot;in the know&quot; don&#x27;t trust amazon reviews because they know companies astroturf them like crazy.<p>Climate change is a place where this also happens a LOT.  Man made climate change is a nearly undisputed fact in the scientific world, yet roughly half of Americans either don&#x27;t believe in it or are unsure about it.  Why? Because there&#x27;s big incentives behind the fossil fuel industry to spread FUD and misinformation about climate change.  On the flip side, there&#x27;s just not the money or resources available to climate scientists to correct that narrative.<p>I can buy that &quot;some censorship doesn&#x27;t work&quot; however, it appears that a free for all is equally broken.')
