In a light skim it looks fine, but then you start actually looking at the structure or the writing and it falls apart.<p>Your comment is full of (and I mean FULL, nearly every sentence) anti-Chinese assertions with zero factual evidence involved:<p>&gt; The world needs to stop China.<p>&gt; China is stealing Western tech to gain an economic and strategic advantage.<p>&gt; Our opponent has concentration camps...<p>&gt; And this is a regime that wants world domination.<p>&gt; Our media is already censored and caters to Chinese tastes.<p>This is not an argument, it&#x27;s bullshit. Oh don&#x27;t get me wrong, some of it is probably true at some level, and Chinese foreign policy is just as acerbic as in the US, but without any evidence given, it&#x27;s not worth reading.<p>Which makes it funny that there are a bunch of comments just below where people chime in &quot;spot on!&quot;, as if the parent commenter made some EXCELLENT points with his jumbled and disjointed word-vomit.<p>What&#x27;s going on here? Did I have a stroke or something? The words are just no longer making sense.')
