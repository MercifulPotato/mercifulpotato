Item(by='kristopolous', descendants=None, kids=[25502231], score=None, time=1608579848, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496822, text='In practice, &quot;free market&quot; as a historically implemented policy has meant &quot;remove all oversight and revoke any protections or governing laws and thus legalize all business practices (such as scams, collusion, price fixing, market manipulations) regardless of ethics and hand the legislative pen to the business leaders to write their own laws.<p>Ban all forms of community governance, municipal ownership, or a people doing something for their community without using a for profit private company middleman.<p>Defund and gut any form of a social safety net. Disallow people to challenge a company polluting their drinking water and shut down the agencies tasked to inspect it. Forbid places from passing clean air laws or having the power to say no to any predatory company that wants to come to town<p>Allow companies to sue entire countries in secret tribunals if a country decides to not eviscerate their health and safety standards. Disallow countries from preferring local industry or keeping out vulture capital doing pump and dump schemes on their water and food supply. Protect these companies by international private militias that have an authority which overrides the country&#x27;s own military.<p>Enshrine this right in treaty law so no sovereign people can possibly override it or fight back without severe consequences. Embargo, tariff and boycott them if they don&#x27;t join in.<p>Permit companies to hide how their products are produced, lie about abusive and child labor and hide their profits in tax shelters without any consequences whatsoever.<p>Allow banks to defraud customers with phony accounts, car companies to lie about emissions, energy companies to crash entire state economies, insiders to manipulate the libor rates, and create shell companies using tobashi schemes to hide losses and reverse tobashi schemes to hide profits, and then bail them out with public money when it doesn&#x27;t work out.<p>And finally destroy public education and replace it with whatever influence peddler with deep pockets wants to pass off as curriculum so that the public doesn&#x27;t ever catch on to how much they&#x27;re getting robbed.&quot;<p>Then there&#x27;s this slight of hand where the advocates talk about the theoretically heady version of free market and then do mental acrobatics to bridge the policy and theories together. It&#x27;s a distraction so that all the effort to combat the chicanery is instead exhausted on debates and theory discussions so obtuse intellectualism instead of meaningful directed focussed political action occupies all the time of thought leaders.<p>It&#x27;s just coercion exploitation and oppression based on raw capital wrapped with the union busting techniques that keep the con game going without any consequences. It&#x27;s a giant hustle to snatch and grab profit while turning our back on centuries of progress all under a fraudulent banner labeled &quot;freedom&quot;.<p>Even the right wingers on gab and parler are seeing this now. It&#x27;s so clear.<p>Such a scam.')
