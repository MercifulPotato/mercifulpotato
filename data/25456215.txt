By appearing to fire Gebru because her paper was insufficiently pro-Google, they damaged their whole purpose of having an ethical AI group.<p>The demands of the group may seem childish or absurdly far-reaching, but if Google wants to rebuild their credibility here, this is the standard they have to hit.  Otherwise, their own researchers have less credibility because their output will be viewed as &quot;approved by Google management&quot;, not real research.  This is critical if they need to say &quot;our own AI ethicists say this is ok.&quot;')
