Item(by='jpmattia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607888920, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25409375, text='You&#x27;re asking a number of questions that have no bearing on whether they&#x27;ve produced financial information for the balance sheet.  We can get to those issues, but first I want to make sure you understand the difference between lawsuit discovery and the initial subpoena.<p>The initial subpoena requested financial information.  I inferred that the time elapsed since the subpoena to mean tether backing was demonstrated.  You mentioned that tether is fighting discovery, implying that financial information has not been provided.  The subpoena and discovery are two entirely different matters, and moreover the reason discovery is happening is because Tether Inc complied with the subpoena.<p>It is the reason that all but the tinfoil-hat people have stopped worrying about tether.  Their business might go under, but it wasn&#x27;t the silly printing fraud that people like Bitfinexed were claiming.')
