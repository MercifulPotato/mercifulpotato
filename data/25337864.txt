I had a jeep and I literally stopped putting the doors on it because even if I left my car unlocked, people would rather smash a window than even check if it was unlocked.<p>SF has a lot of crazies, so I don&#x27;t even know that theft was the motivation. I have seen people vandalize a car because it was the wrong brand or because it had a bumper sticker they apparently did not like.')
