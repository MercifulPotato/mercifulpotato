I am impacted by 32 bit going away and I cannot do anything about it. That is why I am running Mojava instead of Catalina. On the bright side, whenever I am going to buy a new Mac, the ARM processor effectively doesn&#x27;t cause any additional troubles on the compatibility side, and that was probably the reason for Apple to kill 32 bit with Catalina.')
