At the time I thought it was the most interesting research direction in the field. I met her at a conference and introduced her to Ben Hammer and Richard Sorcher. I didn’t know them either, but it worked out. Point is, it’s easy to feel attacked and lash out on the internet. Most people are pretty reasonable on the outernet though. It’s all about what the norms (algorithm) rewards. I wish tensor decomposition captured the interest of the tech world as much as social justice wars.')
