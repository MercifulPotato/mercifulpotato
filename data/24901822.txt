I&#x27;d bet on the story being not accurate, but I&#x27;m unsure to what degree: Did Bloomberg eat some total fabrication? The method described seemed questionable, but variations on it could be possible and be easily in the realm of &quot;reporter doesn&#x27;t understand source&quot;. Did something happen, was caught earlier and embellished (on the way to the journalists, or by the journalists?) and Bloomberg doesn&#x27;t want to admit they didn&#x27;t validate that properly? To my knowledge Bloomberg has not given any further statements about this, which IMHO doesn&#x27;t look good. Neither is there any third-party information outside the denials, which also could be inaccurate or hiding behind technicalities.')
