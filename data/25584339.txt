Overall it was successful and I was glad that I did it. My work-life balance was great and the pay cut was expected and manageable. I usually worked Mondays to Wednesdays so that I could get two contiguous days (Thursdays and Fridays) when children would be at school (so that I could go on child-free visits). Monday mornings were just as bad as they had always been, but Wednesdays were suddenly Fridays!<p>One thing that convinced me that the company would tolerate it was that women returning from maternity leave often worked a three day week, so there was good precedent from a management perspective. And my female colleagues also persuaded me that it was doable.<p>The biggest challenge I found was having to work on projects that had frequent and unpredictable interactions with customers &#x2F; stakeholders. I didn&#x27;t mind occasionally swapping my days around to accommodate interactions, but there was one project that I would have enjoyed in terms of the work, but which I stepped back from because its timings were so unpredictable. This was probably the main problem with non-standard hours.')
