I’m not surprised that such a law is coming especially since in my view, the decentralized nature of crypto makes money laundering even easier.<p>Even if you kept a blacklist of wallets with dirty money, I think it would be possible to spin up a chain of brand new wallets and quickly funnel coins through them before the blacklist could keep up in a way that would be impossible with fiat transactions and traditional banks.
