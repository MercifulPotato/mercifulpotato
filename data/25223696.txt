It&#x27;s basic research into the evolutionary history of our species. They certainly didn&#x27;t secretly want to work on infectious diseases all along.<p>Besides, where do you get the idea that getting funded to work on the Neanderthal genome is easier than getting funded to work on an ongoing pandemic? Not that P채채bo needs it, as a Max Planck director he doesn&#x27;t need to apply for grants.<p>What&#x27;s happening here is simply that the world&#x27;s Neanderthal genome experts continue working on Neanderthal genomes, and when they find something that is related to the pandemic it ends up in Nature and the popular press.')
