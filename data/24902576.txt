There are some data science libraries coming out (maybe arraymancer), but nothing I know of in the numerical computing arena. Nim can compile to C or C++, so I assume FFI is easy, but it&#x27;s still a lot of work if you aren&#x27;t familiar with C. Python has all of that handled for you with certain distributions.')
