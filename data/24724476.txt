That flags &#x27;pending&#x27;? Notifications for &#x27;2 weeks no reply&#x27;?<p>As a hiring manager, absolutely all portals&#x2F;HR management software I have used up to this moment have this feature. Most of them highlight the application and put them in a visible &#x27;No progress for X time&#x27; category; some even send separate e-mails for each long overdue candidate.<p>The truth is that - at least in the orgs I&#x27;ve been part of - the trend for HR is to be apathetic to the needs of the team they&#x27;re hiring for and tone deaf in communication. Recruitment has been the least favourite bit of their job.<p>Over the years I have received Linkedin messages from a number of candidates whom I have referred to other teams&#x2F;department after they interviewed for a position in mine. HR should&#x27;ve followed up with them; they didn&#x27;t.')
