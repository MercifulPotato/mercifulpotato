Now I try to request all paperwork in advance so I can read.  At one (where I thought highly of the doctor who seemed very kind and competent), 2 people in the front office insisted to me that the &quot;other document&quot; to which the main one referred and said I was also agreeing was the same document that had the reference.  After I refused to sign, one left and the other made a phone call to find the real &quot;other&quot; doc.<p>I think (though am not an attorney, so not sure what a really honest, articulate, kind one would say) that if attorneys who wrote these long, difficult agreements applied honesty and the Golden Rule, they would start reading them themselves more often in general life, and they would word them so that their target audience would have an easy time understanding them, etc etc.  But the executives have other things on their minds I suppose, and don&#x27;t push for this (or care...?).  (maybe this is one of my pet peeves--sometimes I wonder if it just makes life harder for honest people).  But I still think being honest and kind is totally worth it in the long run.  Wrote more elsewhere on that.')
