These are two bluetooth devices on same audio stream.<p>Yes. Samsung has supported this for years and it has recently upstreamed to all android devices. You can literally do this with any phone and any bluetooth devices, you don&#x27;t need to fork up $500 for the priviledge.<p>&gt; Does your solved problem bluetooth headphones RELIABLY connect to your current device (without having to unpaid with another device).<p>Yes. The Bose QC35 II for example can store multiple bluetooth connections on the device and switch between them. They cost half as much as the Apple cans and are all but guaranteed to sound better than the plastic cones Apple uses.<p>&gt; You should go back and listen to the criticism of the airpods when they came out - overpriced, stupid, whatever. Then check out sales numbers.<p>I won&#x27;t argue that. Apple certainly moves product - there&#x27;s a significant portion of the population that would buy anything they put out.')
