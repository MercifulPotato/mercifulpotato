We can manufacture it in the body. &quot;Essential nutrients&quot; are things we cannot manufacture.<p>It&#x27;s essential to bone health and bone marrow is where the body makes white blood cells. It&#x27;s generally understood to be important to normal immune function.<p>If you have reason to believe you are Vitamin D deficient, it is always a good idea to address that. If you are not deficient, there is no reason to believe that taking &quot;extra&quot; will protect you from anything. In fact, it may be quite harmful, in part because it is a steroid and in part because it is fat soluble so you can end up storing the excess to the point of hitting &quot;toxic&quot; levels.')
