The quote I referenced is from the discussion in the article of the example you gave - even inside the quote it makes an explicit reference to the table you pointed me to.  You&#x27;re welcome to make another example, but I was specifically responding to the one you gave. That&#x27;s not cherry-picking, that&#x27;s a totally relevant counter-example to the one you gave.<p>&gt; not actually a small sample size, but a total dataset<p>Guess I didn&#x27;t articulate super well. That dataset only covers a very small number of people in a very artificial environment - top lawyers dissecting legal matters from opposite sides of almost every spectrum is hardly an environment representative of e.g. general conversation.  Sure, there&#x27;s a lot of observations made over a period of time, but it&#x27;s observations of only 9 people, which is a really tiny group when you&#x27;re trying to make any extrapolation at all to the general population, even if the circumstances had been anything approaching normal.<p>&gt; your cherry-picked quotation seems to indicate a lack of genuine curiosity on your part<p>Are you trying to make a personal jab, or was that just accidental?  Maybe &#x27;interrupting&#x27; isn&#x27;t the only interpersonal (systemic?) abrasion that might need fixing in society...')
