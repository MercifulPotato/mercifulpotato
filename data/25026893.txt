You should have a pretty good idea of the what&#x27;s available in the area after a while.<p>As you noticed, everybody think they deserve more. Ironically everybody is wrong, because the fact that they work here for this amount is proof that it&#x27;s enough (for now), if they could get paid more they&#x27;d be paid more (whether here or somewhere else).<p>The key is to ignore people because people are always dissatisfied. Big companies set a fixed pay band and reply to everything with &quot;there&#x27;s no budget for a raise&quot; because it&#x27;s the nice easy way to do that.')
