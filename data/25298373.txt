Surveillance is easier too.<p>For those of us who are working from home due to the pandemic (or other reasons), we don&#x27;t have any way to communicate with our co-workers except via electronic channels that can be logged.<p>Pre-covid, one could reasonably expect that if one were to mention unionization in conversation over lunch, there wouldn&#x27;t be a permanent electronic record of it.  Now, it&#x27;s just not something you can discreetly discuss with someone unless you have their outside-of-work contact information.')
