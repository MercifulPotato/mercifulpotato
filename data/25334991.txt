Leaving now is a vote with your feet.<p>&gt; unenforceable non-competes<p>Very few of my peers have ever cared about this in practice. I don&#x27;t think this is remotely a major benefit compared to e.g. state taxes.<p>&gt; fantastic weather and surroundings<p>The surroundings, I&#x27;ll give you, but the weather is &quot;fantastic&quot; in a small number of communities only. SF weather is far from fantastic. I don&#x27;t miss it. Sunnyvale or RWC, on the other hand... But still. The weather is boring.<p>What I don&#x27;t miss are the fires and smoke-filled skies, and the drought.<p>&gt; an educated and diverse population<p>The &quot;native bay area&quot; population? Or the migrants and immigrants? The vast, vast majority of people I worked with over the years were from elsewhere. We used to joke that it was rare to hear someone was born in the Bay Area. There&#x27;s not much weighing people from elsewhere down preventing then from leaving, and there is less and less weight each passing month this year.<p>&gt; cultural activities<p>I actually cannot think of anything unique to the Bay here...<p>&gt; very high compensation<p>True, but I know plenty of people who have moved to Seattle and New York who make just as much. And I know of several fully remote (pre-pandemic) workers who are making 90% of what they would earn in the Bay Area -- I know, this isn&#x27;t common, but it&#x27;s possible.<p>Honestly, SV has done this to themselves. NIMBYism, insane housing, terrible transit, high taxes. I have no doubt SV will recover, but the rest of the world will prosper at the valley&#x27;s expense.')
