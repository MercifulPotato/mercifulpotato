Spotify is one of those products that I sort of almost can&#x27;t live without but yet it&#x27;s painful how bad they have become in the last couple of years. Instead of improving the service and customer experience, it only got worse (if I had the chance to straight up use an outdated client from a couple of years ago, I would!).<p>The fun thing is, my company has jumped on the agile train a while back (nothing wrong with that per se in my opinion), and Spotify was always that cool example &quot;where agile works&quot;. Well, no idea what they&#x27;re doing, but if their KPIs mainly consist of how bad of a UX they get away with, they for sure are very successfully improving their product.<p>It constantly forgets which episodes of a podcast I&#x27;ve already listened to, or where exactly I&#x27;ve stopped when in the middle of an episode. Their support for downloaded songs at this point seems to be almost non-existent (I stopped using spotify offline quite some time ago as it became too much of an annoyance). If a song I liked is not available anymore but is then available again, I have to like it again. It <i>still</i> can&#x27;t differentiate between studio and live versions of songs which I would like to filter out (I hope someone corrects me that I&#x27;m just too dumb to find the right button). I once got an email that one of the bands I liked released a new album - but it was a band with an identical name (and never heard of before!); apparently, they send out mails by matching band names instead of some unique IDs (no idea how <i>that</i> passed any kind of review; must&#x27;ve been some mashed-together 11-hour release).<p>... the list could go on and on. The thing is; I really <i>want</i> Spotify to be good, it&#x27;s what made me stop pirating music, it was just way more convenient. It still is, but it could be so much more, especially given all the cash they&#x27;re rolling in.')
