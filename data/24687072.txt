In my humble opinion, the correctness of a word in a given context should be gauged on its utility in communicating a concept. Tomatoes are fruits in a botanical context, but not necessarily in a culinary context.  Likewise for the planethood of Pluto, as mentioned elsewhere under this comment.<p>To hypothesize on a more contentious issue, I think that this ties into contemporary debates on gender identity. The terms &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;man&quot; are ancient and ubiquitous, but only recently seem to be showing as inadequate in certain contexts. Universally defining these terms seems like it would elevate some of these contexts above the others, which would inevitably invite backlash from people for whom these contexts are less common.')
