Assume there were 1,000,000 violent incidents in 1980 and they were all caused by lead in the water. Violent video games  caused no violence at a level that would even show up. If today we had 500,000 violent incidents and none of them were caused by lead but all 500k were caused by the prevalence of violent video games.<p>(I&#x27;m not trying to say that violent video games cause real life violence, but the numbers you describe don&#x27;t offer any type of compelling evidence without other data being considered as well. )')
