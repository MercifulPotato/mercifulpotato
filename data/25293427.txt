If it&#x27;s a large percentage, then that could be driving this too.<p>There is a precedent, Afghanistan and opium production. Opium provides about 400,000 jobs in Afghanistan, more than the Afghani National Security Forces.<p>To be clear, I am not taking a stance on morality of it. I think smaller countries will look to leverage the vices of the larger countries into sources of income, as economies of smaller countries around the world suffer more due to climate change, increased diseases, and resource scarcity.')
