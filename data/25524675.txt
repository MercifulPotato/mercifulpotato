Many of them are bunk, and many are not much better than the local chess club. But there are some potent practices out there, it&#x27;s not all about &quot;blind belief&quot;. This crisis you describe is precisely the &quot;religious&quot; impulse (or whatever you want to call it). For some people they end up climbing mountains and that does it for them. It&#x27;s all the same impulse, is what I am trying to say. And you don&#x27;t have to believe in some kind of santa clause god to get the juice. Good luck!')
