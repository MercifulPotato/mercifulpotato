I was told repeatedly to get on Statins for high cholesterol. Finally the company nurse said: look, you need this but first I&#x27;ll let you try red yeast. WTF? OK. It&#x27;s a natural source of the same thing. It dramatically reduced my cholesterol and triglycerides -great. I was kind of excited to have such great results while giving the finger to big pharma (who isolated lovastatin from red yeast and patented it). Then the muscle aches started. I was completely unaware of that side effect, but reducing my dose helped - which I did only after being informed that it&#x27;s a common side effect. You can also reduce it by taking CoQ10.<p>You can&#x27;t have a psychological side effect if you&#x27;re not even aware of it.')
