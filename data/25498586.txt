What you are asking is pretty much the core question for a certain set of ML tasks at Netflix.<p>Metaflow is rather unopinionated about those types of questions, since they are subject to active research and experimentation. Metaflow aims to make it easy to conduct the research and experiments but it is up to the data scientist to choose the right modeling approach, features etc.<p>In some cases, individual teams have built a thin layer of tooling on top of Metaflow to support specific problems they care about. I could imagine such a layer for specific instances of transfer learning, for instance.<p>In general, we are actively thinking if&#x2F;how Metaflow could support feature sharing in general. It is a tough nut to crack.')
