Not one. Only thing sold has been generic phones which accepts a generic SIM.<p>And that’s how the market is supposed to work. Free competition on devices. Free competition on service. Customers can combine as they like.<p>Granted you could buy carrier-locked phones rebated through a contract, but the carrier lock was time-limited and reversible and the phone was a generic, international model.<p>Carrier-branded phones was definitely not a EU-wide phenomenon.<p>If anything the <i>introduction of the iPhone in Europe</i> (launched using the very confusing US carrier-model) was what started pushing carriers into attempting to making new restrictions on how people were allowed to use their (formerly unrestricted) subscriptions.<p>So you got it pretty much 100% backwards.')
