After a lot of consideration, I felt like it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it. That would be a lot of time and work for something that wouldn&#x27;t substantially increase my pay. I would be better off just focusing on mindlessly cranking whatever the business tells me to because that&#x27;s all the company cares about. Just as background, I have a master&#x27;s and didn&#x27;t see that help me get much more compensation, nor did I get a promotion.')
