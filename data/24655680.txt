But I would guess that the average programmer do have access to &quot;production data&quot;. What that contain is obviously industry specific, and the most sensitive industries are (hopefully) well regulated and not average, like health care or finance.<p>But I would guess that programmers at Tinder&#x2F;Grindr&#x2F;$datingSite had access to production data in the early days. Probably many SaaS things, perhaps doing stuff in the HR&#x2F;recruitment&#x2F;time reporting area. For B2B I&#x27;m guessing many programmers have access to business sensitive data, that competitors would like to get their hands on. At the least I would guess that at least the average backend developer have access to all contact info &#x2F; emails for all users in services they work on.<p>Obviously all best practices say that random Joe programmer shouldn&#x27;t have access to these things, but I don&#x27;t think that match the _average_ reality.')
