Consumer electronics are rarely about &#x27;the best&#x27; chips, just the ones that work. Intel may not be the leader technology wise, but they have the contracts to put their processors where they need to be. They don&#x27;t have the strength they used to, they still leverage the existing relationships with OEMs.<p>And regarding AMD&#x27;s production capabilities, that seems to be old news. According to a report [1] from August, there don&#x27;t seem to be any <i>major</i> logistical issues anymore. They&#x27;ve massively scaled up output from TSMC, at some points this year making up about 20% of their production output [2]. Whether this is on the same level as Intel, it&#x27;s hard to say - If you have information comparing them I&#x27;d love to see it.<p>---<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wccftech.com&#x2F;exclusive-the-state-of-amds-supply-chain-august-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wccftech.com&#x2F;exclusive-the-state-of-amds-supply-chai...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hothardware.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;amd-7nm-production-at-tsmc-set-to-double-in-2h-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hothardware.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;amd-7nm-production-at-tsmc-set-...</a>')
