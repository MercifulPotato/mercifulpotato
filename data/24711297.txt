The legs are up so far that they won&#x27;t fall asleep (your feet have to be under your heart, vertically, for that to &#x27;just work&#x27;).<p>It is one the most comfortable &#x27;chairs&#x27; I know. Before the lockdown I never used it for working, only for reading or watching movies. When there&#x27;s a sit-in at my place there&#x27;s usually a fight for it among the guests.<p>It doesn&#x27;t yet have any of the contraptions attached to it to make it into a &#x27;lay-down desk&#x27; though.<p>I usually work with a laptop on my legs and for that it&#x27;s absolutely fine -- as-is.<p>Sascha is now looking into designing an extension that allows mounting 1-3 screens and a keyboard&#x2F;mouse&#x2F;touchpad&#x2F;Wacom combo. Just like the contraption in the linked article. :]<p>With the caveats: it will be structurally sound (he&#x27;s an ex aerospace engineer) and -- assumedly -- beautiful too.<p>I&#x27;ll try posting this on the front page once his shop goes live.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.suk-design.de&#x2F;coffy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.suk-design.de&#x2F;coffy&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ergonomicshealth.com&#x2F;reclining-seating&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ergonomicshealth.com&#x2F;reclining-seating&#x2F;</a>')
