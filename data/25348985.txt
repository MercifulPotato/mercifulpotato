For example RHEL has some support branches where they&#x27;ll produce security updates for minor updates. For example you can pay a lot of money and you&#x27;ll get RHEL 7.2 with security updates. They won&#x27;t release sources for those packages unless you&#x27;ll ask for those packages (you, as a paid client, not you as nobody in the Internet). But if you&#x27;ll ask sources and then publish those sources in the internet again and again, so other entity like CentOS or whatever could pick them up and build CentOS 7.2 LTS, they will terminate your contract.<p>So that&#x27;s a weakness in GPL. You won&#x27;t break any law, but they&#x27;ll just terminate contracts with those who publish those sources. So those sources are effectively unavailable for a large public.<p>Currently they publish their mainstream branch sources to the public. But they could stop doing that any time and only provide those sources to their clients on request.')
