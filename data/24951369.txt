In my rejection of these ideologies, I mainly focus on the badness of their proposed solutions to (often perceived, not actual) problems.<p>Specifically for Identity Politics and Critical Race Theory, the main ideological issue I see is qualifying people by their belonging to major groups (often based on race, ethnicity, religion or sex) which results in solutions that go against individual rights&#x2F;liberties (which I take to be the cornerstone of liberalism). Examples are: not opposing police violence against <i>people</i> but only police violence against <i>black</i> people, supporting discrimination for&#x2F;against <i>some</i> races (for black &#x2F; against Asian when it comes to schooling), etc. A lot of these policies would be good if they were instead targeting <i>everybody</i> (or at most class-based (rich&#x2F;poor) discrimination). A lot of the proposed bad solutions could be better if they were thought-out a bit more (e.g. &quot;defund the police&quot; is particularly bad... instead what you should do is, prevent police buying military gear, stop swatting, ban civil forfeiture, fund (and train) them <i>more</i>, legalize drugs, reduce poverty to reduce crime, ...).<p>Edit: contrary to my words above, I actually went and read a bit about CRT on Wikipedia... One of the first &quot;Major themes&quot; listed is <i>critique of liberalism</i>. Therefore, I understand why proponents of CRT would want to pain liberals like me as <i>bad</i> (&quot;right-wing&quot;). It&#x27;s also not surprising that liberals would oppose CRT.')
