Plenty of close in guns and missiles to prevent direct attack, yet you could very rapidly area-denial an area with cruise missile delivered mines.<p>If a naval patrol covers more than two hours per leg, they can deny incoming missiles from directly hitting a carrier or whatever but they can&#x27;t deny missiles incoming 100 miles away at the same time.  Either way it prevents the carrier from operating in the area.')
