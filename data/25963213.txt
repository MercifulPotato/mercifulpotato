In England you would never see people like Elon Musk, Sergey Brin, Steve Jobs etc who came from middle class families move to the highest strata of society and be accepted by those in that highest strata.<p>I am by no means bashing England, I think the country is awesome and have family that lives there, I am just not keen on the stratified nature of its society.')
