I was never for want of money there, so I can&#x27;t speak to that aspect of it, but I recall arriving in places that were close to closing, or otherwise not really set up to feed you a normal meal. I never went away hungry though, even if it was a sandwich and some apologies.<p>In Austria, on the other hand... we arrived at one place about 15 minutes before closing time, and the guy said sorry and kicked us out into an approaching rainstorm. No food, no bottle of beer, no nothing. Had several other similar experiences there.')
