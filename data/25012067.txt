The location is also usually outside of the biggest, most expensive cities.<p>$120&#x2F;hr * 40 hrs&#x2F;wk * 50 wks&#x2F;yr = $240K before self-employment taxes and paying for insurance. Ends up being comparable to typical compensation in cities that aren&#x27;t SF, Seattle, or other top-tier markets.<p>Now if someone was doing more typical ad-hoc freelance work on a project basis, $120&#x2F;hr might be too low for typical work. However, $90-120&#x2F;hr as a contractor with a long-term contract and stable pay over 12-18 months is not uncommon.<p>Unless someone has a lot of new, small contracts knocking at their door nonstop, it can make more financial sense to take a $120&#x2F;hr long-term contract over sporadic $200+&#x2F;hr work that changes month to month.')
