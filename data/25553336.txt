The media then proceeded to immediately circle the wagons and insist that anything other than &#x27;it was a lone suicide&#x27; was &#x27;baseless conspiracy theory.&#x27;<p>I imagine for most conspiracy theorists it&#x27;s a similar process. They see some evidence of our society&#x27;s widespread institutional corruption and the mass deception which is deployed to protect it, and begin looking for the truth in alternative avenues. Unfortunately it is then very easy to exit the first hall of mirrors into another one, like QAnon.')
