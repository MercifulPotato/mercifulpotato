The IBM PC was a skunkworks project by a team of 12 lead by Don Estridge in Boca Raton Florida.  The reasons for its success can be seen, in hindsight, to be a consequence of its lack of internal funding and status within IBM, which had a business model focussed on leasing mainframes to large corporate customers.<p>IBM didn&#x27;t have resources to develop custom hardware or to write software for the PC.  Estridge&#x27;s team used off the shelf chips including Intel&#x27;s 8088 cpu.  To make it easy for 3rd party developers to support the system, IBM published the BIOS source code.  This had the effect of making it possible for Taiwanese manufacturers to clone the PC and sell cheap copies.  DEC had no matching ecosystem.  Its Rainbow 100 sold for $4K whilst IBM PC clones sold for $1K.<p>The killer apps for the first generation of PCs were word processing and spreadsheets.  PC&#x27;s could perform word processing better than minicomputers, and spreadsheets were invented on PC&#x27;s with VisiCalc and then later, Lotus 1-2-3.  Consequently, IBM and the Taiwanese clones, the best known example of which was Dell Computers, were able to sell PC&#x27;s into corporate accounts where IT managers would allow them to take the burden off mainframe data-processing systems by performing the personal office tasks which mainframes and minis couldn&#x27;t efficiently do.')
