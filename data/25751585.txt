Item(by='d1zzy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610477660, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25742400, text='&gt; As one of the people WFH with simply reduced expenses, all I ever hear on the news are about the people who have been adversely affected, other than obvious winners like Zoom. Of course, &quot;average savings rate is up&quot; may not even be newsworthy, but I had no idea until recently this was the case.<p>One thing I&#x27;d like to make it clear is that although I am one of the lucky ones to hold a job in this pandemic economy and work from home, I&#x27;m actually spending more now than before on monthly expenses (for food, for example).<p>Where major savings come from are from lack of travel expenses but I wouldn&#x27;t consider not being able to spend money on travel as being a net positive, it&#x27;s a tradeoff between unique life experience and some extra money, not really a great tradeoff for many people I imagine (and a tradeoff that would have been possible even before the pandemic, the pandemic just removed the choice now which is not great). And it&#x27;s not like most people that can save some travel money now will invest it well, I would imagine most simply end up spending on stuff they wouldn&#x27;t have bought otherwise (see the super high demand for latest PC hardware, high Amazon sales, etc).')
