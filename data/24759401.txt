For the large corporation that I work for, things like soc2, patching, server maintenance, etc. are a giant pain every single month. The quicker we switch as many things as possible to serverless the better. One of the services I converted over went a year and a half with absolutely no attention from our engineers. It was great seeing how old the latest deploy was. Coupling serverless with terraform and git makes everything even easier. It means doing things like adding another lambda to an API as simple as copy and paste terraform, replace phrases in terraform, write code. terraform apply and done.')
