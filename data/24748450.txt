Chances are you will get major version bumps for most of your dependencies after 1-2 years of development.<p>What works well then is to do upgrades partially. Each major library separately, fix issues, go with the next one. Otherwise it&#x27;s hard(er) to track what breaks your app.<p>My current project has 100 dependencies and 150 devDependencies. Upgrading takes a week if not longer for one experienced dev. We tend to do it every 3-4 months.')
