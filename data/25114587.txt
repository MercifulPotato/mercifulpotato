From a high level calories in vs calories out. It is difficult with our sedentary lifestyles and processed food but it can be done! Personally exercising portion control and tracking what I eat is difficult for me. I found that doing a lot of aerobic exercise is my best strategy. If you run for 20 miles a week, you have to try to gain weight! Also not keeping unhealthy food in the house is huge. For most people though, portion control is more important than exercise. Family members who have lost weight don&#x27;t exercise as much as me, but they weigh and watch what they eat very carefully.')
