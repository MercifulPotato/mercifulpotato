HR can be useful but it depends on the company&#x27;s culture and under good circumstances, it won&#x27;t be needed. You want a place that will appreciate your contributions and appreciate the value of their long-term investment in people.<p>If it becomes apparent that $CURRENT_EMPLOYER is not such a place, it&#x27;s time to start protecting yourself with things like formal disability accommodations through HR, etc. The problem is that once this becomes apparent, shrewd politicians will have already worked to make it look like your accommodations are just a cover-up. That&#x27;s not necessarily a deal killer, as every company puts a different weight on the legal risk that HR exists to prevent, but it&#x27;s not likely to ingratiate your manager, which makes things difficult.<p>The long and short of it is that it&#x27;s folly to imagine that HR is in your corner. They are paid by the company and they exist to keep the company free from the mind-boggling expense of lawsuits. You can work this to your advantage <i>sometimes</i>.')
