But this is true, no matter how high you push things.  If something kills all the okra (see Interstellar) then we&#x27;ll have to fall back on spinach _as a society_ if we have one mega-farm.  If everything on the planet dies off then we&#x27;ll have to flee the solar system, or get support from neighbors in the local galactic cluster.')
