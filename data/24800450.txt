If they were working with this vine as a parent (unlikely) they would probably as a courtesy reach out to the original breeder, but they&#x27;d just be taking pollen from it, so the &quot;EULA&quot; would not apply.<p>There are thousands and thousands of grape varieties out there. Most consumers only ever taste a dozen. The genetic diversity bottleneck for grapes comes in general from consumers lack of education and their preferences for the same thing over and over again, usually with a fancy European sounding name so they can feel sophisticated while they drink their wine from a clone of a vine from 800 years ago that had to be sprayed with fungicides every 5 days to stop it from dying.')
