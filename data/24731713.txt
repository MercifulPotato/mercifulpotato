Safari can require that PWAs only be given the chance to receive push notification permission <i>after</i> being added to the home screen. It&#x27;s not rocket science. SpaceX landed a rocket booster almost 5 years ago, and they&#x27;ve gone through the certification process to send astronauts to the space station, and they&#x27;re well on their way to making their next-gen Starship platform orbital. But Apple can&#x27;t figure out a way to support APNS for PWAs. It&#x27;s <i>just too hard!</i> Apparently.<p>If PWAs supported APNS, Apple would have a significantly more defensible anti-trust position, but Apple has shown that they just have no interest in making things easier for themselves -- let alone their users or developers.<p>Apple also supports PWAs so poorly that the new App Library feature doesn&#x27;t even properly support them. PWAs have no option to be removed from the home screen and left in the App Library, unlike all other apps, and iOS 14 is the first time that there has been any distinction between PWAs and regular apps as far as the home screen is concerned. This is without even discussing the lack of widget support for PWAs, which would legitimately be challenging for Apple to support well, unlike APNS.<p>I say all of this as someone who really likes iPhone, and is frustrated that Apple seems to be doing everything possible this year to push me back to Android.<p><i>Just add APNS support to PWAs that have been added to the home screen, Apple!</i> And please don&#x27;t wait another 5 years to do it.')
