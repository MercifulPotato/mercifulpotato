There are many different types when we talk about email:<p>1. Encryption in transit - Yes, indeed unencrypted SMTP is common. SMIME and GPG are not as common as they should be<p>2. Encryption at rest, server side - 99% of providers don&#x27;t do this<p>3. Account security - supporting MFA, u2F etc<p>4. Application security - If there is an official application, does it store saved mail property (ie, not in a big dumb PST file)<p>So yes, somebody could sniff some plaintext SMTP email regardless of your provider, but the other features are very valid and important.')
