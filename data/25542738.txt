Niching down is an advantage to how much you can charge and for finding ideal clients as well.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re thinking more of being a general coding contractor who temporarily joins a coding team? I&#x27;m thinking more of someone who has involvement at the design stage or in a consultant role.')
