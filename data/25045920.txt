In the 1971 Bangladesh independence war, the Pakistani military started conducting a genocide of Bangladeshis. Bangladesh was mostly disarmed, but arms were funneled to it from India. Bangladeshi civilian put up a resistance with the arms they had or could get. That caused large swaths of the Pakistani military to defect.<p>At the end of the day, holding territory is hard. Look at how much trouble Americans have had subduing the Taliban in Afghanistan. The bombs, tanks, planes, etc., are largely useless in holding a city. Now, combine that with the fact that the US military is comprised of citizen soldiers, who would be in the position of fighting against their own communities.<p>It’s when a community is totally disarmed, and when the mere show of military force would force total capitulation without violence, that a citizen military could rationalize aiding tyranny.')
