So I clicked on your comment history.<p>Linux&#x2F;BSD sysadmin. The CNN lite comment. An actual GPG key in your signature!<p>You&#x27;re a real-ass dude.<p>I don&#x27;t work in tech, but when I was a kid my first computer ran FreeBSD, because my uncle who was an Engineer handed me a box of parts, a FreeBSD disc-set, and some satellite tracking software he said I should &quot;never connect to the internet because I copied it from work.&quot; Dude explained to me what Project Echelon was, had an unfolded Mac-10 receiver in his closet, and his proudest moment was when Noam Chomsky emailed him back.<p>Your whole ethos reminds me of him, so please keep being you dude because the world needs it.')
