Getting the right set-up for removing DRM from your uhd&#x2F;hd blu-rays is hard since hardware is constantly being updated (you might have to purchase second-hand blu-ray readers), and downloading them is technically illegal even if you have the physical media - not that the FBI is going to indict you for having a personal media library. I imagine books have the same issues if you&#x27;re trying to get unencrypted digital versions of them.')
