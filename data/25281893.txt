It&#x27;s simply a marketing concept designed to capitalize on the appeal to nature fallacy<p>It&#x27;s not clear what exactly are you referring to with &quot;organic&quot;, as one can refer to both agricaltural products and processed food.<p>At least in relation to processed food, I do read and compare labels, and very often, there are 1. less additives 2. natural additives as opposed to chemical ones 3. less refined ingredients.<p>This alone is a big deal, and just based on this, organic as a whole is definitely healthier.<p>I can&#x27;t talk for processes themselves, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there were higher standards in the food chain (e.g. less freezing time, no freezing at all etc.). As a matter of fact, you&#x27;ll often read that organic is tastier; I personally don&#x27;t find it so, but that could be very well the cause. Again, organic food is preferrable here (I&#x27;m not using &quot;healthier&quot; in a strict sense here).<p>I&#x27;m not based on USA though, which may have looser food standards.')
