I think it&#x27;s just a regular old program with a poorly defined interface. Moreover, I think the claims of idempotence are overblown to the point of near falsehood.<p>Declarative Infrastructure is really just Configuration Management applied to cloud infrastructure rather than operating system software. Neither have really solved anything, other than turning the management of complexity into a Sisyphean task. Forever pushing drifting state back up the hill.<p>Compare this to Immutable Infrastructure, where state never drifts. One never &quot;fixes&quot; a container once deployed, or a package once built and installed. One merely rolls back or upgrades. Any uncertainty is resolved in the build and test process, and in providing both all the dependencies and the execution environment.<p>I think eventually people will wise up to the fact that Terraform is just puppet for infrastructure. I think the real fix is to make the infrastructure less like an operating system and more like versioned packages. Install everything all at once. If anything changes, reinstall everything. Never allow state change.')
