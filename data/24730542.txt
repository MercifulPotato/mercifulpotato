If Apple fails to do this within that time frame, I think that may push it out longer. They&#x27;re already pushing the limits of ARM as a platform with their custom chipsets<p>I think nvidia&#x27;s long term strategy is going to be built around this, among other things, otherwise I believe they overpaid for ARM holdings. They&#x27;ll need to make sure they can expand the market for ARM CPUs to drive ever more GPU sales in the future. They haven&#x27;t been as successful getting their embedded GPUs into the ARM market if I recall correctly')
