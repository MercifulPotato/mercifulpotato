Let me give you an example. (I think it was a video by DÃ¤niken). He takes a ancient egyptian metal-vessel (probaly copper amphore) and then says:&#x27;the amazing thing is, if you just add a little acid and a wire to this amazing device it will act like a battery. So did the egyptians have electricity?&#x27; Or something like that. Of course that will happen, and it will happen to any metal cup, it does not show anything about having the knowledge about electricity of a society, but people who do not know much physics will then lead astray to &#x27;so how do you explain this&#x27;. If they would have found the wire (of a different metal) inside the jar, in some device... ok... but this is like finding a rock of uranium and saying:&#x27;they could have made nuclear power plants from this&#x27;.<p>When I saw they had to go this low, I was pretty sure they have nothing.')
