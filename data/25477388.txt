I wonder if any language that used these techniques would also have to use such a rigorous effect system. It seems so.<p>Their implementation requires annotations on all functions which are effectful (throw exceptions, log to the console, etc). What wasn’t clear to me was whether or not the <i>callers</i> of those functions also need to be annotated, but I presume they do. If so, that’s a pretty tedious limitation. While I like explicitness, changing the signature of a deep, oft-called function (e.g. to add temporary debug logging) requires changing a lot of other code.')
