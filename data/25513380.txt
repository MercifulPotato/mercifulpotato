Item(by='lliamander', descendants=None, kids=[25513817], score=None, time=1608686216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506309, text='&gt; I get the idea that you have not ever studied economics, especially monetary policy<p>That is one hell of a presumption. Did I offend you?<p>&gt; but just like you probably have not studied quantum physics or brain surgery or ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, just know that mankind has put tremendous effort into all of these and has learned some very useful things.<p>This is a complete non-sequitor.  It&#x27;s physics envy and posturing nonsense. The successes of physics and medicine have no bearing on whether mainstream economics is a complete crock.  In the soft sciences like economics, the expert doesn&#x27;t necessarily bring more to the table than the reasonably well-read layman. I&#x27;m not saying there is no value in studying these subjects, but the collective &quot;expert opinion&quot; is not in anyway &quot;science&quot;.<p>Maybe you should study some philosophy?')
