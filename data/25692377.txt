You should counter bad arguments with better arguments.<p>b) There are types of speech, which are proven to lead to violence in the long-run. Also, some things can be proven as untrue. Lies are bad.<p>I have to say, I agree with both of those points. I think group A is missing the point, that there are echo chambers and people radicalizing within their filter-bubbles up to the point of literal terrorism, while group B is missing that the power to censor can be misused by bad actors in the future and  that silenced people will not just change their mind.<p>Is there a proper answer for someone like me? Where should I stand on this? I am leaning towards group A, while acknowledging that radicalization does happen and dearly worrying about perversion of words like &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;fact&quot; (&quot;your&#x2F;my truth&quot;, &quot;alternate facts&quot;).')
