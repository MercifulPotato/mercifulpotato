(Where I talked about my home ceph setup that was another reason why I need fast swap)<p>Yes I build something using a standard x86_64 (celeron) setup. I heavily experimented with an all arm setup thought. I still find it pretty hard to balance a cheap build that is expandable. I recently lost an OSD and my setup had a consistently high load while recovering.<p>I don&#x27;t really like the power consumption of my current setup and am thinking of moving to arm. (I use multiple small HDDs between 1tb and 10tb and have different pools with different redundancys. Am thinking of replacing it with a simple raid or something and 3-4 12tb HDDs with a simple redundancy. Could use minio as s3 replacement and btrfs as fs [I won&#x27;t use zfs for different reasons] btrfs has snapshots, compression and deduplication so everything I want and need. Never did use rbd over network)<p>Edit: This is my home setup I&#x27;m talking about. At work we got a real setup.')
