The rotor on the top is not driven (literally just spins freely on a bearing). Forward motion pushes air through it, which keeps it spinning and that keeps the aircraft up. In effect the rotor acts like a wing (forward motion results in lift), but without the ability to stall.<p>I&#x27;m learning to fly an autogyro in the UK. They&#x27;re great fun to fly, and in theory safer than a plane because the short landing distance means that in event of engine failure you have a much greater selection of places to land (in practice modern safe autogyros have only been around 5-10 years so we don&#x27;t have enough data to compare).')
