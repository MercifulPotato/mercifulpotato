Cutting out the front-of-house, the ambiance, and the wait staff kinda also cuts out a lot of the personality and connection.  Scrolling through a bunch of generic “chicken fettucini alfredo” options on an infinite grid is kinda soulless, and doesn’t give me a sense of what I’m getting for the extra money between the $14 and the $26 versions.')
