Reading doesn&#x27;t make you pronounce things wrong.  Not reading does.  It&#x27;s why so many people on YouTube embarrass themselves by confidently getting certain words hilariously wrong.<p><i>How many American children grew up reading Harry Potter pronouncing Hermione as &quot;Hermi-Own&quot; until the movies came out?</i><p>Is this common?  I can&#x27;t say that I know a lot of children, but the ones I do know had no problem with it.
