Welcome to Italy, my friend. The country that gave the world Leonardo and Galileo and Michelangelo, and the country where these things happen, where a police force has a few Lamborghinis (I was overtaken by one, nearby Rome, ~15 years ago) that regularly travel well above 100mph even if it&#x27;s not necessary, whose cost would cover several &quot;normal&quot; police cars. And a country where sometimes when there is a problem and an &quot;Italian-style&quot; solution, that solution is implemented. Helicopters? Kidneys can stay in ice for several hours? Who cares, the police transported a kidney at 250 km&#x2F;h, and proudly tweeted about it.<p>I&#x27;m Italian; I am fully authorized to make some fun of my own country. But, before you say &quot;absolutely reckless&quot;, you should know that the &quot;autostrada&quot; between Padova and Roma is very well built, and that the policemen driving the Lambo are really good drivers. A bit reckless? Maybe. There&#x27;s worse in the world.')
