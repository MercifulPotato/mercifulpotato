But history is replete with &quot;IT in the large&quot;. Just look at mainframes, quietly ticking away for decades on loads that people are re-discovering how to handle.<p>Partly I blame this on the hubris of the young - &quot;this ain&#x27;t your granddad&#x27;s IT.&quot; Heck, I recognize it in myself from years ago, when I was all in on Linux, but the BSDs had been around a while.<p>But I do believe there is a wanton lack of communication in the industry and academia. Part of this is on purpose - companies don&#x27;t like &quot;giving away&quot; their hard won lessons, nor is it (short term) profitable to pay people to write documentation. But there&#x27;s a bigger culture around &quot;if you don&#x27;t understand, you&#x27;re just not smart enough.&quot; It&#x27;s toxic.<p>We could sorely use something like the group in &quot;Anathem&quot; that does nothing but study history and remind others of it.<p>I wish we could learn the lessons of the past without having to repeat them and adding yet another standard to the fourteen already out there.')
