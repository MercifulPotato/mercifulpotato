I’ve seen too many “make it easier for normal people” projects ruined by trying to appease people that have muscle memory for the old way.<p>Luckily bit doesn’t do anything that would prevent someone from using git on the same repo.  You can co-exist.<p>I’ll make this prediction based on decades of observations:<p>1. There will be many projects like this.<p>2. Eventually one will win out and the others will fade.<p>3. The winner will be the one that focused on a particular audience AND successfully ignored so-called experts that didn’t see the need for such a project.<p>4. After one tool wins out, the nay-sayers start to adopt it.  Forums like HN get flooded with posts about how “I wish I had tried it sooner”.<p>But seriously... if you don’t need this kind of tool do the other 98% of the world develop it in peace.')
