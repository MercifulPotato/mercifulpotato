However; things do not work a lot of the times; my wife is a writer, almost all my friends are non technical and they complain a lot about how crap everything is. And when I check the culprit is always lack of memory and it is always chrome (the browser and in Electron) that is eating all of it. It is miserable imho; techies can pretend the enduser does not care; maybe they should ask.<p>I know how to fix it for myself (I have scripts to do it automatically) but most people do not and just reboot when the system becomes too unresponsive. Not so great for 2020.')
