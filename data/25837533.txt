I have the opposite observation from the OP.<p>My productivity is off the charts this past year. Between cutting out all forms of small talk, commuting, unplanned meetings, and constant bite size updates.. I&#x27;m now finally for the first time totally in control of how I spend my day.<p>I have more time for work and more time for play.
