I&#x27;d rather have my metadata on matrix servers than on FB servers - at least it&#x27;s not connected to my phone number, which is tied to my real identity. Also, matrix doesn&#x27;t upload my entire contact list to Facebook. If it&#x27;s secure enough for the german military and the entire french government, it&#x27;s certainly secure enough for me.')
