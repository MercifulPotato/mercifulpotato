In fact, I think WhastApp is more secure since it does E2E encryption by default.<p>It&#x27;s true that Telegram is about &quot;fun&quot; and not security. I just wasn&#x27;t sure if you tried to imply Telegram is like Signal with a focus on fun as well, or you just meant most people don&#x27;t care about security and would rather have fun chats?')
