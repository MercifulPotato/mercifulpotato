Of your face, I mean, not of the recognition software.<p>At this points these complains are bullshit in my opinion. It shifts the debate about if we want to accept facial recognition to the side. It is like a free gift to those that sell these systems.<p>So if facial recognition is actually bad for minorities, people bringing up these topics should not be their friends. My opinion, I know it is a strong one, but it is also more correct.<p>Is a passport checker even needed for security would be a better discussion topic.')
