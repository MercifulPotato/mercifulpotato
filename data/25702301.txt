Well if you&#x27;ve heard of a language, it&#x27;s likely because it is a language that has proliferated through the community. The worse a language is the more it must have made people money to &#x27;survive&#x27; and proliferate.<p>Think of the worst&#x2F;ugliest languages you can think of (coming to my mind is Visual BASIC, C++, PHP, Javascript). These are languages that made an exceptional amount of money, and this allows them to survive <i>despite</i> being so bad.')
