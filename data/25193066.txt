I do like the idea of &quot;fancy multiplications&quot; because I do think you should understand convolution as well as you understand multiplication.<p>But I still feel like this kinda obscures and confuses the origin of the reversal.*<p>If you don&#x27;t understand the convolution formula instinctively, read this comment enough times till you do.<p>The point is this.<p>-We have a function originBangSound(t) that maps the effect at (t) of an impulse or &quot;bang&quot; coming from the origin (t=0).<p>-We have a function bangWeights(t), which measures the distribution of impulses or &quot;bangs&quot; over time.<p>-The question is: how do we get the total allBangSounds(t)?<p>Simple: We make every point in time the origin, and add all the results together. Let&#x27;s call (tau) the current origin. The size of the bang at <i>this origin</i> is bangWeights(tau). The size of the sound at (t) which is coming <i>from this origin</i> is originBangSound(t- tau), since we care about the position of (t) <i>relative to the current origin</i> (tau). Adding them up leads to an integral in the continuous case.<p><pre><code>  allBangSounds(t) = \\integral bangWeights(tau)*originBangSound(t-tau) d(tau)\n</code></pre>\nThe point is this. Don&#x27;t think of it as a flip. Think of (tau) as defining the origin point for a particular &quot;bang&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s a nice sanity check: if (tau) is larger than (t), (or equivalently, (t-tau)&lt;0) then do you expect to hear its bang? Ofcourse not. The bang hasn&#x27;t happened yet. So unless its bang travels backward in time (which definitely does happen in spatial convolutions!) you ain&#x27;t hearing it.<p>_____________________________<p>*Come to think of it, this is a very useful pun. When you think to yourself &quot;what&#x27;s the origin of the reversal again?&quot;, just remember, the moving the origin is the origin of the reversal.')
