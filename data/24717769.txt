The question comes down to P(winning by switching | monty reveals a goat). The key difference is whether P(mony reveals a goat | you chose a goat door the first time) is 50% or 100% (if you choose the car, there&#x27;s a 100% chance he reveals a goat in either case). Since &#x27;winning by switching&#x27; is the same as &#x27;choosing a goat door first&#x27;, you can apply bayes theorem to see how the results change.<p>To put it another way, if Monty is choosing randomly, half the time where you would win by switching, instead the game just ends&#x2F;isn&#x27;t counted, but the same is not true of the case where you win by not switching. From a bayesian point of view, Monty randomly revealing a goat should increase your belief that you picked the car the first time.<p>That said, switching is not worse than not switching unless Monty is biased towards revealing the car instead.')
