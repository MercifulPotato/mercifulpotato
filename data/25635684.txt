Item(by='ColinWright', descendants=None, kids=[25635906], score=None, time=1609784769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25634192, text='Some feedback from a random internet person, take it with a fistful of salt.<p>Why are there non-functioning arrows next to the names of projects, companies, <i>etc.</i>?<p>Why does it keep randomly re-rendering while I&#x27;m trying to read something?<p>The design is, no doubt to some people, gorgeous, but I&#x27;m finding the landing page example completely unusable.  If it&#x27;s intended to show off capability then it needs to be clear that that&#x27;s the purpose.  If it&#x27;s intended to be usable then it needs to be re-thought.<p>(Later)<p>Ah, when I go to an actual example then the arrow isn&#x27;t functional, but the text on which the arrow is placed, is a link.<p>My reaction ... I don&#x27;t want it to be discoverable, requiring exploration to work out the functionality.  I want it to be immediately obvious, using existing internet norms.  If I visit for the purpose of looking at a CV I don&#x27;t want to have to learn how to use the site, I want to get the information I&#x27;m looking for.')
