A few weeks ago, I wrote a program that provides a SMTP relay, mail storage, and web UI for managing email sequencing. The only dependency that it pulled in was pywin32 so it could run as a windows service; if it ran on a Linux box, there wouldn&#x27;t be a single dependency.<p>Not including integration testing, the whole deal was two days of work. If I had to pull in and evaluate external libraries I would have spent two days just working out the details of which libraries to select.<p>At least for now, I don&#x27;t think anything can replace Python for prototyping an idea.')
