Think about it: the big companies (Morgan Stanley, GS, BofA, Ameritrade) are selling stock to retail customers, and they know for a fact what companies people are selling&#x2F;buying in volume each day, so they can make trades confident that they will make money. Nobody outside this group has direct information about the sell&#x2F;buy levels of each stock, so this is a rigged game for them.')
