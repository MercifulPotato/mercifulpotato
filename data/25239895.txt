Like you I also have questions and would like to hear more. I always find it helpful in grief to just hear what happened. Was it a mechanical malfunction? Was it a lack of fire alarms? Was it arson or murder? Was it suicide? It&#x27;s extremely sad, and only 1&#x2F;1000 deaths in the US are now caused by fire, and am just wondering how it could happen to such a smart, young, generous person.')
