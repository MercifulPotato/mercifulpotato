That&#x27;s never expected to work, and it&#x27;s a pity it doesn&#x27;t just give a simple error &quot;don&#x27;t do that!&quot; rather than sometimes partially working.<p>As you said, you should start a new environment instead and install whatever you like into that. For Python, that means using virtualenv or python -m venv. You can always use the --system-site-packages switch to get the best of both worlds: any apt install python3-foo packages show up in the virtual envioronment, but you can use pip to shadow them with newer versions if you wish.')
