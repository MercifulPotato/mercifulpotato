I quit my very well-paid job 6 months ago to make my side-project my full-time job.<p>It is going quite well (I am nowhere near making the same money). Just 2 of us at the moment. I&#x27;ve learnt so much over this period. Like what you would get over 10 years in a big tech company while jumping over all the hierarchy.<p>Moreover, my very first side project turned me from a guy who knows only Python into a guy who can set up entire architecture on the cloud. Later, I became somewhat a &quot;rockstar&quot;&#x2F;jack-of-all-trades engineer.<p>But I agree, unless you do your side-project just to do something then it is your hobby.<p>My advice would be: someone has to pay for your side project&#x27;s product&#x2F;service. Because only then you can show that it generates real business value. This is the only thing which should matter to your future employer. You generate business value.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newscatcherapi.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newscatcherapi.com&#x2F;</a>')
