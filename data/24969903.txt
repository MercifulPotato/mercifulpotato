They are also susceptible to health crises and family tragedy like everyone else.  All the money in the world can&#x27;t bring back family members or magically solve incurable health issues.  While there must be some bad apples, my experience has led me to believe that it&#x27;s unfair to categorize all wealthy people as uncaring, greedy and selfish.<p>My big takeaway from watching how &#x27;the other side&#x27; lives, is that money is like a magnifying glass of who you really are.  If you&#x27;re genuinely virtuous--for example generous and caring--the wealth allows you to express that.  I&#x27;m sure if you&#x27;re greedy or have an addictive personality, you&#x27;ll be even more destructive to yourself, those around you, and wider society.  I&#x27;m extremely lucky to have the ability to not have to work with people like that.')
