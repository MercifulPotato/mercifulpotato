Mechanical brakes work by converting the kinetic energy of the vehicle into heat via friction, it seems fitting that inductive brakes would dump energy to heat by running current over a resistor. Though under normal braking circumstances I don&#x27;t know what percentage of the vehicle&#x27;s energy is lost to the brakes themselves and what percentage is lost to the friction of the tire with the road.')
