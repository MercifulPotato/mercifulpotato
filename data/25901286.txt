Its lowest layer is called LIC (Licensed Internal Code), and is written in C++. In the beginning, AS&#x2F;400 used a proprietary CISC processor called IMPI (never publicly documented, but its instruction set apparently resembled somewhat that of IBM 370 mainframes, without being compatible with them.) User applications and higher-level OS components were not written in IMPI, but in a virtual machine bytecode called MI. LIC was responsible for translating MI code into IMPI and providing low level OS services. The LIC was written in a secret PL&#x2F;I dialect (IBM has a few of those) called PL&#x2F;MP. As part of the CISC-to-RISC translation, the PL&#x2F;MP code of the LIC was rewritten in C++. The higher levels of the OS, which run inside the MI virtual machine, are written in a variety of languages – C++, PL&#x2F;MI (another secret PL&#x2F;I dialect) and Modula 2.')
