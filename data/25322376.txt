E.g. some drawing may look so:<p><pre><code>    100:100:svg:svg\n    100-100:svg:g &#x2F;* group *&#x2F;\n    100-100:svg:rect\n    100-100:svg:rect\n</code></pre>\nThese elements have no text content, so their extent is 0 and offset is same. Yet they also have hierarchical relationships and you need to store extra data to express those. E.g. in this example you can guess that &#x27;g&#x27; and &#x27;rect&#x27;s are descendants of &#x27;svg&#x27; and the first &#x27;rect&#x27; is a child of the &#x27;g&#x27; but only because you have some preconceived ideas about the meaning of these elements. There&#x27;s not enough data to tell if the second &#x27;rect&#x27; is a part of &#x27;g&#x27; or not. You need to store at least the level in the hierarchy. If you stored the data in a database (i.e. without implied order) you&#x27;d also need the relative position of the element, but here you have the order built-in.')
