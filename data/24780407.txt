They paid the actors for season 4, but never produced season 4. It left with a very unsatisfying ending.<p>Will I ever recommend anyone with Glow on Netflix? no, because I can&#x27;t tell them &quot;Hey, watch this show on Netflix, but it doesn&#x27;t have an ending and likely never will&quot;<p>It&#x27;s similar to how I&#x27;ll never recommend The Kingkiller Chronicles or a Song of Ice and Fire. Because doing so would mean that someone reading those would probably never have an ending.<p>This is where I feel Netflix is hurting themselves. They&#x27;re producing all this content and then never finishing it. Their catalog is going to start looking like a bunch of incomplete shows.<p>I think it&#x27;s fine if you have a show with a short run. One season that finishes properly? Great! Two seasons? Great! but ending before it finishes is just as bad as continuing on forever with no end goal.')
