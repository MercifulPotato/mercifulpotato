We&#x27;re one step away from that now: we already have to write against a strict spec, fit all the rules, and are subject to arbitrary dismissal. They take 30% and leave us the crumbs. The appeals process is unfair. If Apple likes what you&#x27;ve got, they can just clone your app. One step away.<p>We&#x27;re in prison and you&#x27;re rationalizing about your parents.')
