Just an example I found, 230 Atherton Ave, Atherton, CA 94027 vs 234 Atherton Ave, Atherton, CA 94027, both absolute mansions with pools looking at them on google maps and the former even has a tennis court.  Property taxes paid: 8,000 for the former and 200,000 for the latter.  Absolute insanity!')
