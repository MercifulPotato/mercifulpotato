They don&#x27;t want to pay for RHEL licenses in test&#x2F;dev but need a binary compatible version to ensure they can get enterprise support in production should they hit an issue.   Having different drivers&#x2F;kernels&#x2F;libraries is a non-starter.<p>There&#x27;s absolutely no way that Redhat is so blind to their user base that they don&#x27;t know this is happening.  This is  a pure money grab, if they can get even 5% of the users doing what I&#x27;ve seen paying for licenses, it&#x27;s a net-win for them.<p>I&#x27;m 100% onboard with Redhat doing things to make lives difficult for companies like Oracle that are trying to make money off their hard work.  I have no time for user-hostile moves like this, every justification they&#x27;ve given is hollow IMO which is why they&#x27;re still trying to do damage control and persuade the public that it&#x27;s not what it looks like.')
