Item(by='sokoloff', descendants=None, kids=[25156533], score=None, time=1605831075, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25155893, text='Looking back at our timeline, we filed the S-1 about 3.5 months before the first day of trading. (I&#x27;d been there a little over 2 years before that, so well after it was clear we had a legitimate chance, but well before it was clear we could IPO.)<p>I would say that employees who were there right before or shortly after the IPO weren&#x27;t all that different in terms of initial grants. The only difference is that pre-IPO employees could get ISOs which have slightly better tax treatment than NQSOs.<p>I would make the decision based on the work, the pay, and your overall feelings for the space rather than whether you applied 4 weeks ago or 4 weeks after IPO. You already missed the gains before the IPO, but most companies have a lot more gains after the IPO than before it.<p>If you&#x27;re the type to be jealous that you missed on the pre-IPO gains, don&#x27;t go, of course. Those employees who made &quot;millions&quot; in the IPO didn&#x27;t do it because they joined 2 months before you. They probably joined 2+ years before you.')
