If I&#x27;m poor, and I know I&#x27;m poor, but I also think about something other than class when making political decisions (no matter what that &quot;something&quot; is), then I have &quot;false consciousness&quot;.  That is, if I don&#x27;t think about this totally the way Marx says, I&#x27;m stupid.  Nice.<p>If you think about your life that one-dimensionally, you&#x27;re poor in a way that Marxism can&#x27;t fix.')
