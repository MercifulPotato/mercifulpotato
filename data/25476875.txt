I&#x27;d definitely use Spotify more if it had that, maybe significantly more - I can use it for 6 hours on a given day but then I often give it breaks because I&#x27;m on a discovery rut.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s just me, and they know on very certain statistical terms that for most users that&#x27;s not the case and music filter bubbles work much better.<p>Or maybe they&#x27;re completely wrong in their approach and they&#x27;re making a massive mistake at scale. We&#x27;ve come to develop this bias that tech giants &quot;must know what they&#x27;re doing&quot; but I think it&#x27;s often not the case. In ten years we could be reading how a competing service took over by offering the same catalogue with much better recommendation tech or other bells and whistles layered on top.')
