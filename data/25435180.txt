You can write your own Android apps for them[1].<p>Why this isn&#x27;t advertised, promoted, &amp; made available? Why digital cameras seem to want to get their lunch taken by phones? Not sure!<p>I think it was way too soon, but Samsung had a good go with a series of Samsung Galaxy Cameras[2] that were proud Android brandishing devices. Android has gotten better, mobile chips have gotten way better. But even something more like the unofficial OMF that I linked, a Sony camera, that doesn&#x27;t look like an Android system, it looks like a camera, but is really Android and can run Android? That makes hella-sense to me.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ma1co&#x2F;OpenMemories-Framework" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ma1co&#x2F;OpenMemories-Framework</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Samsung_Galaxy_NX" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Samsung_Galaxy_NX</a>')
