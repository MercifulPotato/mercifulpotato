Did you use a template to create it? Is it using some platform for checkout? I would love to know. Also if you can share the process of publishing a book like this end-to-end (writing, publishing, hosting, marketing etc.) it would be an invaluable read. I want to publish a book in my field, but not sure how to go about it. Thanks.')
