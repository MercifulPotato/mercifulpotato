When editing a text document, if you cut some part, it actually goes away. If you saved the document at that point, that selection would be gone.<p>On files, if you cut a file on Windows for example, <i>nothing happens</i>. Until you paste, no operation is done. So it&#x27;s not the same thing, and I think the way Finder handles it makes more sense.')
