Now I see the author makes the comparison to a Lisp program.<p>Also wanted to mention the differentiation of cells in an embryo (how the f*ck can that even work ... not in a lab, but our own bodies?!) - it&#x27;s explained really well in &quot;The Gene&quot; (hormonal gradients in the embryonic fluid). Author also mentions this.<p>Natural selection ... is our DNA some kind of cosmic RAM memory that stores all this information over millions of years?<p>The other day I went to get my hearing checked and the doc explained to me how sound is captured by the ear drum and transferred to the brain through a few bones and along hairs &amp; nerves. It&#x27;s basic high school stuff but if you take a step back and think about how this mechanism makes us perceive the beauty of our favorite sounds (music, hearing our children laugh), how complex it must actually be and that this ... &quot;evolved&quot;, out of a cosmic chemical soup, it&#x27;s just incomprehensible.<p>Biology, genes, brains are nothing short of amazing. I&#x27;m not a religious person but if something points to the existence of a god then you&#x27;ll find it in biology.')
