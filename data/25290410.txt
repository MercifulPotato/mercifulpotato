They never limited themselves to &quot;out for a walk and... social distancing&quot;.<p>I wear a mask outside while walking and social distancing and I&#x27;m not virtue signaling. I simply personally find it harder to futz w&#x2F; a mask when coming up on people or going inside a building.<p>Please be a little less reflexive when it comes to this stuff.
