The spores are already there they just need the right conditions. It will take months to year(s) if you just let it sit.<p>For aerobic composting you should layer leaves and grass clippings. One brown layer, one green layer and so on. It’s best done in a sunny area and you’ll need to turn the compost weekly. It should only take a few months or more and it will be hot. Ever driven by a steaming pile of wood chips or some other steaming earthy pile? Organisms are making heat while they feed on organic matter.<p>Just remember the fungus and organisms are already there they just needs the right conditions to flourish.')
