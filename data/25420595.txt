Women are guaranteed to reproduce, men are not. If you are going to have a son, and you know he&#x27;s not going to be the most handsome guy, don&#x27;t have a son. Otherwise you&#x27;re a trash human being pushing a lifetime of suffering on another human due to no fault of his own. Just your selfish pleasure causing pain to another human.<p>Either be ultra wealthy or be a handsom man with a pretty woman if you want a son who wont be disadvantaged in the modern world.')
