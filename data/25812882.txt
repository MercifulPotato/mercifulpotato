At the simplest level, democracy is a system of government where the people have the authority to choose their governing legislators. I would agree that in its current form in America, the government incentivizes the use of propaganda to get specific policies passed.<p>Instead of coming at an entire form of government, perhaps you could suggest a solution that actually solves some of these issues. Is there a way to require full understanding of a proposition before voting? Is there a way the government can restrict advertising on these topics? And, more importantly, can you suggest a form of government that solves these issues without creating any larger problems of its own?')
