It provides stable, nontradable jobs for a large group of relatively low skill people.  Guards, cops, and corporate vendors to those groups.  It turns out that Microsoft is a good example of that latter category.<p>Managing a patronage system is a particularly potent form of political power.  Patronage systems underwrite most examples of &quot;Machine Politics&quot;, particularly Chicago style Machine Politics.<p>I would personally like to see the word &quot;patronage&quot; return to American political discourse.  It&#x27;s something our ancestors talked a lot about, but we don&#x27;t.<p>Patronage systems brought down the USSR.')
