Usually phones are tuned to deliver an &quot;as close as possible to the result&quot; viewfinder image, while webcams in general do very little or no processing on their side. I might be completely wrong here though, however I do agree with the article. It&#x27;s 2021. If Thunderbolt can provide enough bandwidth to support a full-on GPU, then we can dedicate resources to do correct image processing either on our CPUs or boycott Webcam makers to actually invest some time to finetune and optimize Webcams. As the article states, it&#x27;s better to buy a used iPhone 6 and buy EpocCam by Elgato to use the phone as a cam. At least it&#x27;s actually good as compared to the C920 which has been price gauged to oblivion throughout the world')
