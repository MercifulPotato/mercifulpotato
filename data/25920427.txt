My experience talking to black (one African, one European) coworkers is their reaction is &quot;That&#x27;s the problem you&#x27;re going to fix?&quot;. When the company does a companywide initative to remove &quot;problematic&quot; terms from APIs&#x2F;documentation, but doesn&#x27;t stop funding of politicians who support voter suppression that predominantly affect black people in real practical ways, that bemusement can even turn to offense as they feel placated.<p>Of course, my coworkers don&#x27;t represent all black people, and especially wouldn&#x27;t claim to represent African Americans, but if even black people can hold this opinion, are you surprised others don&#x27;t see this as worth the effort to change?')
