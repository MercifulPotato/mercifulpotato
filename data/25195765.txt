I&#x27;m super amazed at the channels, doccies, channels and cool videos I did discover ! Now a &quot;real F1 score&quot; is not really possible with the size and nature of YouTube ( Recall VS Precision) but still I find 6&#x2F;7 days I get recommended cool stuff 3&#x2F;5 times :) My gf(ok she is now my ex since 2 weeks ago) use to also complain at how bad YouTube algo was for her, but she did enjoy my videos and channels I got recommended.\nThe only difference is I think, was that I spend a lot more time on YouTube then her ?')
