QoQ, YoY, market share, revenue etc.\n3) is the company innovating organically<p>2) and 3) have a fairly big effect on culture. People are busy making shit happen, there&#x27;s enough exciting projects and career advancement opportunities going around. There&#x27;s no risk of downsize (firings) so there&#x27;s less politics it&#x27;s more about how well you produce.<p>At some point the company gets too big. Organic growth slows, reorgs happen culture slides, &quot;A&quot; player&#x27;s leave and it just perpetuates.<p>Once company can no longer sustain the growth shareholders demand organically, the culture and quality of job experience slides. That&#x27;s a good time to bail.')
