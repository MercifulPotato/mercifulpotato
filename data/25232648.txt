So when a senior self taught person without a cert sees any mention of a cert in their domain, they get insecure bc they do not have that cert. That senior thinks - &quot;great, more stuff to learn.&quot; Then that senior vents to anyone, even on hacker news, whining that certs aren&#x27;t necessary and people who have them are somehow less knowledgeable.<p>&gt; I think this is not the type of person I would want to hire for AWS. Itâ€™s kind of like learning AWS for the sake of passing a course.<p>LOL WUT? How about that&#x27;s exactly the type of person you want to hire. And you wonder why the knowledge levels between candidates vary so much and why there is a skills shortage.<p>How about - certifications are a good thing. It&#x27;s a good thing that people with no knowledge have a goal of at least some level knowledge that someone more experienced somewhere decided that the level of which to pass such certification is a generally agreed upon base line.<p>SMH. This attitude needs to change, but I doubt it ever will.<p>Edit - yesssss, here come the downvotes. Keep em coming, boys.')
