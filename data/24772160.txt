The message doesn&#x27;t get recorded if you don&#x27;t speak english. It works fine if you press and hold side button tho (my preferred way to use Siri anyway).<p>I would probably consider Homepod or Homepod mini if they&#x27;ve got batteries and bluetooth. Heck they could&#x27;ve even used MagSafe chargers for them. Now I&#x27;ve got two Soundcore Motion+ that got amazing hifi sound.')
