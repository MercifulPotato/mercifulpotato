A chord arpeggiated as fast as possible? A chord arpeggiated to a specific tempo?<p>When a composer writes (say) a chord with an arpeggiation sign next to it, it specifies that the notes are to be played in a certain order, and quickly. There are multiple possible performances that comply with this &quot;specification&quot;. MIDI cannot encode this information (the information being the set of acceptable performances).')
