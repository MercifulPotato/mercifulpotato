The company wanted to move to a more flexible system where pricing can be setup based on few rules like customer type. For this the ui and backend system needed to be developed. Design I proposed was a single &quot;monolithic&quot; service which did everything including UI and UI was supposed to be a old style mustache templates and some minor jquery. Instead they went with pub-sub systems, 4 different microservices, a react based UI, api which used json-schema, even to send data back to UI. When I left a team of 6-7 people was working full time on this and they were about 20% done.')
