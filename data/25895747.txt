Item(by='croissants', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611520916, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25894304, text='There are a couple of comments about it here, but I think this point in the paper deserves emphasis: they say that &quot;well-being rises with income&quot; in the sense that well-being increases linearly with the <i>logarithm</i> of income past $75,000. The logarithm they use seems to be base 2 in Figure 1, so that means a person making $500k is roughly 17% happier than a person making $75k. 20% isn&#x27;t nothing, but it&#x27;s not much either. Especially since I think a lot of people in tech can get to ~$100k with a lot less effort than ~$500k.')
