Item(by='kibwen', descendants=None, kids=[25128344], score=None, time=1605633946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25125419, text='Voting should be mandatory <i>but</i> the first listed option for every office should be &quot;I approve of no candidate and think none of them should win&quot; (the disaffected vote), and the second listed option should be &quot;I approve of every candidate and don&#x27;t care who wins&quot; (the apathetic vote). With our current system it&#x27;s impossible to tease out how many voters are disaffected vs apathetic vs simply disenfranchised (in the above scheme, those who don&#x27;t make it to the polls at all), which makes it impossible to confirm or deny that any candidate has the mandate of the people.')
