But the idea of free speech has been twisted and warped to mean speech without social or economic consequences and that is where it goes wrong.<p>I doubt you believe that speech should be more criminalized than it already is.  I think most of us agree that having an opinion, no matter how outrageous or evil, should not be a crime.  We agree on exceptions to this for outright threats of violence.<p>The expectation that speech should be free-as-in-beer.  That you are entitled to a platform.  That you should be free of all consequence.  This the problem.<p>Providing privacy and communications produces not subject to control of a central authority isn&#x27;t a bad thing!  But we also shouldn&#x27;t just be mindless cogs in the free speech money machine.')
