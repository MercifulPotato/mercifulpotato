I&#x27;ve been contemplating using Terraform for my org, but I would really like a CI system that generates a plan, lets me review it, and then I can approve it and the plan gets applied. Ideally I think this is how I would like all of my infrastructure to work. (It&#x27;s how I do changes to Kubernetes stuff; generate some resource manifests then apply the files.)')
