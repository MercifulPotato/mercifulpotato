Being acquired by Ken and Roberta was surreal; they were two of my idols from childhood gaming and they were every bit as great to work for (via multiple layers of bosses) as you&#x27;d hope. They were gamers; they cared about people having fun playing games. They were also hard-nosed about their development teams creating product that would achieve that goal. I remember having to answer to Ken in person in a meeting about what my plan was to get my title shipped. He was firm and fair, but he didn&#x27;t like my hand-waving at the schedule and task-breakdown. (He&#x27;d come to visit our studio in general, not to ream me out about shipping late, but he was spot on that I&#x27;d not been diligent enough in my prep and planning. We didnâ€™t call it that, but my burndown chart was not tilted downward.)<p>Every step along the rest of the journey with Sierra was a nightmare for employees. CUC, Cendant, Vivendi, and maybe there was another link in the chain, but I got fed up and quit in spring of 1997. We had incredibly talented and passionate artists (2D and 3D) and along the way a lot of that got shipped out of country to artists who seem to have never seen an American auto race. Several employees sued over shenanigans with our stock options treatment; I didn&#x27;t join in (though perhaps I should have as I think we were getting screwed). IMO, the acquirers just sucked all the fun out of the room and a lot of talented devs and producers left. If you&#x27;re not having fun working in computer gaming, you might as well go not have fun someplace that pays well.<p>Ken and Roberta are two of the good ones in my book.<p>0 - Papyrus Design [IndyCar and NASCAR Racing]')
