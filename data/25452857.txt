You&#x27;re working backwards to make humans like computers&#x2F;interpreters. The fact that human interpretation &#x27;doesn&#x27;t care&#x27; is not so much a feature but a necessity. Ambiguity is inherent to natural languages, not a failure of them, nor a feature. On the other side, programming languages are strict my nature and it is a necessity. In programming we have a limited vocabulary and that limits our expressiveness, which is a feature. We don&#x27;t want probabilistic outcomes for standard means.<p>So let&#x27;s look at the two parts you quotes from me and give some examples. We&#x27;ve conversing quite well, wouldn&#x27;t you say? You understand me and I understand you? So #1 must be true, right? But have you ever played the game telephone[0]. With the general outcome of every game that must mean that #1 cannot be true, yet here we are. Like I said before, when communicating there&#x27;s: what is intended, what is said, and what is heard. Usually these align pretty well. But small fuzzing adds up quite quickly. But it should also illustrate to you that what you hear (or read) isn&#x27;t what the speaker (or writer) intended. Their job is to convey as best as they can to you while your job is to interpret as best as you can. Language being of this form allows us to express wildly abstract concepts, especially ones beyond our capacity to even understand. This is the usefulness of natural languages. But it is also why we created mathematical and programming languages, but why they will never be able to have the same expressiveness. You cannot program what you do not understand. But you <i>must</i> be able to talk about what you do not understand, if you are ever to hope to one day understand it.<p>I&#x27;d encourage you to read both more about linguistics and compilers. If you&#x27;re feeling lazy, Tom Scott has some decent linguistics videos and are aimed at STEM audiences. For more technical maybe see NativLang.
