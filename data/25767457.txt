And they just tested a &quot;silver shiny UFO&quot; which was the prototype for the SR-71. And yes, this was exactly the same date when people first called radio stations and the police for UFO sightings.<p>Assuming Area 51 was just that, you can&#x27;t disregard the whole UFO phenomenon (which has been taken place all over the globe for decades) as &quot;the observers didn&#x27;t know they were looking at an Skunk Works aircraft&quot;. That implies you haven&#x27;t even seen the tip of the iceberg.<p>These reports not only often come from highly trained fighter pilots and engineers, but it also leaves imaging (radar, infrared, etc.) records that show that these things, whatever they are, can move too fast (and too slow) to be any USA&#x2F;China&#x2F;Russia&#x2F;Israel super secret aircraft.')
