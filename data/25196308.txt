He woke up to police in front of his house (called by BMW&#x27;s own alert system), there&#x27;s an atmospheric pressure sensor inside the car and everything.<p>No sign of the thieves, so he booked an appointment to have the window fixed and didn&#x27;t think much of it. But then he realized the side panel (in the door column? the column between the front and rear doors) was tweaked over a bit.<p>The thieves had gone in and cut the cable tree going to the roof of the car, which contains amongst other things the antenna and connection to BMW&#x27;s alert service. Their plan was to come in the one night, disappear, hope the victim didn&#x27;t notice that (and the garage doesn&#x27;t check for it), and come in to steal it for real the next day, or maybe even the same night after the police has gone again.')
