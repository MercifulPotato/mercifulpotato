It&#x27;s not too uncommon with Chinese xianxia&#x2F;xuanhuan novels. We&#x27;re talking thousands of pages. It&#x27;s not as incomprehensible as you might think. I didn&#x27;t find it enjoyable though. I can certainly see a place for automatically translated manga. It&#x27;s not a sellable product though.')
