Wow, this actually works really well!<p>As I write this from my iPhone, this might singlehandedly be the reason why I switch to a Pixel instead of another iPhone this fall. I was always disappointed that even after acquiring Shazam, Siri could never seem to correctly guess what song was playing unless I had a perfect recording.<p>Anytime I go to a live concert venue, or even a club, I never can get a recognizable song from my phone. Live music I could maybe sort of understand, but the club part failing was always weird to me, because besides a little bit of distortion, the song being played is coming directly out of a speaker. It shouldnâ€™t be that hard right?')
