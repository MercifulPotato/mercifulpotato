If you only have power half the day you can charge during that half the day. Most EVs already support time mode charging and price based charging exists in a few.<p>For always needed power we can just over provision and for variable power we can just turn it off if it&#x27;s a particularly calm night.  A surprisingly large amount of electricity use can be adjusted by a few hours.  For example see how car charging locations are now adding batteries to allow them to avoid high demand charges by time shifting loads.')
