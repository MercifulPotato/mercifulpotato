Don&#x27;t always work for me. That&#x27;s the fundamental difference that normal people don&#x27;t get. That rather simple thing is basically the problem.<p>I&#x27;m pretty good at &quot;adulting&quot; and otherwise coping with my life but I hit roadblocks that other people sail by. I can do very complicated, difficult and tedious tasks but sometimes get stuck doing simple things like paying a parking ticket. I know how to do it. I know when it&#x27;s due. I know I&#x27;ll pay a penalty if I pay it late. I think about it all the time. But doing it is like lifting an incredibly heavy weight. Normal people don&#x27;t feel the weight and think I&#x27;m lazy.')
