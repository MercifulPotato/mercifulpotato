Technology and organization allow your impact to scale to superhuman levels. I used the JK Rowling example because it&#x27;s obvious that without her, we would not have the multi-billion dollar franchise that is Harry Potter. Without Harry Potter, there is no guarantee that another franchise would have taken it&#x27;s place.<p>It&#x27;s also not a stretch to suggest that Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates have created over 100 times more value than Rowling. Their roles are more nebulous, but they certainly did something better than their competitors. Microsoft Excel alone possibly has possibly saved trillions of hours productivity.')
