It&#x27;s not obvious at all unless you know where to look. College is the prime example of that. If you pay better you&#x27;ll have more new grads applying and they will prioritize you over other offers (unless you are an exceptionally prestigious employer). But even then, you&#x27;ll never talk to the student who interned twice at FAANG and got a firm offer a year before graduation. You can get that guy only if you are willing to employ him at FAANG salary for two summers.<p>Employing these guys won&#x27;t make my existing hires any better than they are in the immediate future.<p>However<p>Better hires leads to better teams. I find that certain developers have a multiplicative effect that applies to other devs. They mentor, document, review and help everyone grow. That might actually slow them (taking half a day to explain high level architecture to a lowly junior coder) until you realize the junior coder is now capable of answering questions from his teammates.')
