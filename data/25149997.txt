This lead me to buy a higher resolution tablet for reading pdf&#x27;s with tiny math.<p>I also bought a finer point pen and this helped me improve my handwriting <i>a lot</i>.  Closing loops on &quot;o&#x27;s&quot; or backtracing the upward line of a cursive &quot;t&quot; to not make a loop.  With the finer point, I was able to see my imprecision and improve it.<p>I used to rewrite my finished work in undergrad and now my writing was improved to the point where the first draft was entirely legible.')
