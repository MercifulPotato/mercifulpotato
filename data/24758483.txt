Here’s a direct quote on the topic.<p><i>&quot;Younger adult smokers are the only source of replacement smokers. Repeated government studies (Appendix B) have shown that:\nLess than one-third of smokers (31%) start after age 18.\nOnly 5% of smokers start after age 24\nThus, today&#x27;s young adult smoking behavior will largely determine the trend of industry volume over the next several decades. If younger adults turn away from smoking, the industry must decline, just as a population that does not give birth will eventually dwindle. In such an environment, a positive RJR sales trend would require disproportionate share gains and&#x2F;or steep price increases (which could depress volume).&quot;\noriginal quote from the internal documents of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, circa 1985, in the collection of Stanford Research Into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising (note that statistics are out-of-date).</i><p>But thanks for helping me to understand where you’re coming from.')
