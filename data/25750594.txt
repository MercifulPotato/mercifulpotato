It sometimes only becomes evident went you stray into an unfamiliar one.<p>Personally I like some cross-pollination.  It can take me by surprise when I&#x27;m subjecting to the vagaries of the public.<p>People tend to protectively double down, and get very defensive, even over very benign topics.  Some thrive on that friction, some just would rather leave it alone and drift towards those with similarish outlooks.<p>People also have a tendency to believe what they want to believe.<p>I got a load of stick off a friend, because he thought I held a particular political persuasion.  Just because I mildly challenged him.  Well I&#x27;m not even sure as to why he thought the way he did.  He just put me in another box&#x2F;bubble that wasn&#x27;t his, and lashed out at me.  Quite ugly behaviour in my mind.  As soon as he realised we were on the same page on the topic, he vaguely apologised for his outburst.  To me however, I was left thinking, well what if I hadn&#x27;t seen eye to eye.  Nice guy in the main.  Just like racist Grandma.<p>Anyway I think what I&#x27;m trying to say is that I expect differences of opinion.  And can accept them (outwardly at least, up and to a point, maybe..).  I like a bit of healthy discourse.  But the subtleties and lost contexts can be horrible pain points of misunderstanding.  Some just can&#x27;t stand a difference of opinion.')
