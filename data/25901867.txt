This article doesn&#x27;t even touch a point on it.<p>The goal is : In any company there are people who want to have an answer to the question &quot;what comes next on your product?&quot;. Those people can be any of: CSM to prepare a presentation for customers, bored customer who want to talk to CSM, Sales people who want to impress their prospect, Execs to tell the public and investors that things are moving. Do those people care that the roadmap is going to be respected ? Not really.<p>The roadmap is not a product management tool, it is a communication tool. So my advice to PM, you are asked to create a roadmap ? Put all the things in the roadmap that people want to hear, forget about it, and continue working on what you were working on.')
