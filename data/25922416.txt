For neilmed, you might try one of the higher flow crevices temporarily to dislodge stuff: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Multi-Purpose-Saline-Spray-ounces&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B002GU64EI&#x2F;ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Neilmed&amp;qid=1611704367&amp;sr=8-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Multi-Purpose-Saline-Spray-ounces&#x2F;dp&#x2F;...</a><p>For the breathe right, I can tell you my early experience:<p>1. I actually got hypocapnia: pins and needles in arms from excess ventilation. This just showed how unused my body was to proper airflow. My pulse o2 went up a couple percentage points and the hypocapnia went away fairly quickly.<p>2. My nose clogged up a bit temporarily, almost like it wasn’t used to the airflow. This went away. After a couple days<p>3. My nostrils started staying further apart when I didn’t have the strips on. I basically just resisted them collapsing inwards.<p>So you may find after a few days use they lead to some improvements when not wearing them. I use them most when sleeping.<p>You might also consider a sleep study, in case thus blockage has led to apnea or anything similar.<p>Final thing: there is a device called a pulmonica, used to train the lungs. Believe I read reports from some people saying it improved congestion via vibration of the sinuses. I have not tried one extensively, but am currently evaluating. I’d consider my sinus congestion mostly managed now so can’t give feedback there. But as you seem to have a severe case it might be worth tracking down this lead.')
