Item(by='chindtooo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610272402, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25711617, text='Immigration activist here.<p>Nothing in the H1B world is as it appears from outside. There are far deeper problems. Trump admin in particular (in my personal opinion) is driven by a great hatred for Indian and Chinese h1b holders and has been a bit like bull in china shop targeting both groups with various ridiculous and often completely illegal methods.<p>Lottery assignment is based on first come first serve as per the law. I expect this change to be challenged and eventually thrown out by courts. Of course administration does have a case here as they can argue first come first serve is intended only when h1b cap is not met and once it is met, the agency must get deference to use whatever algorithm they chose to use.<p>This sort by salary would sound like a good reform to many. It is not. The so called body shops will run circles around the incompetent people at USCIS who ignore all laws of economics and come up with heavy handed regulations which only further help the scammers and hurt the honest.<p>Nothing prevents My Bodyshop Inc. from filing a petition with unreasonably high salary. Once the h1b petition is approved the employee then quickly changes jobs to My Brother&#x27;s Bodyshop Inc. this time with a reasonable salary. There is nothing USCIS can do here but to approve the petition if the paperwork is in order. Trump administration out of sheer caprice decided to deny job change petitions thus putting thousands and perfectly genuine job changers into jeopardy (not to mention the law does not given them any such authority).<p>If the Evil Bodyshop Inc wants to take bigger risks they do the following. They offer a pretty big salary to the employee to even beat Google and Facebook. But when the employee joins the employee is required to pay back the additional portion of the salary to some one else like a fake university running fake educational courses.<p>The Extra Evil Bodyshop Inc promises they will pay a fat salary but simply does not pay that amount. Since most H1B holders from India will never get their greencards they do not have to worry about the future scrutiny during greencard process. They basically happy to continue on the low salary. After they have made decent money they might even catch a flight back to India. They have made their money.<p>There is only one sensible H1B regulation. Permanently end the program. Let American companies move the job to Canada to India or some other place which is more willing to take in immigrants. That we &quot;these people are taking our jobs&quot; argument will vanish from public discourse. If there are no jobs in the country in first place, there are no jobs to steal.<p>Just offer a EAD to greencard to all H1B holder within 2-3 years so they become free agents and do not have to be bound to their employer. This vastly reduces the paperwork for everyone and allows markets to promote higher wages.')
