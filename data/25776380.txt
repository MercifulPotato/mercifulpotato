For example, for voyage to Mars, launch two Starships, connect them with, say, kilometer tether and make them rotate for artifical gravity. On perpendicular axis to the tether.<p>Cons: you need EVA to move between modules<p>Pros: it&#x27;s simpler, modules can be more easily added&#x2F;removed and coriolis forces aren&#x27;t an issue.')
