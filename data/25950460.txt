So even if the hedge fund&#x27;s audacious bet is horribly wrong, the smart money reacts and profits before the crowd can coordinate their pile on. Hedge funds bet against other hedge funds too.<p>The asymmetry is who <i>loses</i>, and unlike the hedge funds with dreadful risk management, most of the retail traders piling in this week won&#x27;t have mansions and yachts to go back to after their bad bet turns sour.')
