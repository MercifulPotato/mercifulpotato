I ran myself into a case of plantar fasciitis about the beginning of 2019, tried to run through it, and lost about four months of running. I am still surprised that I was stupid enough to do this, having lost some weeks almost forty years ago to trying to run through a twinge in my knee.<p>Now, back in the days when I was a decent recreational runner, there was seldom a race in which I didn&#x27;t wonder, about 2&#x2F;3 of the way through, what in the world had caused me to sign up, and didn&#x27;t think that I really shouldn&#x27;t do this again. I&#x27;m not really sure what learning was involved there--it was mostly I think stubbornness, being determined that I was going to have run part of the race and suffered the discomfort without finishing.')
