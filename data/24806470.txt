That&#x27;s what you want in a professional, top tier code base and that&#x27;s what you get.<p>Unfortunately, once a project grows to many developers, many of whom have varying levels of experience, it&#x27;s just too easy to write bad C++ that becomes impossible to debug. I&#x27;ve been using it for a decade and I swear I barely scratch the surface of its features.<p>Lastly, and this one is the most annoying, C++ also has cryptic error messages that almost always never mean what they suggest. You&#x27;ll learn to understand them over time and decode their meanings, but at first glance you&#x27;ll spend long days hunting for the wrong issue.')
