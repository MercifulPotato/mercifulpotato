This amount is often not enough to fully flesh out an idea or to present something non-incremental. Rather, people tend to chunk up work, called salami publishing.<p>Now, sure doctoral theses also exist but the vast majority of research is presented in about 4-15 pages.<p>But I disagree that after 6 months everything should be integrated into other summary work.<p>Most published research is not worthy of being integrated into other work and 6 months are j√≥t enough to decide. Most papers are forgotten and rightfully so. Publication doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s correct or worthy of eternal remembrance. It just means that a scientist wants to share a finding with the research community. It&#x27;s not established knowledge yet. Only when it is actually adopted and used successfully by the community, will it be part of established shared knowledge. After some years such key ideas do get written into textbooks.')
