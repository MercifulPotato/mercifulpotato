RE &quot;minification&quot;: yes,  - there&#x27;s a minified version (terser) as part of the build and it should also be compatible with closure compiler. RE &quot;performance&quot;, no I haven&#x27;t made any comparisons using benchmarks, if that&#x27;s what you mean. DOM updates are batched together using requestAnimationFrame and the update cycle walks the tree to perform the updates, so that should give you some insight into the trade-offs. RE &quot;better than others at managing live DOM elements&quot;: better in what sense?')
