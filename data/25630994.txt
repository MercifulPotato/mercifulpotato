Everyone in big tech has job mobility, so for someone to care to unionize, they have to <i>not want to leave</i>.<p>So where in other tech companies, unhappy employees leave, at Google they try to &quot;fix&quot; it, which has led to these unionization type efforts, with wider goals around making the company behave.<p>I absolutely think that the fact that many Googlers&#x27; primary social identity is that they&#x27;re a Googler is why this is starting there and not another FAANG.')
