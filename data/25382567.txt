The party distributing drug doses knows &quot;&lt;patient UUID&gt; care of &lt;doctor&#x27;s post office box&gt; is recieving &lt;experimental&#x2F;placebo&gt;&quot;, but doesn&#x27;t know who the patient is and ideally shouldn&#x27;t even know which doctor they&#x27;re mailing it to. The evaluators (plural) each recieve &quot;patient with &lt;age&#x2F;sex&#x2F;preexisting conditions&#x2F;etc&gt; equal to &lt;value&gt; &lt;improved&#x2F;worsened&gt; &lt;a lot&#x2F;a little&#x2F;not detectably&gt;&quot;, with each evaluator bucketing and adding up the data for their particular trait (eg &quot;18-25-year-olds did this well, 25-40-year-olds did this well, etc&quot;). The company that <i>has a obvious conflict of interest</i> (incentive to corrupt the trial results) shouldn&#x27;t be involved at all besides shipping a crate of medication to the dose distributer.<p>In practice things wouldn&#x27;t be <i>quite</i> as strictly compartmentalized as they in principle should be, but if the patients&#x27; personal infomation is ever all present in one place to <i>get</i> &#x27;stolen&#x27;, your healthcare system is so fucked up it&#x27;s not even funny.<p>(Note, preemptively, that I am not claiming that your healthcare system is <i>not</i> so fucked up it&#x27;s not even funny. I&#x27;m making normative claims here, not descriptive ones.)')
