(Edit: and one mammoth 500-comment subthread that I&#x27;ve since split in two.)<p>You have access to both highly qualified people (that read HN and would most likely be glad to help you engineer a system (paid or unpaid) that would not be strained by usage) AND access to money if that was needed to improve things (and pay for a solution).<p>Does HN still run on a server colocated in a data center?<p>Is there a budget that you need to adhere to? YC certainly makes money and can afford to pay for a better setup.<p>A bit embarrassing HN should not run as if if it was operated out of one person&#x27;s basement, budget, or expertise.  (And it&#x27;s not 1996 either it&#x27;s 2021 and HN does not even have anything but text).')
