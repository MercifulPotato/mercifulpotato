I have noticed there is a tendency on HN to treat Scandinavian countries with small homogeneous populations as “the rest of the world”, ignoring other nations out there as well as the diversity of opinions within Scandinavian countries.<p>In my view, the far left - as far as those in the center are concerned - is “progressives” in America (and their equivalents elsewhere): those pushing for equity (equality of outcomes instead of equality of opportunity), those using a victim&#x2F;oppression narrative as a foundation for every political position, those seeking collectivist society&#x2F;policy instead of individualist perspectives, etc. There is room for relativism certainly, but characterizing the GND as the “center” is not just without evidence but in conflict with the reality of political cultures around the world.')
