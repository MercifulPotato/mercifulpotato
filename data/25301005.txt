It had to be done in under 40 bitwise ops, without loops and with constants of up to 8 bits. The naive approach took way too many ops! I was stumped until I found the linked page, in particular &#x27;Counting bits set, in parallel&#x27;[1]. Parallelism at the bit level?! That is when I realized low level programming was completely badass.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graphics.stanford.edu&#x2F;~seander&#x2F;bithacks.html#CountBitsSetParallel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graphics.stanford.edu&#x2F;~seander&#x2F;bithacks.html#CountBi...</a>')
