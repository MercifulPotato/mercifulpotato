It&#x27;s very rare that we can do a nice controlled experiment where only a single variable is changed at a time. I joke that it&#x27;s really a subset of biology, not physics.<p>&gt; probably more useful to focus on instrumental causality<p>I partly agree -- we humans do seem to get by on rudimentary reasoning.  On the other hand, the issue of back-progagation is quite similar to identifying &#x27;root causes.&#x27;  There&#x27;s also an issue of combinatorial explosion of the number of possible sets of variables that interact with each other, coupled with the fact that data becomes exponentially sparse as the dimension of the space grows. The human ability to detect causal relations is really stunning when you realize how tough it is -- I wouldn&#x27;t want to bet that we can reproduce it by trial and error. Evolution had plenty of time to get it right, but we don&#x27;t.')
