It has a struct, which is kinda like a class without methods? It has a trait, which is kinda like an interface but with implementations for methods? It has ... implementations... which kinda make a struct to a class, but not really.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to hate here, but these are all things that need to be understood in some kind of way.')
