You are either vegetarian, or you are not. You are either vegan, or you are not. Whereas you simply aren&#x27;t, depending on how far you stretch the definition. If it comes to giving up and alienating people for being imperfect, I believe that is harmful. Hence I applaud reducetarianism. Either way, however far you take it, the direct connection between eating meat and animal suffering is easier and easier for an individual to work around. Because society is getting more and more vegetarian and vegan friendly.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Speciesism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Speciesism</a>')
