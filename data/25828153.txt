In order to make sure the dots don&#x27;t intersect with each other simply spread them out appropriately. In order to make sure the rings don&#x27;t intersect each other make some of them slightly bigger, or stretch them a bit.<p>The resulting orbits are still, approximately, great circles on the same sphere - just perturbed a bit.')
