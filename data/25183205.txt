I&#x27;ve also seen several comments talking about designing in black and white first and then adding colour. A lot of this feels similar to painting. When learning to paint you first learn to paint in black and white to understand values (lightness&#x2F;darkness) and contrast. This is not directly related but there&#x27;s a great video on painting that shows how the colour picker&#x27;s values can be deceiving in showing the true brightness&#x2F;contrast of colours. If anyone&#x27;s interested in how colours truly relate to brightness this video is definitely worth a watch -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gJ2HOj22gDo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gJ2HOj22gDo</a>')
