The resulting actions could be as simple as posting a Slack message or as complex as running a suite of integration tests or initializing data.<p>Here are some examples:\nNotifications: post to a slack channel when a deployment starts completed.\nTriggering processes: kick off a test suite once a deployment has been completed.\nAudit; record a new environment being created in an inventory system.\nCleanup; remove references to a deleted environment in an external monitoring system.')
