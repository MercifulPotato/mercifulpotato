Item(by='Sniffnoy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608846606, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25516343, text='I&#x27;m a bit doubtful of Wright&#x27;s claim here that people only think zero is neither even nor odd only because they&#x27;ve been told so.  I think a lot of people just don&#x27;t like edge cases and want to exclude them.  Now zero isn&#x27;t <i>really</i> an edge case for parity, but someone who&#x27;s not too used to thinking about zero might just consider it as an edge case generally (possibly even thinking of it as only sort of a number -- remember, people took a long time to accept zero as a number!), especially if they&#x27;re thinking more in terms of whole numbers than in terms of integers.<p>Hell, I&#x27;ve noticed that even a number of mathematicians will exclude zero or the empty set (or other such trivial objects) from definitions even when there is no reason to, even when there&#x27;s no edge case there.  Sometimes zero or the empty set really is an edge case an acts differently, but most of the time it doesn&#x27;t, and yet a number of mathematicians will exclude it anyway just because, IDK, they never really got comfortable worthing with the empty set, I guess.')
