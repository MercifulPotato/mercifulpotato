Roughly 1 in every 25 developer I worked with told me they wouldn&#x27;t do silly arbitrary technical interviews and that if the company wanted them to they would decline the interview.<p>I respected that decision but it none of those engineers every got hired by companies I was working with. They all had jobs already so clearly that was fine with them but it seems like there needs to be a better alternative.<p>One developer would ask what the role entailed, then find a relevant job&#x2F;project that showed he had done similar work. That was helpful but obviously only works if you have a longer career with many projects to pull from.')
