Now,\n  when a business gains public attention for reports\n  of racist conduct, such as using racist language\n  or symbols, Yelp will place a new Business Accused\n  of Racist Behavior Alert on their Yelp page to\n  inform users, along with a link to a news article\n  where they can learn more about the incident.</code></pre>')
