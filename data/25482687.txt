I still cry that we don&#x27;t have the equivalent of that 25 years later.<p>Then AltaVista got caught in the great DEC &quot;hostile giveaway&quot;.  Which left Google sitting in the right place with nobody to really compete against them.<p>One problem was that AltaVista was early--it basically predated common people using the web--and so it wasn&#x27;t quite so clear how you monetized it.  DEC effectively ran it as a goodwill &quot;free service&quot; to the internet.  Even in 1999, on-line commerce wasn&#x27;t very big.  Remember, the big AOL&#x2F;Time-Warner merger was in 2000.<p>The one thing that Google got right was <i>timing</i>.  Google was in the right place when everybody switched from services like AOL to basically just accessing the web directly.  And this let them put ads in the search which could be used for monetization.')
