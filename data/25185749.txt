He told me they were having (hopefully tongue-in-cheek) discussions about being able to work for Google and Facebook at the same time, now that everyone&#x27;s WFH anyway.<p>Which got me thinking, why should an employer care as long as the worker is providing more value than what you&#x27;re paying them? And if the employer can&#x27;t <i>tell</i> if that&#x27;s the case, surely that&#x27;s a problem in any case? What&#x27;s the difference if the extra time is spent on another job or watching Netflix?<p>I&#x27;m not saying the two are equivalent. But what I am saying is that employers measuring what&#x27;s worth it to them by hours&#x2F;exclusivity doesn&#x27;t make much sense. Either it&#x27;s worth it or it isn&#x27;t.<p>So, does anyone think that the WFH revolution is going to lead to a change in how employers value work? And that if the results are ok, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with working at Google and Facebook at the same time?')
