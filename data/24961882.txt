Also, the discovery phase itself can be flexible on time allotted and billed in time increments, even if the main project won&#x27;t be. You might well not know up-front whether you need a day, a week or a month to pin down the spec and all the other details, so a self-contained &quot;getting to know you&quot; phase before anyone makes big commitments has a lot of upsides for all parties.<p>Also, regarding the problem of vague requirements and differing interpretations, getting a complete set of acceptance tests agreed early-on has a lot of upsides for both parties too.')
