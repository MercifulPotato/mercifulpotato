Each individual comes with a distinct set of biases. Social collective action is the contextual weighted average of those individual biases. This results in quite resilient societies: at equilibrium individual biases balance each other across the population, small changes in a relatively small number of individual preferences result in societal course corrections, avoiding dangerous shocks. Smooth ride.<p>A subtle AI risk is simply the centralization of the decision making process. This leads to the reinforcement of some subset of biases, until they completely overshadow alternative options. The system becomes rigid, having lost its day-to-day individual level feedback, thus its capacity to adapt to new circumstances. Sooner or later, it will fail.<p>See also &#x27;too big to fail&#x27; and &#x27;central planning&#x27;.')
