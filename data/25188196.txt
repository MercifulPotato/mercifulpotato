Instead, they sorta wrangled web technology to sorta work. I don&#x27;t understand why the performance is so bad on the PS4 of all things, given how it&#x27;s a pretty decently specced machine.<p>They, and many other companies, should really look at the iPhone&#x27;s early success - a BIG factor there was native code, meaning they could run on a single core machine for years while Android was struggling to push device specs up just to get their UI to feel performant.<p>And Apple&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t even optimal; they used objective-c which adds some overhead with every single function call (simplified: &#x27;can I call this method on this object? Yes? Then call the method on the function call&#x27;. Only fixed with Whole Module Optimization in Swift iirc).<p>But it made such a huge advantage in terms of performance and battery life, Apple was easily five years ahead of any competition.')
