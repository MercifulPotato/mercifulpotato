PoS offers much, much stronger security than PoW while being about 4000x cheaper to run and sustainably decentralized. Sharding (along with rollups) allows for a truly global scale platform - over 100k TPS, potentially 1M, while still running on normal computers in people&#x27;s homes. PoS is a requirement for sharding, as dividing security under PoW would make each shard too easy to attack.<p>Last but not least, full eth2 turns eth into a positive yield asset, a share in ethereum (real income depends on fees paid by users - ethereum already dominates).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptofees.info&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptofees.info&#x2F;</a><p>To not overhype, the current launch is really an incentivized testnet only for PoS itself - real ethereum still runs on PoW as it was. It&#x27;s important because it shows that after long delays eth2 is finally starting to happen, and because consensus itself is like a car that can drive without transporting anything or anyone - not very useful at the moment, but changes required to make it useful are relatively small compared to building the car from the ground up.')
