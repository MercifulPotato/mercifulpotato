It might hear that some nodes are &quot;more productive&quot;, but that is illegible and unauditable from the system&#x27;s point of view. In light of this, I see no reason why employees shouldn&#x27;t conform to the metrics; yes, some &quot;true productivity&quot; is sacrificed, but that is the price of legibility. That has always been the price of legibility, whether you&#x27;re a state or a company or a community. For large organizations, that is a price they often choose to pay.')
