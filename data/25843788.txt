More and more abandonware, and more and more cheap&#x2F;freemium clones and garbage - noise to signal ratio is much lower than on say Linux. From a dev perspective, unlike a decade ago, now there&#x27;s very little room to make any significant money just by building and selling simple desktop apps as indy dev. Now you need a SaaS, or some freemium upsell scam and a lot more marketing skills, plus Apple takes their share of every possible income channel you have and gives very little in return. That&#x27;s at least my experience.')
