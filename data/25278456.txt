In most (but not all) US cities fast, reliable broadband is easy to come by. Obviously you can find one-off complaints here and there from people who have exceptions, but the general situation isn&#x27;t as dire as the edge cases.<p>&gt; I have a 350mb&#x2F;15mb connection for Â£50($66)<p>For comparison, I have 1000Mbps for about the same price in a medium sized US city. I have friends in other US cities who pay more than you for less bandwidth, though. It just depends on the location.<p>&gt; In the UK...<p>The challenge with the USA is that we have a lot of land, some of which is very sparsely populated. We have 10 different states that each have more land area than the entire UK. For example, Texas is almost 3 times the size of the UK, but has half the population. It&#x27;s a challenge to get high speed infrastructure everywhere, and another challenge to keep it updated every decade as speeds advance.<p>That&#x27;s where Starlink shines: The sparsely populated areas where running high speed infrastructure to everyone is prohibitively expensive.')
