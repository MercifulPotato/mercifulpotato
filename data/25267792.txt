That&#x27;s an ideal use case for on-demand AWS Macs, and I&#x27;ll probably transition to that if the Mac Mini in the corner ever decides not to boot or not to accept a mandatory OS update when I have to use it someday.<p>Also, I&#x27;m more likely to transition to this because I&#x27;m familiar with AWS, I didn&#x27;t know MacStadium existed before this thread.<p>If that&#x27;s their target market (and not someone who wants a scalable Mac build farm available 24&#x2F;7 and doesn&#x27;t care about costs), then it makes sense - I pay a lot less than the price of a Mini to rent it 4 days a year, if Amazon can find 90 other people who want to do the same, all of us are better off.')
