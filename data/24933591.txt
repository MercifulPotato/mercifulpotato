The proper way to publish this is to describe the evidence, and the reasons as to why the evidence may be falsified, and do continual reporting as the story develops to keep the public informed how likely or not the information is false.<p>The alternative of suppressing it based upon supposition and a &quot;gut check&quot; says very, very clearly: we don&#x27;t trust the public to make up their minds, or, worse, we think this might be true but it would run counter to our interests if people knew about it. Saying something like this is &quot;misinformation by the Russians&quot; when it is not denied nor has evidence been presented as such is what we used to call &quot;believing in conspiracy theories.&quot; Sometimes conspiracy theories are true, and the facts prove them. But journalists shouldn&#x27;t make publishing decisions based upon conspiracy theories without evidence supporting those theories.<p>In any case, both of those behaviors run counter to the principles of journalism, which is predicated on the idea that preferring to <i>share</i> imperfect information, accurately described, is ultimately what leads to an informed citizenry, even if some of that information turns out to be misleading or wrong in the end.')
