They are legal so why wouldn&#x27;t you pay less tax?<p>If you hate large companies not paying their share, encourage government to <i>do their fucking job</i> and legislate in order to prevent companies from cheating the fed out of billions.  Ironically, (as much as I hate the guy) Trump is the only president in recent history who&#x27;s made clever moves to target Amazon.  Unfortunately, companies lobby to have their tax cheating ignored by congress and government at large.<p>This is glaringly obvious, when Biden criticizes trump and rich americans for &quot;cheating&quot; on taxes where his returns clearly show he uses similar - sometimes identical means of dodging taxes.')
