This seems pretty obvious if you&#x27;re familiar with the structure of international trade – but many businesses don&#x27;t have expertise in this area.<p>One of the major goals of the EU is the reduction of this red tape, but the UK government spent a lot of time making a political argument about how everything would still be fine. Businesses obviously had to work with that advice. Now that the barriers are there and real, it&#x27;s been a bit of a shock. This is particularly true for sectors like food products, which now require health and biosecurity checks (which are expensive!).<p>One of approaches to compensate for this to some extent is to ship products in bulk to distribution centres or similar facilities within the EU – this reduces the per-shipment overhead. But obviously this means you move staff and investment to the EU, and the UK loses out on employment and tax revenue.<p>The whole thing means it just becomes much less attractive to import from, and export to, the EU. That translates in the long term to a dark on the UK economy. Baffling as an economic decision, but politics seems to defy practicality in the UK these days.')
