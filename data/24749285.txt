For example Britain&#x27;s offshore wind farms are scored as 11g&#x2F;kWh. Sweden&#x27;s nuclear reactors, 12g&#x2F;kWh. In some sense a wind turbine or a nuclear fission plant do not actually &quot;emit&quot; CO2 in operation, they aren&#x27;t burning carbon - but you need a bunch of concrete construction and mining to have these generators, and it&#x27;s at a scale where we mustn&#x27;t forget it. Another reason for showing a number is that if you don&#x27;t, some pro-fossil fuel person is going to say &quot;Ah, but what about...&quot; and so it&#x27;s all baked in, same way you can find numbers for &quot;carbon emissions&quot; from ground source electric heat pumps. Unlike a gas boiler to heat things obviously the electric heat pump does not in fact &quot;emit&quot; carbon directly, but nevertheless for comparison we can estimate what the overall emissions are for one versus the other (mostly to show that yup, heat pumps are a good idea).')
