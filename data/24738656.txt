Essentially, a super basic scene graph. on every tick in my update call, i would update something about a specific entity in that collection (maybe position, transform etc). And then in my draw call I would render the entire updated collection. Just getting a specific entity from the list was a huge issue and then updating it and putting it back was worse. I gave up after a many days of trying something as basic as this. In JS, Nim, Crystal etc. this would have taken me a couple of lines of code.<p>Here I ended up reading bid docs on something called Lens and was never able to apply it correctly.\nhere is the repo i was working on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rishavs&#x2F;coral&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Engine.fs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rishavs&#x2F;coral&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Engine.fs</a>')
