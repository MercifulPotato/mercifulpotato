Robinhood outsources their order execution to Citadel, which handles more than just Robinhood trades.<p>Or actually, &quot;outsources&quot; is a misnomer because Citadel pays them for the orders, so they can make money front-running them. That&#x27;s why Robinhood trades are &quot;free&quot; for their retail users. You don&#x27;t pay a fee but you get a slightly worse price.<p>Citadel also, fwiw, just loaned $2.5B to a fund with a lot of short exposure to GME.')
