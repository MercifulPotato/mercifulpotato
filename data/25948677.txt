For example, if you pick an XML format you can add new attributes and tags, if you pick a Protobuf format you can add new fields. “Extensible” sounds like it can be a real mess but there are effective strategies to minimize the mess.<p>There are also various chunked formats like AIFC (AIFF) and PNG which can be extended by defining new chunk types, without needing to change versioning. AIFC includes the APPL&#x2F;stoc chunk and PNG has various mechanisms.<p>There are a few problems with versioning file formats. One is that you often end up with &#x27;if (version &gt; 3)&#x27; scattered across your code base or other nonsense. Another problem is that it is easy to accidentally mark the wrong version, either a version which is too low (because you wrote something to the file and forgot to make your encoder bump the version properly) or a version which is too high (because you didn’t bother to use the minimum version your data requires).')
