Remember the first time you learned binary code?&quot;<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;<p>&quot;You were forming pathways in your brain. Deep structures. Your nerves grow new connections as you use them - the axons split and pushed their way between the dividing glial cells - your bioware self-modifies - the software becomes a part of the hardware. So now you&#x27;re vulnerable - all hackers are vulnerable - to a nam-shub. We have to look out for each other.&quot;<p>&quot;What&#x27;s a nam-shub? Why am I vulnerable to it?&quot;<p>&quot;Just don&#x27;t stare into any bitmaps...&quot;')
