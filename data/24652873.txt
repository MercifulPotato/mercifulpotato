This ends up costing the company money due to poor booking. Finding good flights and other travel arrangements is an additional job duty, and usually other job duties take precedence.<p>But if there&#x27;s a possibility of a traveler benefitting from the booking, they&#x27;ll do so more promptly, be willing to spend time outside of work looking at flights, and try to find reasonably priced flights to avoid this perk being taken away from them.<p>This is my observation from travelling within a small company, it probably does not hold for larger companies.')
