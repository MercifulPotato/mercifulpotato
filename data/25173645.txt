Here’s their list of preserved Flash animations: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bluemaxima.org&#x2F;flashpoint&#x2F;datahub&#x2F;Animation_Master_List#Flash" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bluemaxima.org&#x2F;flashpoint&#x2F;datahub&#x2F;Animation_Master_L...</a>.<p>I’m surprised that so few people in these comments seem aware of Flashpoint, and that the linked article only mentions Flashpoint briefly at the end.<p>I expect Flashpoint to always have a bigger archive of SWFs than the Internet Archive. This is because the Internet Archive seems to be aiming to only host SWFs that can be compiled for web using Ruffle, while Flashpoint accepts any SWF that can be played by the official Flash Player. Flashpoint can do that because it targets users who are willing to install its archive-browsing software for Windows, which includes a version of Flash Player.')
