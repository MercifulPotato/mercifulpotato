Nice, collectible, lesser used ICE vehicles will go up in value, for collectors that can still afford to operate and own them. It&#x27;ll be a wealthier person&#x27;s hobby. For everyone else they&#x27;ll have very little value and most of the market will become far more burden than it&#x27;s worth (because there will be increasing environmental costs associated with operating them, selling&#x2F;buying them, registering them, and disposing of them).')
