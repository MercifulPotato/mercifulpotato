If the base data set has that many very-short-lived containers, it&#x27;s probably not representative of containerized persistent services. How many services get CD updates every 10 seconds?<p>Indeed, the original Sysdig report that the chart comes from makes this case:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sysdig.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;sysdig-2019-container-usage-report&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sysdig.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;sysdig-2019-container-usage-report&#x2F;</a><p>&quot;Many containers need to only live long enough to execute a function and then terminate when it’s complete. Seconds may seem short, but for some processes, it’s all that is required. We believe the increased use of Kubernetes Jobs that run finite tasks like batch jobs contributed to this growth. In fact, we expect short lifespans to increase, especially on serverless platforms that are well-suited to running short term tasks.&quot;')
