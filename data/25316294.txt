The common excuse is &quot;America isn&#x27;t built that way&quot; but .. well it was at one time, less than 100 years ago. We use to have more streetcars and passenger rail than EU does now!<p>I didn&#x27;t address the technical merits, but we&#x27;ve already seen leaked Google training data on here (that was really bad training data because it seemed to use automated&#x2F;AI to build the training data and put boxes around a lot of things it shouldn&#x27;t have ... can&#x27;t find the link to that now), we know about Uber&#x27;s engineers screwing up royally and killing a cyclist, we know about Tesla&#x27;s autopilot getting people killed ... which shows even using sensors as safety features may make people less attentive to the road.<p>It&#x27;s a hard problem space. Personally when I get really old and can&#x27;t drive anymore, I&#x27;d prefer to live some place where I could still walk to cycle or take a train everywhere I really need to. I trust that stuff more than us finding the magic bullet to self-driving AI.<p>And I think what we can get from this article: good self driving AI requires advanced general purpose AI. And once you have that, good luck getting something that intelligent to drive you car. I imagine Marvin from Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide, &quot;The most advanced robot in the galaxy asked to do the most menial tasks ... fix the engine Marvin. Fly the ship Marvin. Go buy groceries Marvin ... I think you ought to know I&#x27;m feeling very depressed.&quot;')
