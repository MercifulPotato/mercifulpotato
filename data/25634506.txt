We&#x27;re all individuals and have different goals, wear different clothes, read different books, code in different editors, whatever, but objectively we all have something in common by way of being workers in the first place: we rely on wage labor to live.<p>And crucially: we don&#x27;t own the means of production (or we&#x27;d be owners and not workers).<p>Why should &quot;that guy&quot; have a voice? Because our fortunes rise and fall together.<p>Frankly it boggles my mind to no end that tech workers, just because they&#x27;re contingently pretty comfortable while riding the wave of an advantageous labor market that gives them a lot of (contingent) leverage at the moment, don&#x27;t understand that they (as single, individual people\n!) aren&#x27;t standing as equals against like Alphabet, Inc. an institution that brings in double digit billions per year, increasingly has its hands on levers of policy and culture around the world, etc.')
