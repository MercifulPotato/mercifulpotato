Good for e.g. Numpy arrays, but can it provide these massive speedups with custom classes? Arrays of strings? Sets?\nProbably not, since both Julia and Numba relies on inferring the data types of all objects, and on them being stored efficiently in memory. The Julia type system allows easy type inference, and all custom structs are stored efficiently in memory. In Python, neither of those are true.')
