It is just ideological cover for wealth transfer from productive economy to landlords (by focusing on &#x27;living wage&#x27; based on market housing costs and not on &#x27;affordable rents&#x27; based on market wages).<p>Man, this is painfully true. Until California can decide between housing being affordable and housing being an asset that is guaranteed to increase in value 10% every year (which is what we&#x27;ve decided for the moment) every increase in wages is just going to be an additional subsidy for the top 1%.')
