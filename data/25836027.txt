Their 10nm was supposed to enter volume production in mid 2018, and they still haven&#x27;t truly entered volume production today. Additionally Intel announced in July 2020 that their 7nm is delayed by at least a year which means they figured out their node delay problem.<p>Knowing something happened is not the same as knowing &quot;why&quot; it happened. That&#x27;s the point of my comment. We don&#x27;t know why they were not able to achieve volume production on 10 nm earlier.')
