Where I live, there&#x27;s a bunch of flavors to pick from. There are buy&#x2F;sell groups. There are giveaway groups. There are &quot;curb pickup&quot; groups. There are hybrid &quot;curb pickup&quot;&#x2F;&quot;spotted&quot; groups, usually named &quot;Uwaga, Å›mieciarka jedzie - $location&quot; (&quot;Attention, the garbage truck is coming&quot;), where people put both stuff they want to give away and interesting stuff they&#x27;ve spotted someone else throwing away.<p>On the food front, there are freegan groups. Interesting place to look if you want to see the degree of food waste happening daily. When I saw some photos just how much perfectly good, high-quality foodstuffs people can find in dumpsters by grocery stores, my jaw fell to the floor. We&#x27;re talking &quot;feed a family of 4 for a week from one garbage-spelunking trip&quot; levels.<p>Further on the food front, I was happy to discover public food fridges are becoming popular in Poland. We have one ~5 minutes from where we live, so now whenever we miscalculate our cooking and end up with a bunch of food that we don&#x27;t feel like eating, or some ingredients that we&#x27;re sure we won&#x27;t make use of before they expire, we just pack them, label with date and list of ingredients, and put them in the public fridge. Less food thrown away, somebody gets a meal for free, and it&#x27;s much less awkward for everyone involved.')
