Right now I have a solution that involves patching, but presuming that my ultimate goal is just that one concessions, just have a flag buried somewhere that would enable type-ahead instead of search, how do you suggest I get that done?<p>I think that would go a long way towards demonstrating that gnome can be reasoned with, is worth even approaching or talking to.<p>Could we hire a developer? Set up crowdfunding? Can someone give me a quote and I can see what resources I can bring to bear on the problem?<p>I&#x27;d be open to other suggestions on how to channel that energy productively, but I really think if they can&#x27;t compromise on that one feature that&#x27;s important to a bunch of people then they&#x27;re probably not going to be worth dealing with.
