It leads to more skepticism by mainstream entities when Coinbase is their only experience into the cryptocurrency market. I echo the other comments here that they need to figure out their stability issues prior to their IPO. There&#x27;s no way they can go public with such a poorly run platform. And I say all of this as someone that is an active user of Coinbase.')
