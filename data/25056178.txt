I run a &quot;mom and pop&quot; business with my wife, and taking advantage of state of the art marketing technology through eBay, Amazon, Facebook etc. is dead simple and at least semi-affordable.<p>As the technology becomes more advanced, I don&#x27;t see any reason why these massive companies would conspire to deny small businesses access to it.\nSure, companies with in-house AI developers will have an advantage, but if it reaches the stage where this is make-or-break, small businesses failing will be the least of society&#x27;s problems.')
