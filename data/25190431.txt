Is he a VC now? If you want a term that refers to all investors we already have one - it&#x27;s &quot;startup investors&quot;.<p>VCs are mercenaries - they invest someone else&#x27;s money and they are responsible to return the money in 10 years <i>or bust</i>. They take board seats, they try to drive when things get tough, they try to push companies to the breaking point because 10 years are fast approaching.<p>This sets them apart from FFFs or Angels, for example. Or even from Investment Bankers.')
