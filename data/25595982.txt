Because of this, all the international community hears about&#x2F;from Turkey is that the sky is falling due to Erdogan... It takes a keen reader to realize that these same English speaking Turks have been screaming about the sky falling for the past 17 years...<p>Full disclosure: I support Erdogan and I readily compare him to other &quot;so-called&quot; dictators like Orban in Hungary. I highlight &quot;so-called&quot; because these &quot;dictators&quot; routinely win their elections and are otherwise constrained by rival political factions. For example: Erdogan&#x27;s recent shift to an aggressive foreign policy is not due to the swinging moods of a dictator, but his alliance with a smaller far-right parliamentary party whose votes he needs to keep his ruling coalition.<p>Turkish democracy is weak, it always has been. Prior to Erdogan Turkish democracy wasn&#x27;t Norway. It was more like Egypt. As imperfect as it is now, I can only think of Israel as having a more functional system in our region.')
