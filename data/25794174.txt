Item(by='lcall', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610735067, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25791358, text='For switching around quickly among multiple xterm instances that I keep running, all the time, and searching history. I used to heavily use konsole but found that switching to xterm + tmux was lighter-weight (fewer extras to install), fast, and very flexible. It took a while to get everything set up the way my muscle memory wanted, but after time working through the manual pages and a few web searches (over time) I&#x27;m very happy.<p>I use customized keys for navigating easily around many tmux windows where I like the low overhead so it doesn&#x27;t break my train of thought).<p>And with tmux panes: it&#x27;s great occasionally to be able to send the same keystrokes simultaneously to all panes, like to multiple remote hosts). Something like a similar konsole feature, or a variant of pdsh+dshbak.<p>That and fvwm (also customized) make it so I can get where I want between tasks or apps with the fewest keystrokes I&#x27;ve found so far.<p>Edit: that plus that tmux allows scripting, such as to set things up for me automatically after rebooting, in ways that I&#x27;m not sure how I would do with shell scripts -- it has added another sphere of automation that I didn&#x27;t have before -- maybe similar to what one could get with the expect language -- like simple automation inside both shells and apps running in them.  Plus more features it has that I haven&#x27;t tried yet.  It is really rich.<p>Another possible benefit from tmux is that it is originally developed as part of, and included in OpenBSD&#x27;s base distribution, so it hopefully gets the kind of attention and high standards for quality and security as the rest of that OS (like OpenSSH in that regard).  (This is not to criticize the other products in this space -- they may be excellent also.)')
