Please don&#x27;t.<p>This person really did encourage his 600k+ subscribers to spam the PRs in no uncertain words. He explained how developers with swag clothing and brand stickers look cool and get respect. He told people &quot;it won&#x27;t improve you much as a developer. But hey, free t-shirt swag, and there&#x27;s a well defined path to get it. I request every one of my followers to make 20 spam PRs so at least 4 sit for more than a week&quot;.<p>I guess this was bound to happen since hacktoberfest and similar programs have become so popular. Part of me is sad that some influencer is so careless and rallied 20 something enthusiastic kids to do this and adding another bad incident Indians will be remembered for.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m college student (graduating in about 8 months) and I&#x27;ll highlight that there&#x27;s a very massive guidance problem here. Enthusiastic students have no one to mentored and direct them and it makes them act on lot of bad advice. In my college, sophomores teach freshmen about Google&#x27;s Summer of Code, open source and events like hacktoberfest. These endeavours are headed by the one or two guys  among the students who happen to get into GSoC&#x2F;ICPC or (in majority of the cases) have a good competitive coding profile. When everyone involved is a beginner, you get unintended outcomes. It&#x27;s just so much of a convoluted mess, that even the capable students distance themselves from it (convoluted, as in these capable folks are outnumbered by the enthusiastic kids, who, despite their best intentions shouldn&#x27;t be guiding others right now. And the one club head is a former part of these guys who really hasn&#x27;t improved in the 2 years after that). Much of this bad guidance contributes to that statistics you see on how &quot;90% of Indian coders are unqualified&quot;<p>Edit 2: (just dropping my reply down the thread from) Someone mentioned that I shouldn&#x27;t drag other Indians into this. I guess that was bad judgement on my part as it doesn&#x27;t really matter here, I apologise it I came off as disrespectful to fellow South Asian demographic, that wasn&#x27;t my intention, I just wanted to bring attention to an underlying issue. We have a lot of bad rep for filling sites like Quora and Medium with loads of low effort content, sending unsolicited messages on LinkedIn and AngelList, and in general bad etiquette in messaging others over the internet. Much of this can be attributed to us having 1&#x2F;6 of world&#x27;s population (more if you just count English speaking populace), but that doesn&#x27;t excuse people&#x27;s bad behaviour. I personally believe that there&#x27;s a need to teach people on how to conduct written communication and how to behave in casual to semi-formal settings in the internet.')
