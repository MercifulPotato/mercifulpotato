I was in the maths group for the write-offs when I was 14&#x2F;15, and thanks to almost entirely my own reading I am now studying theoretical physics and writing compilers (amongst other things you tend to see on HN, that kind of stuff). That would still be possible without the internet but there&#x27;s no way I could&#x27;ve done it almost entirely of my own volition (i.e. online resources)<p>In my case I&#x27;m not particularly intelligent (My IQ is probably about 110ish) but my ego drives to learn ever more difficult looking things, that and the having the attention span of a child (I&#x27;ve recently noticed I can barely read aloud without stumbling). Having the internet available to do that on my own terms is why I know anything at all today, I really don&#x27;t do well being sat in a classroom.<p>I still do the usual gaming and the like, but I really don&#x27;t buy that you can force people to learn if their hearts not in it (maybe my parents were too laissez-faire, who knows - if all goes to plan I&#x27;ll be the first in the family to have a degree worth the paper it&#x27;s written on).<p>My best friend had that kind of very-structured upbringing and I could just feel that I could run rings around him because I&#x27;d got to the same place (We ended up at the same University) the long way round - even though we&#x27;re basically made of the same stock mentally.<p>That&#x27;s my ode to the internet, anyway.')
