I can try to root around for sources if you&#x27;re curious, but I&#x27;m also curious where you&#x27;re getting the impression of &quot;vast majority.&quot;<p>&gt; Antibiotics are fungible.<p>Not really. Definitely not in the same way that food is fungible. I assume you&#x27;re talking about generics here? But generics again actually make up a startlingly small minority of healthcare expenditure costs despite making up the majority of prescriptions IIRC (again I&#x27;m going off memory but I think it was something like 75% of medication expenditures are due to medicines with no allowed generic alternatives).<p>Basically the places that you&#x27;re suggesting the free market should best apply to are already the smallest slices of the healthcare expenditure pie (and also already quite effective in that limited domain).')
