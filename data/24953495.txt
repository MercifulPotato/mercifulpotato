A personal anecdote; I used to think about what would be my legacy as software developer? Anything that I write would be obsolete in few years. Nothing I wrote back then remained working. This thought was depressing me.<p>Then I realized that what I&#x27;m actually creating and maintaining is not code. It&#x27;s the mindset behind the code, and the skillset to convert ideas to working pieces of software. My legacy would be to learn through experimenting, and to help others learn the same.')
