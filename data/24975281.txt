There&#x27;s nothing more real about plugging in usb devices or dragging around files on a system file browser, it&#x27;s just what seems normal to you.<p>It would be just like telling kids in the early nineties &quot;this GUI stuff is great and all, but the real way to interact with computers is the command line&quot;. Or even longer ago, telling kids &quot;this terminal is nice and all, but the real way to use computers is punch cards&quot;.<p>I also don&#x27;t think the idea that ChromeOS is too locked down to be a real learning environment for kids really holds up. If anything, it&#x27;s <i>too</i> open. There are billions of websites out there, and thousands or however many that might be excellent learning resources or sandboxes for kids, it can just be hard to know about them&#x2F;find them all. But the abstractions are just shifting around, there are plenty of full development environments on the web where you can program and host entire apps. Or you can tinker with IFTTT or Zapier to connect different hosted services and hack them to do different things you make up. There&#x27;s still a lot of room for creatively using technology, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t sweat pushing kids onto &quot;regular&quot; computers instead of chrome books or tablets (beyond just a basic introduction to broaden their horizons and let them at least understand that this other paradigm exists).')
