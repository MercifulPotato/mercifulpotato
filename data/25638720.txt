Been at MSFT for 7 years, been on 5 different teams, and switched between PM and Dev a few times. It&#x27;s been great from a quality of life perspective, I think. I&#x27;ve got a lot of experience I wouldn&#x27;t have had if I stayed on the same team and work has stayed pretty interesting. I&#x27;ve also got a pretty large network of folks I know, which is helpful for a variety of reasons.<p>Biggest downside is economic; can&#x27;t negotiate new pay when changing teams by policy and you&#x27;ve gotta build a new case for promos&#x2F;etc. People who have changed companies 2-3 times are likely making significantly more money than I am. I try to keep it in mind that I&#x27;m paying for quality of life by staying, so I need to get my money&#x27;s worth or it&#x27;s not worth it.')
