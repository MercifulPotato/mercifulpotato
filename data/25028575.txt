Whether you <i>as user</i> consider that essential, or what your opinion is on what qualifies as &quot;cost effective&quot; is entirely irrelevant. Will the site work without an analytics cookie, and an optimizely cookie, and a cloudfront cookie, etc. ? Sure. But if a business decides they need a service that needs cookies set to work properly, as long as no PII is involved, that is not GDPR&#x27;s concern in the slightest.')
