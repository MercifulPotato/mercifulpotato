Whether they are &quot;colored&quot; (ie. can you wait on a future in a non-future context), or based on threads or cooperative concurrency (ie. async) etc. is entirely an implementation detail, with significantly differing trade-offs.<p>In that sense, you can really only compare future <i>implementations</i> with other concurrency systems.')
