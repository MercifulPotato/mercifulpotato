Experienced programmers know that JS is an awful language. But there’s also a tooling or SDK “blub problem”. For example, compare npm and webpack vs gradle and javac (not to defend the Java ecosystem, but it does get some things right, or more right than others).<p>More idiosyncratically, there’s this historical arc of encountering fundamental problems, and trying to solve them within the current constraints of the web, rather than perhaps waiting for the web to standardise and evolve. This seems to be a mixture of lack of experience outside of this ecosystem (a bit like Blub) and, for this and other reasons, fixing problems “in your app” that should be fixed in the fundamental infrastructure of the web. It feels like technical solutions to social problems or, to use another metaphor, we are patching downstream what should be fixed upstream... if you build a house on sand, it will never be robust, no matter how many layers of infrastructure you add. That’s where the complexity arises.<p>It’s an enlightening exercise to step back and ask how you would build SPA infrastructure if starting anew. You certainly wouldn’t use a language like JS, you certainly would want to provide visual design tools as far as possible, APIs would be replaced with standard protocols, and probably you’d use a relatively small XML for layout. So perhaps only the HTML is anything like what you’d use. There’d be no transpilation, no webpack, no polyfills, no CSS, no JS.<p>In fact, what you’d end up with would look remarkably similar to the dev process for a Java applet!')
