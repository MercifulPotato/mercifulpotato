Item(by='diggan', descendants=None, kids=[25127430], score=None, time=1605631967, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25125423, text='&gt; If your laptop isn&#x27;t very bright ... buy a brighter laptop ... and a portable monitor that is brighter<p>As someone who works with my laptop outside in the sun a lot, the trick is not to have a brighter laptop but to have one with a matte display instead of glossy, and use bright backgrounds for everything. Even when I&#x27;m in direct sunlight, matte display and light themes make me able to see my code without any squinting or troubles.<p>&gt; The refresh rate on e-ink is so low that coding on one would probably be excruciating<p>If you&#x27;ve edited files in vim over a spotty SSH connection and wasn&#x27;t phased too much by it, you could probably survive the e-ink refresh rate as well.')
