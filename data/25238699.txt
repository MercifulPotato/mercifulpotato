Maybe a bit of a hyperbole, but not far from the truth.&quot;<p>This is just silly.  5 hours of intensely focused, silent, eyes-glued-to-monitor-and-keyboard work beats the conventional 8 hours of work involving socializing&#x2F;chatting with coworkers over the cubicle, making phone calls, checking in on people, walking around an office, taking breaks, etc., which itself seems to lead to approximately the same 5 hours of actual work... just with much less intense focus (intense focus which is mentally draining).<p>To quantify work output merely by time fails to appreciate the much more important factor involved in work: efficiency.<p>Working 5 hours, intensely, is draining.  This author is silly for failing to realize that there&#x27;s a reason Google engineers are allowed to work 11am-4pm: because they&#x27;re competent, efficient, responsible, and probably don&#x27;t waste much time (otherwise I don&#x27;t see how they&#x27;d be employed there-- one of the most sought after &amp; selective employers in the world)')
