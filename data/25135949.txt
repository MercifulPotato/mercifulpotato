So it could be a net win for Apple in the end.<p>But I&#x27;m also thinking about the lackluster state of the Mac App Store, which is getting more important now with M1 Macs running iOS apps but also all platforms supporting Catalyst apps. Apple could use some momentum for it&#x27;s larger screen devices (tablets and PC&#x27;s) and a lower App Store cut together with a larger audience for your products could help new developers enter the ecosystem or to help developers that turned their backs on the App Store to return.<p>But all in all the main reason is probably the battle with Epic. It really helps to thin out the choir of complainers when all of the smaller developers stop supporting or at least stop being interested in Epic&#x27;s cause.')
