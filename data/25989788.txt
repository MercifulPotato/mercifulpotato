I&#x27;m looking for a flexible, experienced full-stack developer to maintain my set of 4-5 personal projects while I continue to work on my startup. Most of these projects are low traffic and only need a bug fix or small new feature, but there&#x27;s also one with complex JS and a significant following. I&#x27;m paying for this work personally.<p>Looking for someone with 5+ years of experience with Python&#x2F;Django and JS, with some TS experience as well; able to think independently and make good code architecture decisions; and ideally able to make not-terrible UX decisions, but that&#x27;s not a requirement. As I&#x27;m working on a startup full-time, you must occasionally be willing to explore possible solutions on your own and present synthesized options when there&#x27;s uncertainty.<p>In return, I&#x27;m willing to pay a high market hourly rate, and you can have total flexibility over how many hours per week you work. Want to take a few weeks off? Sure! From my perspective, the engagement will still be a net win over the zero hours I&#x27;m able to put in. Want to work 30 hours a week for several months? Also great! One of the projects has an arbitrarily long roadmap.<p>Please email bitrot@gmail.com if you&#x27;re at all curious and let&#x27;s chat.')
