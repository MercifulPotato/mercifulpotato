Jupyter Notebook has &quot;restart &amp; run all&quot; button. It&#x27;s no different from keeping a REPL open all day. If you don&#x27;t restart your REPL before re-running your program, you have at least as much of a hidden state problem as any notebook. And don&#x27;t get me started on spreadsheets.<p>Composability... eh. You can run a Python notebook from the command line just like a Python source file. You can even run one notebook from another, or &quot;compile&quot; the notebook to Python source and import from it. But that somewhat of an &quot;off-label&quot; use to me. The idea is not to be a general-purpose literate programming tool, although it turns out to be pretty close to one.<p>It&#x27;s a notebook, like a lab notebook. You do stuff and take notes on that stuff, and it keeps the results of what you did + your notes all together in one file that can be rendered to HTML or PDF. That&#x27;s fucking fantastic IMO. Once you&#x27;re at the point where you&#x27;re trying to compose a lot of notebooks you should strongly consider opening an IDE and developing a project-local library instead. Or at least using some kind of task runner &#x2F; data flow engine thing.<p>I hate to be the &quot;no true Scotsman&quot; guy about notebooks, but all of this anti-notebook invective just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Go ahead and write all you want about how notebooks are not an IDE replacement - that&#x27;s fine, and nobody (at least nobody that I respect) ever claimed they were.')
