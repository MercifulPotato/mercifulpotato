When I recorded the piano I hadn&#x27;t built the tetris machine yet so I didn&#x27;t have the proximity-test library part. Now it would be so easy to test if there is a hole or not (or a bump) in a block working as a sheet as it moves down. And now that scripts have editing powers, I can see how I could add a block to where the &quot;cursor&quot; is when I&#x27;m recording the song.')
