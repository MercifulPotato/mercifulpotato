Let&#x27;s say you need a short segment of DNA to randomly pop into existence, capable of nothing but self-replication. What are the odds?<p>Here&#x27;s my best analogy: If you take one mole of &quot;random&quot; Rubik&#x27;s Cubes (the number of molecules in a glass of water), then search for &#x27;Solved&#x27; ones you&#x27;ll find 512 <i>are</i> magically solved, merely by the power of large numbers. The ways molecules can &#x27;snap together&#x27; are similarly &#x27;finite&#x27;, just like a puzzle.<p>Now think how many glasses of water are on earth. A replicating molecule would have existed probably on the FIRST DAY earth had cooled enough to form water.<p>If we knew what the shortest sequence if DNA is that can replicate, we&#x27;d be able to mathematically state the probability of it existing in any &#x27;random&#x27; length of DNA of that length as 1&#x2F;(4^N) where N is DNA length (number of AT&#x2F;GC pairs).')
