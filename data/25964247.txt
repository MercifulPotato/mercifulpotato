RH was still <i>wrong</i>, but the fundamental problems were those mechanisms that allowed lack of collateral to discriminatorily disadvantaged on class of investors in favor of others. I doubt that was the <i>deliberate</i> intent when these mechanisms arose, but it sure is the result, and needs to be fixed.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced on the theory of efficient markets &amp; allocation of capital. WSB making decisions knowingly contrary to the underlying finances of a company sort of undermines that theory. Those theories pretty much rely on people making, mostly, fundamentally, <i>financial</i> decisions, even if they&#x27;re wrong or poorly informed. WSB was making more a philosophical decision (along with some pile on FOMO, sure) and that method of decision making is definitely not covered by the theory of efficient markets.<p>Though I suppose the GME incident, with the peripheral stocks like AMC, could be viewed as the first round of an iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. It was a &quot;defection&quot; that worked this time. But, if the institutions impacted and those watching are left to respond on their own instead of through artificial protection, they might very well come up with strategies that would thwart the philosophical decision making of WSB in this situation.')
