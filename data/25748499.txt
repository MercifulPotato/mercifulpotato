When users deleted their posts, the site failed to remove the content and instead only added a delete flag to it. Oh, and each post carried a numerical ID that was incremented from the ID of the most recently published one.<p>There&#x27;s really nothing wrong with any of that, unless you&#x27;re specifically coding to defend against content scraping.  I mean, the whole point of a &quot;tweet&quot; or whatever they&#x27;re called in Parler land is to be public and discoverable.<p>&gt; failure to scrub geolocations from images and videos posted online<p>Worse, but again, was the site even supposed to be designed with anonymity in mind?')
