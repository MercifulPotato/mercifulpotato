It wasn&#x27;t to UTF-16 though. In fact, you should just assume that text variables are encoded in Unicode points and not care whether it is UTF-16 or UTF-8 (and on Unix-like systems, it is definitely represented to UTF-8). If you are converting it into binary, at least you <i>know</i> what encoding is it: no &quot;Oh no my Python code was broken on Windows&#x2F;Unix&quot; because even Py2 has already the UTF-16&#x2F;UTF-8 OS split.')
