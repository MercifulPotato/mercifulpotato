I&#x27;m still without children, and over the years I made my own little &quot;cave&quot; from where I can work, although my flat isn&#x27;t exactly huge.<p>Some colleagues are not so lucky. Multiple young children, small flats, day-to-day logistics complications, significant others that are essential workers (as my wife, who is working extra shifts since this pandemonium started, and I don&#x27;t have an idea what would I do if we had a child) or could not work from home... And same goes for business partners or clients. I don&#x27;t even dare scrutinize them about what they are going through these days. Some of their loved ones may be impacted, or they are having a hard time by themselves, the least they need is me judging them because they have a needy kid.<p>I remember a couple of years ago I had an interview with a job candidate, online because some other circumstances (FYI he was hired and is a great chap). He was pretty anxious, I can hear and see that, and in the middle of the interview his six-month baby started crying. We could hear the wife trying to calm the baby down and seen him sweating peas. My senior colleague did the best thing at that moment, basically aborting the interview discussion altogether and started talking about children and parenting and so on. We offered the guy to take a break, but the baby calmed down soon enough, so we continued. I remember the relief I&#x27;ve seen when he realized we understand him and that we&#x27;re on the same page. He became much more relaxed in the rest of the interview.')
