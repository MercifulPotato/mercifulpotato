Item(by='ivan_gammel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605477278, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25104383, text='&gt; Will you ever do that in real life? Seriously, why would someone change something from an int to an array...<p>This happens quite often, when one-to-one relationship is replaced with one-to-many. In this specific example it could be an integer identifier of an object. If you need a real life example, think of an item in online shop, which had a category assigned and you now want to assign multiple categories.<p>On a side note, nothing I said justifies the use of properties. Refactoring is heavily automated today and users of an API undergoing such a dramatic change would have to review all uses of this value anyway. Having broken build would guarantee that this happens.')
