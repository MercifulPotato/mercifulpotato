What i dont understand is the &quot;security&quot; logic given by fuchsia. How is Linux less secure ? I dont think anyone starting a new kernel now can guarantee its security to be superior to Linux, because Linux had 25 yrs of evolution to where it is now. That logic is pure garbage, the real reason probably is NIH. And if Google ever actually hopes to compete with iOS technologically it better choose a superior stack and fuchsia is far from it.')
