The British and French did not have the resources towards the end of WW1 to win, and that&#x27;s one reason they failed to occupy Germany, leading to WW2.<p>- in WW2, the US built about half the arms for both Britain and Russia. The US even designed and built many factories for Russia, which is not well-known.<p>- Pakistan does not have a stable government. They were unable to address the rise of the Taliban for fear their own low-level government and military members would defect from  the official leadership if they did. Trusting Pakistan with nuclear technology is foolish with a shaky government.<p>- Iran is a regional industrial power, as capable as N. Korea. They build their own tanks and fighter clones, and have the capability to build nuclear weapons - unlike any other country in the region.<p>- Mao didn&#x27;t care about not being acknowledged by the US - he cared about ruling the world from an ideological perspective. He even asked Russia at least twice to jointly declare war on the US, but Russia laughed him off.<p>China and Russia to this day are not close because of a 7-month war fought in 1969, and the current threats by Xi to reclaim territory from Russia.<p>There&#x27;s a weird attitude in the West that China is some big panda, but the CCP has no problem starting wars.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sino-Soviet_border_conflict" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sino-Soviet_border_conflict</a><p>- China has the world&#x27;s largest navy. That is a sign of global ambitions, not self-defense. Japan did a similar thing pre-WW2. The US has a large nuclear arsenal because most of the Western-aligned nations, including an ungrateful Europe, are under our defense umbrella. (Because of the CCP&#x27;s ambitions, Japan will likely have to go nuclear shortly.)<p>You really don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about. Some advice for Europeans: if you want to feel proud, do something to be proud of. Being ingrates to the US and cowering in fear of Germany for the past century is nothing to be proud of, which is historical fact.<p>You can start by paying for your own self-defense, which means increasing spending from 1.5% of GDP to 2.0 to 3.0%. Until then, stop pretending you&#x27;re superior in any way to the US - your opinions simply don&#x27;t count without the means to back them up.<p>&gt; Other countries do things out of their own self interest, not out of some desire to attack America.<p>The history of warfare is not about starting wars out of a logical calculus, but primarily a leader with ideological or emotional goals. The US is currently the main target because they&#x27;re also the most capable (and only superpower) to stop a usurper like the CCP.')
