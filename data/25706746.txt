Item(by='no-s', descendants=None, kids=[25707378], score=None, time=1610238356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25704079, text='&gt;&gt;All of what you wrote is bullshit.<p>&gt;&gt;Claims made without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.<p>Technically, mediabiasfactcheck used no actual evidence to dispute the veracity of &quot;here is the evidence&quot;, only an assertion of &quot;bias&quot; against the sources. The Brennan Center report only asserts that other claims of evidence are false, not the ones in link I posted. Also it&#x27;s rife with other tedious rhetorical fallacy. I can&#x27;t see how you can make the leap without support. In fact, your arguments and the way you present your arguments seem to impeach the honesty of your claim.<p>(edit, since OP is apparently assuming I am a concern troll because my point was not clear to OP)\nPerhaps you have a polite and actually specific refutation  to &quot;here is the evidence&quot;? Your comments seem deliberately demeaning and do not appear to have any actual substance.')
