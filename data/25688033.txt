We saw that they did remove the 1:1 peg briefly when Crypto Capital in Panama (?) froze a few hundred million of their USD.<p>Tether&#x27;s page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wallet.tether.to&#x2F;transparency" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wallet.tether.to&#x2F;transparency</a>) claims $23.6 billion in total assets. Despite their claims to transparency, I see no report of what those assets are, how risky those assets are, or any audit that assets they even own those assets. Their front page has a big link saying &quot;Proof of funds&quot;, which leads to an audit published 2Â½ years ago, claiming only $2.5 billion in cash in two bank accounts with unnamed banks.<p>For a company that claims to be &quot;always fully transparent,&quot; that is shockingly opaque.')
