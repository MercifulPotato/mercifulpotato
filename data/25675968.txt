Zuckerberg took the opportunity to quiet those concerns, saying WhatsApp would continue to operate independently from Facebook.<p>&gt;“We are absolutely not going to change plans around WhatsApp and the way it uses user data. WhatsApp is going to operate completely autonomously,” Zuckerberg said. “They might use people and infrastructure to grow, but the vision is to keep the service exactly the same. They do not keep the content you send, and we’re not going to change that.”')
