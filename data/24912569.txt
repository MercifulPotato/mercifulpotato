If you do a sandboxed build with nix, you will get a specific version of inkscape with a specific hash, which includes will include any inkscape extensions you include. And since the build will only be able to read files in the sandbox, none of the problems you list above can happen -- you can&#x27;t pull random stuff from the network either.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.wiki&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nix#Sandboxing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.wiki&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nix#Sandboxing</a>')
