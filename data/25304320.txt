Part of why things are difficult is because perfect, mechanical solutions aren&#x27;t feasible. If they were, the problem would be solveable, commoditized and something else would be difficult instead.<p>This article does a good job presenting difficulties, and they are all important areas where doing a good job is important.<p>Eg <i>&quot;Or the category thing - yes, it has circular references which breaks the nice theory behind it, but what practical issues to the readers or editors does this present?</i>&quot;<p>There probably isn&#x27;t a good, legible solution that will &quot;fix&quot; this. It&#x27;s an epistemological problem about knowledge itself. Wikipedia&#x27;s approach is an approach. It isn&#x27;t perfect because there are no perfect solutions to knowledge problems. It is however, a workable approach given the problem space.<p>None of these need 100% solutions. They just need workable solutions.')
