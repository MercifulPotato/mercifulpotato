But (used much like Latin), they don&#x27;t speak to any human beings except those that have the leisure and capacity to learn all that math ... and then to acquire a voluminous mental store of evidence to apply it to. Real truth is plain.<p>Newton&#x27;s equations are approachable, closer to human experience and comprehension. Feynman&#x27;s diagrams, perhaps a step in the right direction.<p>True? Science is not math; it has no proofs. A &#x27;theory&#x27; is the expression of a model that&#x27;s stood the test of time - but one piece of evidence can force it to be re-built. Science forces us to search for and adapt to the new. Feynman said, &quot;When someone says ‘science teaches such and such’, he is using the word incorrectly. Science doesn’t teach it; experience teaches it.&quot;')
