Our success rate was ~1% and we thought we could do better.<p>We created a JS embed that you install in your web app. It allows you to segment your users and place a call with them from within your app (using webrtc). Unlike email&#x2F;calendly&#x2F;zoom square dance, Smidge has a 17-20% success rate to call. It&#x27;s been huge for us and we&#x27;re now opening to beta. Would love feedback<p>(Screensharing, &quot;request a call&quot; and page&#x2F;user calling coming soon!)')
