Yes, obviously there is politics in the military (e.g. making rank at the cost of your men and&#x2F;or duty) just as there are people looking to make a paycheck. From the ones I&#x27;ve met and heard stories about the majority are hard working honorable people who truly believe in doing the right thing. It seems kind of horrible and short sighted to make such a broad all encompassing statement that doesn&#x27;t take into account the possibility that there are honorable, hard working individuals that have given their life to an idea they think is greater than themselves.')
