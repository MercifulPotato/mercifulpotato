This information comes in handy during debugging. If your code is trying to access a field on `undefined`, then you may well have a typo. If your code is trying to access a field on `null`, then you&#x27;ve simply made some wrong assumptions about your inputs. The next steps for those two scenarios are quite different!<p>Arguing that all `null`s should be replaced with `undefined`s in JS code also kind of implies to me that JSON should replace the `null` keyword with `undefined`, which just sounds crazy to me. Why <i>store</i> &quot;undefined&quot; values in serialized data? If it&#x27;s not defined, don&#x27;t define it... `null` allows you to convey that &quot;this value may exist, but currently doesn&#x27;t&quot;.')
