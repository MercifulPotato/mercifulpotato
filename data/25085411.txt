I also don&#x27;t understand why you are ignoring &quot;sexual mores&quot; or even what that specifically means.  Does that include every increase in personal freedom related to gender and sexuality?  It would be weird to ignore those because they are obviously the biggest increases in freedom over the last 50 years since many of the biggest changes of the civil rights movement occurred just outside that window.<p>If you do want to ignore all those issue, I will point out that freedom of speech is more prominent today than it was 50 years ago.  After repeal of the fairness doctrine, the loosening of obscenity laws, and various court cases including Citizens United most recently, free speech rights might be at an all time high in the US.<p>Also there are examples of freedom being lost and regained in gun ownership.  The assault weapons ban in the US that lasted 10 years is one that comes to mind.')
