Even for sites that are trying to play ball, there are multiple CDNs so everyone has to agree which one is the standard. Plus everyone has to be using the same version of each resource, but in practice most js tools release so often that there will always be many different versions out in the wild.<p>On top of that a lot of the modern frontend tools and best practices are pushing in the other direction. Out of the box, tools like webpack will bundle up all your dependecies with your app code. The lack of JS namespacing and desire to avoid globals (which is pretty well-intentioned, and generally good advice) means that your linter complains when you just drop in a script tag to pull a library from a cdn instead of using an es6 import and letting your bundler handle it. Typescript won&#x27;t work out of the box I don&#x27;t think. Your integration tests will fail if the cdn is down or you have a network hiccup, as opposed to serving files locally in your test suite. And on and on. This is just anecdotal, but I haven&#x27;t seen most teams I&#x27;ve worked with value the idea of centrally-hosted JS enough to work around all these obstacles.')
