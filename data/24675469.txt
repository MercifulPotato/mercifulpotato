Why then have China and India not always led the way as super powers in the first place?</i><p>Yes. Who said they hadn&#x27;t?<p>For the biggest part of history, until Europe got forward after kickstarting the industrial revolution (along with the help of colonization and the exploiting of the New World), China was the #1 economy worldwide, and quite more advanced in many ways than the rest of the world.<p>E.g. in the Song dynasty (900-1200 A.D): &quot;These [policies] made China a global leader, leading some historians to call this an &quot;early modern&quot; economy many centuries before Western Europe made its breakthrough&quot;.<p>1500 A.D.: In 1500, China was the largest economy in the world, followed closely by India, both with estimated GDP&#x27;s of approximately $100 billion. France was a distant third at approximately 18 billion, followed closely by Italy and Germany.
