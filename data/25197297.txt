If that tool is a linear fit, or heck even adding a few columns in a spreadsheet, it&#x27;s my job to realise that and choose appropriately. If it&#x27;s a complex custom-built NN, then as long as the cost-benefit analysis justifies the build time, I&#x27;ll choose that.<p>Of course, as you mention, there&#x27;s always the business-political aspects - of explaining or justifying your choice to people who don&#x27;t understand any of those tools, and who often want to pretend that they&#x27;re part of a &quot;smart data-driven AI&quot; company.')
