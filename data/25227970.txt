In the file I group topics &#x2F; questions based on what makes sense for that project, and at the top of the file I often have a &#x27;topic&#x27; where I can quickly dump thoughts, that then later have to be refactored into one of the real topics.<p>I hope to one day find a way (and the time) to connect my ideas app with the repo txt file approach, so I can sync both.<p>Conceptually I think the hard part of most problems is figuring out the real important questions you want to ask yourself. Once you think you know them, then the answer is either obvious, or requires you to do something (research, build prototype, etc).<p>[1] Idea Growr app - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.juliushuijnk.tools.ideagrowr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.juliushuij...</a><p>[2] Concepts app - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;concepts.app&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;concepts.app&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a>')
