Right now not using either of those requires a whole lot of work. It&#x27;s actually pretty hard to use GTK apps with only the GTK toolkit and not a bunch of other software daemons. Hell, in a perfect would I&#x27;d even get rid of dconf and gnome&#x27;s weird registry, but I recognize that as pretty integral to the toolkit.')
