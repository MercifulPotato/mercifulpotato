For a string value, the !tag syntax occurs <i>before</i> the opening quotation mark&#x2F;heredoc marker of the string. It’s like a Java annotation.<p>This isn’t a YAML tag; it’s just YAML embedding some opaque text from some random command-language that uses exclamation marks to mean something.<p>In fact, actually considering the meaning of the action, the ! used here probably <i>is</i> just the regular ol’ boolean NOT operator in most languages: the action has specified that it should trigger only for commits that <i>aren’t</i> tagged as WIPs. (Which is an eminently-sensible condition to provide.)')
