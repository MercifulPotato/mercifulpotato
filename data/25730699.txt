A square meter of PV panels produces around 150W. So 15W average for a panel in a good location in Germany. 10W&#x2F;m^2 seems like a good estimate if you want your stuff to work reliably year round. Better locations than Germany would do better of course, and restricting yourself to just summer probably helps quite a bit too (winters are dark and cloudy in Germany).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solar_power_in_Germany#Statistics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solar_power_in_Germany#Statist...</a>')
