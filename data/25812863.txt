Here&#x27;s an analogy:<p>If you see $5 laying on the ground, it&#x27;s better for you to pick it up. That&#x27;s different than saying we must structure society in a way that people are relying on finding money on the ground (which is where you are taking it.)<p>It&#x27;s OBVIOUSLY possible to have teams and employees that operate fine without these experiences. My point is that these experiences are just opportunities to make it better (like picking up the $5) so why wouldn&#x27;t one try to be the kind of person who is happy to pick up the $5 rather than someone who grumbles about it?')
