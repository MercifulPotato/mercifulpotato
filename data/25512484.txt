Regarding behavior, do intact male dogs also attract aggressive behavior towards them? My (intact male) dog isn&#x27;t aggressive, but a few times now other dogs have attacked him (not resulting in serious injury, but was super scary). I was told by a trainer that he could be emitting hormones that cause this behavior in other dogs.')
