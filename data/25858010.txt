For whatever reason.<p>We pay too much attention to what we perceive to be the “arrow of time”, the direction. Forward, backward? What’s the difference really? Is it our illusion of “free will”, that somehow there is more to the atoms of our body than can be explained by the same laws of nature that governs the rest of the universe, that simply won’t accept that we might just be like billiard balls moving along predetermined paths (admittedly unbelievably complex ones) and if we accept that, then the direction of time doesn’t really matter at all.')
