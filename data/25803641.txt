Look at how they&#x27;ve left GPIO accessible, offered a mini keyboard (no longer visible on the site) to slot into the GO and provided loads of examples and project ideas [1].<p>That makes sense when you&#x27;re stretching the limits of very modest hardware. The difference is that the SoC powering the Advanced and this new variant is powerful enough for Linux distributions.<p>So I&#x27;d say the spirit is in the right place - they&#x27;re not just smashing out cheap crap preloaded with copyrighted material. But this is their most &quot;finished&quot; gaming specific product, so they&#x27;re not much point showing other things it is capable of. Are there really much in the way of legitimate Linux games which can be demonstrated to run on the hardware?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hardkernel.com&#x2F;shop&#x2F;odroid-go&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hardkernel.com&#x2F;shop&#x2F;odroid-go&#x2F;</a>')
