Brandon Ridenour&#x27;s wife&#x27;s name is Debora Silva Ridenour and her email address is deb_silva007@yahoo.com. Brandon Ridenour and Deb Ridenour also own 730 N Magnolia St, Denver, CO 80220. Their children go to Graland Country Day School located at 55 Clermon St, Denver, CO 80220. The Chairman of IAC and HomeAdvisor is Barry Diller and his home address is 1940 Coldwater Canyon Dr, Beverly Hills, CA 90210. All that information was kindly provided by their colleagues. HomeAdvisor are the biggest scammers in US history and need to be shut down. HomeAdvisor are spamming the internet and search engines with hundreds of fake websites to manipulate consumers and manipulate search engine results. Some examples of HomeAdvisor&#x27;s hundreds of fake websites are home-siding-contractors.com, 1800contractor.com, handymanservice.com, jensonbrothers.com, starsproservices.com, and powellandsons.com. The construction industry and local economies are being ruined by these bombardment of scams, lies, and deceit from HomeAdvisor and it will only get much worse if nothing is done to stop them. Sometimes as much as over three-fourths of the 1st page search results are all HomeAdvisor and HomeAdvisor&#x27;s fake websites, which makes it extremely unfair for construction businesses and independent contractors. Often all 3 ads on the 1st page search results are homeadvisor.com, jensonbrothers.com, and powellandsons.com, all 3 of which are websites controlled by HomeAdvisor and is blatant gross anticompetitive manipulation. HomeAdvisor are also writing thousands of fake reviews of their competitors and of themselves. HomeAdvisor are also writing thousands of fake positive reviews of themselves on ConsumerAffairs, Google, the App Store, and Google Play. HomeAdvisor is the worst rated company on the BBB in history with over 2,000 bad reviews from the last 3 years and a horrible average 1 star out of 5 stars rating as of the beginning of the year 2020, but starting the summer of 2020 HomeAdvisor has also begun to write hundreds of fake positive reviews of themselves on the BBB and on ResellerRatings to cheat and alter their ratings. HomeAdvisor is by far the most unethical, unfair, dishonest, and malicious corporation in America. HomeAdvisor uses every scam and dirty trick they can think of. Brandon Ridenour, Deb Ridenour, and the rest of the people behind HomeAdvisor need to be at the very least sentenced to life in prison. Angry contractors, let HomeAdvisor&#x27;s CEO know that HomeAdvisor will not be tolerated.')
