Not saying they have absence of ethics, just saying they could possibly be less bound to develop their tech faster without having to worry about short term trade-offs as much.<p>They could in this way become stronger than other nations who are more bound. With FSD they could start testing earlier even if it&#x27;s not guaranteed to be completely safe, and they could adopt it immediately full scale at the point when it&#x27;s definitely safer or almost as safe as humans, while in western world it would have to be much more safer than humans driving. Maybe this could mean years of advantage and they can start immediately adopting and optimising their economy.<p>Maybe ethics is not even the correct word. I&#x27;m talking about a trolley problem where they would be allowed to switch tracks while western world maybe not. \nIn this case it might mean more deaths up-front, but fewer later with optimised economy.')
