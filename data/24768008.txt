Only the branches where some &quot;measurement&quot; is done are &quot;calculated&quot;. I suppose the others are garbage collected at the end of time, or something like that.<p>And maybe it&#x27;s not a tree, but a graph of universes. In the same way that a universe split in two, two universe could also fuse into one when they share the previous state. Somehow it feels like this have to be connected to reversible vs. non-reversible computation.<p>Ah.. it&#x27;s a good feeling being a fearless dilettante.')
