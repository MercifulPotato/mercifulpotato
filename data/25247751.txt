The small form factor alone makes these cameras difficult. There&#x27;s no rooms for buttons to easily adjust settings. You get at best a single micro-HDMI port. Yes, it is getting better with all of the 3rd party devices that have been created to specifically address the fact that the form factor is so small it would be impossible to use without them. These cameras and their smaller form factor do lend to some very interesting things though, so please don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m crapping on them. Their prices also make them nearly disposable for decent budget shoots meaning much more interesting shots can be captured.<p>TL;DR Big video cameras have their places that smaller photo-centric cameras can&#x27;t replace.')
