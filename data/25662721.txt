I learned through experience to ask for a candidate to write a couple of lines of code.<p>Usually it&#x27;s just some simple question that requires a single loop.  We explicitly tell them they can use any language including one they want to make up as long as they are ok explaining how it works.  When possible, I try to relate it to the conversation we&#x27;ve had up to that point.<p>I&#x27;ve had someone start off by writing &quot;four&quot; on the board when prompted to write a &quot;for&quot; loop and get stuck.  I&#x27;m still not sure if he was truly inexperienced or just trolling.  The resume looked solid to me and he spoke well about his experience.  I had almost decided to just skip the coding question as a result.')
