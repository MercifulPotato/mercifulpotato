Then we had to do what we call technology transfer. So we go to each partner and we train them on the process. We train them on how to manufacture. And then, you know, some people are new to this process. It&#x27;s like they learn the process. They don&#x27;t know how to make the vaccine and they&#x27;re not as efficient as others&quot;.<p>&gt; &quot;So you may have lower productivity. That&#x27;s why we have a productivity going from one to three. And so, unfortunately, it&#x27;s really bad luck. Actually, there&#x27;s nothing mysterious about it. But look, the sites that have the lowest productivity in the network are the sites that are supplying Europe. And quite honestly, I mean, we&#x27;re not doing it on purpose. I&#x27;m European, I have Europe at heart. Our chairman is Swedish, is European. Our CFO is European. Many people in the management are European. So we want to treat Europe as best we can. You know, we do this at no profit, remember? We didn&#x27;t go into this to try and make money or whatever. We would like to treat Europe as good as possible. I actually do believe we treated Europe fairly&quot;.')
