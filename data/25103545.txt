(asking emteycz here, no one else)<p>I&#x27;ve started multiple businesses in different EU countries and never hit any &quot;extremely complicated regulatory requirements&quot; when I&#x27;ve done it. Basically sign some papers, pay the necessary fees (if even needed, not always a requirement) and make sure the company reports accurate numbers each quarter and you&#x27;re basically good to go. Is it any easier in the US?<p>Or are you simply echoing other peoples opinions here?')
