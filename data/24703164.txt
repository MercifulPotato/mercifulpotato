We recorded several suburbs of Karlsruhe, Germany, corresponding to over 320k images and 100k laser scans in a driving distance of 73.7km. We annotate both static and dynamic 3D scene elements with rough bounding primitives and transfer this information into the image domain, resulting in dense semantic &amp; instance annotations on both 3D point clouds and 2D images.')
