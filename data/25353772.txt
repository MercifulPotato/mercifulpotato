The position of my keyboard was very similar to the Altwork station, I.E. with arms bent at about 90 degrees with a keyboard and trackpad positioned above my body.<p>After a couple months of using it during full time working hours I developed severe pain in my wrists and forearms. This had never occurred before when using a conventional workstation &#x2F; position. I soon became unable to type, and nearly any use of my hands resulted in intense pain. Writing code using a keyboard was out of the question.<p>After much reading during my forced hiatus, I came to a hypothesis: elevating my hands to type while on my back caused a decrease in diffusion of fluids to the non-vascular tissues of my forearms and hands, that is, the tendons and muscle fascia. While in this unlubricated, &quot;dry&quot; state, the small, continual movements of the tissues against each other (the motions of typing) led to the injury. I concluded it was tendonosis. (IANAD, but had no health insurance at the time.)<p>The injury took six months to fully heal, during which time I self-administered massage, myofascial release therapy, and grip strength training to increase circulation around the various tissues. For much of that time, I could barely work. Truly it was hell.<p>As for the workstation, I modified it to use a split keyboard (Ergodox EZ) that kept my hands below my heart (basically at my sides). But ultimately I abandoned the whole thing after failing to achieve a reasonable touch typing speed with the Ergodox.<p>My current workstation is based on an Ikea lounge chair and ottoman. Keyboard and trackpad extend from the side into my lap on a low-mounted, adjustable arm. The monitor is also on an arm, cantilevered out over the ottoman (and my legs) at a comfortable viewing angle and distance. This setup is certainly not as relaxing for the back as the previous zero gravity position, but in approximately three years of use I&#x27;ve had no further injuries from typing.<p>YMMV.')
