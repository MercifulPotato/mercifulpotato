Usually there is a point on the back of my neck that starts protruding. Then my neck and shoulder muscles get inflamed and I get pain, headaches, teary eyes and drowsiness. Usually things get better with an ibuprofen to calm the inflammation. But sometimes my wife needs to push really hard and massage until the protrusion goes back in. I can even feel it sort of click back into place and you can feel it skip while rubbing. It started years ago but it&#x27;s sort of moved down closer to shoulder, it&#x27;s not protruding in the same spot as before. One other thing I would do is take a rolling pin against the door frame to massage the neck or pull on the back of my head upward with a towel. \nNow I also do these neck exercises* and they really do help if I do them regularly, I also use a laptop stand whenever I can so I don&#x27;t have to look down and slouch.<p>*<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com&#x2F;img&#x2F;document&#x2F;236321754&#x2F;original&#x2F;6652d8075e&#x2F;1464818760" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com&#x2F;img&#x2F;document&#x2F;236321754&#x2F;or...</a>\n(I couldn&#x27;t find it in english, sorry)<p>PS A neurologist and an orthopaedist told me that my symptoms don&#x27;t make sense and they couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong with my spine.')
