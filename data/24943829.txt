I think this speaks to the maturity of Waymo&#x27;s system at this point.  Two key paragraphs for me personally:<p>&quot;The most common type of crash involving Waymo’s vehicles was rear-end collisions. Waymo said it was involved in 14 actual and two simulated fender-benders, and in all but one, the other vehicle was the one doing the rear-ending.&quot;<p>-&gt; This is consistent with previous reports from Waymo.  If one of their vehicles gets in an accident, it&#x27;s extremely likely that the other (human) driver was at fault.  Of course, this is somewhat compounded by the fact that Waymo vehicles actually try to follow road laws like attempting to stop for yellow lights and making full stops at stopsigns, which human drivers often don&#x27;t do (and may not expect other vehicles to do).<p>&quot;The one incident where Waymo rear-ended another vehicle was in simulation: the company determined that the AV would have rear-ended another car that swerved in front of it and then braked hard despite a lack of obstruction ahead — which the company says was “consistent with antagonistic motive.” (There have been dozens of reports of Waymo’s autonomous vehicles being harassed by other drivers, including attempts to run them off the road.)&quot;<p>-&gt; This doesn&#x27;t surprise me really, but is still pretty sad.  Many drivers are just assholes and AVs are going to be an easy target for such people.')
