I agree, gmail&#x27;s is great. Apple&#x27;s Spotlight is also fabulous. So why does the article say &quot;search doesn&#x27;t fix this?&quot;<p>The problem is when search extends across domains. I can search files with Spotlight, but not my google emails. On my phone, it&#x27;s worse because there are so many different comms systems. I can search my Whatsapp messages; my SMS messages; my email; Facebook messenger; Skype.... Each individual search is fine, but no one tool does them all. Hence, the idea of using manual labels to classify stuff - including emails - can still be useful. Crazy that we&#x27;re forced back to this.')
