(Again, I could be wrong, my knowledge on arm Linux is based on working with rpi and HN discussions.)<p>Otherwise, you may be able to find ARM laptops, but nothing in this product class, and it is the entire chip design, not just the architecture, that makes this unique.<p>For a few years speculation on the benefits of arm servers etc. have been bouncing around with cautious steps in that direction. The M1 points more strongly towards their viability, as well as for consumer devices, than anything else I can think of. I just don&#x27;t want to buy Apple hardware to get it.')
