Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=[25284322], score=None, time=1606942089, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277703, text='The &quot;nootropics&quot; communities have been trying to find magic combinations for decades. Most of the compounds that provide results are variations of stimulants, such as modafinil. The cognitive boost is not without downsides, however. Modafinil is uniquely problematic because it was glorified as being a non-stimulant and free of side effects when it became popular. Some of this was driven by overseas vendors who made a lot of money shipping Modafinil into the United States without prescriptions.<p>Modafinil has a long half-life of 13-15 hours, which means that if you take a dose at 9AM, half of it is still in your bloodstream at midnight. This can have a negative effect on sleep quality the following night, which tends to prompt users to want to take yet another dose the following morning, and so on.<p>Modafinil is also notorious for reducing verbal fluency in some (though not all) users. There are also plenty of reports of abused and dependence online, though not to the same degree as other stimulants. From what I can gather, most people who use it regularly for non-prescription purposes eventually give up due to escalating tolerance.<p>Most other nootropics compounds follow similar stories: Initial glorification, widespread uptake, steady loss of momentum as people realize the compound is not without tradeoffs and downsides, and eventually being relegated to an every once-in-a-while tool for those who have it.<p>In some cases, the negative side effects of a substance are so subtle that people don&#x27;t make the connection at first. For example, cholinergic supplements are frequently touted as memory enhancers and miracle supplements. Unfortunately, cholinergic supplements also have a tendency to induce or worsen depressive symptoms over time. The Nootropics communities are full of people complaining about unexplained depressive symptoms while taking various choline supplements that they hoped would improve their cognition or memory.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to watch from the sidelines, but at this point I&#x27;ve decided that nothing beats good sleep, exercise, social exposure, and good diet. Caffeine is an okay band-aid on difficult days when used in moderation, but any attempts to use powerful compounds to override sleepiness seem doomed to backfire with rebound effects later.')
