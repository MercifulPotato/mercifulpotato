The DEA, ICE, &amp; FBI have documented cases of criminal activity across the border. The left often editorializes his comments however his supporters understand what was meant, and no, it&#x27;s not a racist dog whistle.<p>You brought up a non-sequitor, re Judge Curiel. He has provided legal representation for a hispanic-supremacist organization named La Raza (meaning &quot;the race&quot; in Spanish), which has a public political opinion on matters such as the wall on the southern border. Perhaps Trump should have mentioned the group &quot;La Raza&quot;, however the point stands that Judge Curiel has racial-supremacist political affiliations, was in-explicitly hostile in the lawsuit, &amp; Trump called it out as a theory.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewamerican.com&#x2F;judge-in-trump-university-case-tied-to-radical-la-raza-organization&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewamerican.com&#x2F;judge-in-trump-university-case-ti...</a><p>For many, the &quot;Orange Man Bad&quot; &amp; &quot;all white people are racist&quot; narrative will probably kick in &amp; they will reject what I&#x27;m saying outright because it does not fit their narrative; however this interpretation better fits Occam&#x27;s razor, considering that Trump has also worked with certain people of all ethnicities in a harmonious fashion, while having rocky relationships with certain people from all ethnicities. The differences have to do with political worldview rather than ethnicity. Unfortunately, the political left has a habit of editorializing worldviews according to race, so other explanations are rendered moot according to the worldview of the political left, which views the world according to race.')
