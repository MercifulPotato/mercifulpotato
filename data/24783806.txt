Certainly it&#x27;s true that the client changes the quality of what it&#x27;s sending based on what <i>its</i> uplink supports, but what if a client has very good uplink and sends a high quality stream, but 1 (out of some larger number) of other participants doesn&#x27;t have the downlink to receive it?  Does Zoom actually instruct the sender to degrade the quality of what it uploads, and so <i>everyone</i> gets a worse experience?  That seems unlikely.')
