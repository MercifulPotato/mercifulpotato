Go back to a laid back life? Many mortals think that is a good idea, and, that is OK.<p>I&#x27;m one of those mortals; my data connection is disabled on the phone and used only for emergencies (last time I&#x27;ve used it was months ago).<p>Ultimately it fits in the big picture of the connected life. One can still live disconnected, and pay 10% of the &quot;convenience price&quot;, but save 100% of the associated problems.<p>I don&#x27;t blame the connected lifestyle but the more I think about it, the more it looks like an addiction to me, and the big companies are capitalizing on it. I don&#x27;t agree with them, but I can hardly blame them - it takes one tap to switch the connection off.')
