Item(by='cambalache', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608913690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25534692, text='&gt; My rough map of the article: The Taino (native Caribbean tribe) was thought to have been wiped out completely. Todayâ€™s Caribbean residents were of slave decent and Spanish conquerors.<p>Huh? Virtually every Puerto Rican consider themselves to have Taino&#x2F;Indigenous blood. There are even popular sayings like &quot;Se me salio lo Taino&quot; (_I left my internal Taino to come out_) which acknowledge the perpetuation in PR genetic pool of native people. BTW this is something not exclusive to PR, it happens all across latin america.<p>It&#x27;s always &quot;interesting&quot; to me to hear Americans talk about this sort of stuff, because the way they are taught is that Spaniards were extremely more violent and cruel than their English counterparts, and yet, the US&#x2F;Canada exterminated their native population down to 1% or so, while all the massacres and crimes in Latin-America were not enough to wipe out the native component, which can be as high as 50-65% in several countries.')
