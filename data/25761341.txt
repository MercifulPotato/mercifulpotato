Item(by='yatac42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610542223, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760821, text='&gt; At this point, does any major European country have more than two viable parties or coalitions?<p>If we look at the coalitions that have happened at the national level in this century, we have:<p>* Social Democrats + Greens<p>* Conservatives + Social Democrats (like, a lot)<p>* Conservatives + Liberals<p>So that&#x27;s three different coalitions that have actually happened in the last 20 years. Admittedly three is not a lot more than two, but it is more (and we&#x27;re talking about a time frame that only includes 5 national elections and only about actual coalitions, not potentially viable ones).<p>And if you look at state governments as well, there are actually a lot more combinations that seem to work.<p>&gt; Will the German Greens ever get a Cabinet seat outside a coalition with the Social Democrats?<p>Almost certainly.<p>At the state level they already have. In one case they&#x27;re even the majority with the conservatives being the minority partner in the coalition.<p>At the national level they almost did in 2017. Negotiations between the conservatives, the greens and the liberals failed because the liberals backed out and the greens + conservatives didn&#x27;t have a majority on their own - they would have been ready to go otherwise. It is entirely possible, even likely, that we will see a conservative-green coalition after this year&#x27;s elections.')
