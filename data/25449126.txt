When I play VR table tennis I am exercising my <i>gross motor skills</i>. It is a 100% different experience and type of skill acquisition to anything you will get from flat gaming. There are actually pro table tennis players who now train in VR because it is so realistic and of course they can fine tune to the nth degree what they want to work on. Alternatively, games like Space Pirates have you literally swaying and ducking bullets coming at you in 3d space. There is no comparison at all to me moving a joystick to achieve the same thing.')
