We intend to try to reverse engineer such decorations and to show them properly. With trills and such it can be quite hard because it is perfectly possible to write out the same sequence, a trill is essentially a macro that expands to some number of notes (and some trills can be quite complex, for instance the first few bars of Partita 1 by JS Bach will throw you for a loop if you listen to them and then look at the score).')
