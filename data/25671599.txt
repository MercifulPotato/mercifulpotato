Single use, only touch the strings, etc. They also know they are constantly in the presence of disease and risk transmitting it to those they are trying to help. In non-pandemic times there is a higher chance for an asymptomatic doctor or nurse to infect an at-risk patient than there is for an asymptomatic member of the general public to infect an at-risk person.<p>&gt; I think the emphasis on wearing masks is simply because that isn&#x27;t the norm in the West. Washing hands is the norm (or rather, should be, we&#x27;ve all been hearing it since childhood...).<p>I agree. The part that <i>should</i> be normal worldwide is that sick people should wear a mask to prevent transmission of any virus, pandemic or no pandemic. Hong Kong and Taiwan learned this during SARS and maintained the habit as part of their culture. They also wear them to filter air pollution. So, those two factors made it easy for them to accept masks for all in 2020. I don&#x27;t think mask wearing for sick people was regular practice anywhere outside of medical professionals before 2002. And AFAIK it has not yet caught on everywhere even amidst this pandemic.')
