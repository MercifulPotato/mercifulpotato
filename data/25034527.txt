It&#x27;s clear to some folks that ZM will decline based on the fact that a COVID vaccine was virtually inevitable. However, there are lots of investors, mostly retail investors, that are willing to buy a stock without fully pricing that in. E.g. Tim&#x27;s dad sees that Tim is using Zoom for school and decides it would be a good investment. Other investors are willing to buy ZM for short-term gain as long as they can get out before it crashes back to reality.<p>The same thing happened to Hertz, which even after declaring bankruptcy and almost certainly being  worthless continued to trade at a healthy volume. In fact, Hertz tried to get approval to dilute and sell more shares to capitalize off the fact that people were buying their worthless stock.')
