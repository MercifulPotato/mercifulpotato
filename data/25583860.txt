Item(by='HenryKissinger', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609350358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583397, text='&gt; For most people, their home investment represents a large part of their net worth. From a diversification perspective, it&#x27;s a catastrophe. It&#x27;s not even a diversified investment in different real estate assets, it&#x27;s one asset in one location. This means it is also a bad move in terms of optionality. If crime rises in your neighborhood, the school closes, or if you have a good job opportunity elsewhere, it&#x27;s very hard to move. If a crisis happens at this location, an investor can lose a lot of their net worth and can wait up to 15 years for the recovery.<p>Full stop. Housing is not supposed to be an investment. You buy a house because you need a place to live, not to turn a profit. If you treat housing as an investment, good for you. But I couldn&#x27;t care less about the fact that housing isn&#x27;t as good as an investment as the stock market. If crime rises or whatever, then you sell, and you take a loss. I certainly don&#x27;t expect to sell my old clothes for a net profit when they wear out. Or my car, or any of the things I own out of necessity.<p>Stop thinking about money.')
