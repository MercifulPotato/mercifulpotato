It could mean that the initial condition of the universe was set, such that nobody would do X. But that&#x27;s still a way of the past (initial condition) being determined by the future, even if the future was just predicted via determinism. It makes physics teleological.<p>A common criticism of superdeterminism is that it eliminates falsifiability from science. E.g. to quote physicist Nicolas Gisin, &quot;If we did not have free will, we could never decide to test a scientific theory. We could live in a world where objects tend to fly up in the air but be programmed to look only when they are in the process of falling.&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikiquote.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superdeterminism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikiquote.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superdeterminism</a>')
