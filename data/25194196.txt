But then has to fight an insurance company who wants treatment that isn&#x27;t in your best interests or isn&#x27;t covered by the employer plan.<p>You get home and discover your Doctor is out of network. Pay up. You spend a million years fighting the insurance company.<p>OR your insurance is good, so the doctor says, what the hell I will order that test that is nice to have. They&#x27;ll cover it. Costs increase.<p>Or you go to the emergency room, run up bills for the hospital and leave without paying. The taxpayer foots the bill.<p>And the doctors pay through the teeth for their degrees and want a big return. They earn more than other countries in a significant way.<p>All the incentives are out of whack and not in the public&#x27;s interest.')
