The only real takeaway is entrepreneurship is hard. VERY HARD.<p>You will make plenty of mistakes. Technical mistakes. Business mistakes. Mistakes that cost years, maybe even decades. Mistakes that will cost you thousands (hopefully not millions).<p>Don&#x27;t obsess about &quot;we should have done this&quot; or &quot;I should have done that.&quot; You&#x27;ll beat yourself up unnecessarily.<p>If you want to do entrepreneurship, keep at it. Find problems. And fix them fast.<p>If you don&#x27;t have the bankroll to do it (or just fall out of love), then you can quit too. That&#x27;s ok.')
