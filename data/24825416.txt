Good luck fixing those broken welds on your metal chairs!<p>Good luck breaking the steel beam bed frame :)<p>Ikea furniture is not wood it&#x27;s crap particleboards, cheap plastic, etc. - repairing that looks terrible. Their paint quality is crap as well - I bought a work desk that would scratch from moving a monitor on it and has wear marks from resting my hands. Same problem with kitchen table in a rental apartment - got scratched up from regular use and no way to repair it. Hinges on sliding doors would never stop correctly and scratch up the other door, loose&#x2F;flimsy feeling mechanism in the first place.<p>I do have their standing desk - it fit the home office space perfectly and it was the only good delivery option during corona lockdown - I&#x27;m happy with that so far. In general IKEA is my least favourite furniture option but sometimes they are the most practical solution.')
