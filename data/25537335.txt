If marriege was not an external event, then why the ceremony? The rings? Etc? It&#x27;s full of symbolism describing and alluding to your responsibilities and how you&#x27;re going to be judged for not abiding to them.<p>So yes, in a world where two people have total trust, and society is more lenient in it&#x27;s pressuring of norms marriege would be obsolete.')
