Item(by='ALittleLight', descendants=None, kids=[25817278], score=None, time=1610921753, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25814049, text='One problem with the data is that it&#x27;s hard to know to what extent modern life changes how many kids you want. Meaning: if a woman knows she has to have a full time job, she may only want, or believe she can afford, two or three children.  Conversely, I suppose a woman in agricultural setting might want 7-10 children knowing they could help on the farm. It&#x27;s probably impossible to know what people would want &quot;unconstrained&quot; by reality, and maybe not even meaningful.<p>Two things I think are true though. First, women have fewer children than they want, even if what they want is declining over time. Second, women who don&#x27;t want children, or who want children below replacement, won&#x27;t ever become the majority of the population - at least not for any significant amount of time. Such women will be replaced by women who, genetically or memetically, want more children.')
