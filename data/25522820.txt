My Dell monitor <i>can</i> do what you describe, but lacks the ports of a real dock (don&#x27;t think it has outgoing Ethernet).<p>At the moment I have 2 monitors on the dock (which is my main setup) and a 3rd monitor on a separate machine with KVM (which means 2 keyboards and 2 mice) - this supports 4 computers (2 laptops, 2 desktops) - work+home laptops on the dual-monitor dock and Linux+PC desktops on the KVM. It&#x27;s not a pretty setup.')
