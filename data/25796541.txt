Millions of people thought Betsy Davos was a good idea. MILLIONS. The DOE under her tenure was basically a full on assault against public education in favor of charters&#x2F;private schools. I&#x27;ve had hours-long, in-person arguments with people who are CONVINCED teachers have the easiest jobs on the planet and we pay them too much.<p>Not to mention many HN commenters in general tend to strong pro-management stance which pushes them anti-union in general.')
