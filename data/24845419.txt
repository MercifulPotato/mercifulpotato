For one, people prefer simpler database schema these days - and what used to be larger monolithic apps are often broken into micro services. Earlier, you&#x27;d have one big database - today you&#x27;ll have many. And ORMs are great with simple queries and joins.<p>The language plays a big role in whether an ORM is actually useful or not. In the .Net world, ORMs work quite well because querying capabilities are integrated into the language. Queries and schema are verified at compile-time, and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for slightly better performance or control. On the other hand, with Python (or say Node), or with Java and Hibernate the wins are smaller.<p>Of course, there will be some queries which are just better written in plain SQL. If you&#x27;re willing to accept that, ORMs are a good tool in your toolbox.')
