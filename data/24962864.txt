For example, I was in a Mercedes the other day:<p>1. It had a fob that worked as a key, but it didn’t look like a key and the key slot didn’t look like where the fob should go.<p>2. You set the handbrake using the left foot, but release it with a pull handle with your right hand!<p>Both were unintuitive, and would catch out some people (I am generally well above average in working out how to use execrable user interfaces).<p>The worst UI is often to release the door to fill fuel.
