This is useful.<p>In this election, there were a lot of things that looked odd at first glance. I’m sure many people saw the huge vertical spike in Biden votes. A reasonable person would see that and say it looks suspicious, we should find out why. And as part of that process, an explanation was found, and this served a useful purpose in giving us confidence that this anomaly was nothing nefarious and was not cause for concern. What exactly do you think happens when you suppress our ability to do that?<p>All of this because our youtube nannies want to decide what we should or shouldn’t see? If Trump is being a moron, I have the right to watch him be one first hand. I <i>want</i> to know how dumb my president is. Why would anyone want Youtube deciding this for me?<p>Such an utterly stupid move youtube.')
