However the problem is that kids are academically segregated from the very start by the quality of their school district.  I am all for fixing that.<p>I might be more willing to believe this academic segregation is a genuine concern from this administration if they actually made any effort at improving these poor districts instead of seemingly ignoring the problem and giving parents the choice to simply abandon these school districts.')
