Item(by='damethos', descendants=None, kids=[25322319, 25324878], score=None, time=1607247073, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320941, text='I understand the fact that the author took the matter in his own hands and claimed what he was owed but this article is just another proof that instead of doing our jobs and spending our time more productively, we always need to play the &quot;lawyer&quot; and the &quot;detective&quot; because some people&#x2F;company always abuse their position of power. The author did manage to get his money, but at the same time pointed them a flaw (the affiliation page) in their little scheme, which means that he didn&#x27;t help protect anyone else that wants to start an affiliation with them. And yes, I understand that this is &quot;how the world works&quot; but still, I always get bothered by this kind of behavior. Maybe an alternative maybe, would have been to stood up by just ending the partnership and finding another company that treats its affiliations with more respect AND post the article in order for others to read the bad experience he had.')
