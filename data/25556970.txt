People may judge that I like a movie with X terrible person.<p>I think that&#x27;s fundamentally a side-effect of the &quot;regulate decency by voting with your wallet and advocating others do the same&quot; mantra of neoliberalism and libertarianism.<p>People&#x27;s attitude towards this has always bugged me - &quot;if you really believed that, you&#x27;d put your money where your mouth is&quot;, and yet somehow e.g. vegans (no, I&#x27;m not vegan) are the butt of jokes instead of held up as people who are morally responsible with their spending.<p>Like, which is it?
