Developers tend to be extremely opinionated about stuff they use (e.g. vi vs. emacs) and aren&#x27;t afraid to voice that opinion.  HN is a good place to do that because usually there is good signal to noise ratio in the discussions.<p>Apple is a company that uses emotion when describing their products.  I think this tends to bring out stronger opinions than a tech company like Google.  People&#x27;s perception of companies isn&#x27;t going to be rational.<p>What is your end goal with proving&#x2F;disproving a bias regarding Apple on HN?<p>I think what is more interesting is exploring the root cause for some of these biases - sometimes there is history of a person strongly disliking Microsoft so their perception of Apple is based in that.  Sometimes someone really dislikes closed source&#x2F;eco-system and prefers open-ness and tinker-ability.')
