Aside from a very few functions reverse-engineered from LG&#x27;s smartphone remote control apps, I&#x27;ve not found any way to control core display functionality via either TCP&#x2F;IP or documented WebOS APIs, including such simple things as backlight brightness and display power on&#x2F;off, at least on my 2018 model.<p>There is, on the other hand, a documented RS-232 protocol supported across many of LG&#x27;s smart and &quot;dumb&quot; TVs that supports these things and more, so I threw together a trivial HTTP wrapper<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jasminetroll&#x2F;LgTvControl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jasminetroll&#x2F;LgTvControl</a><p>that I use to control various TV settings via keyboard commands and Apple remote.<p>As a significant bonus, the RS-232 API has a &quot;disable&#x2F;enable OSD&quot; command, so I can adjust brightness and switch between inputs without an annoying, oversized OSD window covering up a significant portion of the screen for several seconds telling me what I either already know from the resulting display (switched input to, e.g., the GPU connected to my Linux desktop VM) or don&#x27;t care about (the numerical value of backlight brightness resulting from the latest up&#x2F;down button press).')
