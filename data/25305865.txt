My expectations are they would immediately terminate access to all company resources, pay me 2 weeks, send me a letter wishing me good luck on my future endeavors, and send an email to my co-workers saying I resigned.<p>Now later I might think, shoot maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have threatened to quit if they didn&#x27;t meet my demands because I really liked my job.  But I don&#x27;t think we should pretend this isn&#x27;t exactly what 95% of all corporations would do in a similar situation.')
