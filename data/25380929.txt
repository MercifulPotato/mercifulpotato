This will overwhelm hospitals.<p>The problem is that the public has been hearing this for almost 9 months now and with the exception of a hospital or two it hasn&#x27;t happened.  You can only cry wolf so many times.<p>&gt;  I mean we are almost at a complete ICU collapse right now already.<p>Besides a few one off stories could you please provide HN readers with some links?<p>&gt;  And a lot of people will die, not just of covid but of other treatable diseases.<p>They already are and do you know why?  Because hospitals stopped doing &quot;unessential&quot; procedures for months and continue to do so.<p>&gt;  Not to mention we will run out of PPE and medical supplies.<p>Could you please share an article or three with HN readers where a single hospital has run out of PPE in the USA?<p>&gt; More doctors and nurses and respiratory therapists will get sick and die.<p>If Covid is so powerful then why haven&#x27;t tens of thousands of nurses and doctors died?  They are exposed to do multiple times per day.<p>Look forward to your reply!')
