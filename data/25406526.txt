The free market won&#x27;t bring you back to life so you can &quot;choose a different competitor&quot; if it kills you.<p>Life is full of risks. Lots of things were approved by bother government and experts in the past that was bad for you.<p>&gt; That food? Bad. Dead. That tool? Dangerous. Dead. That work on your house? Dangerous. Dead. That car? Unroadworthy. Dead. Those aircraft parts? Counterfeit and not to spec. 300 people dead.<p>The FDA has stopped people from getting medication in the US that are over the counter medicines because they haven&#x27;t been <i>approved for use</i>. It is a double edged sword.<p>&gt;Every single thing humans do is already regulated in some way. Why? Because humans in the end, like all animals, try to achieve the best least effort : highest reward ratio they can.<p>Unfortunately. What has the current light regulation on the web brought us cookie popups that are irritating that people just click through and a GDPR warnings that don&#x27;t actually solve the problem of collecting your data. I don&#x27;t hold out much hope for future regulation, which btw will favour the big tech players that have been collecting our data thus far. BTW you don&#x27;t know the names of many of them, because they are B2B players and provide services to the companies we do know the name of.<p>As for &quot;best result for least effort&quot;. Well it depends how it manifests itself. It can either be laziness or efficiency. The latter is not a problem.<p>&gt; In the modern world, these regulations need to be extended to automatically cover modern technologies and prevent inherent harm. They shouldn&#x27;t be overbearing. They shouldn&#x27;t be pointlessly excessive. But they are required for all things.<p>Inviting any sort of regulation will involve government. Government will try to justify itself by demanding more regulation. It will always be overbearing and that will cement these players in place.<p>At the moment, we have the best chance of these players being toppled. People are looking at alternatives to big tech and are going to smaller players, mainly due to censorship. The trickle has now become a stream, sooner or later it will be a flood. However because of regulation on the horizon (which doesn&#x27;t address any of the issues we care about)<p>&gt; Many people think capitalism is greedy because they have literally spent a lifetime experiencing greed fueled capitalism first hand, not because they sit on YouTube watching propaganda videos.<p>I suspect you are confusing <i>corporatism</i> (which is a form of fascism) with capitalism (which is a party of liberty).<p>As for propaganda. I never said anything about Youtube. Don&#x27;t put words in my mouth. I am talking about how hollywood, novelists (since the 19th century), newspapers have framed it since forever. You are soo fermeted in it you don&#x27;t even realise it is propaganda.')
