A well crafted site built with the help of Nextjs (and similar) works w&#x2F;o JS just fine: The site becomes progressively enhanced through hydration, but if you disable JS altogether, you can still read and navigate the site.<p>For sites with minimalist designs, straight forward data models and low to no interaction (like a blog or similar) I agree that any sort of JS can be overkill. But professional web devs use these technologies because they tick some important boxes (trade-offs) ranging from expressivity, structure to performance and provide a uniform way to write front-ends.')
