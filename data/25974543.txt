This really just punts the responsibility: now we&#x27;re relying on the accuracy of the abstract specification, rather than the model(s) automatically or manually produced from it. It&#x27;s also not sound; it just allows us to feel more confident.<p>Informally: we can have a lot of different people look at the model very closely, and produce test vectors for the model based on human predictions of behavior.')
