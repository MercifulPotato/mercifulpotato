And they haven&#x27;t replaced it.  They&#x27;ve told me four times over the course of the last five months that I&#x27;ll get a call in 3-5 business days.  It has never come of course.<p>I know I&#x27;m not alone; even just in my circle there are two other stories of horrible mishaps with this company.<p>Lenovo makes some decent machines, sometimes, but their warranty service is not to be trusted.')
