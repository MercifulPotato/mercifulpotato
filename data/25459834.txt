You might as well write &quot;il a aimer&quot;. The later sounds the same as with the accent, but it&#x27;s obviously very wrong to put an infinitive there.<p>I guess I proved your point to some extent: I care less about accent errors than other mistakes, and just consider it a typo. But reading a completely unaccented text is hard for me, and I text, e-mail, and communicate online a lot.<p>In my experience, people are not foregoing them on purpose, except on capital letters, which is an heritage of AZERTY keyboards + windows (hopefully AFNOR keyboards catches on). Capital accented letters is <i>the</i> example to cite if you want an example of computer technology changing our habits: my friend Etienne (Ã‰tienne?) insists there is no accent on hist first name, but it makes no sense to me.')
