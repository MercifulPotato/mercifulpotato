Changing &quot;rioters&quot; to &quot;protesters&quot; completely changes the meaning of what Cotton said. I don&#x27;t agree with him, but I am vehemently against people twisting others&#x27; words to spread lies and misinformation. He said &quot;rioters&quot;. Don&#x27;t lie and say he said &quot;protesters&quot; because then you are implying he is trying to quash free speech with the military.<p>In this case, you are the one in the wrong. Spreading misinformation purposefully to trick people into agreeing with you is what is destroying this country right now and you are doing this.')
