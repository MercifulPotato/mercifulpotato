Same way as Germany&#x27;s Reichskommissariats and Reichprotektorats during WW2 were never legitimate entities despite being de facto governed by Germany.<p>This means than no contract (private or public) with a Crimean entity can be internationally recognised and will be easily contested by any court&#x2F;arbitrage outside of the RF.<p>In addition to this, there&#x27;s a moral concern of giving legitimacy to a foreign occupation. There&#x27;s just no way to justify this unless one supports the mentioned occupation, with following systemic abuse of human rights, change of ethnic composition and militarisation.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undocs.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;A&#x2F;RES&#x2F;71&#x2F;205" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undocs.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;A&#x2F;RES&#x2F;71&#x2F;205</a>')
