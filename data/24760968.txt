Whenever you compare Mac and Windows there&#x27;s always a mention of the &quot;smoothness&quot;&#x2F;&quot;feel&quot;&#x2F;&quot;polish&quot; - A new Mac has a smoothness and responsiveness in its interface that I found Windows previously struggled to match.<p>That recently changed when I switched to a 144Hz, 1440p display connected to a Windows desktop and a docked MacBook. The MacBook can only do 60fps on the display (It&#x27;s just a laptop, so not entirely fair), but the desktop easily handles 144Hz and the experience is great. Everything is so smooth - scrolling, typing code, moving around windows. It&#x27;s an incredible delight and the 60Hz -&gt; 144Hz transition gives the same feeling as upgrading to Mac did back in the day.<p>I feel like my personal impressions have been distorted from years of running Windows on old, crusty hardware loaded with bloatware and all the quirks of a long-running system. Of course, the fresh MacBook felt fantastic in comparison. This article aligns with my suspicions -- Running modern Windows on next-gen hardware and an empty hard drive evens the comparison a bit, and with that perspective the differences aren&#x27;t so huge!')
