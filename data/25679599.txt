Even the most successful p2p protocols, bitcoin and bittorrent, are pretty server-heavy in practice.<p>That said, I want my version control to contain, locally, everything relevant to software development, and use some sort of pub&#x2F;sub model to propagate my changes. Here, a server is helpful: gives a fixed domain, a canonical place to retrieve the repo, and so on and so forth.<p>But it should be more like Fossil, where everything is stored locally and you can spin up your own localhost to access the GUI through the browser. Fossil is too monolithic, I reluctantly had to abandon it on that basis, but it points in the correct direction IMHO.<p>And if the hub is down, as long as peers and backups haven&#x27;t changed IP addresses since the last time we communicated, I don&#x27;t see why work couldn&#x27;t continue.')
