When I was in the military, a General was talking to us about the officers that they had doing pentesting, and they said that the people with CS and other tech degrees were usually outperformed by the people with degrees in things like political science. From their experience, the people with technical degrees would often get hung up on a problem if it didn&#x27;t have a provably right&#x2F;wrong answer, while the people with degrees in &quot;soft&quot; subjects were able to think through a problem and provide a &quot;best&quot; answer.')
