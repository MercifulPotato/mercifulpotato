I keep feeling the impulse to log onto the Unfiction Forums and check what&#x27;s going on, but alas, even those are gone now! Without a central watering hole, I think it&#x27;ll be that much harder for the medium to come backâ€”everything&#x27;s siloed into separate Discords now, without a single sustaining community. It&#x27;s not really possible to lurk or hop between games anymore, and scattershot chat messages are harder to catch up on than forum threads, and don&#x27;t preserve as well or make for very good reading after a game is over.<p>I&#x27;m probably younger than most of the crowd that was involved in that ARG scene, so I wanna say thanks for helping to create a piece of my childhood! I actually remember the name Six to Start and that there was a lot of hope behind it when it launched, so I&#x27;m glad to hear it&#x27;s doing well.')
