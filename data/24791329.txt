Here are some off the top of my head for comparison, from roughest to smoothest:<p>* Perl 5 to Perl 6: So disastrous that they <i>rolled back</i> and Perl 6 is now known as Raku<p>* PHP5 to PHP7: Burn my eyes out, please! But of course PHP has unique user pressures, and a monoculture helps a lot<p>* Python 2.4 to Python 2.7: Done in several stages, including deprecation of syntax, rolling out of new keywords, introduction of backwards-compatible objects and classes, and improvements to various semantic corner cases<p>* Haskell 98 to Haskell 2010: GHC dominated the ecosystem and now Haskell 98 is only known for being associated with Hugs, which knows nothing newer<p>* C++03 and earlier to C++11: Failed to deprecate enough stuff, but did successfully establish a permanent 3yr release cadence<p>* C99 to C11: Aside from the whole Microsoft deal, this was perfect; unfortunately Microsoft&#x27;s platforms are common in the wild<p>Now consider how many Python 3 features ended up backported to Python 2 [0] and how divisive the upgrade needed to be in the end.<p>On readability, you&#x27;ll just have to trust me that when Python gets to millions of lines of code per application, the organization of modules into packages becomes obligatory; the module-to-module barrier isn&#x27;t expressive enough to support all of the readable syntax that people want to use for composing objects. If you want a FORTRAN example, look at Cephes [1], a C library partially ported from FORTRAN. The readability is terrible, the factoring is terrible, and it cannot be improved because FORTRAN lacked the abstractive power necessary for higher-order factoring, and so does C. Compare and contrast with Numpy [2], a popular numeric library for Python which is implemented in (punchline!) FORTRAN and C.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;2&#x2F;whatsnew&#x2F;2.7.html#python-3-1-features" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;2&#x2F;whatsnew&#x2F;2.7.html#python-3-1-featu...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeremybarnes&#x2F;cephes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jeremybarnes&#x2F;cephes</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;numpy&#x2F;numpy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;numpy&#x2F;numpy</a>')
