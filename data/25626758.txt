The Haskell REPL is entirely oriented into the &quot;you write the code on the editor -&gt; you evaluate it on the REPL&quot; way (again, AFAIK, the GHCi manual is huge).<p>That said, yes, it&#x27;s a really seamless cycle of you write your code on the editor -&gt; you evaluate it on the REPL, and yes, Haskell requires doing that very little, most problems stop at the type checker. Haskell does really not afford interactive programming, but I wouldn&#x27;t classify that as a problem.')
