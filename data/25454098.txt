I&#x27;d observe Sweden and follow the actions of Tegnell, as Sweden has had a pretty good pandemic so far.<p>2. To placate those who are worried I&#x27;d focus on raising hospital capacity as much as possible.<p>3. I&#x27;d get a grip on testing. Doctors are all trained not to do indiscriminate testing without any other signs of problems, a lesson that has been forgotten now. I&#x27;d end mass testing entirely and focus all testing on people who present with symptoms (this would still be a high level of over-testing because COVID symptoms were worked out by looking at anyone who tested positive so is polluted by a lot of FP noise).<p>Key metrics are hospital loads and excess deaths. It would be acceptable for the latter to go up by, say, 3x the level a normal flu season would see before starting to impose any population controls.<p>Pushback: of course there would be. They&#x27;ve all been told by &quot;experts&quot; who know nothing about disease that millions will die unless everyone is locked in their homes right now because exponential growth always lasts forever, don&#x27;t you know, and they&#x27;re all terrified of seeming to place anything above health outcomes. But if I were the mayor then they&#x27;d ultimately report to me, I guess (I don&#x27;t live in the US so don&#x27;t know much about mayoral politics).<p>The risk if the policy was wrong would be hospitals would get over-full. The contingency plan would be to buy capacity from hospitals in further away regions and invest in rapid buildouts of ambulances, helicopters etc to make it easy to shift capacity around and load balance between hospitals, including to neighbouring regions that disagreed. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s likely because we know what happens if you ignore the projections: basically nothing. Look at Swedish all-cause death stats for the year. It&#x27;ll come in a bit higher than 2018, probably a few percent higher. Nothing important.<p>W.r.t emailing key interest groups. It&#x27;s way too far gone for that. People have been proposing rational and sensible alternative plans for the last 8 months, they&#x27;re all ignored.<p>I have no experience in public health or epidemiology, thank god. If I did I wouldn&#x27;t be able to consider alternatives because I&#x27;d be a part of the public sector&#x2F;academic system in which personal reputation as a &#x27;nice guy&#x27; or &#x27;clever specialist&#x27; is the primary determinant of personal success. I&#x27;m much happier in the private sector where what matters is getting results, not the <i>perception</i> of niceness or reasonableness or cleverness.')
