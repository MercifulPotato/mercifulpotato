It&#x27;s pretty hard to read by a camp fire.<p>And you&#x27;re either gathering dead fall or using a sharp steel axe.  Dead fall is a limited resource, if you need some every day you&#x27;ll run out close by soon.   So soon you&#x27;re spending more time traveling for wood than collecting.   Eventually you&#x27;ll have to use a stone axe.  IIRC, it takes three days to chop down a tree with stone axes that would take an hour with a steel axe.  You&#x27;ll go through several axes chopping down one tree, so you spend much more time making and sharpening axes than chopping.')
