At this point I have management experience and am at mid-career - I have been doing the data thing for a decade. I can&#x27;t do it anymore, I can&#x27;t stand cleaning or working with dirty data on a daily basis. I am sick of managing expectations about DS work with managers who just want models and results when they&#x27;re not tenable.<p>I have started to learn how to write back end code e.g. web services, APIs, working with Apache Kafka, and have found that working on these types of projects brings me joy. I am worried that companies will look at me as a very odd choice for hiring because of this career switch. Has anybody else gone from DS to more vanilla SWE? If so, what was your experience doing so? Any advice? Thanks.')
