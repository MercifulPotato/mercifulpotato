Examiners asked me to rewrite some sections and resubmit my thesis because one of them didn&#x27;t &quot;believe&quot; my results. Believing in this context actually meant I made lots of his stuff outdated &#x2F; irrelevant using mathematical models instead of hand waving. Models led to precise findings, which had some lab validation by the time I submitted.<p>At the same time my university, which is a really famous one, was encouraging me to patent my results. And my supervisor applied for massive funding as if all was his idea. 2 major clinical trials are now recruiting to test my findings.<p>Least to say, I refused and got a new exam with some honest people.')
