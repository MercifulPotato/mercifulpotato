So while the topic of the discussion often is about SF companies (but more often than not it&#x27;s about generic tech issues that are interesting everywhere), this is a quite global forum and the discussion here quite clearly is <i>not</i> properly understood through a lens focused solely on Bay Area, as 90% of people in that discussion are from elsewhere.')
