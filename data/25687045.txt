Item(by='solstice', descendants=None, kids=[25688406], score=None, time=1610126453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25686447, text='I totally understand what you mean and I also frequently look up older conversations to enjoy again the in-jokes, banter and actually useful information of my chats.<p>However to avoid 1) having to manually delete things and 2) accumulating hundreds of megabytes of messages and 3) to not be swamped by months and years of &quot;can you call?&quot;, &quot;alright, see you later&quot; and other ultimately meaningless stuff, I have conversations in Signal with my frequent interlocutors set to expire after a month.<p>To save things, I currently simply screenshot the relevant parts of the conversation or forward them to my &quot;Notes to myself&quot; thingy for later. It&#x27;s a bit manual, but at least it&#x27;s simple to remember: what I don&#x27;t actively save disappears. Screenshots leave out audio messages and gifs (to a certain extend) but it is at least something. (And I just realised that with Signal it&#x27;s actually possible to download individual audio messages and video so that a later reconstitution is possible if tedious.)<p>However, what would be great is to indeed have a way to backup messages including stickers, audio, videos etc. in a more high-fidelity way to relive important converations.')
