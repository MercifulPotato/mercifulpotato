It exists at every company I&#x27;ve ever worked at, and will exist anywhere there is money, power, and status at stake in the decision making process.<p>My suggestion is to find a company where you can accept and work within that company&#x27;s dysfunction, and stay put as long as you have a positive career path there. Every company is dysfunctional in some way, from small startups to large public corporations. As long as there are people involved there is going to be some form dysfunction and politics.<p>This is actually why I didn&#x27;t mind he transition from IC to management, because even though I code less, I have the ability to influence the decision making process and improve day-to-day for everybody who reports to me.')
