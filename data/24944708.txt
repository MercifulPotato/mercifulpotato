But I find simply right-clicking a couple and telling it to stop recommending them is very effective at undoing that.<p><i>&gt; it seems like Youtube&#x27;s algo gets quite quickly to the local minimum&#x2F;maximum but then struggles to look around or away from it.</i><p>I&#x27;ve observed this too. Sometimes I feels like I have watched every single synthesizer video ever uploaded to YouTube. But I don&#x27;t consider that an entirely bad thing. There&#x27;s something to be said for a service with an engagement ceiling. If I find myself scrolling too far down to find an interesting video, that&#x27;s a good signal that maybe I should get off YouTube and find something better to do.')
