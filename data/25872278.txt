I&#x27;m not fanatic about it, but I do prefer to know that some care was taken and that worker conditions are at least somewhat decent, and that my clothes didn&#x27;t come from halfway around the globe for no reason.<p>Ideally I would get all my clothes from thrift stores, but I&#x27;ve only really had any luck with shirts.

Look at how much fluff collects in the filter<i>, that is fabric that has been beaten out of your clothes. With that sort of treatment, it&#x27;s no wonder clothes start to look threadbare after a while.<p></i>If you&#x27;re the camping&#x2F;hiking&#x2F;bushcraft type, dryer lint is absolutely amazing tinder, so at least it has some practical use :-)')
