They can also be trained to recognize recognize the difference. There&#x27;s really no such thing as tone deafness.<p>Tone deafness is when you sing something badly, people make fun of you, and you stop trying to sing. Not an option when you speak a tonal language, instead you just learn pitch without realizing you&#x27;re learning pitch, just operating from &quot;feelings&quot; and what &quot;sounds right,&quot; which is of course based on an enormous amount of lifetime feedback.<p>It&#x27;s like how actual blindsight (when the eyes or their connections to the brain are actually damaged or destroyed) is unrecognized echolocation. We are not aware of our own conscious experience, or the processes we go through to reach some of then conclusions we reach.')
