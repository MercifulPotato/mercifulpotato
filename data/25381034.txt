The idea behind it is that it isn&#x27;t the unique fingerprint that is valuable, it is correlation between different captures of the same unique fingerprint that is valuable. So a randomized fingerprint would he unique, but only for one session, and so the data has no value. If anyone understands the reasoning and could explain how I&#x27;m wrong I&#x27;d appreciate it.')
