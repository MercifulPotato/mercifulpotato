The promise of the container revolution was that cross-cutting concerns would be handled by the infrastructure &#x2F; orchestrator, and applications wouldn&#x27;t have to care about details like authentication, monitoring, logging, etc.  None of that really materialized, though.  The actual running&#x2F;scheduling of workloads is currently in a great state, but the cross-cutting concerns are pretty awful.  Or actually, they&#x27;re good, but very much &quot;bring your own&quot;.  I use managed Kubernetes, but it doesn&#x27;t give me managed monitoring, managed logging, managed authentication, etc.  (Cloud providers sell that, but you have to do all the integration work.  Some random Go binary you download won&#x27;t accept Identity Aware Proxy JWTs and send your metrics to Stackdriver.  You have to make that all work yourself.)<p>I&#x27;ve run into the situation at least twice where some app has bought into that mindset and made auth an external factor (don&#x27;t send HTTP requests unless the user is authorized), and found that there was pretty much nothing good to provide that feature.  So... I wrote my own thing both times, and am loving it.  (You could use it too! But I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;jsso2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;jsso2</a>)  I never have to think about auth again.<p>Having also done the infrastructure and library work to get Prometheus&#x2F;Grafana&#x2F;Jaeger&#x2F;Loki doing what I want (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;opinionated-server" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;opinionated-server</a>), I am almost happy with the remaining cross-cutting concerns.  I am ever closer to my &quot;1 hour app&quot;, where I can just type in some code and have a fully-working production-quality app available to users.  I&#x27;m not there, but I&#x27;m getting closer by the year.<p>(Sometimes I wonder if we were wrong to totally get rid of the &quot;just rsync some PHP files to a server&quot; model.  There were good things and bad things going on there; we should bring the good things back.)')
