But this false feeling of generality is dangerous because it leads to a feeling of why-bother. Current levels of toxicity, while bad enough to produce symptoms, at least aren&#x27;t fatal. Why-bother would kill the community if it spread.<p>&gt; selective, arbitrary enforcement of rules<p>HN moderation is inconsistent in one way but consistent in another—call them strong and weak consistency. Strong consistency would be &quot;every post that breaks the guidelines gets moderated in the same way&quot;. That would require moderators to read all the posts, and there are far too many for that to be feasible. Weak consistency would be &quot;when a post does get moderated, the mods do it consistently and even-handedly&quot;. That&#x27;s at least possible, and what we&#x27;re shooting for. We don&#x27;t get everything right but we&#x27;re open to hearing about and fixing our mistakes.<p>If you see a post that ought to have been moderated but hasn&#x27;t been, the likeliest explanation is that we didn&#x27;t see it [2]. (You can help by flagging it or emailing us at hn@ycombinator.com.)<p>&gt; why was my reply flagged, but the comment I replied to, which you also cited as violating the guidelines, was not flagged?<p>Users flagged one more than the other. Your post violated the guidelines worse, so I don&#x27;t think that was unfair.<p>&gt; this whole submission seems to be a strange time to be pedantic about enforcing the guidelines<p>That&#x27;s not how moderation works. When users break the guidelines and we see it, we ask them not to. Keep in mind that we don&#x27;t necessarily read the threads in order—sometimes we do, but other times we&#x27;re looking in via more random-access views. The guidelines don&#x27;t change relative to the submission, so I don&#x27;t see why moderation should.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dat...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=likeliest%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=likeliest%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=...</a>')
