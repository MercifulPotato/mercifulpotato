Item(by='vel0city', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609192082, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563524, text='Lots of license plates these days have high contrast between the letters and the background. These license plates are often usually covered in retroreflectors such that the high contrast is accentuated with any kind of light. A strong IR light source from an IR camera can probably read most clean license plates driving by without being obvious to the people being viewed. Remember that light follows the inverse square law, so if you&#x27;re far away you&#x27;ll probably need a pretty bright IR source to get a good high contrast read from a far away license plate, along with pretty good optics&#x2F;sensor to reliably read the plate.')
