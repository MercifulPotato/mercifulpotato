The margins will be so razor-thin that there won&#x27;t be any room to risk on innovation.<p>This is because they don&#x27;t care to improve discovery on their store front. It&#x27;s always been awful, it will continue to be awful. There will be virtually no quality control to speak of, with sudden and opaque decisions to remove products, and so on...<p>Recall that in the very early days of the Android app store it was flush with $20 games, and effectively absent of stolen content, adware and spyware. Look at it now.<p>The two major improvements that it might have over the App Store experience would be an absence of asset-ripped &quot;clones&quot; (read: your APK is ripped, minorly re-branded, and re-uploaded with a similar name), and perhaps far less malicious software, because access to the local device will be limited.')
