Then for pointers to the allocated storage, just use a subscript on the array name.<p>Even today people do the same thing in languages like Java and Rust as workarounds for performance or semantic constraints of the environment while still nominally obeying language semantics. I assume the same phenomenon is true in the C# universe.<p>When you bring this up many users of those languages are quick to explain why array indices are safer than managing raw memory addresses from outside the language&#x27;s object model, but let&#x27;s not go there ;)')
