When starting at a FAANG you&#x27;ll often receive a high but not outrageous compensation package with equity making up 20-30% of compensation.  4 years later the equity will often have compounded by 20-40% annually yielding the TC packages you see today.<p>In another industry with stock that appreciates slowly or depreciates over time, the model wouldn&#x27;t yield the same packages.  The company buys your equity grant when you start, and has limited incentive to renegotiate&#x2F;fight over the outsized reward.')
