Item(by='serf', descendants=None, kids=[25820308], score=None, time=1610927970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25812219, text='I don&#x27;t get it.<p>1) People on HN say the person isn&#x27;t educated, so you link her degrees in varying fields (not statistics or epidemiology).<p>2) People on HN say that those fields are irrelevant to her work, so you explain their relevance to the field of statistics.<p>3) People say on HN that credentials don&#x27;t matter as long as you&#x27;re doing the work of a data scientist, at which point you declare the importance of a relevant degree to the field.<p>So, which is it that draws importance? The college-level education of any kind, or the credentials that establish the doctor?<p>I find your opinions to be largely at-odds with one another.<p>Personally : I don&#x27;t care at all about credentials if the quality is there. With regards to this specific case, i&#x27;ll wait until the facts are in -- but it rubs me the wrong way that authorities don&#x27;t want to speak of her charges even though she&#x27;s available and willing to cooperate from what I read in the article.<p>P.S. I share your pain with those that edit comments in a dishonest way post-reply. It&#x27;s a real problem on HN.')
