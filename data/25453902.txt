It results in causal connections between parts of your codebase that are not reflected in the control flow of your code. If you have immutable unidirectional data flow causal relationships between parts of your code base must be reified in the control flow of the language.<p><pre><code>  Most components do not have any async effects.\n</code></pre>\nAt least when using Apollo &#x2F; GraphQL almost every component ends up with async effects.<p>I think this talk by Andre Staltz is the best explanation and solution of the problem <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SXdtrhn8iII" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SXdtrhn8iII</a>')
