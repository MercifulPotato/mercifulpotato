Most people don&#x27;t use Telegram or Signal which I do. Not to mention a lot of geeks have their favorite way of being contacted (slack, wire, etc).<p>And of course all that will have change in a few years. Before you had to have facebook. When in Asia, it was lime or something else.<p>As soon as you have a lot diversity in your life, text messages are the only thing that works all the time, plus they are free in my country.<p>In fact, iMessage is basically sending text messages without the user knowing they do if the other hand is not an Apple device.<p>In the end, I suspect text messages will still be here in 10 years, and all people around me asking to subscribe to yet another chat service will have change 3 times (and lose their contact list in the process).')
