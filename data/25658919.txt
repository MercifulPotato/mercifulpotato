In many situations that isn&#x27;t the statistic you actually care about.<p>(For the avoidance of doubt: my previous comment wasn&#x27;t trying to claim that the &quot;statistical value of a life&quot;, measured in such a way, is a good measure of how much a person values their life in non-monetary terms, or anything like that. I was just objecting to the <i>specific</i> claim I was responding to, namely that the &quot;statistical value of a life&quot; is measuring only its value <i>as a future income stream</i>.)<p>Very very crudely, the value of a small gain in money is something like inversely proportional to the amount you have already, which means that the value of a given amount of wealth increases something like logarithmically with the amount of money, and either of these means that financial institutions like markets care about people&#x27;s interests roughly proportionally to their wealth. Everything in this paragraph is pure handwaving, but I find it a useful intuition.')
