Although it covers the same, but I like its presentation much better than the video course.<p>Nisam&#x2F;Schocken: &quot;The Elements of Computing Systems&quot;<p>I have only finished the hardware part, so far, but skimming the rest I can&#x27;t find Tetris anywhere. Is that really missing, although it&#x27;s in the title?<p>(I know that you can program Tetris on the machine you build in the course, but is it an exercise somewhere?')
