Like, how science about animal cognition and behaviour for a long time took utmost care not to compare any behaviour or thought processes of animals with those of humans - because after all, we can never know whether or not an animal experiences things the same way as a human does, so we must not jump to conclusions assuming that they do.<p>Oddly, jumping to the opposite conclusion - that they don&#x27;t - is perfectly acceptable and is used to justify all kinds of horrible treatment.')
