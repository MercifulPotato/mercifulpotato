You can piece components together (yay, standards!) and I did exactly this for the IETF&#x27;s XMPP deployment recently. But it&#x27;s far from being a cohesive easy-to-deploy product. Simply because nobody is building that right now. It takes time and resources and there&#x27;s no money in it.[1]<p>People who do set out to build Slack clones (projects like Mattermost and Rocket Chat) and earn money don&#x27;t have features such as federation on their priority list and don&#x27;t build on top of Matrix&#x2F;XMPP. They roll their own custom protocols and as far as I can see they are fairly content with that decision.<p>[1] There&#x27;s even less money it, but nevertheless I am currently working on such a self-hostable &quot;package&quot; for XMPP. However rather than focusing on the team chat use-case (Slack&#x2F;etc.) I&#x27;m focusing on personal messaging (WhatsApp&#x2F;etc.): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snikket.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snikket.org&#x2F;</a> if you&#x27;re interested. It&#x27;s possible I will broaden the scope one day.<p>EDIT: typo')
