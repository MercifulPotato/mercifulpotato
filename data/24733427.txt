Item(by='scubbo', descendants=None, kids=[24733934, 24733580, 24734263], score=None, time=1602271224, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24732828, text='&gt; it&#x27;s long been obvious that &quot;This is wrong&#x2F;bad [quote]&quot; just serves to further spread the propaganda and raise the propaganda artist&#x27;s profile.<p>This has never been obvious to me, and I continue to be confused by it as a position. It seems similar to &quot;don&#x27;t respond to anyone making blatantly false&#x2F;harmful claims on discussion forums, because engaging with them just encourages them and spreads their message&quot;. In fact, in the Twitter case, it&#x27;s even _more_ nonsensical to me - because the audience in a forum is general (and so, is likely to contain folks who are &quot;on the fence&quot; or who agree with the troll), but your Twitter followers are, by definition, those who hold similar opinions to you (and so, are likely to agree with your &quot;takedown&quot;).<p>I&#x27;m not saying that you&#x27;re wrong (I&#x27;ve seen enough apparently-smart people espousing this opinion to convince me that <i>I&#x27;m</i> the one missing something), I&#x27;m saying that I don&#x27;t understand it. Can you help me understand what I&#x27;m missing?')
