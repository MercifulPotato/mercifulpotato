So much low hanging fruit in hospitals and  doctors offices alike. I think automating things like forms has a lot of value, although calculating it that way is not the most accurate lol.<p>The problem you’re dealing with is largely because programmers aren’t involved in the healthcare space or administration, and the admin aren’t aware of how much money or time ideas such as documented APIs could save. I think it would be awesome if healthcare systems would hire programmers solely for the purpose of problem solving, maybe let them run loose inside a hospital or something :). The state of overlap between healthcare and programming is tiny, probably on the order of 1 percent of either population have a meaningful connection. If we’re to actually get any meaningful interaction, Im guessing it’ll have to be done through top down hiring.')
