We didn&#x27;t in the past, and I like the present much better: it frees me up while writing and reviewing code to not have to think about formatting. Almost everyone I talk to feels the same way.<p>It&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable at first when you can&#x27;t use your favorite style anymore, but the advantage of not having to think about style for me vastly outweighs the advantage of being able to code in my personal favorite style.')
