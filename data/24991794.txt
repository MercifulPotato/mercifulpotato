Why do you think these kids act out with violence?<p>Bullies are highly manipulative and work the system. Constant, low-level harassment makes the victim a squeaky wheel that the local authorities ignore, or even makes the authority figures appear to the victim as working with the bully. Undermining trust in the system is part of how bullies operate in general.<p>I was systematically bullied in grades 3-4 by a group of about a half-dozen classmates in a NYC Public School. I never struck and rarely spoke up -- in fact I was terrified to go to school, and would invent illnesses or hide in the bathroom to avoid lunch. Guess who had a disciplinary record? Me. One time I literally ambushed -- a kid jumped on me from on top of an iron fence and beat me with a metal bar. 2 &quot;witnesses&quot; said I attacked him and I was suspended. My parents were called to some bureaucrat&#x27;s office and threatened them with expulsion. They don&#x27;t like squeaky wheels.<p>I was fortunate that a science teacher took notice and was skeptical. He took me under his wing, arranged for me to eat lunch in the science room, and did something to get those kids away from me. In some ways, he saved my life and I am eternally grateful for that man caring enough and sticking his head up to do the right thing when he didn&#x27;t have to.')
