It seems like most of that society&#x27;s energy was concentrated on building this bridge, and physical infrastructure of that nature.  Its best minds and hands were at work.<p>Similarly, in San Francisco, many people live in 100 year old houses.  It&#x27;s not like we discovered better &quot;must have&quot; ways of building houses that made the old ones obsolete.<p>I honestly think things like the Linux kernel (going on 25 years) and LLVM (going on nearly 20 years) will still be around in 100 or 500 years, and basically nobody will have the time or a reason to rebuild them.  Kind of like the PC BIOS is still around.<p>People won&#x27;t really be working much in those areas, but rather on top.  Just like we kind of build &quot;on top&quot; of houses now.  It&#x27;s infrastructure that we can use to make progress in other areas.  It reminds me of &quot;How Buildings Learn&quot; by Stewart Brand.')
