I&#x27;d heard rumors they&#x27;d burned through the $100mm USD donation already but didn&#x27;t want to believe them.<p>Is there any indication that applying capital to the problems we&#x27;re seeing will fix them?<p>I want to help, but only in a way that will be effective in improving the situation.  If they already have enough money, giving them more will not.  If they don&#x27;t have enough money following a $100mm USD donation, it&#x27;s possible that giving them more will not.')
