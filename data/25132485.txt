If your payoff is 10% and you&#x27;re  also losing out on 2% to opportunity cost.  Net winning is (10% * 0.9 - 2%) = 7% but your withdrawal fee is effectively reducing your winnings from 8% or 7% a loss of 12.5%.<p>On the other if the bet paid 100% of your money you would net (100% * 0.9 - 2%)  = 88% and your fee dropped you from 98% to 88% a net loss of 10.2%.<p>PS: These numbers get much worse if the withdrawal fee includes the principle.  Then you would be have a net loss of (110% * 0.9 - 2%) =  3% on the first bet and a net gain of 78% on the second.')
