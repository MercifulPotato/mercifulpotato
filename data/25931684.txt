The price of goods at Walmart is not based on your bet on supply and demand.<p>If there are more buyers than sellers, the price goes up.  If there are more sellers than buyers, the price goes down.  If a business wants to raise money by issuing new shares, supply and demand will dictate the price.<p>The market doesn&#x27;t need uninvested third parties sitting outside the ring gambling on the supply and demand outcome in order to set a price.')
