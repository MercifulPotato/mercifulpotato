The funny thing is that you can edit posts, but you can&#x27;t save them on the server. In fact, you can save a local copy of a site built with TW, but it becomes your own copy. You can go to the settings and hide the save button. Not sure if you can totally disable it thou.<p>What I like about this model vs. others is that it&#x27;s entirely self-contained in a single file. As long as you have a browser that supports Javascript, you can work with it. And as much as I like modern tools like Obsidian, TW pretty much guarantees me that if I save 1,000 tiddlers on a file (up to 100K are known to be possible), 20-30 years from now, as long as HTML and Javascript are still capable of being ran somewhere, my entire knowledge base will be there.<p>Heck, other than some Unicode issues I have, my entire site is happily in archive.org as a single, snappy file right now...')
