I agree with you that in the broader sciences this is a different debate. That said I do not share the distain for the &quot;softer&quot; sciences often found in the hard sciences. -- a bit of the side note I find the disregard for softer sciences much stronger among engineers than scientists. It seems to me that engineers are often much more outcome focused in their work, while e.g. physicist are much more tolerant towards research towards expanding knowledge which they also apply to other fields')
