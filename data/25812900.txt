Microsoft has known it for years: to be successful with enterprise accounts, people matter.  Account managers, sales&#x2F;support engineers, direct access to product teams (sometimes).  I&#x27;ve never worked with Amazon&#x2F;AWS but from what I&#x27;ve heard anecdotally, they are of the same mindset.  (It would be consistent with Bezos&#x27; customer service mantra so perhaps unsurprising).<p>I know of only 2 colleagues who&#x27;ve looked at GCP.  Both are medium-large financial institutions.  Both said they had very little human-to-human contact with Google representatives.  In one case they chose AWS instead; the other is still evaluating GCP.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that other posts in the thread are complimentary about the quality of the GCP products.  I can believe that; Google has built its fair share of impressive technology.  But I see no evidence of an enterprise supplier I could trust: one that would be there to help out when the world went belly up.  Given that, it doesn&#x27;t matter how good their products are.<p>I&#x27;d actually like to see GCP being successful.  As well as bringing some competition and diversity to the market, it would give Google a more honest and above-board revenue stream than ads.  I don&#x27;t see that happening though, at least not without a change in leadership.')
