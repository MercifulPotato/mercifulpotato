Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25808080, 25808074], score=None, time=1610856508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807656, text='&quot;We don&#x27;t want no government run healthcare, and keep your goddam hands of my medicare!&quot; - angry person at Obama rally, 2008.<p>Watching the comment boards on all of the various sites, it was hilarious to see FoxNews commenters recently rally behind Trump&#x27;s $2K last minute populist wrench-in-the-works veto threat&#x2F;demand.<p>All of a sudden &#x27;empathy for working people&#x27; became a really important issue!<p>It was always there of course among rank and file working class, they just needed someone &#x27;patriotic!&#x27; to say it.<p>And then the other articles would lament socialism with bated breath.<p>I&#x27;m not taking sides here, other than to point out this one very specific and recent populist issue very viscerally demonstrated how this can happen.<p>I should say it&#x27;s also not entirely duplicitous, the same policy can be arrived at via different principles. In particular, populist-Constitutionalism can be a funny thing when it clashes with ideology, for example, the 1st Amendment doesn&#x27;t protect &#x27;free speech&#x27; at all in the way people think it does, many are surprised to learn.<p>Edit: I should add, in the months leading up to the budgetary standoff, as &#x27;one party&#x27; was pushing hard for said stimulus checks, there was no support at all among the Fox News commenting section, at least from my observance. And then when some &#x27;other person supported it&#x27; the support was loud and clear.')
