You give me a fragment of Scala code using implicits it might be hard to know _what_ is going to happen. Similarly, having a bunch of namespaces (or, perhaps more importantly, leaning into them and having many name overlaps) just means that it&#x27;s harder to read a single code fragment and know what it&#x27;s going to do.<p>Though I&#x27;m pretty partial to the argument that, like..... yeah you&#x27;re going to call a function so the name refers to a function. But without extra symbols around this concept to help the reader, in this age it seems like a concept that is hard to take advantage of.')
