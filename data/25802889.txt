Only downside is that you need to write them in Groovy but the payoff is that the JenkinsFile reduces to basically a function call or two per stage which makes it super clean + it makes JenkinsFiles more or less &quot;standard&quot; (because there is practically no project-specific stuff in it - the complexity is managed by the library functions). This approach has made fixing issues or enhancements so much more easier for us.')
