We were all using desktops or fairly clunky laptops. Then, out of nowhere, we have touchscreens, cameras, maps, etc AND the power of a desktop machine, in a device that&#x27;s 1&#x2F;20th the size! It was such a staggering leap!<p>I was around when it came out. There was no staggering leap. The first iPhone was nowhere near desktop power and the camera wasn’t meaningfully better than what was available in other high-end “feature phones” or the blackberry.<p>The major breakthrough was the real browser and the capacitive touchscreen. It didn’t even have an App Store.')
