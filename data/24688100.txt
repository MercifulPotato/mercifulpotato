Typing isn&#x27;t bad but it&#x27;s sometimes tough to get your fingers at the right starting positions for touch typing. I put a few tactile stickers on the keyboard to help. Otherwise it is very comfortable.<p>In my experience, I&#x27;ve found a MS Surface and a gooseneck ipad holder is a lightweight ideal laydown desk. I clamp the gooseneck a few feet above me in bed and I can lay perfectly flat and have access to a full PC.<p>It also can be disassembled and stored in moments.')
