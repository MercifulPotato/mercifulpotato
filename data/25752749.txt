This works out to something like 1 in 300.<p>Since the fatalities skew heavily toward the elderly, in practice this means if everyone catches Covid, most people are unlikely to have a close personal friend or relative who dies as a result of the disease.  Sounds not too bad, right?<p>A fatality rate of 0.3% also means that if everyone in the United States catches it, a million people will die.  We&#x27;re coming up on the equivalent of a 9&#x2F;11 every day (though again, skewing heavily toward the elderly).  You can&#x27;t rely on personal experience to put these kinds of numbers into perspective.')
