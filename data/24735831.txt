A dancer would almost certainly exert more energy, so let&#x27;s optimistically double that to 10 watts per step. Let&#x27;s also assume the dancer steps an average of two times a second, for a total of 20 watts of power. Finally, let&#x27;s assume you&#x27;re able to harvest all energy from the step.<p>Adafruit recommends 20mA as rule-of-thumb for estimating NeoPixel energy usage at 5V [2], so let&#x27;s say a NeoPixel requires a little under 1W.<p>You could probably run 20 LEDs during a dance routine in this. While the wireless part is more exotic, it is likely doable.<p>Of course, the form of dance will determine how many LEDs you can include. Perhaps your dancer outfit is best suited for Riverdance...<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pavegen.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pavegen.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.adafruit.com&#x2F;adafruit-neopixel-uberguide&#x2F;powering-neopixels#estimating-power-requirements-2894486-11" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.adafruit.com&#x2F;adafruit-neopixel-uberguide&#x2F;power...</a>')
