It will improve your projects, and help your enjoyment of your hobby. The tools also hold some sort of residual value.<p>If your hobby is building AI&#x2F;ML models, a one-shot trained model isn’t going to really help you on an ongoing basis. It’s an amazing single shot project, but if your hobby is actually ML then you probably aren’t going to be happy just looking at your completed trained model - you are going to want to train a bigger, better model.<p>And if your hobby is building software, you can just download a pre-trained model for free.<p>I don’t think the analogy holds the other way.')
