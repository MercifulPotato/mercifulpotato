Did you wear masks last year for fun and pleasure?  Do you think re-breathing your exhaled is a good idea?  From my personal experience, I can only report minor negative effects.  I certainly don&#x27;t think anyone operating machinery (eg drivers) should be wearing one.<p>Surgeons wearing masks for a period of time during an operation is not the same thing.
