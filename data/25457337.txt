So I am used to the media making fun of me, or people like me and my family.<p>At 40 it seems just normal, you know? &quot;Ha! christians are so backward-thinking close-minded goofus people&quot; is a recurring trope and even I will laugh if the joke is funny. I also recognize that a lot of the mocking is well deserved. People like that do exist and they do harm.<p>But, recently I&#x27;ve been noting how Hollywood and media in general is bent on not showing any kind of positive representation of christians.<p>Take the Tolkien biopic (2019) for example, where there&#x27;s not even a passing mention of him being a Catholic and the great importance theology and religion had on his work and on his life. I&#x27;m now  expecting the new Amazon LOTR series to tone-down or even subvert the obvious christian motifs of Tolkien own works.<p>Another example is A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019), based on the life of Mr. Rogers. Like I said, I grew up in Mexico and I didn&#x27;t know anything about Fred Rogers, but 15 minutes into the movie I was incredulous on how saintly the man was portrayed to be. Turns out he was not only a Christian but a presbyterian minister, something which the movie goes greats lengths to &quot;hide&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not saying people should not make negative portrayals of christians (or any other religious group), but come on, wouldn&#x27;t be great to have a positive representation of a christian minister who is good and kind and very anti-racist? I guess we&#x27;ll never know.')
