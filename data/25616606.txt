Some posts up someone defined it in eco science terms. Some people define it via the consumer price index. The consumer price index is what governments and and companies use in salary negotiations. So for people, the consumer price index is what drives their salary. If this consumer price index is not adequately factoring in the price of houses (cost of housing) or stocks (price of saving for retirement), than they are skewed. Salaries will trail behind rising cost aka. my generation is basing social status on smartphones instead of houses, because we can&#x27;t afford houses.<p>Now, low interest rates play an important counter role: it is cheaper to finance a house.  It due to the increased prices, it takes a lot longer. Combine that with the fact that my generation deals with less worker rights and job safety (they call it flexibility) and the fact that I have now seen two once in a lifetime economic crisis within 12 years ... It&#x27;s getting quite hard to sign that 40 year finance plan.<p>There is however a solution to this, which is to leave the cities and move to the countryside, where I can build a house on a plot of land that used to be part of my grandma&#x27;s farm. Not everybody is that lucky tough and not everybody can a find a job there or work remote. Hell, I&#x27;m not sure if I can, given that the internet there is still copper based.<p>In my opinion the issue is that to much money goes into buying existing things and to little money goes into creating new things. QE and other gov. measures seem to be going mostly into propping up prices of existing values, so the ones who own them don&#x27;t lose virtual money.')
