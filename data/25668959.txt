I use sms or an in-house service to communicate with colleagues. I only use WhatsApp with my gf. I don&#x27;t have fb or Instagram. What effect does this policy change have on me? Obviously, fb will receive some data on me and my communications with my gf, connecting me to her (extensive) network on fb, but how worried should I be ?')
