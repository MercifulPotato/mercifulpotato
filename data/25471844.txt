Item(by='bentcorner', descendants=None, kids=[25474031], score=None, time=1608324860, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25469520, text='&gt; <i>I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m actually totally confused as to how that even works</i><p>I subbed for a few months and have never played CP2077 but here&#x27;s the high level overview:<p>You buy games on Steam&#x2F;Epic&#x2F;Ubisoft game store as normal.<p>In the GeForce Now client, you pick the game you want to play (and on which storefront).  When you &quot;launch&quot; it, NVidia spins up a VM, configuring it to launch the storefront you selected with your game, and connects a remote stream to your local client.  You sign into Steam&#x2F;Epic&#x2F;Ubisoft (usually only needed the first time per storefront), and you &quot;install&quot; the game and play it.<p>It works pretty well.  If you don&#x27;t have cutting edge hardware and don&#x27;t mind a few ms of latency, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.<p>Only caveat is that I would not use it to play shooters that require quick reflexes.')
