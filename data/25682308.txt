You do want to follow the law, right?<p>There were all audits requested as done by law, some states had multiple recounts done, all with the same result. At some point asking for more and more recounts when you don&#x27;t like the original several becomes ridiculous. These audits were done in many cases by lifetime Republicans.<p>Trump had 60+ opportunities to present fraud in court. He did not provide actual fraud in any single case, this he lost them all. He presented nonsense and no evidence and hearsay and handwaving, which is why every judge, even Trump appointed judges told him so. In PA, Trump appointed federal judge even dismissed the case with prejudice it was so ridiculous, and now in multiple states the lawyers presenting those cases without evidence are facing legal consequences.<p>And, no matter how or what happened, there is also a legal time window to resolve it in. That window is over. There is zero legal method to do so now - consider the statute of limitation has passed.<p>At some point you become an adult and realize this is the law. Claiming to be the law and order party should give you some respect for the law, but apparently it does not.<p>So - do you now want to no longer follow the law when it doesn&#x27;t suit you?')
