They are both several years old and have a decent number of contributors.<p>IMHO, a lot of Mithril code looks like React code. Things like eslint&#x2F;tsconfig can be setup equally strictly regardless.<p>Having seen some truly gargatuan React apps, I&#x27;d actually argue that neither React nor Mithril do much to enforce structure aside from the componentization aspect (which, to be fair, is a big part of it).<p>Ember, for example, is arguably far more prescriptive with regards to code structure consistency.<p>What I do think is true of React and similar libraries&#x2F;frameworks (think mithril, but also vue, svelte, etc) is that once you setup a structure of your liking, the path of least resistance tends to also be the happy path, i.e. even &quot;copy-paste&quot; programming generally ends up resulting in always making reasonably sized components, always using the state management mechanism idiomatically, etc.')
