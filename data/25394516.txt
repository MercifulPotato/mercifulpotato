A distributed system may solve the money issues of (b), but the legal ramifications of child exploitation will chill any unmoderated distributed system. For (c), because of the first amendment, I&#x27;m not sure what political regulation is possible (see Citizen&#x27;s United). The government probably can&#x27;t regulate YouTube&#x27;s free speech (hosting videos) even if that limits other peoples speech (on their platform).<p>I think one solution would be a distributed but <i></i>not private<i></i> video peer-to-peer hosting system. Perhaps like a public IPFS? Speech would protected against government intervention, but without privacy it could be easily policed. I don&#x27;t think a peer-to-peer system will gain any traction if it is possible to host illicit content that the government could punish you over, so that&#x27;s why I raise those points.')
