Reddit sleuthing is all good and fun but it should not be trusted at face value (or at all, really) when there are real people and real consequences on the line.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d rather tell people to learn to judge evidence and the analytical thought that goes into making the conclusions.<p>Implied in this position is that you have to be skeptical of reddit sleuthing until you have a reason not to be. The problem is that people are _not_ skeptical of reddit sleuthing because there is a &quot;We did it reddit!&quot; attitude that the platform is super capable and should be believed by default. You and GP are both warning against that.')
