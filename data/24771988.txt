Item(by='elmo2you', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602636076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24771423, text='&gt;The bottom line is that unfortunately Russia is perceived to be like a bully against its neighbouring countries in its West and North-West because of its words and actions. If it stopped doing the needless bullying, maybe those neighbouring countries wouldn&#x27;t be so fast to point the finger at Russia.<p>Sure, that&#x27;s really the reason. As with everything above it, you may want to hone your skills in differentiating propaganda from (corroborated) facts.<p>As for the cases you mentioned, there certainly are doubts about (deep) involvement of Russia. For starters because most of the purported evidence really does raise questions about its reliability and in some cases has been shown to not add up. Mind you, I&#x27;m not saying this means Russia is innocent. Just that the evidence is inconclusive and in some cases highly questionable (at best).<p>You of course can frame any such doubts as if all &quot;evidence&quot; is just categorically going to be rejected or denied, but that will on you. I don&#x27;t know how long you have been around and whether you&#x27;ve moved around a lot, but after decades of rather &quot;hands on&quot; experience with how NATO member (often on USA command) have done all kind of (increasingly) questionable things to further their agenda. If you can say with a straight face that this organization to not lie or produces falsified evidence, than you&#x27;ve clearly have little actual experience with being on the receiving end of their efforts.<p>Please do take into account that it is you who is talking like there is an already established fact, that Russia is as bad as you claim, while in reality all of that is derived from rather questionable assertions and in more than a few cases obvious propaganda.<p>I don&#x27;t claim that Russia is good or bad. That&#x27;s a complicated discussion and a whole different story, which sadly can hardly be had with most Americans anyways, because the majority is already too presumptuous and indoctrinated to even have a level and honest discussion about it.<p>What this is about is if there is credible evidence that Russia is (to a high degree of likelihood) guilty of the things you claim(ed) about them. To the best of my knowledge, the answer to that is a clear no. In fact, all I have seen regarding that for the last two decades or so, has been (pretty much without exception) propaganda, framed, falsified or otherwise not passing the bar of credibility.<p>But feel free to believe otherwise. I&#x27;m pretty sure that time will teach you. Especially since the apparatus that has been pushing all this garbage, is slow but surely creeping towards its inevitable demise. There will be a lot of skeletons falling from closets, you better believe it. In fact, you&#x27;d be lucky when those who have suffered from these &quot;games&quot; (and many innocent citizens certainly have) will be forgiving when the full extend of this shit show really comes to light. It will pale both Wikileaks and Snowden in comparison.')
