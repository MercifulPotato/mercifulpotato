If your editor gets it wrong, you can just fix it. If your compiler gets it wrong, you might get an error message, or weird behavior.<p>This is, for example, a major philosophy behind Rust&#x27;s well-regarded error messages. The compiler <i>rarely</i> makes this kind of choice behind your back- instead, in reports an error message with a suggested fix-up for what it <i>thinks</i> you mean (and editor integration can apply those automatically).<p>Then the program source remains unambiguous and clear, there are fewer ways to confuse readers, but you still get all the benefits of &quot;if your editor can do that, so could the compiler.&quot;')
