You&#x27;re not supposed to leverage a monopoly in one area into others.  It&#x27;s near impossible to compete with such companies.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine any sane person would say that Google&#x27;s search itself is a problem.<p>It was the same problem with MSFT when they tried to leverage their monopoly in OS into browsers, apps.')
