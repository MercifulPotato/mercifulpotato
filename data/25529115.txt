I had read the book in the days they were published and found them damn good in their realm, but when I heard that there was a TV serial about it, I didn&#x27;t even bother giving it a try. Then hype started, but hype has a negative influence on me, it is the best to get me not to watch&#x2F;read&#x2F;listen&#x2F;do something :-) .<p>So it was only after a number of years that I started watching the serial. I had no hope for it, but I found the first episodes unexpectedly great, and then again and again. Well of course, as usual it went down when the book material went thin and finally ran out, and ended in a wreck, but still the first seasons were up to the hype. The only thing I may have against it is the abuse of colour filters: a cheap, too cheap, trick to build a mood, give a graphical style, or like in this case indicate a setting, that way too many directors use and abuse.')
