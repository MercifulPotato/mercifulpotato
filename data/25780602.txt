I have been to 30 countries including North Korea and most of the Stans-- and the Bay Area, specifically SF&#x2F;Oakland&#x2F;Berkeley is the Hall of Fame for sketchy and unsafe.  I suppose New York in the 80&#x27;s was worse...but currently seems like Bay Area.  I stayed at a rather swanky Hilton in SF but all night listened to the sounds of homeless people fighting outside-- it was very dystopian.')
