One time I spent an entire evening trying to configure a server that refused to work, I kept on tweaking the config files and restarting it repeatedly, at least 20 times or so, before finding out that the feature I needed was broken. I joined the IRC channel and ranted &quot;I literally wanted to throw my computer out of the window&quot;. Someone said I was overreacting, I repied I don&#x27;t have any problem with the software or its developer, just frustrated by the broken feature itself. One day later, I debugged it, submitted a patch and got it merged.')
