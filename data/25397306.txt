But this requires control over your grammar which you might not have i.e. you are parsing a standardized programming language. Practically speaking, unless you want two separate parsing engines in your IDE, that Lisps are actually LL(1) and Python and Java are &quot;almost LL(1)&quot; doesn&#x27;t get you closer to parsing C++.<p>Packrat parsers are equivalent to arbitrary lookahead in either LL or LR grammars.')
