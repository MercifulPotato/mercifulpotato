When the pandemic started, a lot of ecommerce brands were clamping down on budgets. Shortly after the CARES act was passed, suddenly revenue for a lot of my clients started to skyrocket, especially those in the food industry (some were making what they made over the course of a year in a few months) but soon also to discretionary industries like apparel and beauty. Ever since, I&#x27;ve been seeing large-scale projects to agencies we work with being pushed through without hesitation and of course business has been growing at a much higher clip for my own company versus prior to CARES.<p>I&#x27;m grateful for it, but at the same time I know this is at the expense of many small companies in the restaurant and travel space, and all the labor they employ too, so that&#x27;s pretty depressing. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sustainable so I expect my own luck to turn around eventually.<p>I don&#x27;t think things will change much in the next 6 months though with another potential stimulus check on the horizon and at least until some of the state-level measures to reduce the spread of COVID are reversed (possibly with vaccines widely available?)')
