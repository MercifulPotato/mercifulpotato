The 7.5k fed credit, the 2500 CA tax credit, mandated charging stations, solar subsidies, HOV sticker, upcoming mpg mandate - all of this was necessary to support Tesla. I literally bought electric for the HOV sticker that comes with it. I feel like I am losing respect for Elon everyday, even though I own two Teslas.')
