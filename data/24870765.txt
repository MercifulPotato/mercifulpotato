I&#x27;ve gotten several offers from French companies for Sr. Engineer roles and the problem isn&#x27;t that your developers are lazy - it&#x27;s that software companies in France don&#x27;t pay anywhere near market wages compared to the rest of the globe. Last year I was offered the equivalent of US 70K to take on an ambitious Sr. Eng. Role. That&#x27;s less than half what I&#x27;d expect in the states.')
