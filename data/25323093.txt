I&#x27;d bought hundreds of servers there over the years (with cost being a main factor) and it tended to be the Colocrossing ones that&#x27;d be volatile or not last your entire billing period.<p>For specific servers&#x2F;recommendations, I have a few servers with Ramnode (might be a grandfathered service) for $15&#x2F;y. There are a bunch of good providers in that price range but without knowledge of them they can be hit and miss and for the most part makes it worthwhile paying more to worry less about it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talk.lowendspirit.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talk.lowendspirit.com&#x2F;</a>')
