If the profit were to decrease a lot from each transaction then they would be at a position where variable cost becomes more relevant.<p>That is to say Google&#x27;s special place has nothing to do with it being a magical internet company but rather its being in a seller&#x27;s market that they dominate.<p>If it were suddenly to no longer be in a seller&#x27;s market or to have to do stuff like save data longer to get value from it, or to earn much less per search because advertisers didn&#x27;t want to pay, or to find that there are side effects from having too much traffic that ends up decreasing ability to serve relevant data because of signal to noise ratio thus causing a loss of profit etc. etc. we would end up with the cost to Google of a transaction being much closer to what they earn from that transaction.<p>In the last scenario I put up there, which I believe could actually be a problem if you project out infinite growth (search growth) does it become a &quot;major cost&quot;, yes, in such a scenario too much traffic decreases the value of all traffic.<p>In fact too much traffic decreasing the value of all traffic is a well known feature of Internet companies, because internet companies actually use physical devices (just wanted to point that out, since there seems to be this special thing about Internet companies not having physical inventory) to serve their customers or users (depending on which we&#x27;re talking about here) and this is why DDOS is a thing and why even natural spikes in usage can be problematic. So in fact, I would actually say about just about any online company there is - if you project out infinite growth ( of traffic ) does it become a major cost?<p>Um probably, and depending on how that a growth is structured it might in fact be a crippling cost.')
