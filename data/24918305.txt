You can&#x27;t do it for free. It&#x27;s going to <i>have</i> to be ad-supported. But ads are the very opposite of Apple&#x27;s brand.<p>2) And financially, they&#x27;d trade their incredibly lucrative deal with Google for such a high risk? It just doesn&#x27;t seem like something a board would approve.<p>3) The timing of this feels very suspicious, though maybe that&#x27;s just sudden journalist interest rather than leaks... but if you were Google, this is the best thing that could happen to you lawsuit-wise. Can&#x27;t you imagine a conversation one or two years ago? &quot;Hey Apple, OK we&#x27;ll pay you the $8-12 billion, but you also have to spend a little chunk of it -- just $10 million, really -- to credibly claim you&#x27;re &#x27;developing&#x27; your own search engine. Don&#x27;t ever deliver it, just always be &#x27;working&#x27; on it. Cool? Awesome, thanks.&quot;')
