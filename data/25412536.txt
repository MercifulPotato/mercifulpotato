Namely, it only covers losses from hot storage (&lt;2% of holdings) and it doesn&#x27;t cover losses due to compromises of an individual account.<p>&gt; Coinbase prioritizes the security of our customer&#x27;s digital currency through a combination of online “hot storage” and offline “cold” storage. Coinbase maintains 98% or more of customer digital currency in cold storage, with the remainder in secure hot servers as necessary to serve the liquidity needs of our customers. All digital currency that Coinbase holds in its online hot storage is insured. If Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online hot storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.<p>&gt; This insurance policy does not cover any losses resulting from the compromise of your individual Coinbase account. Please note that the insurance policy covers any losses from Coinbase’s hot storage resulting from a breach of Coinbase&#x27;s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft. It is your responsibility to use a strong password and maintain control of all login credentials you use to access Coinbase.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.coinbase.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;coinbase&#x2F;other-topics&#x2F;legal-policies&#x2F;how-is-coinbase-insured" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.coinbase.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;coinbase&#x2F;other-topics&#x2F;legal-pol...</a>')
