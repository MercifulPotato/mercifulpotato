It came out just before Quake 3. It has massive (many km^2) outdoor maps with rolling hills and jetpacks. Early in the alpha the devs and the users figured out that by spamming jump while going down a hill you could &quot;ski&quot; and pick up speed the jet up the next hill to maintain. This bug, skiing, became the central element of the game. And because Tribes allowed client side scripting in a c++ like language you could just use a &quot;jump script&quot; to efficiently ski.<p>Eventually people were building line-rider style FPS maps for skiing starting around 1999.')
