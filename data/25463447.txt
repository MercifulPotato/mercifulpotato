In addition, their closed eco system allows for longer shelf life of their products as they maintain them.<p>Every damn android phone I had, within a year or 2 max, the updates stopped, I would be multiple major versions behind. Android is a disaster as there&#x27;s so many hardware variations and screen sizes. Developing great apps that work on all phones is a pain.<p>Don&#x27;t get me started on Linux where the graphics drivers are just shit. Every thinkpad and other laptop I had always had some issue recognizing external monitors on boot and bugging out. One monitor would work, another wouldn&#x27;t, then the actual laptop display wouldn&#x27;t but a monitor would.<p>Even as a developer and tinker, I got tired of having to spend countless hours fixing bugs and shortcomings of products that should just work.<p>I&#x27;d never own anything but a macbook pro for software development.<p>Apple does it right.')
