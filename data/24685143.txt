So how about they give that a shot? Let&#x27;s put the models to the test and see if they can build something. That is in my opinion a much better approach at evaluating what can be reproduced. If they build something and did so without their academic models, well, then now we need theoreticians to figure out what&#x27;s going on there. To me this seems a more organic approach, where the direction of research is being led by stochastic discoveries fueled by an acceptance of the risks of trial and error. The top-down, directed research approach we have is hard to stomach with inherently biased people at the top, and this type of system will only change its preferences on research directions one funeral at a time. That&#x27;s a lot of time to waste for many many 20 - 30 year olds that have ideas but don&#x27;t have a fighting chance to try.')
