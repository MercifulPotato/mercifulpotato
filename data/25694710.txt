I highly doubt that these bans are going to be effective in terms of curbing undesirable communication. On the other hand, I am confident that they will reinforce perceptions of biased and uneven enforcement.<p>I am also particularly worried that politicians will use the threat of regulation to coerce companies into suppressing political opponents&#x27; messages. The government can&#x27;t directly ban speech, but if they can intimidate platforms into censuring political opponents they will have achieved the same effect. Better, in fact, because the politicians&#x27; agency in this censorship is not visible.')
