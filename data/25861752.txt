It had super half baked networking support and absolutely no concept of multi-user or privilege separation.<p>What need does a personal computer OS have for multi-user support? The median number of users on a personal computer at any given time is 1. Even in the rare case that two or more people want to use the same computer at separate times and desire to protect eachother&#x27;s files from eachother, they can use encryption rather than fake OS enforced security.<p>Privilege separation, in order to keep malicious <i>applications</i> from compromising the user&#x27;s files, has become significantly more important but it wasn&#x27;t that important back then.')
