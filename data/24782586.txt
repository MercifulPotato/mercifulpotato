Nobody ever does bad things just to be evil.  They do them because they honestly believe the end justifies the means.  We tend to give a pass to actions taken toward ends we agree with.  Everybody is the hero of their own story.  Nobody is acting in bad faith.  They just believe that based on the information they have and their experience that the course they are choosing is correct.  Those guys firing AGTMS at each other in the videos we get out of Syria are all trying to create a better world for the next generation.  They just happen to disagree on the details.')
