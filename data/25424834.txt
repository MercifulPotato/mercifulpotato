But if you need doses high enough that you start bumping up against the recommended dose, DEFINITELY talk to your doctor about long-term use and possible kidney &#x2F; liver damage. They may know of a safer solution (possibly an opioid: which has risks of addiction but... its the doctor&#x27;s job to weigh the risks &#x2F; rewards and your various options. Figuring out the right medicine probably requires a decent interview with you).<p>Getting addicted to an opioid might be &quot;lower overall risk&quot; than dying to kidney failure. Its bad options all around, but that&#x27;s why we have doctors to help navigate your options.<p>-------<p>Good luck. I&#x27;ve never experienced chronic pain myself. I just know that being in that state means that you&#x27;re probably not thinking through all your options 100% (just focusing on the pain-relief side of things). Which is why its important to get consultation from a doctor.<p>I know the urgent care facility in my neighborhood does primary care. Search around for urgent care facilities, they accept walk-in appointments. Ideally, you&#x27;d talk to a primary-care physician who has your medical history... but not everyone stays up-to-date with their doctor. (I certainly don&#x27;t, and instead rely upon the urgent care walk-in appointments)')
