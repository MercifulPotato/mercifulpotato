That&#x27;s my guess anyway, what&#x27;s the point of your employer paying 100% tax?<p>It&#x27;s tapered from 100 to 125k, but at no point is your employer paying 100% tax. From 100 to 125k, your marginal tax rate is ~60%, but drops after that point.<p>&gt; Â£500k as a salary is rare, most comp at that level is some sort of bonus.<p>Even with bonuses, or RSU&#x2F;some other form of shares, I think &quot;rare&quot; is understating it, and that&#x27;s exactly the point. The discussion in this thread is that the top performers in FAANG are clearing _well_ above these values (multiples of these numbers).<p>&gt; once they are familiar with the person will bump the rate to whatever.<p>Can you be a little more clear with the &quot;whatever&quot; number? 100k? 500k? 1m?')
