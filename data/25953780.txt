They allow you to buy stock immediately, but that happens (transparently) on margin. Robinhood is loaning you the money to make it happen.<p>Likewise, when you buy or sell a stock, the trade doesn’t settle for t+2 days. Robinhood again transparently loans you the money while waiting for the stock trade to settle.<p>If Robinhood exceeds the SEC-mandated limits for margin they can extend, or their creditors decide it’s too risky to continue loaning them the money, the whole show grinds to a halt. They chose to press the pause button on the primary meme stocks driving them toward this cliff. I imagine the only alternative was to hit the pause button on the entire platform until the credit issue was resolved, but it’s much harder to get additional credit when your service has ground to a halt.')
