This is especially true in non-US countries which are not founded on explicitly liberal principles. The 60s saw the  L. A. Hart and Patrick Lord Devlin debate on the limits of morality&#x27;s place in law.<p>&gt;And great reddit tier red herring about &quot;defining porn.&quot;<p>Not a red herring at all. I frankly do not trust legislators to possess an accurate or up-to-date understanding of what the relvant literature shows, with what confidence, or explanatory power. I also do not trust the blunt force of the law to limit its scope. The Danes probably made erotic fanfiction legal too. Imagine you&#x27;re a fanfiction writer, and your craft is illegalized and you&#x27;re thrown in prison despite the fact that your government could not produce any evidence that your craft causes the harm attributed to other porn. <i>That</i> would be an injustice, and just like the prohibition of alcohol on similar grounds, I can&#x27;t support it unless we&#x27;re clear ahead of time what this means for freedom of expression.')
