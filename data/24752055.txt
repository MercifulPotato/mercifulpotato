I&#x27;d tried to approach this problem with by splitting the track into its different instruments with open_unmix [0], and then using librosa pitch tracking [1], and then cleaned the results, but unfortunately, the midi came out totally unrecognizable.  I thought about approaching this problem again when I saw the recent post on audio source separation [2], but that still only solves the problem of separating the vocals from the instrumental track and into separate instruments.<p>Is there a better&#x2F;more state of the art method to pitch estimation than librosa&#x27;s piptrack, or am I just using piptrack improperly?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sigsep&#x2F;open-unmix-pytorch<p>[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.hubwiz.com&#x2F;docset&#x2F;LibROSA.docset&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;generated&#x2F;librosa.core.piptrack.html<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24748793')
