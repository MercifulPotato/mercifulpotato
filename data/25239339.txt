My normal process for e.g. Python deployment is to write a Dockerfile that installs the dependencies, installs packages, and then copies my user code in. Then I use Pulumi to upload that image to a Docker repository &amp; deploy it to a k8s instance.<p>What am I missing by doing that? This <i>looks</i> really slick, but I&#x27;m not sure how, why, or where to use it.')
