It is my personal experience, others can have a different experience. But my point was that I am not using google search because Google has somehow forced me to use them, the way IRS forces me to pay them or the way US government forces me to pay social security &quot;contribution&quot; to them or how most bay area cities force me to use PGnE for energy and force me to put ethanol my in car. Latter are all examples of coercion where as former is all about Google doing something better than others.')
