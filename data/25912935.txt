There were through-hole components and chips with pin mounts, most armatures were pot metal.<p>If you looked inside a TV now, you&#x27;d see mostly surface mount components, and molded plastic armatures.<p>There&#x27;s just not as much to repair anymore, things either work or they don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s good or bad, I&#x27;m saying there was no conspiracy to drive repair shops out of business, just a general switch to more reliable (yes, more reliable) electronics, which happen to also be less repairable.<p>White goods are a different story, things like washing machines have been built in an increasingly cynical fashion.')
