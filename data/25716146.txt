This idea that you are trying to build a non-stick surface on top of the metal is just adding extra work that isn&#x27;t needed.<p>Wash with soap, dry of the stove top, put in some oil (I use peanut), then take a paper towel and rub the oil around over everything and at the end the metal should look shiny but there shouldn&#x27;t be any pooled oil left anywhere.<p>If you are cooking something that doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or strong flavor, you can skip the washing all together and just leave it there to cook with next time.<p>If you try to go the whole &quot;never wash this&quot; route, you end up with unhappy results going from cooking something with onions and garlic to cooking something more neutral flavored. No one wants onion flavored pancakes.')
