That&#x27;s what makes lock files so important. I think we&#x27;re past worrying about those wheels&#x2F;npms&#x2F;pkgs disappearing from the internet.<p>My concern is more about packages going stale and don&#x27;t peer-match with other packages that evolve, or major versions that change results: not so much for R pkgs but there have been cases of major versions breaking existing projects, or requiring significant effort to update. (One example that zinged me is the FFI interface for Node. The &quot;official&quot; package hasn&#x27;t been touched in years, and the &quot;replacement&quot;, FFI-NAPI, is still has lots of open issues. We were using in-house fixes for some time.)')
