Those clients had to share with me the software, controls and training they put into place to enforce those access rules, and I confirmed with long-time employees they&#x27;ve walked staff out of call centers summarily fired for joy-riding the data. I can believe the situation at hospitals can be looser, but financial services being more strict than pharma fulfillment or PBM&#x27;s would be news to me. I&#x27;ve only had two clients in the PBM space, and they didn&#x27;t seem to take their infosec lightly either, but that is a much smaller sample space so I&#x27;d be interested to hear from those who work in the trenches in PBM&#x27;s or pharma fulfillment what it is like for them.')
