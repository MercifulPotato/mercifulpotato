If you could use reasonable means to identify someone from the IP address then it will be personal data. I don&#x27;t really agree with the outcome of the case because it implied it was easy to contact an ISP to get them to disclose details of the subscriber information associated with the IP address. In the UK at least it would require cause, and a court order.')
