Arguably, it&#x27;s not Facebook&#x27;s responsibility to fact-check anything.<p>Facebook is not a publishing house (at least not the Facebook social media platform as such) and mandating that they fact check and curate their ads and content is tricky business. It requires a legal definition of truth, which is a matter complex enough to justify the existence of the whole judiciary system.<p>Expecting that a condensation of such a system be applied to the publishing of information on any platform is wishful thinking at best.<p>Edit: Corrected typos')
