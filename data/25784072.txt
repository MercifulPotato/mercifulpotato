Peer 1 plays their keyboard, \nand the midi data is sent to Peer 2 where a keyboard animates and sound optionally plays.<p>Project name is Midishare.<p>Got the idea after starting piano lessons about 5 months ago. It’s all over zoom, which works surprisingly well for music lessons on its own, but it’s difficult rigging a camera to show the remote person what you’re doing on the keyboard, as well as getting the sound to come through (if you don’t have a nice audio interface). There is still the issue of communicating finger position, not quite sure how to solve that one yet, or if it really even warrants a technical solution (again, you also have zoom to just communicate verbally, works okay for fingering)<p>The keyboard I use to animate playback is a 3D model which communicates the flow of playback surprisingly well, it’s at least a pretty cool accomplishment on its own!<p>I’ll launch it with a Show HN one of these days, within a month or two is the goal!')
