The inserted text could be a “reading between the lines” of the original text.  As in the novel “Interlinear to Cabeza de Vaca” by Haniel Long (I’ll mention that Henry Miller wrote an introduction to an edition of it, a recommendation for some).<p>I have wondered whether, for public speeches, someone could put together a wiki-like site so the public would be able to make comments (“interlinears”) <i>on each single sentence</i> of a given public speech.  So one page of comments <i>per sentence</i>, or perhaps even a single phrase.<p>The structure, rigorously enforced, of focusing comments on the meaning and implications of a single sentence might keep the troll noise down or at least make moderating easier.  The current rantfest in comments on political content is discouraging.')
