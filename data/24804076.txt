The wide varying cultural differences in food already tells us there&#x27;s nothing biologically innate about the preferences.<p>Toddlers will observe their parents facial expressions and behaviors even as they&#x27;re being served. If you scrunch your nose when giving them broccoli, they won&#x27;t like it. If you incentivize eating it, they learn they&#x27;re not &quot;supposed&quot; to like it.  At the other extreme, if the parents fight for the last piece of broccoli the kid will happily join in, in my direct experience.
