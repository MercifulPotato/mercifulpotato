First, if users could effectively block advertising and spying, then the problem would be solved regardless of paying. The data monopolies (and would be parts of those monopolies) are actively and effectively combatting blocking.<p>The &quot;because free&quot; trope is a blackboard theory. It&#x27;s clearly not true in reality, but people still argue that it&#x27;s &quot;true in theory.&quot; This isn&#x27;t a theoretical scenario. There are plenty of paid products, and they also spy on us. Echo, android, spotify...<p>In reality, besides apple, most of the largest fortunes made recently in the tech space are based on advertising, data collection and monopolising the marketplaces, platforms, feeds or pipelines. Even Tesla&#x27;s insanely high stock price is primarily based on data collection. It&#x27;s their edge in the autonomous driving race. Teslas aren&#x27;t free.<p>Facebook and Google would still spy and advertise because it is far more profitable than selling, and creates a more convenient relationship with &quot;customers.&quot; They also spy on their &quot;partners,&quot; and were recently fined &gt;$bn for doing so monopolistically.<p>Anyway, the &quot;adbacked trash websites&quot; aren&#x27;t the main problem... The main problem are the adbacked empires of Google Facebook &amp; co.')
