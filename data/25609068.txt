That&#x27;s entirely up to you. For some unknown reason you seem to care, and I certainly can&#x27;t figure out why from the replies so far.<p>As best as I can guess from the evidence available, you&#x27;re looking for some vector to &quot;No, you&#x27;re wrong!&quot; disprove some aspect of my personal view of this. This will, of course, go nowhere. I didn&#x27;t submit my personal view as some sort of entry in a <i>debate</i>, and I&#x27;m making no effort to persuade anyone to my view.<p>If you can&#x27;t find a way to derive value or relevance from my viewpoint, other than trying to disprove it or debate it, then you&#x27;ll just have to move on. I&#x27;m not going to try to pressure you, persuade you, influence you, argue with you, or otherwise make any effort to interfere with your freedoms of thought and choice. That would be inappropriate for an unsubstantiated personal view such as the one I have provided.')
