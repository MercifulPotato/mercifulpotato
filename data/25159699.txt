That&#x27;s it, they <i>will</i> want the next fix, a new skin, more privileges, it&#x27;s a bottomless pit of purely virtual assets that are easy to detach from money.<p>That&#x27;s my take at least, from being a kid in the 90s and comparing my experience when I got real toys vs when I got digital toys (MMO subscriptions like Ultima Online, for example). I can&#x27;t imagine how much harder for my parents it&#x27;d have been if instead of a subscription I was asking for them to pay or give me enough allowance to buy every item I wanted in a game. It&#x27;d be hell.')
