I mostly messed around trying to learn how to make games in Unity. I didn&#x27;t actually learn a whole lot of programming this way but it probably improved my interest in the subject and then I eventually discovered code academy which actually taught me how to program.<p>In between unity and codeacademy I tried a bunch of books but none of them really got me to understand what was happening so I didn&#x27;t learn much from them.')
