Does the init process restarts the daemon? I would argue that it shouldn&#x27;t.<p>If the process stops responding to a healthcheck, it&#x27;s the scheduler&#x27;s responsibility (k8s in this case) to handle it. Crashes in this case should be handled in a similar way, whether it&#x27;s due to OOM or a bug.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing another scenario here?')
