Random assignment of judges to cases.<p>2. Any judge accused of failing to recuse from cases with a conflict of interest has to face a randomly chosen panel of judges.  If the panel agrees that the judge has deliberately taken on cases with a conflict of interest, the judge can be removed from the judiciary.<p>The first would make shopping for a judge harder.  For the second, the way he advertised and then his behavior when he got the cases is hopefully enough to convince a panel of neutral judges that he is biased.<p>The first would be a relatively easy change to make.  The second is complicated by the Constitution, which reserves impeachment of judges to Congress.  Something which has only happened 15 times.<p>However <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.law.yale.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=5053&amp;context=ylj" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.law.yale.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?arti...</a> argues, convincingly to me, that it is within the power of Congress to write a law enabling other judges to remove a judge.  (Though not to criminally charge him for his behavior - that still requires Congress.)')
