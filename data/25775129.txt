The ones best at getting allies to protect them, the ones who keep their children alive even at the cost of thousands of others&#x27; lives, the ones who groom an ally to throw themselves on the grenade, the ones who climb the power ladder and then use that power to keep themselves safe from the conflict…<p>War is a terrible selection pressure, if you value the light and good in this world.
