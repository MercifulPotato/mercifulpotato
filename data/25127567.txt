He was one of the smartest programmers I&#x27;d ever met.  Not only did he write great code, but he also always maintained an excellent connection to the his customers who would use the programs he wrote.  This was in a hospital.<p>Personally, he was kind, generous, excellent family man.  He never really talked too much about politics, didn&#x27;t care too much for it.  He also helped me order the parts for and showed me how to assemble my first intel based desktop computer, an amazing 486-DX2-66!<p>It&#x27;s been years but I recently communicated with him, and we had a great e-mail exchange, caught up.  He was surprised and pleased that since I left I&#x27;d not only gotten married but now have an adult son.  Surprised because back &gt;25 years ago when we hung out I was <i>very much</i> not a &quot;family man&quot; kind of person.<p>I asked him in passing how he&#x27;d been holding up with the pandemic, and suddenly, there it was.<p>Covid19 was a hoax perpetrated by China to help Joe Biden get elected.<p>It broke my heart.  A smart, good, kind man that I knew had been brain damaged.  Like some kind of fucking psychological cancer.<p>As the old saying goes, There but for the grace of God, go I.<p>You and I can&#x27;t imagine falling prey to such a thing, but I can assure you that my old friend Danny had and has the same mental facilities as you and I.<p>He caught this particular cancer, and you and I didn&#x27;t.<p>What&#x27;s worse?  He doesn&#x27;t even know he has and is subject to this psychological malignancy.<p>I wonder if there are any psychological cancers you and I are subject to, right now, that we don&#x27;t even know about or suspect?')
