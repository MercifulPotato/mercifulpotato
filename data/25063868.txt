At least these topics come to mind:<p>- Data Engineering: various DB technologies&#x27; pros and cons (AWS Athena, Snowflake, MS Sql Server, Elasticsearch, Redis), Airflow, AWS S3<p>- ML Engineering: AWS autoscaling clusters, EC2, Spark cluster set-up &amp; management, IO&#x2F;CPU bottle neck identification, optimizing workloads (like how large chunks, how many Spark worker processes, how many threads on Python&#x27;s libraries, ...)<p>- Umm Web Engineering?: HTTP API design, load balancing, Docker &amp; Kubernetes, partial results caching for real-time responses<p>I have understood that on larger organizations each of these could have a dedicated team behind it. Anyway I&#x27;ve been lucky to find this company &amp; role and gotten an opportunitu to learn and apply so many technologies, but I must admit it is getting a bit tricky to keep (shall I say pickle) all that in my brain :D')
