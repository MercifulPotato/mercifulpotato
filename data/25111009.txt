The problem here is that buildroot does cross-compiling, and Emacs has no native support for cross-building.  However, qemu was able to help by emulating the target arch at user-space level (I didnt even know this worked, very nice).  I am not sure if that hack still works today, since the Emacs dumper was recently rewritten AFAIK.<p>Regarding Emacs being an universal UI platform, I wrote a metapost to emacs-devel to celebrate that fact very recently.  Indeed, Emacs is the only platform I know which can be used to write programs which work on the terminal and with a GUI toolkit alike.  I call that modality-independant.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.gnu.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;html&#x2F;emacs-devel&#x2F;2020-09&#x2F;msg00286.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.gnu.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;html&#x2F;emacs-devel&#x2F;2020-09&#x2F;msg00...</a>')
