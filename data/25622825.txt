Vitamin D is fat soluble. It can build up in your system over time. Normal levels are 30-50 ng&#x2F;ml, and you can get your levels tested by asking for the test whenever you get a blood draw or your physical. Taking vitamin D supplements at high levels indefinitely without medical testing is dangerous (albeit a slowly building danger over months that is relatively easily reversed).<p>Anecdata: I was taking 5000 IU daily for a year, and my levels went up to 79 ng&#x2F;ml. I stopped taking it for 6 months, and my levels went down to 47 ng&#x2F;ml.')
