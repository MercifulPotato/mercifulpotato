(I&#x27;m not even sure that multiplatform executables were even supported by Mac OS X before 10.4 or so, when they started using them for Intel cross-compatibitility.)<p>&quot;Fat&quot; CFM&#x2F;PEF binaries existed on classic Mac OS, but used a completely different mechanism that only supported 68k and PowerPC code. And if you wanted to support a Classic II, that rules out a Carbon application bundle too.<p>About the widest range I can imagine for a single executable is a hybrid CFM&#x2F;PEF&#x2F;Carbon executable, which might be able to run on anything from a classic 68k mac up to Mac OS 10.6 (through Rosetta).')
