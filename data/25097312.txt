Kinda calm, and enjoying NYC&#x2F;Manhattan being a quitter place.<p>I am mostly an introvert though, but had some major FOMO before covid.<p>I attribute this sense of tranquility&#x2F;calmness as all that FOMO is gone, since pretty much everyone is in the same boat.<p>I also have created a routine and I go out every day, and work outside for at least one hour.  Before it was in the parks, but now that is a bit chillier at outdoors at coffee places.  Many coffee places have outdoor seating, so I use that as much as I can, before it gets too cold.  I bundle up, and have noticed that I can work outside up to 42-44F so far. Not sure how will it be one it gets colder. Weather in NYC has been lovely so far though.<p>I miss playing sports though (soccer and volleyball), and the occasional dating, but I don&#x27;t feel bad at all since everyone is in the same boat.<p>For the winter, I highly suggest to get some good yellow spectrum lighting  in your apt.  and also buy a powerful projector, and project movies&#x2F;games in a whole wall.  I have noticed that using a 2000lumens projector daily, instead a normal TV has made a huge improvement in my mood, and almost eliminated that SAD feeling you get in November.<p>TLDR:  \n1. Develop a routine where you go outside, to work&#x2F;read, for at least one hour a day.  Be friendly with the local baristas.  Just somme chatting and in-person interaction every day, makes a huge difference.<p>2. Visit&#x2F;explore  different parts of the city, every week.  Use a bike, so you don&#x27;t have to use public transportation.<p>3. Buy a powerful projector, and watch TV&#x2F;youtube, play games on it, for those days that the weather is not good.<p>4. Make your apt, room ambient look and feel nice, get some good lighting.<p>5. Get a regular cleaner.  (I usually leave the apt. for most of the day when a cleaner comes).  A clean&#x2F;neat apt improves your mood a lot.<p>6. Start new things (either projects, books, games, whatever), so you don&#x27;t feel stale, and experience new things.')
