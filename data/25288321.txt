I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve really done much consideration for trig since my sophomore year of HS.  I didn&#x27;t get into programming via a formal education, and the programming I do doesn&#x27;t involve heavy graphics or physics so it&#x27;s just not something I think about.  Interesting article, and only serves to inspire me to add re-discovering trig&#x2F;physics&#x2F;calc to my todo list on reading.')
