Item(by='a5withtrrs', descendants=None, kids=[25180303, 25179554, 25178870, 25178250], score=None, time=1606058852, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25177200, text='My complaint (as an Australian) against tipping is that I have no idea what the cost of my meal ends up being.<p>If I dine out here at say a pub, the price for a steak is $30 AUD and the price of a beer is $5.<p>The total price I pay is $35 AUD.<p>This includes tax.<p>This includes the wage for the staff front and back of house.<p>And if for some reason I&#x27;m feeling like tipping the staff because they went the &#x27;extra mile&#x27;, I can optionally do so.<p>This is super confusing in the US (as a visitor) when the price of a meal is advertised as $xx and then you go to pay and it&#x27;s actually $xx + tax + tip.<p>If I&#x27;m paying a minimum price of $xx + tax + 10% tip, why not just make that the price of the item? It just makes no sense to me!')
