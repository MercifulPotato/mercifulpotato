US lawmakers have control over what is legal and illegal. US VISA won&#x27;t process activities that are illegal in the particular country. It&#x27;s not that religious conservatives have power over the credit card companies.<p>I also hope you&#x27;re not saying that the US should allow child sexual assault which is the issue in this case.')
