I was discussing looking into packaging kubernetes with another Arch developer yesterday, and noticed this discussion today.<p>I&#x27;m the package maintainer for go and maintain a number of go packages in Arch Linux, along with writing the current guidelines and looking into packaging strategies for golang.<p>I&#x27;ll offer a more cynic view then the one presented: golang is not a mature packaging ecosystem.<p>So 1) is partially correct; go just sucks from a packaging perspective. Not <i>really</i> the issue at kubernetes.<p>We can probably package up kubernetes within the next hour and drop it into `[community]` as Arch has less structure and QA around the packaging process. However our largest hurdle is that we package the latest version. Is kubernetes going to work properly on go version `1.15.3`. By experience container software brings out the worst of the go runtime and any changes to the syscall, goroutine or memory management is a cause of concern.<p>The other hurdle is the cadence of when kubernetes decides to support which container runtime. Docker is wonkey at best, but I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of details on cri-o nor containerd.<p>So frankly our problems are not really related to packaging, but the challenges of providing recent versions of packages and making sure they work.')
