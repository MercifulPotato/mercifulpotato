While not all of that software is copyleft, it has AFAIK always been part of the reality and the very premise of Red Hat that someone else can take that, too.<p>If a community project itself stopped providing what it has been providing for free, people would probably be disappointed if they had started relying on what was provided. They might also become wary of relying on community-supported projects. But they would probably not be upset in the sense of being angry. Most people wouldn&#x27;t feel entitled enough for that.<p>I think what makes people upset in this case is that Red Hat sort of adopted the project, giving it a home, and then stopping to provide what that project had been providing for people outside of Red Hat.')
