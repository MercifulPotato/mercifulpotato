I can save any page with a click of the button using SingleFile (a fantastic Chrome extension, by the way!).<p>Then a cronjob runs and puts it into a folder to be processed into a database, which generates a static html index and puts it in my Google Drive.<p>Then it syncs offline on my chromebook. Which means that without internet, I can put my chromebook in tablet mode and do some nice reading. I&#x27;ve been very pleased so far.')
