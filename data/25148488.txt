I looked at the source&#x2F;googled the number and found the source government press release, it was the number of people entering the country without permit, of course that&#x27;s against the (German) law, but a refugee has to per default do this to enter somewhere and claim refugee status (unless they&#x27;re the kind of refugee that could get plane tickets to a destination country willing to issue them entry visas -- but surely no EU embassy thought &quot;Ah here are some Syrians wanting to visit as tourists for a week, give them visas.&quot;).<p>Obviously the Breitbart article didn&#x27;t mention this detail, leaving the details of the &quot;crimes&quot; committed to the imagination of their readers...')
