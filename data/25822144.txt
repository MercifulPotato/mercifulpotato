Small breaks shouldn’t convert into a time unit, and if it does, it simply wasn’t a small break.<p>I don’t track it, my time units are big enough to keep them ball-parked in my head. My tasks are scoped and small enough to have them ball-parked in my head in 2-3 week (or even monthly) chunks.<p>But, I don’t like time tracking in general so this is how I handle it in a minimal way.<p>I’m the opposite about task tracking&#x2F;scoping. I just don’t let time be a major factor in it, mostly just define a deadline and scope around that.')
