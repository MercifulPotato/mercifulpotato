People will be writing theses on this. You could argue this isn&#x27;t &quot;our&quot; 9&#x2F;11, but only for the relative lack of violence. In terms of the repercussions on America&#x27;s cultural, social and political landscape, it is, and it isn&#x27;t leaving the cultural consciousness for a long time.')
