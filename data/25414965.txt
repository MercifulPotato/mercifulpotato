A good rule of thumb is to keep a 2 second (or 3 second) distance between vehicles, and that means that the peak throughput of any single lane is 0.33-0.5  vehicles per second regardless of speed.<p>The total time spent on the road increases and the utility of the road decreases since it gets you to your destination slower, but the capacity does not increase, it&#x27;s the same capacity with an added delay line. In fact, the safety distance increases more than linearly with speed, precisely because the combined effect of reaction time, braking distance and severity of incidents is more than linear. The 2 second  rule is just a rough approximation.<p>These are really &quot;fundamentally true&quot; issues that are well known in traffic engineering so there is nothing much to debate. The rain example is disingenuous since in rain the braking distance increases  dramatically, drivers instinctively know this and maintain larger clearances. And the demand of the car traffic increases too in bad weather, for example people avoid using bicycles or walking and opt for a car, which injects additional vehicles into a road network and pushes it over into disequilibrium and gridlock.')
