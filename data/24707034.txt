Really a journalist at Wired that put his voice behind two whole &quot;historians.&quot; One of which, Luke McKernan, has this to say recently in the blog where quotes were lifted from:<p>&gt; There has been renewed interest in this 2018 post after it was quoted in a piece by Thomas Nicholson, ‘YouTubers are upscaling the past to 4K. Historians want them to stop‘, for Wired.co.uk. The piece is chiefly concerned with the recent ‘upscaling’ of early films done by Denis Shiryaev on the Neural Love site. I rather admire this work, which is reasonably honest about how it has treated the originals, and is fun. Contrary to what the article’s title states, this historian does not want them to stop. I just want there to be better understanding, not least of the consequences.')
