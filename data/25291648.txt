I still own most of them. My mother read everything. The house was full of books. At some point over the years having my own family and moving around a bit the books got cut down to only the old stuff from the 1960 that are collectables, stuff from my grandfathers childhood (things with dates ~1900) and hardbacks of non-fiction type things (science, music theory, math, biographies, the classics). This still covers 3 bookshelves. Everything else is pretty much only in digital form. In this lock down I have come to realize how much I miss the physical book.')
