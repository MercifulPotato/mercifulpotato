It&#x27;s the fastest free&#x2F;open source LP &amp; MILP solver I&#x27;ve seen, but has a terrible CLI if you don&#x27;t want to use it as a C++ library. It&#x27;s easiest as part of the Open Solver Excel plugin. Lp_Solve isn&#x27;t as fast I don&#x27;t think, but the CLI is much easier to use and better documented. I prefer to use a scripting language language to write my own .lp models and send that directly to the solver. There are lots of libraries to do that, but it&#x27;s easier for me to write code I fully understand than to try to learn someone&#x27;s library.<p>Google has the &quot;Or-tools&quot; solver which I haven&#x27;t used, but have friends which do use it and like it.')
