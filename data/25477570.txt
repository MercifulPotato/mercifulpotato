The optimization work stops as soon as it &quot;feels&quot; fast enough and, this &quot;feels fast enough&quot; has been the same over the last few decades no matter how fast the underlying hardware is. Any advance in hardware will ineviatably be eaten by software within a year or two. That&#x27;s why running old software on new hardware feels so increadibly fast.<p>I also disgree that we got better developer- or user-experience out of the &quot;deal&quot;. Most commercially developed applications have a &quot;peak version&quot;, but still continue to be stuffed with new features that nobody asked for. E.g. name one feature that was added to Microsoft Word, Outlook or Excel in the last two versions which really added to the &quot;user experience&quot;.')
