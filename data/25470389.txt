Helpers are an anti-pattern, they don&#x27;t fit in your architecture, they have no mental model, they&#x27;re difficult (impossible) to name and organize, and they&#x27;re extremely resistant to refactoring. Effectively they&#x27;re spaghetti code.<p>The example I always come back to is auth. If you&#x27;re doing the same thing like &quot;parse a cookie header, get the session, make a DB connection, look up the session info, etc. etc.&quot;, consider how you could architect the layers of your application using a mental model that people would find easy to reason about. That might be some OO, middleware, or even a macro, but the point is that it&#x27;s thought about, designed, engineered, and documented.<p>The reason helpers are more prevalent than thoughtful architecture is that humans are a lot better at prioritizing the short term &quot;I improved it&quot; fix from factoring into helpers over doing the long term work of architecture. If you want to change this, it starts with cultural values that prioritize long term sustainability.')
