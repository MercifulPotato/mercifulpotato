Item(by='vladvasiliu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610039781, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25672053, text='They probably shouldn&#x27;t mandate &quot;how technology works&quot;. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t vote for that.<p>However, I think that public services (paid for by taxes) should be open and accessible. That is, the government should mandate certain properties (&quot;it should be open&quot;) and not certain implementations (&quot;it should use this specific protocol &#x2F; app&quot;).<p>Another commenter gave the example of Brazil schools sending parents important information via WhatsApp.<p>Now I&#x27;m not against the schools doing that if it&#x27;s one of multiple options and if the parents have an actual choice. I think the government should mandate that at least one <i>open</i> choice be made available, without necessarily detailing said choice.<p>In my view this wouldn&#x27;t stifle innovation. If you come up with some new communication app that&#x27;s better than anything else, if it&#x27;s open and many people pick it up, there&#x27;s no reason for the schools not to use it instead of the older &#x2F; inferior option. This would also allow schools to choose one among several open solutions according to their particular needs.')
