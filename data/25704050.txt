Specifically, Section 230[0] of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.<p>&gt;You should be able to choose a status, either &quot;platform&quot; or &quot;published&quot;, and in the case of the first, you&#x27;d have to leave everything not directly illegal (with rules in place, how to contest the legality in court if the post was removed and the author think it&#x27;s legal speech - sort of like with DMCA claims), or you&#x27;re a publisher, where you can decide what content you want and which you don&#x27;t want, and then take responsibility for the content you&#x27;ve let stay on your site.<p>That&#x27;s an interesting idea.  But it&#x27;s somewhat problematic for several reasons:<p>47 U.S. Code ยง 230 (the section of the law in question) applies to <i>all</i> persons&#x2F;entities in the United States, and to <i>all</i> third-party communications hosted within the United States.  How, exactly, would you implement such a rule?<p>If I decide to set up a github repo, who and how do I inform that I intend to be a &quot;platform&quot; or a &quot;publisher&quot;?<p>If I&#x27;m a member of a mailing list, quote someone else&#x27;s words and send it to that mailing list, how do I &quot;register&quot; as a platform or a publisher?  This isn&#x27;t an idle question either.  This was an actual case[1] that hinged on <i>one</i> particular email to a particular mailing list.<p>I host several services via my home Internet connection.  If I choose (which I have done in the past) to host a Diaspora[2] pod and invite a few friends and family to join, and maybe even federate with other Diaspora pods, how and to whom do I register as a &quot;publisher&quot; or &quot;platform&quot;?<p>If I &quot;register&quot; as a platform and I have an argument with my sister in-law, and she says some really vulgar&#x2F;unkind things on my pod.  If I remove those comments, am I now in breach of my &quot;registration&quot; as a platform?<p>&gt;So yes, sites like facebook and twitter (which generally have a monopoly) should be regulated more, and having to choose their status.<p>I don&#x27;t dispute your claim that Facebook&#x2F;Twitter exert a great deal of influence.<p>However, Section 230 is not what you seem to think it is.  It isn&#x27;t about censorship, nor is it about freedom of speech.<p>It is a very specific section of a law that says (paraphrasing):<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t sue <i>you</i> for what <i>someone else</i> says.&quot;  Full stop.<p>That&#x27;s it.  It&#x27;s not limited to social networking sites.  It&#x27;s not limited to large corporations.  It&#x27;s not limited to websites (both commercial <i>and</i> non-commercial).  It applies <i>everywhere</i> there is third-party content.  On a Github repo (think bug reports&#x2F;feature requests), email mailing lists, IRC channels and any other place where more than one person can share bits.<p>I&#x27;m going to say it again to make sure that it&#x27;s clear why I say that.  Section 230 (c)(1)(this is a direct quote now) says:<p>&quot;No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.&quot;<p>I will now translate that into non-legalese:<p>&quot;You cannot be <i>sued</i> because of something I (or anyone else) say.&quot;<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that <i>you</i> can&#x27;t be sued for stuff that <i>you</i> say.<p>Let&#x27;s say that we take your suggestion and remove Section 230 protections from &quot;publishers&quot; (whatever that is defined to mean).  That won&#x27;t stop people from posting obnoxious&#x2F;unpleasant&#x2F;hateful things.<p>Rather, it will mostly just stop people from maintaining&#x2F;setting up <i>other</i> sites (like HN) where people can share their thoughts.  If HN can be sued for stuff that you or I say (upvote&#x2F;downvote&#x2F;flag moderation like we have here would almost certainly force HN to be a &quot;publisher&quot; under your definition), I suspect they would shut down this site almost immediately.<p>If that were the case, the only folks that could <i>afford</i> to take on that kind of liability would be deep-pocketed companies like, you guessed it, Facebook and Twitter.<p>So, doing what you suggest would actually make things <i>worse</i> and not better.<p>There may well be some form of regulation that is required to rein in the influence of large social networking platforms, and you won&#x27;t get any argument about that from me.  In fact, I find such sites to be so offensive that I refuse to use them.<p>But Section 230 isn&#x27;t the proper place to implement regulation to reduce their influence&#x2F;market power.<p>I hope that this helps you to understand why modifying&#x2F;repealing Section 230 won&#x27;t solve the very real issues you&#x27;re talking about.<p>And so, I must regretfully inform you that you are wrong about Section 230[3].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;47&#x2F;230" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;47&#x2F;230</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Barrett_v._Rosenthal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Barrett_v._Rosenthal</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Diaspora_(social_network)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Diaspora_(social_network)</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20200531&#x2F;23325444617&#x2F;hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-section-230-communications-decency-act.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20200531&#x2F;23325444617&#x2F;hello...</a><p>Edit: Fixed links and link references.
