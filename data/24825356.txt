Item(by='rbanffy', descendants=None, kids=[24826195], score=None, time=1603107454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24824107, text='&gt; You realize of course, that the Commodore 64&#x2F;128 were better than the Apple 2 and PET in every conceivable way?<p>Having been launched many years after the II and the PET, I&#x27;d expect much better specs. One key selling point of the II was the software library. The Commodores had great games, but Apple II&#x27;s, aided by the Disk II, had orders of magnitude more, in both numbers and diversity. Up to the 128, disk performance also hurt the Commodore 64 family. The IIs architecture remained very stable over the years and backwards compatibility was always excellent. This allowed Apple to have very healthy profit margins (to the point of hurting itself) because it protected the investment in software.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I love the 64 (love the 128 a bit less) and the brilliant idea of having a disk drive that has its own computer inside (same applies to the 8-bit Ataris).')
