These people are largely smart, well educated, but also raised in a particular way with connections that you only have from being in the top 5% at birth.  There is the financial backing that allows these people to take large risks because they arenâ€™t worried about a paycheck, the capital to invest in their ventures, and the connections to clients&#x2F;partners&#x2F;other investors.<p>The founder of the last firm I worked told a story about his father giving him the option of a big party when he came of age in middle school or to have the cash value of the party to invest.  He chose to invest, and that is how he launched his investment career, he told us proudly.<p>Cool story, until you inflation adjust the dollar figure was something like $100k at the age of 14.  So he started his young adult life +$100K whereas my wife&amp;I started our adult lives (post college) -$100K in debt.<p>Another place I worked the founder started in his 20s with $1M equivalent in capital... etc etc')
