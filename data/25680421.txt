I think this is what the standard downside of that economic system looks like in practice... plenty of regulatory capture + moral hazards due to low punishments when &#x27;caught&#x27; + little if any competition.<p>Like most things in economics the best route is looking for the least-bad option. We will find out over time if the state-capitalism balancing act really is the best, assuming there are any realistic alternatives and&#x2F;or the scales&#x2F;ratios of state vs capitalism are meaningfully measurable.<p>This experiment is only decades old in the modern technological era and one could argue it has only really peaked in the last two decades, with ever more industries getting merged to this day (which Corona will accelerate no doubt, just like 9&#x2F;11 did with the US defense industry).<p>The state&#x2F;nationalism part of this means these potentially poorly run companies could stay propped up for decades, despite the industry&#x27;s potential in other forms.<p>I recently spent time reading about some chartered airline companies from the 70&#x2F;80s and their stories is probably the best example of this sort of slow march towards industry conglomeration, with plenty of state involvement and protection. It probably provides a good timeline to base this stuff on and at a minimum plenty of analogies.<p>One example (see History): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TUI_Airways" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TUI_Airways</a>')
