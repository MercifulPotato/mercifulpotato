One of the things I learned decades ago as a solo entrepreneur was to force for as much commonality as possible across everything I was doing.<p>When you wear many hats you have to mentally task switch between domains and this time can sometimes be measures in weeks (example: you&#x27;ve been doing mechanical design and you now have to switch to FPGA design after months of not touching the codebase).<p>This is why jumping on the latest and greatest trends isn&#x27;t always the best idea.  Languages, tools, frameworks, new chips, new FPGA or CPU architectures, etc.  Things that don&#x27;t mesh at a certain level impose a cognitive load that can really slow you down.<p>The simplest example of this I have from years back would be using C and Verilog on embedded systems.  While Verilog <i>is not software, it&#x27;s hardware</i> the &quot;C&quot; feel to the language --as opposed to VHDL-- makes for an much easier transition between hardware and software development, at least for me.')
