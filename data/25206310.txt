Not so fast: if you need multiple hard steps to evolve an observer to marvel at it, then on those super-rare worlds where observers show up life statistically tend to be early.<p>At least this does just amplify your conclusion, that intelligent life is more likely to be exceedingly rare rather than die out prematurely.')
