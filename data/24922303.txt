Item(by='steveklabnik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603909420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24922007, text='&gt; Clearly C moves a lot of complexity to other areas, or hides complexity by using subtle semantics.<p>This is what I mean. I <i>do</i> think it&#x27;s tough in the context of learning, because many resources will teach you things that are actually technically incorrect, but work enough of the time that you won&#x27;t always notice it. And it&#x27;s really really tough to know if what you&#x27;ve done is even correct, because you don&#x27;t have a ton of help. This is before you even get into the bevy of flags which can change language semantics, and are actually used by real projects.<p>You also have to deal with different social groups of people who have different beliefs about what the language even is. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raphlinus.github.io&#x2F;programming&#x2F;rust&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;17&#x2F;undefined-behavior.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raphlinus.github.io&#x2F;programming&#x2F;rust&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;17&#x2F;unde...</a> This is what leads to a lot of those conflicts about semantics too.<p>None of this means C is not worth learning, or that you shouldn&#x27;t do it. But I think suggesting that it&#x27;s simple in the way that, say, Go is a simple language to learn, just isn&#x27;t really true. YMMV.')
