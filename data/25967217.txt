Item(by='bryanrasmussen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611993589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25964104, text='I didn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a valuable skill, in fact as I said it would be slower for me to do so (which maybe I should have said significantly slower) that&#x27;s a pretty strong indicator of its lack of value. I should also say it would be worse quality - because if I needed to add some JavaScript functionality I would need to be able to use the syntax I remembered and not what I could look up.<p>However my confidence that I could do this slowly and of poor quality is that - I started making websites 20 years ago so making and index.html file and linking to each file by hand and I still do this every now and then when making little static sites (like if a site is 4-8 pages I might just do it by hand). And the stuff I look up for sites like that are generally - how do I do this cool thing in CSS.<p>Admittedly if I did it this way the site I am envisioning doesn&#x27;t look much better than Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berkshirehathaway.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berkshirehathaway.com&#x2F;</a><p>on edit: also there is some question if one is just allowed to do what one can remember in one&#x27;s head or if, without using an internet search engine, one can use the stuff one has on local computers and devices? In which case I have some complicated stuff here to reference going back a lot of years, a lot of ebooks, local hardcopy books. So in that case I think I can do just about anything that can be done with search (except for using newest CSS, es2019 features), but still significantly slower.')
