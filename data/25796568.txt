No response of course...<p>It&#x27;s a total dick-move by Dropbox since access to Contacts is clearly not necessary for Dropbox to work.<p>However, the real problem here is obviously Google Login that only allows blanket permissions to either accept or reject.<p>Permissions should be granular and as a user I should have the ability the &quot;untick&quot; access to Contacts if I don&#x27;t want to give an app access to that data. If I untick a permission that is needed for app functionality, e.g. I deny camera access to a camera app, then the app simply would be able to do that feature.')
