Item(by='benbristow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609019384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545156, text='Dominos are ridiculously overpriced in the UK if you buy them straight. Same for Pizza Hut or Papa John&#x27;s. Especially if you&#x27;re single and just buying a pizza for one.<p>The coupons&#x2F;special offers are good but recently at least Dominos have started moving the minimum order for delivery from like ~£10 to ~£12+. Really expensive just for pizza! They used to do a &#x27;build your own pizza&#x27; delivered for about a tenner medium&#x2F;large size which was a godsend when I was in university halls.<p>Barely use them nowadays, just get a decent fresh oven pizza from Tesco or the Co-Op. Shame because I used to like Dominos.')
