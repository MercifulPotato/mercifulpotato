That said, so has the financial press and insiders. In fact, during an interview of NASDAQ&#x27;s CEO, the suggestion was floated that this is the Russians or something. That rumour was dropped by professional journalists and insiders. In fact, the regular, non financial press had a far more curious response than the financial press... they even read reddit.<p>Going back to &quot;Citadel rumour..&quot; It certainly was off the cuff and certainly doesn&#x27;t encompasse everything. That said, RH <i>is</i> financially dependant on Citadel and Citadel is in a position to benefit from RH&#x27;s decision.<p>Whatever you think of Cuban, these people are being drawn in for the same reason you and I are talking about it. It&#x27;s saucy.<p>I think your &quot;vilification of naysayers&quot; point is off-mark. This is not about whether or not GME bets make money. The whole saga <i>is</i> a naysaying of sorts. Naysaying to the rigging.<p>I suspect I&#x27;m probably on the same side as you regarding the larger point. Speculation, HFT, etc are negatives to be curtailed not expanded.

But, the symbolism is fairly subtle. The firms being protected from long tail risk (right, wrongly or even essentially are, again, being shielded from long term risk on bets only they have access to. This <i>includes</i> clearing houses and market makers. The &quot;systemic risk&quot; is the risk that these guys lose money. Stability is premised on them not losing money.')
