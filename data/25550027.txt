It is nice for the theme and visuals but adds nothing to the core game loop. It is more extreme in fighting games like Street Fighter or MOBAs like League of Legends.\nIt splits the meta-mini-game of race&#x2F;character selection out of the main game.\nThe downside is that it makes balancing nearly impossible.<p>As an alternative, a game could use positions for unit select. Kinda: Conquer the eastern flank to build Zerg units or conquer the western flank to build Protoss units.')
