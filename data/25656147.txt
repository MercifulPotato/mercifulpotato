In the absurd extreme, we could reshape society into doctors, farmers and medical manufacturers in a mad quest for best possible medical care.<p>At some point we have to ration healthcare and decide when to put more resources towards something else. If not personal wealth, what do you want to use for the rationing process? Age? A lottery?<p>Unless there is some really amazing alternative, money is one of the best proxies available for for contribution to society. A bunch of edge cases exist, but they are edge cases. It is a fair way of rationing healthcare.')
