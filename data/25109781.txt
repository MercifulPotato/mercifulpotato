But now the intent of asking for an email has to be crystal clear, which makes you and them more aware of what data you are actually giving them.<p>Apple sure is doing some good stuff with their authentication solution and their efforts to help people with healthier passwords habits. I&#x27;m still not too fond of having such fundamental infrastructure owned by a private company. Would you be comfortable handing over DNS to Apple?')
