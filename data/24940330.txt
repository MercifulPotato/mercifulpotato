That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m trying to get at with the parent comment.<p>For the bad dimsum restaurants in SF, I could point you to a dimsum place in HK that&#x27;s equally bad as long as the flavor profiles match.<p>There are lots of bad restaurants in HK. Does that make them not authentic? Of course not, so quality does not equate to authenticity.<p>The original article is talking about authenticity because that was a real problem. The flavors were changing as they came to America, by a lot.')
