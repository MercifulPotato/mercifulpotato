It is not possible to replace them with 3D printed parts just yet.<p>But! All of jet engine turbine blades are cast, not machined. Those parts can be safely 3D printed, as various metal sintering&#x2F;remelting methods produce similar or better structural quality. Same goes for those magnesium castings used in aircraft landing gear - can be replaced with 3D printed ones.<p>Parts that only under hydrostatic load like fuel nozzles can be 3D printed. Fatigue is not an issue there.<p>Parts that do not experience significant structural loads, but high thermal loads (combustors) can be also 3D printed.<p>I believe that&#x27;s a better answer to the topmost comment.')
