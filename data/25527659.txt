You do realize you are as biaised right? Except here, you&#x27;re siding with one of the biggest corporation in the world to assume that they treated their employee fairly. Excuse me if i&#x27;m more likely to believe an employee that share the story publicly under her name, might alleniate future employer, etc. More likely to believe that story of someone who worked at Google for that many years, than an anonymous commenter on HN that just came out with their alternate theory to defend the corporation.<p>If you had read the twitter thread you would know the language is not the reason of the firing, so it seems you also didn&#x27;t go very far in your &quot;investigation&quot;.')
