This is mostly due to poor optimization of the website owner&#x2F;host. It&#x27;s almost never worth it to have a fully dynamic page generated for every visit. A couple short lived caches (60 seconds) would likely have kept the site online, as well as properly set headers.<p>This honestly seems like a rookie configuration mistake that was overlooked during some migration between webhosts. At this point, tuning WordPress is pretty well known. The reason MySQL gets blamed is due to WP&#x27;s poor DB schema. Very few indexes and the data is not normalized.<p>On small sites with few comments&#x2F;posts, it&#x27;s never a problem, but at scale, you&#x27;ll see issues start to popup as the DB has to scan entire tables for each page load. This largely drove the rise of comment services like Disqus and FB comments a decade ago. It seems in recent years a lot of people have opted to just not have blog comments, instead driving discussion to dedicated forums or social media groups.')
