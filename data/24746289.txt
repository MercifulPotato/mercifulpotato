Item(by='sradman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602429047, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24744743, text='&gt; The conclusion of the paper is just bad science, not an example of human microevolution.<p>&quot;Bad science&quot; might be a bit harsh. I read the paper as a call to arms (no pun intended). The data presented in Table 1 is good science but the sample is far too limited to support the paper&#x27;s subtitle &quot;A microevolutionary change&quot;.<p>It is plausible that a microevolutionary change has occurred (ditto environmental change or no change). We need much larger surveys that span populations and geographies to first establish that a change has occurred and then quantify the causal factors.<p>Perhaps the fault lies in the culture surrounding the publishing of scientific papers with an emphasis on strong conclusions rather than unresolved questions. Maybe I&#x27;m being too forgiving because I was previously unaware of the adult median artery phenotype. Regardless, your criticism is important and appreciated as is tgbug&#x27;s point that we are lacking data on population wide anatomical variation.')
