I don&#x27;t understand why this isn&#x27;t higher up in the discussion.<p>Do you check whether your brakes work every time before setting off? Do you check whether your wheels are attached properly every time before setting off? There are a million things that could break on your car. They&#x27;re just <i>very unlikely</i> to happen.<p>Pilots&#x2F;maintenance crew for planes checks that kind of stuff for virtually every flight. We accept this small risk with cars.
