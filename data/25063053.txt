Referring to the architectural diagram, it is going to be much more efficient for the &quot;Frontend&quot; to persist the task data into a durable data store, like they show, but then the Frontend should simply directly call the &quot;Store Consumer&quot; with the task data in an RPC payload. There is <i>no</i> reason in the main execution path why the store consumers should ever need to read from the database, because almost all tasks can cut-through immediately and be retired. Reading from the database should only need to happen due to restarts and retries of tasks that fail to cut through.<p>Disclaimer&#x2F;claim: I worked on this system and on gmail delivery.')
