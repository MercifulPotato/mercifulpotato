Item(by='varispeed', descendants=None, kids=[25058122], score=None, time=1605099737, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25057794, text='The ideas are always around taxing the middle class, the hard working engineers, lawyers, doctors and sold to the masses as taxing &quot;the rich&quot;, but in reality the rich never pay as much tax as middle class (as a proportion of income). Tax is often used as an instrument to discourage certain behaviour and this proposal seems to be also hitting engineers, but also people on lower income who for example assemble parts at home. It seems like the goal of DB is to discourage home working disguised as a help to those who cannot work from home. \nIt&#x27;s kind of &quot;we know better than you what is good and you must obey or give us your hard earned money.&quot;\nWhy people are not ashamed to put such proposals forward?')
