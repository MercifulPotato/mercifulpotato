It&#x27;s not necessary if you return a pointer instead of void, which is also nice because you can treat calls to your list functions as lists themselves and chain them together.<p>Agreed.<p>&gt; It also allows you to avoid warts like `p = &amp;(<i>p)-&gt;next;`<p>Does it? Isn&#x27;t having `p = &amp;(</i>p)-&gt;next;` in the while loop necessary?<p>&gt; at the modest cost of needing `p=remove(p,t)` instead of `remove(p,t)`.<p>I may disagree since an API is used many more times than the API function is written.')
