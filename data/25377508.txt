At the time we had two major issues which slowed down loading these sorts of dylibs.<p>One was attaching the code signatures (which gets attributed to the dynamic linker because it is synchronously stalling waiting for the the validation to occur).<p>The other was that reactive patterns tend to cause A LOT more classes and methods which result in a lot more fixups. When I am debugging apps I can often tell if they use react based one the ration of Objc&#x2F;Swift metadata to __TEXT in the binary. That ended up causing dyld to stall waiting for page ins (which again are not really the linker but get attributed to it).<p>IOW, many of those clever patterns that make doing rapid development easier are really just a way to transfer work from the developer to the runtime, and it has a cost. Swift and SwiftUI are actually have some very clever ways to mitigate this, but reactive Swift libraries int he Swift 2.0 timeframe certainly did not.')
