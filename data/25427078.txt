I suspect some of it is that the customer service teams have zero to no interaction with the developers, so if it&#x27;s not written down it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>I think this is a good argument for developers spending at least some time working on customer service per week (even just a few hours). You could escalate queries such as this one to a developer, where clearly somebody is asking a more technical question.<p>Before anybody says &quot;that&#x27;s unrealistic, they don&#x27;t have time&quot; - first consider the amount of ridiculous meetings a developer will normally find themselves in, or how long they spend answering emails every day.<p>Of course, it doesn&#x27;t mean that such a password would be given away, but at the very least it could start an internal discussion about it&#x27;s existence. Having a single shared super-password is a problem waiting to happen.<p>Regarding the point with small firmware-based devices and security (i.e. IoT), I believe the practice is changing where each device will have entirely unique credentials (something that&#x27;s relatively easy to do these days).')
