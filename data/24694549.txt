I&#x27;m just a guy who cares a lot about this stuff. I suppose I can be dramatic but I don&#x27;t think that makes me wrong.<p>&gt; The consequences of losing access don&#x27;t necessarily follow from that though.<p>Currently, they do. That could change in the future but right now when people spend money on media they&#x27;re merely buying some company&#x27;s permission to enjoy some content. That permission can be revoked at any time and for any reason or no reason.<p>&gt; Lots of people for example understand the principle of leasing an apartment or car, and in those cases it&#x27;s much harder for the true owner to arbitrarily take the property away from you.<p>People aren&#x27;t leasing content though. They&#x27;re buying it. They buy books, they buy video games...<p>&gt; it can&#x27;t be very practical advice<p>Ignoring copyright is actually the most practical advice there is.<p>Everybody understands how to do it. I&#x27;ve yet to meet a single person who has never infringed copyright. People do it without even realizing it. It&#x27;s how people naturally operate, especially on the internet. When people want something, they right click on it and save it. Nobody really thinks about the creator&#x27;s rights to monopolize imaginary property.<p>The only problem with this advice is it&#x27;s technically illegal. We can fix this by abolishing copyright.')
