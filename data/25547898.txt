Here, the engineer <i>published</i> the photo by giving it to his employer (and making it a part of the test suite).<p><i>Not</i> publishing would be keeping it to himself, which the engineer did not do. For all we know, his girlfriend <i>did not consent</i> for that photo to be distributed to <i>other people</i>. Model release forms exist for that reason.<p>But that&#x27;s not merely a <i>publishing</i> consideration anyway; the law is more general than that.<p>In the end, it&#x27;s someone&#x27;s face being used for a commercial purpose without consent, and this is exactly what the law is about.')
