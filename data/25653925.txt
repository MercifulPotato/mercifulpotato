(Portable or installed? windows mac or linux? dpkg or rpm? From the dev&#x27;s website or through homebrew&#x2F;apt? Is a portable executable even available for this application?)<p>- I don&#x27;t need to give the author of the webpage access to all my local files.<p>Native programs are also often 10x+ as large as websites. (Eg the facebook iOS app is somehow 488mb)<p>These problems are all solvable. Wasm alone will go a long way to solving the sandboxing and app format problems. But we still need to build the platform, whatever it is.')
