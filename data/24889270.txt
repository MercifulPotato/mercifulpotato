It imposes very little cognitive load, allowing you to spend more time thinking about the problem you are trying to solve and less time on language gymnastics. I am way “over” being impressed with that kind of cleverness. I am much more impressed with what a program does than with cleverness at the code level.<p>Go mostly picks the right features and avoids those that just add complexity, and it mostly gets that right.<p>It doesn’t get everything right. I am disappointed with channels and I do think it needs generics, though I hope the latter do not add much complexity and are not overused.')
