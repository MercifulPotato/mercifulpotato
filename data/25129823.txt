I would encourage the world to be cautious about copying whatever it is they are doing.<p>And if the South Australia Big Battery is an example of utility scale storage, store&#x27;s about 1-2 hours worth of energy from a small plant. It isn&#x27;t capable or expected to help power on through a night or anything, it smooths the grid when there is instability. Ie, it doesn&#x27;t mitigate the main problem with renewables (intermittent generation). It mitigates secondary problems with renewables (short term grid instability). Or it mitigates whatever problems the South Australians have with their grid, I don&#x27;t know. Point is, if they were relying 100% on renewables they&#x27;d have developed a culture of early bed times.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.news.com.au&#x2F;finance&#x2F;business&#x2F;south-australia-has-the-highest-power-prices-in-the-world&#x2F;news-story&#x2F;178987d30a8e6f273cd8949f34a64c83" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.news.com.au&#x2F;finance&#x2F;business&#x2F;south-australia-has...</a>')
