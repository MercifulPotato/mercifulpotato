Even in a state of peace, there are dangerous deployments (anecdotally, almost every retired Marine I know has some sort of permanent injury from training - most are of the annoying variety - surgically repaired knees - but some are worse).<p>A pandemic the likes of which we haven&#x27;t seen for a century is a change in that status quo for medical providers.  It also brings a level of work and stress that simply isn&#x27;t sustainable, regardless of compensation.  A human simply can&#x27;t sustain 80 hour weeks, no matter how much we pay them.  Nobody wants to be stressed out all day long because their patients are being even more moronic than normal (see also: South Dakota nurses who deal with COVID-deniers who are literally dying of COVID).')
