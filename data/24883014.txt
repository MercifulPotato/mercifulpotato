Currently GPG (and Sequoia) will reject the signing of keys using SHA1 if they claim to be recent.<p>The preferences would allow you to send me two messages that used the same SHA1 hash for the signature. I would never know that it had happened as I would never see the hash, only the valid signature. Both signatures would be logically valid as they came from your assertive action.')
