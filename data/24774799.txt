The story goes - I start to watch a show, I grow to like it, get all emotionally invested, the show gets cancelled halfway and I&#x27;m left out in the cold, dick in my hand, no satisfying end to a story arc, nothing. Most recent example is Counterpart which was (imo) phenomenal but got the axe after two seasons.<p>I&#x27;m not expecting the shows to run in perpetuity, just for them to run their course, tell their story. Great shows aren&#x27;t great because they last a long time.')
