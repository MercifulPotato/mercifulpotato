I think the key is to avoid thinking &quot;priority&quot; as one dimensional.<p>A goal can be high-priority because it is urgent.  Continuing to work until today&#x27;s lunch break is more urgent than calling your parents, because you can only work until today&#x27;s lunch break today, while you can call your parents at any time.<p>A goal can be high-priority because it is important.  As a goal, calling your parents may be more important than continuing to work until today&#x27;s lunch break.<p>In order to avoid the outcome that calling my parents is important, but I haven&#x27;t called them in months because it was never urgent, I have to increase the urgency of the goal by constraining it in time: It&#x27;s important to call my parents, and urgent to call my parents before the upcoming holiday.')
