If yes, what is it about? If it is public, please do share the source code!<p>What makes it different to other programming languages?<p>Is Forth worth learning?<p>What useful resources do you have for learning Forth or just generally about Forth? For the latter, I am thinking about something like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forth-standard.org and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theforth.net. The latter is a package manager and repository for Forth.<p>If you can think of any other questions, please feel free to post it and we could start a thread there.<p>Let us make this submission all about Forth! I wish we could revive Forth. Do you think it is worth it? Do you think it is possible? Whichever your answer is, why?')
