It doesn’t even pass very common sense checks. Just because its numbers doesn’t make it a good signal. Anyone can cherry pick numbers that make their contribution look godlike. Oh I improved the loading time of our internal tool by 1000% by applying very basic optimizations I googled 5 minutes before that no one had bothered to do since it’s low priority.<p>Especially at smaller companies where you can easily 100-10000x specific things that no one has had time to optimize yet since they haven’t been top priority. To a smaller extent at big tech but the point is that optimization numbers without a great amount of context is completely meaningless (like the parent said)')
