If you choose not to wear a mask, you choose not to enter that store or engage that employee. The problem is we have people who want people around them wearing masks, yet those people are refusing to stay away and in a number of instances assaulted and even murdered people who tried to restrict their movement into private property with a mask requirement.<p>I hear your line of reasoning from these same crazed individuals so I am lead to believe that this is the extreme end of that set of beliefs without also observing the corollary that I mention above..')
