Item(by='kristopolous', descendants=None, kids=[25141069], score=None, time=1605723473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25139642, text='&gt; What does it mean to publish if what&#x27;s recorded is never read? The old WORN drive joke (write once, read never) has fangs.<p>The mere act of publishing itself is a form of capital and political and social exercise regardless of who reads it.<p>This is a deep rabbit hole and I don&#x27;t have time to go into here (there&#x27;s 2 chapters in this mythical book I speak of on it) but I&#x27;ll point you in two directions, both centered on xerox<p>1. As a brief premiere look up the scholarly work &#x27;Xerox Project: Photocopy Machines as a Metaphor for an “Open Society”&#x27; - or look into how the open society foundation supposedly helped defeat apartheid south africa and bring down the soviets via copy machines and cottage publications.<p>2. As a cornerstone of the first step of the modern LGBT rights movement in the 1950s. &quot;ONE magazine&quot;, one of the first LGBT magazines using a specific Xerox machine as best I can determine either in Mar Vista or Venice california. Shortly there after, the Mattachine society, a second LGBT rights group, used the same copy machine to do their publication as well.  The machine was also used to fight anti-mccarthyist blacklisting publications for the film industry as well. A similar effort happened for civil rights in Jim Crow south (I live in LA so I can do better research on the LGBT stuff since I can drive to the physical archives)<p>Even if nobody ever read any of these and the publications went into the garbage can, the maturation of thought and the coalition building as a function of the geographic space necessitated by the access to the machines had meaningful political ramifications.<p>You can also read the book &#x27;Notes from Underground: Zines and the Politics of Alternative Culture&#x27; for a decent deep dive on this.<p>It&#x27;s all fascinating stuff.')
