I think the problem lies in the fact you would have to include in your business decision to block roaming.  Roaming is a money maker, so I think you would have a hard time convincing telcos to block that.  There are laws around roaming as well that you would have to augment or remove internationally.  If numbers were not portable and roaming did not exist; meaning, you have to acquire a local number through some form of authentication and your source country forwards the calls to that temporary number, then that might work.  When you call people back, they won&#x27;t see your number though.  They would see the loaned local number.  At this point we are reinventing the proposed shaken&#x2F;stir but in a more cumbersome manor.<p><i>all calls either originate from a network that is trusted</i><p>That is also tricky.  What does trusted mean?  Does it mean that if someone on that network is abusing SS7, that they become untrusted?  If so, every network would be untrusted within 10 minutes.  Maybe a cost penalty to self regulate?  You have to block your own reported abusers or lose peering?  I like the idea, but I think that would put us back into that realm of legal and political quandaries.  This would require a fairly significant addition in full time employees to police the abuse reports and entirely new reporting systems to log all the SS7 data, learn and report abuse patterns.')
