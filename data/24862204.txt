The sitewide search is a nice tool, but if I wanted to do that I would search on your site. Novice and advanced users want CTRL+F to behave as they are expecting, not bring up an unfamiliar (and unrelated) tool. For example Google Sheets also hijacks CTRL+F but at least it replaces it with something that operates extremely similar to the original action.')
