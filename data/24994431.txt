Instead of asking what can I use sum types for, it might be useful to ask, what is the shape of existing data? As it turns out, most systems contain either implicit or explicit sum types. Take JSON, for example. A JSON value can be defined as sum type of null | boolean | number | string | Array&lt;JSON&gt; | Object&lt;JSON&gt;. Types are useful way of describing characteristics of domain you are working in.')
