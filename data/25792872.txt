But I&#x27;ve a feeling that the difference in uptake between cancerous and normal tissue might not be large enough to make this especially useful. Fluorine-18 labelled glucose is used in PET imaging, but not for treatment as far as I&#x27;m aware. On the other hand, if a compound can be found that is more selective for the cancer in question, making it radioactive may offer a further improvement.')
