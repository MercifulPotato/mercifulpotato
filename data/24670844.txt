When we switched our marketing site over to Gatsby it was a godsend, but once we hit over 400 static pages on our site, the build times were killing us.<p>Our devs complained that even on local, building took forever, and because it had to refetch all of our WordPress CMS media library each time, sometimes it would just crash during build.<p>Also we grew the need for good SEO support for dynamically generated pages (of which we have thousands), and we had to write our own prerendering lambda function to handle bots (and embed tools) that couldnt run js on their own<p>After Next announced their support for static site generation and the release of next-serverless, we took the next three weeks to get our site ported over and haven&#x27;t looked back since.')
