The material has in fact changed the speed of light.<p>The wave equation of light is dictated by the permittivity and permeability of the material through which it propagates. This is just a property of electromagnetic waves. Only the speed of light in a vacuum is a constant. Or more accurately, the permeability and permittivity of a vacuum.')
