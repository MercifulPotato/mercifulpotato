Other countries have solved this problem by making healthcare universal, and forming a bulk purchasing group which strong-arms providers into charging something the system can bear. The end user doesn&#x27;t have to care how much that is, because most developed countries simply pay for the drugs people need in the first place.<p>The ideal way to obsolete this problem is to follow their lead - get Medicare for All to happen and restore Medicare&#x27;s ability to negotiate the price of drugs directly with manufacturers.<p>Then nobody has to pay for the drugs directly in the first place.')
