Ebola for instance justifies pretty almost any action you can imagine to contain it&#x27;s spread, where we are still arguing if lockdowns or travel restrictions are the cost appropriate measure with COVID.<p>If the time of fatality is sufficiently delayed, or the time to implement other countermeasures or recognize the situation has changed is too long, it doesn&#x27;t help anyone in the short, medium, or potentially even long term - you can have massive fatalities and huge spread.<p>The 1918 pandemic had multiple waves, with the second in particular having a much higher fatality rate than the first - 10x a typical flu season, which is what we&#x27;re seeing now. This was almost certainly caused by variants, though lack of data makes it impossible to prove.

Very likely.  However, smallpox was a scourage on humanity since likely 300 BCE and up until eradication by a massive global effort in 1975, it still had fatality rates around 25-35%.  So don&#x27;t just assume COVID will &#x27;evolve to harmlessness&#x27;, or if it does that it would happen on a timeframe convenient for society [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;smallpox&#x2F;history&#x2F;history.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;smallpox&#x2F;history&#x2F;history.html</a>]')
