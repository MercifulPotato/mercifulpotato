My reason always boils down to the other tooling, particularly in regards to HTTP endpoints. AWS API gateway is an absolutely infuriating product.<p>My current thoughts are if you&#x27;re working in the AWS ecosystem, with AWS tools, Lambda works fantastically. Using Lambdas to set off alarms and run playbooks has never let me down, and I&#x27;ve done a lot of data processing hanging lambdas off streams and it just works. Really well in fact.<p>Where it falls over is interacting with the outside world in a sane fashion. HTTP endpoints are a nightmare to set up and deploy in a semi-automated fashion, I&#x27;ve had things that matched what was in the docs that just don&#x27;t work because of some random gotcha, the undocumented silliness around a &quot;HTTP API Gateway&quot; vs a &quot;REST API Gateway&quot; is another mind bogglingly frustrating thing. Not to mention all the latency issues I&#x27;ve had, which are far too many to blame on a cold boot of the lambda.<p>Serverless has its niche and it works really well, and real cheaply to boot. But it&#x27;s not a generalised tool like the loudest evangelists like to pretend it is.')
