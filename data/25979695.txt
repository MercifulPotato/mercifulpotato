Sorry wont bite your bait. BTW I was not aware that RSS is a religion.<p>This much I am willing to claim -- RSS is a silent approver of right wing acts of violence starting all the way from Gandhi&#x27;s assassination to more contemporaneous cow slaughter related lynchings.<p>Unlike the farmer protests that have distanced itself from acts of violence and vandalism I am unaware that RSS has done that for the violence that has engulfed India in this govt, but am willing to be convinced otherwise.<p>The spokesmen of the government have frequently branded the entire protest and Khalistani and Pakistani. I am very tickled that you seem to be outraged not by the act of the government which has real implications but on the comment someone made on the internet. That might be quite indicative of where your sympathies lie.')
