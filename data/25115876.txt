There <i>are</i> rules about all those things. You speed too much or in the presence of a cop, you&#x27;ll get pulled over. In my state, you go more than 20 over and you have a mandatory jail sentence. There are strict rules and crash tests from insurance associations for all vehicles to reduce the risk from car crashes.<p>Furthermore, as a bicyclist you can manage your own risk and the risks aren&#x27;t correlated. Viruses don&#x27;t listen to Fox News or MSNBC. You can&#x27;t wish away exponential growth. Just because a car crashes into your bicycle, doesn&#x27;t mean that three other crashes occur in close proximity. I&#x27;m sorry, but your comparison doesn&#x27;t make any sense.')
