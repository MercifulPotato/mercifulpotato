You see the rapport built from going to the bar as an advantage that you shouldn&#x27;t pass up on. In your example where failing to go to the bar makes you less impactful at work, I see a team that is doing a shitty job at team building, which will probably harm their chances of success. The blame for that can go in any and all directions, it&#x27;s on everyone.<p>If every potential detractor involved just says to themselves &quot;this is what everyone else likes, so I&#x27;ll fix my attitude and head to the bar&quot;, you can end up with several of them contorting to fit in, and then you&#x27;re just cargo culting a good culture instead of really having one.')
