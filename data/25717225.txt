Since newspapers get this stuff wrong too wikipedia will only allow incorrect information.<p>And that&#x27;s Wikipedia working as intended. If you&#x27;re unfortunate you&#x27;ll run up against someone who i) doesn&#x27;t know anything at all about the topic, ii) has misunderstood some poorly reported document, and iii) has more free time than you. It&#x27;s <i>exhausting</i> dealing with these people and I simply have better things to do with my time.')
