However, there&#x27;s a difference between sending a name&#x2F;email address combo <i>once</i> during signup and having the advertising SDK ping the advertiser every <i>single time the app is interacted with</i> (which is what the Facebook SDK does for example); the former only leaks &quot;I use X service&quot; once to the advertiser, the latter leaks a detailed trail of my usage patterns &amp; IP addresses (can be used to correlate where I&#x27;ve been and who I&#x27;m hanging out with if their own phones are connected to the same Wi-Fi network and thus share the same IP).')
