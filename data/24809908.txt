Obviously, science is an unspeakably valuable epistemological tool and process (and, as I see it, the inarguable best way to reach correct conclusions about the world). I&#x27;m no crackpot or conspiracy theorist who thinks vaccines don&#x27;t work or the earth is flat or climate change isn&#x27;t real.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is that, as I see it, society&#x27;s idea of &quot;science&quot; often conflates it with scientists and&#x2F;or institutions themselves (hence the &quot;argument to authority&quot; part of my comment above). This is, of course, the opposite of what science means, which is why it bothers me enough to have written these comments :-P')
