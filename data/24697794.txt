A lightless window looking out on the well inside a 20-story apartment building - less practical.<p>I have plenty of room, and enjoy fresh basil all summer (and pesto all winter!) but I understand I&#x27;m the exception.<p>Tried growing potatoes several times - fail. They rot in the ground, or the voles eat them before I can get at them, or they just don&#x27;t produce. Sigh. Back to the grocery store.')
