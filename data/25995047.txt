Even if they may contain binary blobs (which are normally unexpected, and not really conformant), they are still supposed to be text format.<p>Surely you can store anything on a bytea. However, that won&#x27;t take you very far if you want to query the logs (partially or completely) from the database --which is indeed extremely useful.<p>In any case, Postgres always strived for compliance. And here, it is not accepting a UTF-8 valid character, hence is being non-compliant.')
