Not everybody is successfully brainwashed and believes everything what chinese media or science tell them. They are extremely critical internally, but would never admit that publicly. Their privacy standards are much higher than in the west for a good reason. They are really spied upon, in a much grander scale. Eg their social media profiles are never with real names, and are invite-only. Facebook or Google realname policies won&#x27;t fly there.<p>So independent confirmation from westerners has its value.')
