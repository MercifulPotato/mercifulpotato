It seems to me that the only thing that would ever be exchanged between solar systems, would be information.<p>&gt; It is at least possible that a manufacturing ecosystem would be so difficult to develop that it would require fewer decades to transport products than to develop that ecosystem.<p>Or there are multiple desired products whose manufacturing ecosystems place such a burden on a system that a single system can&#x27;t support them all.')
