Processing fees are going to take away a significant chunk of your total donation relatively speaking if your individual donations are small.<p>Let&#x27;s do some math: In signal&#x27;s case, since they use Donorbox, there is a 2.9% + 30Â¢ fee for credit card transactions going via Stripe (in addition to another percentage that goes to donor box). If you were to donate $24 once per year, Signal would end up with just over $23 after processing fees had been deducted. If you donated $2 per month, they would end up with $19.7 per year, an additional $3 being spent on fees!<p>Edit: unless they have some special lower cost stripe rate of course, in which case you can ignore my comment altogether ;)')
