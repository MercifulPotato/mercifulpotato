There is nothing intrinsic to Java that forces developers to needlessly add abstractions.<p>If your codebase has too many unwarranted abstractions to the point it adds a toll to your maintenance, it&#x27;s up to you to refactor your code into maintainability.<p>And no, n-tier architectures do not add abstractions. They never do. At most, you add an interface to invert the dependencies between outer and inner layers, which does not create an abstraction. Instead they lift the interface that was always there,and ensures that you don&#x27;t have to touch your inner layers when you need to fix issues in your outer layers.')
