It even takes abs(), which might be mostly equivalent to your squaring operation.<p>Weird. I am really not trying to claim that I discovered ACF — quite the opposite. My result was shockingly different to what you found, even though the operations are so close to identical.<p>I think phase is extremely important in visualization. You can see why here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;theshawwn&#x2F;status&#x2F;1176070853819342848?s=21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;theshawwn&#x2F;status&#x2F;1176070853819342848?s=2...</a><p>You’ve come up with one of the most gorgeous visualizations I’ve ever seen for signals in general!<p>One way to incorporate phase: turn the angle into an x,y coordinate using atan2, then shade red and blue based on x and y. E.g. x of 1.0 is “full red”, x of -1.0 is no red; ditto for y, but with blue.<p>The other trick I used was to un-interleave the lines. Basically I noticed that every other line has a strong correlation; therefore drop every even numbered line to remove the aliasing artifacts. Then suddenly you get nice and smooth phase interpolations.')
