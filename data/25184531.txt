Every time I open the project it breaks because things have changed without me doing anything and then I have to spend an hour figuring out what hidden dependencies the Azure Functions runtime has which I must reference myself before my project compiles again.<p>I got so annoyed with it that I learned Go in order to use Google Cloud Functions before you could run .NET on them and ironically I have done a lot more Go and increasingly less .NET since then.')
