Also, it gives a <i>lot</i> of power to individuals whose modus operandi is the above.<p>But why is this the expectation? You could also subscribe to and support a publication <i>because</i> they make the hard choices, also publish the unpopular news. Because you think this is important. However, if you do this, support the publication, but the publication starts chasing profit instead of truth, then in the US, joke&#x27;s on you! <i>Of course</i> they would chase profit instead of truth, everybody will tell you.<p>It kind of reminds me of the Ferengi in Star Trek sometimes. Does the Star Trek universe perhaps offer any insight how they run a society when the <i>entirety</i> of this society is doing nothing but chase profit?')
