A 3090TI or 3080TI for example would have to launch at the most at the same price as their base models to stay competitive. That would result in a massive PR headache.<p>Also, would the TI versions actually help? Even a 100$ markup on a 3080TI would bring it close to the 6900 XT pricing.  And the 3080TI cannot come close the 3090&#x2F;6900 XT performance for that markup or otherwise it would risk cannibalizing Nvidia&#x27;s own products.<p>Nvidia&#x27;s only hope at this point is that either AMD fudged the benchmarks by a large margin or AMD gets hit with the same inventory issues.')
