Our primitives include int, float and complex in 32 and 64 bit sizes, and we also have vectors of these types. We have spoken about extending this to matrices, but it&#x27;s not in the current language.<p>It would be very nice to include this, as it would open up some useful patterns for analog modelling and ML runtimes.')
