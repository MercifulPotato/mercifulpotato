Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem. The EU wants doses made in the UK. The EU doses have already been exported to the UK.<p>This whole thing looks incompetent on the EU&#x27;s part, from the outside. First, the delays in signing. Second, the sloppiness of the contract. And third, the incompetence of the post-problem situation. The EU has something Britain wants--a trade deal. Strike a deal with the UK to get their vaccines. Instead, we have a song and dance, empty threats and name calling.')
