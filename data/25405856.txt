If they do this to you multiple times; you waiting for them and they do not even answering their phones, will you plan your next thing with the original enthusiasm? Or will you think &quot;oh god they wont even show up, whats the point of planning anything&quot;.<p>This has nothing to do with disease or disability, this is just a simple break of promises multiple times in a row.<p>This can be avoided though, simply make promises which can be kept; do work, which can tolerate unforeseen absences, or work in a different way than others which compensate the issue in some way that is fair for and agreed upon by the other teammates.<p>I have my own fair share of health issues, and managed to choose a workplace which accomodates my needs.<p>Some people are not that lucky to have the opportunity or even ability to do that, but this is not in the scope of responsibility of an average citizen to solve.')
