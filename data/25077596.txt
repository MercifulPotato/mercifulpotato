It&#x27;s actually quite nice â€” but our code is heavily, heavily typed. It would be miserable without the type system. Some of the older parts of the codebase are more loosely typed (although they&#x27;re shrinking reasonably quickly), and those sections are indeed a huge pain to ramp up on.<p>Part of the success of IG&#x27;s large Python codebase is FB&#x27;s investment into developer tooling; for example, FB wrote (and open-sourced, FWIW) our own PEP-484 compliant type checker, Pyre [1], because mypy was too slow for a codebase of our size.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;pyre-check" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;pyre-check</a>')
