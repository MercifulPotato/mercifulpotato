There are pictures of police officers taking selfies with protestors etc. They saw each other as sharing similar politics and backgrounds. Very different from the individual police officers attitudes toward Black Lives Matter protests.<p>Note I am not saying it was some kind of conspiracy with orders from abovve, I am saying individual police sympathies in aggregate led to much increased tolerance.<p>In many cases in the USA the cops are quite happy to create puddles of blood, for better or worse (and it&#x27;s usually worse).<p>Note I am also not saying they &quot;should&quot; have created puddles of blood here.')
