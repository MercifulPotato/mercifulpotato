There are no gifted options in elementary school but immediately from high school onwards standardised tests rank students into better and worse schools. Everyone knows which ones are which and the entrance scores are widely publicized in the media.<p>And you can bet your ass the best schools and universities only have kids from upper middle class parents. Turns out free education just means subsidising rich kids&#x27; education with public money here, just like everywhere else.')
