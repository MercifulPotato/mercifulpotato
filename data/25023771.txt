I&#x27;m just saying that sales is probably a bigger factor than you think. I&#x27;m going to assume that you&#x27;re an engineer. Tech alone doesn&#x27;t make a business successful. More so than not it makes a business fail. I agree that the statement &quot;Everything about a startup is sales&quot; is exaggerated. Although, I will say that good sales outweighs good tech the majority of the time. It baffles me that people don&#x27;t recognize that.')
