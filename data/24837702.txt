It took many repeats of the cycle before it was even realized that 20 hours was her limit, but those responsible for her case didn&#x27;t have options to help her because she could partially support herself normally and appeared able to do more.<p>The above is but one case - probably unique to just her, but I know of many other unique cases each with a different situation. The point is we cannot treat the poor alike. However not being able to treat them alike means there will be fraud anytime someone figures out how to work the system.')
