It&#x27;s powerful enough to make working on my project feasible, and indeed when travelling, it is what I use, reasonably happily.<p>But most laptops just can&#x27;t compile 800k lines of C++ fast enough to make them practical as a development system for that type of software, so the &quot;type of dev&quot; I am really does have something to do with it.<p>And yes, the new Apple laptops are not for me, which was my whole precise point, and (I believe) Gruber&#x27;s point in that quoted text, however unintentional.<p>I&#x27;d take one of the Minis though, just to see how fast it really is :)')
