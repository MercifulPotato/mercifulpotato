Below is taken from the rclone website:<p>Limitations<p>Downloading Images<p>When Images are downloaded this strips EXIF location (according to the docs and my tests). This is a limitation of the Google Photos API and is covered by bug #112096115.<p>The current google API does not allow photos to be downloaded at original resolution. This is very important if you are, for example, relying on &quot;Google Photos&quot; as a backup of your photos. You will not be able to use rclone to redownload original images. You could use &#x27;google takeout&#x27; to recover the original photos as a last resort\nDownloading Videos<p>When videos are downloaded they are downloaded in a really compressed version of the video compared to downloading it via the Google Photos web interface.
