Item(by='Ardren', descendants=None, kids=[25485124], score=None, time=1608453933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480083, text='&gt; I&#x27;m convinced that anyone who says they haven&#x27;t had &quot;any issues&quot; is either lying, has very low standards, or just doesn&#x27;t pay much attention to detail.<p>It feels dismissive, but I agree.  It seems unbelievable that there could be such a massive difference in bugs just based on different hardware.<p>Did these people never have a bald &#x27;V&#x27;?  Or have other characters clip into them?  Or spook an entire street by dodging?  Or get a wanted star for shooting a gang member?  Or not have the weapon accessory page not update after salvaging?
