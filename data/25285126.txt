This is stupid. I hate to be so, well, blunt, but you can’t be hurt by an App Store, maybe if you don’t like it you can create your own?<p>Apple (and they aren’t unique in this - Wal-Mart, Amazon, Steam, Epic, Nintendo, you name it) created a place for people to sell products. Without that creation, that market doesn’t exist. I’d you want to “punish” Apple then sure they can pay the developers and then all the developers can pay back all the profits they made on top of iOS.')
