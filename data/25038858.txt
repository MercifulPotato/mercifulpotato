If you&#x27;re already an expert in Haskell this might not seem like a big deal, but it certainly makes adoption a lot harder.<p>Another related issue is the level of abstraction is so high that it makes it harder to be extremely optimal with memory usage and access, which is something game developers love doing, even sometimes when they don&#x27;t strictly have to.<p>I love programming in Haskell, but I&#x27;m highly suspect that it will ever be a widely used game programming language. It&#x27;s very good at expressing computations in the abstract at the expense of being good at telling a physical computer exactly what to do. Game programmers tend to prefer languages that fall in the latter category in my experience.')
