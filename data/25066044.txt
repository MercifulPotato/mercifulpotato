If they all benchmark the same, what am I paying the difference for?<p>b) The M1 chip vs a ryzen desktop (naively interpreting this its punching up near a 5950X, which seems TGTBT?). How do these chips compare against the larger TDP competitors if portability and batteries aren&#x27;t an issue?<p>b2) Compared to the AMD mobile chips? (i don&#x27;t have much insight into these)<p>c) someone else on here posted a Tiger-lake intel chip benchmark beating the M1. Now that makes even less sense to me now, because now there&#x27;s an intel mobile chip beating the top of the line Ryzen desktop?<p>Help out an honestly confused individual.')
