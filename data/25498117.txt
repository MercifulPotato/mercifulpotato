And the &quot;labor&quot; is a selling point -- this a niche product is for customers who _want_ to build their own frame. The DIY assembly isn&#x27;t a cost-saving measure like with furniture.<p>The $800-$2500 is just a catch-all range for the rest of the components. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with their specific frame.<p>&gt; Care for your bike like a musical instrument?! They can&#x27;t be serious. That instrument had better be a steel triangle.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what your issue is with their statement. Regular maintenance is important, and will extend the life of the components. That&#x27;s true for all bikes. People that spend time &amp; money on a quality bike are willing to maintain them.<p>&gt; Is that 10 miles each? That&#x27;s not very reassuring.<p>I agree with you that their statement doesn&#x27;t give any indication of the durability of the frame. They should have quoted some kind of actual statistics, either real world or from factory testing.')
