I added &quot;for free&quot;, meaning that I don&#x27;t have to decide whether or not I want it enough to pay, and then enter my payment details, manage an account &amp; password, etc.<p>When Netflix was the only game in town, it actually made a measurable dent in pirate traffic; a fact which was widely reported at the time. Now that content owners want to have their own Netflix (thus draining its catalogue), piracy rises again [1].<p>It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s a certain limit the &quot;it&#x27;s not a price problem&quot; statement. I&#x27;m perfectly willing to pay up to a certain amount per month on entertainment services (and I do), but at some point, enough is enough. That certain amount will vary from person to person, the industry just needs to find that sweet spot and stop trying to turn potential clients into criminals.<p>[1] (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sandvine.com&#x2F;inthenews&#x2F;netflix-falls-to-second-place-in-global-internet-traffic-share" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sandvine.com&#x2F;inthenews&#x2F;netflix-falls-to-second-p...</a>)')
