Whereas the advantages of the desktop are primarily user-centric and affect the long-term or power users.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is generalizable to all web apps, but perhaps this distinction is why I always feel unsatisfied with the web app experience. I&#x27;m always happy to learn shortcut keys, tweak settings, and otherwise speed up the experience of apps I work with frequently. Basically I like being a power user. Web apps rarely cater to this desire and it feels like being stuck in perpetual &quot;novice&quot; mode.<p>Edit: s&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;web')
