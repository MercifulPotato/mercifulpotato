For example, I find it obvious when someone is interested in what I&#x27;m saying, but I&#x27;m not sure what to do with that information (e.g. do I just stop? Switch subjects, which might lead to the same problem? Etc.).<p>Where did you find this information? I might be self-analysing wrongly, so it&#x27;d be helpful to know how one might reach the opposite conclusion.')
