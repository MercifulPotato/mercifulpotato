In other words, its not the fault of the individual&#x2F;human hardware its the fault of the patterns that society has entrenched aka systemic racism or the software of a culture.<p>Its a top down theory&#x2F;solution to what critics would argue is a bottom up problem. Individuals must be responsible for what they say, how they regulate their emotional state, and how their experiences and cognitive distortions skew their thinking. CT&#x2F;CRT, by my understanding, argues against this. Thus it seems reasonable to say it leads to a lack of accountability if you define accountability as a responsibility for ones actions and beliefs.<p>I’ve read a small bit on CT&#x2F;CRT, intersectionality, and the modern culture of safetyism. Primarily from Haidt who has more peer reviewed sources on things than anyone could ever want.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0735224897&#x2F;ref=nodl_" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Gen...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0307455777&#x2F;ref=nodl_" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Relig...</a><p>I find CT&#x2F;CRT to be compelling to a degree, but it brings along with it too much baggage in my opinion. You’re likely not going to find or be given a specific source of data that says CRT leads to lack of accountability (however you would measure that), its an assumption made by the previous poster. You don’t need one either to have a discussion, so don’t fall back on the lack of academic evidence as an argument in itself.')
