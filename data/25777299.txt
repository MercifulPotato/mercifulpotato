Some folks who develop for open source are not motivated by money, and may not even want it.<p>I personally have been developing MMS to get it on the pinephone, and I don&#x27;t think I would want anyone to donate to me. The main reason is now I feel like it obligates me to work and support people, versus now I do not feel any obligation. I get that I can ask for donations with no expectation in return, but I would still feel that way.<p>I would offer if that is truly what you want, perhaps taking some of the first steps to get it going may be a lot more useful than donating. If you have the first steps done, it makes the goal much easier if others want to help. That is exactly what I have found wokring through my project. A lot of people come out the woodwork to help on smaller issues that they can tackle, but there was no large scale effort until I finally rolled up my sleeves to start.')
