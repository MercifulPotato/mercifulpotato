VNC, RDP, that sort of thing.  Use Xvnc or Xrdp on the remote machine, so the apps on that machine have something to connect to.<p>Although X was remote-capable from early on, it was never especially well designed for remote uses.  For example you can&#x27;t easily detach from a display and move an app to a different display.  And it&#x27;s not very good at latency on a high-latency network.  Partly that&#x27;s because of how it assigned XIDs in the protocol; they should have been client-assigned.  It would still be possible to make that change (as an extension) but it hasn&#x27;t been done.<p>It would be great if there was a modern remote desktop application protocol, that works well over all kinds of networks and allows application windows be moved between different display clients easily (e.g. from your laptop to your desktop at work).  Or even better, let the application move as well, for ideal responsiveness everywhere.<p>I think we will get that eventually, because it&#x27;s such a natural evolution of all the distributed things we&#x27;re building.  But I think it will be a long time coming.')
