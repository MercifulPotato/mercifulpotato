Item(by='cycloptic', descendants=None, kids=[25453064], score=None, time=1608166468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25450608, text='I&#x27;m not going to argue about semantics but I want to be clear here: the basic definition of &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; is keeping the old thing working. Adding new features is often at odds with this because it can break things in subtle ways. You might be able to make some small backend changes, bringing back some of the major breaking changes to widgets or to the rendering model is out of the question.<p>If someone really wants to backport things like wayland support or emojis to GTK2, or make a shim layer to support all the old GTK2 APIs in GTK3, you could probably get people on board to take those patches somewhere. I know adding wayland support would not be simple and would probably break things as there are a lot of things in GDK2 that were direct mappings onto X11 APIs that have no analog in wayland. As the backports pile up you would have to weigh the cost of doing that versus just porting the application and getting the additional benefits of porting to a newer version. It would only be a total waste of time if there were no benefits to porting, but this is not the case.<p>I just doubt any of the GTK4 developers are going to want to drop what they&#x27;re working on now to do these things given the risk it carries combined with the fact that there are workarounds for these missing features.')
