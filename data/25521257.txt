I never met one (obviously!) but I wonder how do they learn their stuff. Do they read deep tech stuff regularly? I assume they already known all the internal details of whatever system they are trying to crack (e.g., TCP&#x2F;IP, ssh, HTTP, Linux, etc.)... I guess they learnt that stuff at some point in the past and then moved on. Moved on to what? I suppose they stop &#x27;reading&#x27; and started to &#x27;produce&#x27;; they don&#x27;t learn from others, they are the source of knowledge for some topics (I mean, a zero-day exploit is something that cannot be learnt... one must come up with it based on previous accumulated knowledge).<p>I guess I won&#x27;t ever be able to know how real &quot;crackers&quot; learn by just searching on the internet... but since HN, perhaps you guys know a guy that knows a guy that actually knows how real crackers learn. Would be interesting to read that!')
