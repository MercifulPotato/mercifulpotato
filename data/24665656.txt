I can&#x27;t believe I never thought to look at the documentation for `jekyll serve`. This will make my life much easier.<p>Another note on using Hugo. I have really enjoyed working with Hugo, both for the speed and for the overall experience. I ran into an issue where the table of contents was not rendering properly. I believe it&#x27;s a known bug, perhaps just with some themes. Since I&#x27;m not familiar with Go yet, I came up with a quick fix by writing a quick Python script that converts all the incorrect TOC links to the correct links for my site. It&#x27;s plenty fast for me, and I can always make it faster by using bash or sed, or learning a little Go and patching Hugo. At some point I&#x27;d like to do that just to contribute back to the project. So it&#x27;s quite possible to use a static site generator in a language you&#x27;re less familiar with, and create quick tooling scripts around it for any issues you run into that you don&#x27;t want to deal with in the generator&#x27;s native language.')
