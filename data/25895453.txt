Item(by='andrewzah', descendants=None, kids=[25895572, 25896202], score=None, time=1611519346, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25895348, text='I really don&#x27;t get why the concept of mastodon is so confusing.<p>It&#x27;s basically twitter&#x2F;microblogging* with multiple hosts, and you can see posts from other hosts. So instead of just @andrewzah, my handle becomes @andrewzah@&lt;host-I-chose&gt;. You could visualize twitter as @andrewzah@twitter.com, but it&#x27;s redundant as twitter is the only host. This is basically how email works, no?<p>The only other difference is federation, so you have two timelines instead of one: the entire** federated timeline, and the local timeline to your host. Plus the timeline of users you follow.<p>So unlike twitter, the user must decide what host they want to use. Or they can self-host an instance. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s up to date, but <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instances.social" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instances.social</a> has a wizard for this.<p>*: IIRC mastodon&#x27;s default limit is 500 chars, and pleroma&#x27;s is 2,000.<p>**: One exception: Hosts can block other hosts. So if you use i.e. mastodon.social, you won&#x27;t see posts from users on blocked hosts unless you specifically follow them.')
