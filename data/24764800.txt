There is lots of money too, and people in charge in governments that are interested in using private security agencies like public security agencies because the private sector is usually way more efficient than the public one. That also applies to spies.<p>This is prone for abuses, and society should react to protect themselves. You can easily create a &quot;dictatorship in practice&quot; from a democracy with it.<p>Now, AI is just the technology that makes global surveillance possible, machines are cheap and easy to control. The alternative humans are expensive and prone to whistle blowers denouncing your abuses.<p>But AI is not an ideology, it is just a technique set, and you can use it for very good things, like counting blood cells, driving cars or watch your house while you are away.<p>It is a good thing that exist, only that it must be controlled by the users and not be the controller itself.')
