If you&#x27;ve every tried to copy and paste from a PDF and got rubbish (as opposed to a message saying you aren&#x27;t allowed to do that), the reason is the Turning complete program painting the page doesn&#x27;t have to paint things in a particular order and the things it paints may be bit maps.  In the worst case you may as well be trying to copy a bunch of PNG images that have been plonked onto the canvas that happen to look like letters to a human.<p>We would have been far better off with a declarative way of painting a page.  It&#x27;s not that hard - SVG achieves the same end result, and is purely declarative.')
