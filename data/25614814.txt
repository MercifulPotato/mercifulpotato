IMHO the B&amp;W adds really nice context - and it sounds like it&#x27;s not just a straight overlay, but he&#x27;s recoloring the B&amp;W pixels, which I think provides a crisper result.<p>I&#x27;m curious what resolutions you&#x27;ve worked with, if you don&#x27;t mind sharing. High frame rate thermal cameras (above 9hz) are ITAR restricted. Hi-res above 640x480 is not common on the consumer market and is restricted to embargoed countries. Cooled thermal cameras are restricted too IIRC.')
