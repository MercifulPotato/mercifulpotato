Can&#x27;t remember the key combo to hold down during boot to do this. I just remember iteratively dragging half of the extensions out of the folder to find the culprit. I also remember my 4 year old daughter counting the extensions displayed along the bottom to know how much longer it was going to be before she could play her games.')
