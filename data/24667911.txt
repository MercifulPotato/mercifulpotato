I can&#x27;t disagree with that, but it isn&#x27;t relevant.<p>&gt; Many, many other countries don&#x27;t have a lot of natural resources and are not having these problems.<p>They have the 3rd largest economy in the world. It goes US, China and then Japan. 30% higher GDP than the next contender, Germany. If there are any non-linear economic effects at all between size and labour market, Japan is going to find them first.')
