I have the DashPass, which was advertised as free delivery for many restaurants. Turns out it only works if you spend $12, and even then sometimes it doesn’t apply. If you check prices between the app and the actual restaurants’ websites, there’s often an extra $2-3 added on for each item on DoorDash (I don’t blame the restaurants). When it’s all said and done, a basic $10 meal ends up being $20+ through DoorDash after the upcharged food items, delivery fee, service fee, and tip.<p>Edit: I do still order through DoorDash when they offer me the occasional coupon, but I rarely order without a substantial discount. I don’t know how this business model is sustainable. I’ve also noticed that many local restaurants offer their own free delivery with no service fee or up charging if you live nearby. Also, some of the best restaurants in the area seem to not be on DoorDash, Uber Eats, etc.')
