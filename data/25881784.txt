It&#x27;s not super interesting so nobody raves about it.<p>Java&#x27;s new collectors ZGC and Shenandoah are state of the art, perhaps the best GC&#x27;s in the world. There&#x27;s collectors with lower latency and higher throughput but nothing out there that achieves both like Java&#x27;s new collectors do.<p>It&#x27;s a large part of why you hear that Java &quot;performs better in production&quot; than Go and C# even though those languages are faster in micro benchmarks. Java doesn&#x27;t have value types and generates a ton of garbage but the collectors are good enough that it&#x27;s still competitive with these faster languages.<p>Some will tell you that Go&#x27;s GC is state of the art but I disagree. Last time it came up I started a huge flamewar in the comments so I&#x27;ll avoid comparing them :).')
