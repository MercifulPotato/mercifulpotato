China has already moved up the manufacturing value chain. The low end stuff has been getting shipped to ASEAN countries for more than a decade.<p>&gt; If India adopted the chinese model (what americans call &quot;cheating&quot;)<p>The &quot;chinese&quot; model is actually the american model. It&#x27;s what japan and the asian tigers all modeled their economy around.<p>&gt; it could probably compete against china even with a free trade arrangement, but they&#x27;re probably not going to do that.<p>Compete in what capacity? China and India are in different leagues now. It&#x27;s sad that people really believe the nonsense they read on the news. India is even behind ASEAN countries like vietnam when it comes to manufacturing.<p>Nothing you wrote made any sense.')
