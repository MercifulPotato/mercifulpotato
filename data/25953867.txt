I simply don’t trust Robinhood anymore. I feel they are too leveraged and too exposed to the cross-winds of retail investors. Flashmob trading is officially a thing and Robinhood  will be the most exposed brokerage when it comes to volatility and lack of liquidity.<p>After what happened today it’s clear they can’t be trusted with my securities and even less with my liquid cash.<p>I don’t want to have any kind of money in Robinhood because I have the weird feeling it could go down. That’s how much I distrust them at this point. \nIf they really halted transactions because of lack of liquidity, imagine what could happen with them if we experience a bubble burst or any other major economic event that impacts public markets.<p>I’m certain I’m not the only one feeling like this. If I could I would sell and re-buy at another brokerage but I want to avoid a tax event.')
