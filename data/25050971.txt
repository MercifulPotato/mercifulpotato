Because good clients have  regular work and adequate budgets, existing contractors are already working with them (the regular work part) and existing contractors are moving heaven and earth to keep those clients (the adequate budget part). Good clients have long term relationships. As do established contractors.<p>It is a long game. Deep pockets to ride out cycles are helpful. Because of relationships.<p>A common mistake is pursuing clients with little money. There is a sound business reason established contractors don’t work for people with no money. New contractors do it as a way of avoiding competition. But there’s only so much runway to fritter on a dead end strategy.<p>In your case it sounds particularly dead end because the projects are undercapitalized. This makes them even less likely to succeed. It means the founders are less likely to be plugged into a network of well capitalized further opportunities. And your role is central to the success, under resourced, and requires working with “amateurs” (as opposed to founders with successful fundraising track records...never mind exits).<p>In short you need better clients and time spent doing work for lousy clients is both easier and less productive than time spent pursuing good clients. Good luck.')
