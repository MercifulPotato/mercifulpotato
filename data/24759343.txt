What I meant was higher rate of crime against people and police.<p>But to give you an idea what might turn police force to want to have more serious weapons. Just few days ago there was a 2 hours long attack on the local police station in France. Attackers used fireworks. Police did not respond though and I do not have an idea why. Perhaps they were outnumbered and outgunned.<p>In such situation, where criminals do what they like, would you prefer your police force have some serious weapons or you would think that it would be an overreaction?')
