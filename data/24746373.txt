Item(by='jancsika', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602429636, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745471, text='&gt; There is a well-known idea that liberal Hollywood indoctrinates audiences, leading them to change their values or beliefs.<p>The author spends half the article on what is essentially a left-wing fairy tale that posits the question, &quot;If the Democrats had political rhetoric even half as effective as the Republicans , what might it sound like?&quot; Putting that show in the context of &quot;liberal indoctrination&quot; is like writing an entire article on Bolero and then stating, &quot;A lot of people find Ravel&#x27;s music blustery and repetitive.&quot;<p>I also love how the author uses ambiguity to hedge in that sentence. E.g., change <i>how</i>? Say I give the example of Zero Dark Thirty repeating the right-wing propaganda of its former-CIA consultants to rationalize the CIA torture regime so a lot of powerful people can continue evading jail time. I go on to explain that this is par for the course for the modern Hollywood U.S. war movie with very few exceptions. Well, the author never said the indoctrination was toward liberal values-- they only implied it was effective in changing ideas and values. So now they can freely pivot to one of a number of potentially contradictory positions at will (military movies are an exception, Hollywood liberal are only liberal in name, author doesn&#x27;t actually believe the trope and was only using it as an example, Hollywood liberalism is uncritical and therefore subject to exploitation from other powerful propagandists like the Pentagon&#x2F;China, etc.).<p>In light of that it is worth noting-- especially on HN-- that there is writing in the humanities that doesn&#x27;t merely &quot;ask questions,&quot; but also does research, provides evidence, and takes a stance based on that evidence. This isn&#x27;t an example of that.')
