Using aircraft we can already transport large volumes of items fairly quickly around the world, yet most freight is still transported by sea because it&#x27;s cheaper.<p>A standard &#x27;96&quot; pallet&#x27; on aircraft is 317cm x 244cm x 244cm (125&quot; x 96&quot; x 96&quot;) and can hold 6,804 kg (15,000lb). Specialised aircraft can carry even more - some aircraft can transport trains!<p>The only place where I could see needing to ship stuff quicker - that could actually afford it as I&#x27;m guessing it won&#x27;t be cheap - would be the military. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s nessasarily a good thing though...')
