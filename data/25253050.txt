They are hard right-wingers who voted for Trump, twice, and probably watch OAN and Newsmax all day.<p>2. I should not talk about anything remotely sensitive in the presence of this person, and I cannot ever let them find out that I&#x27;m bisexual.<p>3. They will be easier to anger than other people.<p>I don&#x27;t know why I assume #3, but I do.<p>Also, city vs city. If I hear a New Jersey accent, I assume:<p>1. You have poor character<p>2. You&#x27;re very shallow<p>3. You probably have several STDs.<p>If I hear a Boston accent, I don&#x27;t assume anything immediately negative about you yourself, but I do assume that you grew up in a slightly grimy city with slightly rougher people.')
