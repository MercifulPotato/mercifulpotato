I followed the news enough to know you&#x27;ve misrepresented it.<p>Unarmed protesters wanted to protest in front of the police station. The police blocked them. The protests grew day by day because the police kept escalating to violence.<p>Then the police suddenly abandoned the station and the area. The protesters didn&#x27;t ask for it. The mayor and police chief denied ordering it. The police just went rogue and left the protesters to figure out what to do. They never occupied the police station.<p>The first shooting was just outside the protest area. People who knew the victim and the suspect said it was a long running feud.<p>The second shooting was outside the protest area. The victim said he was attacked by white supremacists.<p>The third shooting was outside the protest area. The victim refused to talk to police. So no one knows who did it.<p>The last shooting did involve armed protesters working as security guards. It wasn&#x27;t a case of mistaken identity though. The teenagers drove at the barricades minutes after erratically driving through the occupied park.')
