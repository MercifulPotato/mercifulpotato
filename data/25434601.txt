When the world appears to be unjust and we feel powerless to change, we (humans) tend to fabricate justifications for the actions of others. So that we feel better about themselves and we can move on thinking bad things won&#x27;t happen to us.<p>This is how you see someone getting beaten during an arrest and people are like &quot;but this guy was once arrested for such and such&quot;. The assumption being, since they are &quot;bad&quot; people, that&#x27;s the reason why bad things happen to them. And, therefore, that won&#x27;t happen to &quot;me&quot;.
