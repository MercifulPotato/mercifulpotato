At least for me, I&#x27;ve never needed anything particularly special maths-wise for professional work, apart from derivatives for ML&#x2F;AI and even that was just academic-self-pleasuring from the course I took... no ML library requires you to mathematically prove something before you can use them (at least not the ones I have used)')
