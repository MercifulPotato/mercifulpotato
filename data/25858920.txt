I&#x27;m in Canada.  De-icing is a normal part of flying in the winter.  If there is a line&#x2F;delay for de-icing, it is because the airlines chose not to buy enough.<p>Fyi, de-icing is also a lie told to many passengers as cover for other things.  A plane must takeoff within a fix time after de-icing fluid is applied.  So an aircraft wont even line up for it until absolutely every other problem&#x2F;delay is solved.  If they are talking about de-icing, and the engines are not yet running, they are covering for something.')
