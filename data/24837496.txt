Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24837530], score=None, time=1603203187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836422, text='&gt; A person who is looking for a full-time job that pays a living wage — but who can&#x27;t find one — is unemployed.<p>Yes, if you add at least underemployment by an arbitrary and probably contentious “living wage” standard to traditional unemployment, the number is bigger than you are used to hearing and sounds scarier. Of course, all the historical numbers you&#x27;ve heard are also using the traditional measure, so while the number sounds scarier, you&#x27;ll also need to erase your memory and replace it with a different data series to have the right context, which will then probably make the current value of the new measure seem a lot less scary. Or not? While arguments for a different headline unemployment number than is currently employed often put a lot of emphasis on how much bigger the current measure would be using the proposed changes, they rarely out that current level in historical perspective.<p>&gt; The official unemployment ... also excludes anybody who has stopped looking for work or is discouraged by a lack of jobs or by the demands of child care during the coronavirus crisis.<p>So does the definition you just presented, which excludes anyone who isn&#x27;t looking for work, whatever the reason. Or are you now defining  “looking for a full-time job that pays a living wage” to include people that aren’t, in fact, looking for a job of any kind? But it&#x27;s the relative movement not the a absolute level that drives most policy responses, so aside from a bigger number, what different actionable insight does the proposal provide? The article doesn&#x27;t even begin to make an argument that this number is more useful for any practical purpose, even if it was coherent, which the contradictions in the first couple paragraphs seems to indicate that it is not.')
