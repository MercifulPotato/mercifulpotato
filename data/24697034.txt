That could change in the future but right now when people spend money on media they&#x27;re merely buying some company&#x27;s permission to enjoy some content. That permission can be revoked at any time and for any reason or no reason.<p>I think you are misunderstanding my point.<p>What I am saying is that most people&#x27;s expectation of leasing&#x2F;renting arrangements is such that there are protections in place to prevent the thing from being arbitrarily taken away.<p>However those protections don&#x27;t exist for software services, only physical things like cars and apartments. Thus it is a violation of peoples&#x27; expectations that software services don&#x27;t have those protections.<p>So it is not enough to simply tell them, &quot;You don&#x27;t own it and that&#x27;s the problem&quot;. That does not fully explain the problem. In order to fully explain the problem you would need to explain how not only do you not own it, but ALSO there are no legal protections to prevent it from arbitrarily being taken away like a layperson might expect there to be such a situation.<p>&gt; People aren&#x27;t leasing content though. They&#x27;re buying it. They buy books, they buy video games...<p>Earlier you just said that users don&#x27;t own the content... so which is it?')
