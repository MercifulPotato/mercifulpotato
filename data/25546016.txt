Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609012987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545724, text='&gt; There is literally no difference, in this regard, between a dumb TV with a dongle&#x2F;box plugged in, and a smart TV which has exactly the same thing built-in.<p>I mean, the TV is usually much more expensive than the dongles that get attached to it. I don&#x27;t love replacing a $30 dongle every few years, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt my wallet too bad. replacing a whole $500-1500 TV every few years is a big deal.<p>ultimately I&#x27;ve made my peace with the whole smart TV thing. my current one does a much better job streaming high bitrate local media than a chromecast. whenever it stops getting updates, I will probably just buy a NUC to use as a source, and use it as an unnecessarily complicated dumb TV.')
