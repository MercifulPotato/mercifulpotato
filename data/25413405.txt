My son was making purchases on an ipod game without knowing what he was doing. They kept putting popups on the screen. He wanted to keep playing, so he closed the popup. What he didn&#x27;t realize was that it was costing an average of $25 every time he closed the popup. It took about 30 minutes to rack up $200 in charges.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to put together a reasonable defense for this. What really pissed me off was that even though Apple eventually refunded the money, they kept making it sound like it was my fault. &quot;You need to turn on this setting in this menu.&quot; Nope. Not my fault at all. The setting <i>was</i> turned on but it failed. And even if I hadn&#x27;t turned it on, why on earth should you need to opt out rather than opt in?<p>Maybe it doesn&#x27;t have much of an impact on the industry as a whole. My response has been simple. I&#x27;ve not given my credit card number to any device since. I just don&#x27;t buy that stuff from anyone.')
