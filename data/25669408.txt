It is simply a matter of that community signaling that you are not welcome and telling you to leave.<p>Any community is free to set its own rules for who they consider welcome and you are more than able to join or create an alternative community where you feel more welcome.<p>That said, claiming that only right-leaning folks are being mocked or told to leave communities is highly disingenuous. Think about being a liberal&#x2F;left-leaning gun owner and trying to participate in the vast majority of gun forums online. Or hunting forums. Or a lot of survivalist&#x2F;bushcraft forums. Or militaria forums. Or car forums.')
