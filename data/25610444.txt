At least Microsoft is apathetic all the way through: don&#x27;t expect any help, but as far as I know you won&#x27;t get shot out of the blue. To me, Apple&#x27;s whole shtick these last few years reads as if they&#x27;re just saying &quot;We don&#x27;t want you to develop on our platform.&quot; (&quot;Pay us for even the ability to start making anything on our devices. Give us our cut for letting you exist and provide content for our platform. You can&#x27;t do that anymore; banned. Make this arbitrary change or you&#x27;re gone in x days...&quot;)')
