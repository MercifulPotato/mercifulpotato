I prefer my own picks, my own solutions, and learning, but microk8s having these instantly available would be really good for a lot of folks. Until now though it has never felt like those advantages would be useful in a real prod environment, that microk8s was not interested in being in prod, but HA signals to me that they are interested in broader adoption.')
