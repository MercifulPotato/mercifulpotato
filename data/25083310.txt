Most of my drivers are retired people who got bored and wanted some extra cash, like to chat, and wanted to get out of the house. Others have some disability that prevents them from working fulltime. Many are doing it for extra cash, especially around the holidays. Many only selectively drive when there are events that they know will make the rates spike.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are tons of fulltime Uber drivers, especially if you live in a city where cab drivers have made the switch.
