All they need is a simple majority to accomplish all of the things I listed. You said it yourself - everybody wants to have a one party state, right? So who, besides Joe Manchin and perhaps Kyrsten Sinema stands in the way of adding new states, abolishing the filibuster, packing the courts, or any other part of the democrat agenda?<p>There are no shortage of voices for these things. Where are the voices against them?<p>If Joe Biden, who is supposed to be some kind of moderate, can&#x27;t tell the American public whether he&#x27;s for or against packing the supreme court, what does that say about the state of the democratic party?')
