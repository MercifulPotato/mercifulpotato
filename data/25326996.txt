Anaerobic digestion produces methane which is ~83x worse than CO2 as a greenhouse gas.<p>The alternative is to gasify it, and produce biochar (a.k.a terra preta), a form of carbon that is mixed with the soil to improve it&#x27;s nutrient and water retention, friability and microbial activity.  Biochar is theorized to be stable for 10k years in the soil.')
