That&#x27;s why it is used.<p>Naive redundancy ignores almost a century of better method form forward error correcting codes. I have a feeling your idea of redundancy is having multiple exact copies of a system or data and having them vote, which is a terribly expensive way to do data protection when there are vastly better methods.<p>&gt;Of course, somebody who sells ECC RAM will want to convince you that ECC actually solves a real problem. The same can be said about the nutritional supplement industry, or many other industries that rely on make-belief.<p>And we&#x27;re done. If you don&#x27;t think ECC helps a real problem then I see why you don&#x27;t understand bitflip causing problems. Good luck.')
