He used to love going to parks and playing, but after a few months of lockdown he is afraid of stepping out anywhere. Anxiety is now up through the roof. He taught himself to read (with basic comprehension) during the lockdown (just before his 3rd birthday) - but that&#x27;s a good thing and a bad thing (hyperlexia). Considering therapy now for him, which we weren&#x27;t entirely for earlier since many people in the spectrum have highlighted some important issues.<p>In short, it&#x27;s been pretty hard on the family. I decided to go back to my anxiety medication which I hadn&#x27;t needed for quite some time.')
