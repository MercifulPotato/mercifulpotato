In the example of Sun and Ximian, it can be viewed as commoditizing or directly funding a non existent yet required comunterpart due to lack of in house expertise.<p>I suspect the reality of the majority of less visible chains of compliments are closer to symbiotic than parasitic - that intentional and extreme commoditization are the adversarial exceptions which are so large and monopolistic as to bias the landscape... even then as other commenters point out, those relationships don&#x27;t appear to be sustainable long term, due to longer term negative side effects or a changing landscape.')
