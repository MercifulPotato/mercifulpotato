It&#x27;s a logical fallacy. Moreover your claim about Gasan Gusejnov is taken out of context. He said: &quot;кроме <i>того</i> убогого клоачного русского, на котором <i>сейчас</i> говорит и пишет эта страна&quot;, i.e. &quot;apart from <i>that</i> sordid and cloacal Russian language in which this country speaks and writes <i>now</i>&quot;. It is clear that he didn&#x27;t mean the Russian language as a whole but the form of Russian language used in oral and written public communication lately.')
