I find it incredibly frustrating that network effects and game theory mean we&#x27;re stuck with sub-optimal solutions to problems just because &quot;everybody else uses it&quot;. Twitter thread long-posts are just one example.<p>I would love to see some proposals for legislation designed to mitigate user-base monopolies. Products should be competing on features, price, and performance; not on who happened to acquire the most users first.<p>Facebook, Twitter, Slack, Office, iMessages, etc. are just a few examples of products that are market leaders not because of the quality of their product, but because they happened to capture large enough user bases to spur network-based growth.<p>I have no idea what this legislation would actually look like (or how disastrous the unintended effects would be), but at first blush I&#x27;m imagining something along the lines of compulsory interoperability requirements. The devil is in the details of course...')
