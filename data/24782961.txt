I am finally (late 40s) able to sleep several hours in a row after decades of not being able to sleep continuously for more than an hour or so. Ironically, I need to get up at 4:45am for my job but can&#x27;t go to bed until 11pm. Ha ha. I get to sleep in a bit on weekends so can&#x27;t complain. My issues were related to chronic illness. I hope you get some relief.')
