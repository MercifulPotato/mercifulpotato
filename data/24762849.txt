Even at full wattage, a phone transceiver will give off around 100mW, in most realistic scenarios it will be less than a tenth of that.<p>Even if you used the maximum band power of 1 watt, that isn&#x27;t really enough to do anything. At rest your body will produce about 80 Watts of heat energy, which is a much higher frequency than what your phone gives off and hence has much more energy per quanta. Also keep in mind that 1 Watt is going in all directions, at best you cover half the hemisphere and even assuming phone manufacturers aren&#x27;t optimizing for phones to radiate away because that gives better reception at lower power, you&#x27;d be getting half a watt of energy from a device going maximum transmit power. A standard phone will likely give you less than 5mW of energy dosage.<p>The most that your phone can do is warm up your ear a bit if you put it under your pillow. By an amount that is likely to be not measurable with modern equipment.<p>And before noting about ionizing radiation; phones aren&#x27;t high enough frequency or power to really do that at any appreciable level. Only high frequencies are capable of ionizing since it requires an atom receiving a certain amount of energy per quantum, and the energy per quantum is only related to the frequency, not the transmit power.')
