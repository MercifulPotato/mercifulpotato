Item(by='eska', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603609167, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880081, text='The memrise blog has some very important info about how one should create cards. Making them ask about only one thing in isolation is one of them.<p>For example all downloadable Kanji decks basically ask &quot;Kanji -&gt; meaning, kun readings, on readings, nanori readings, translation, example jukugo, example sentence, pronunciation, stroke order, ...&quot;, i.e. not atomic at all.<p>I have instead made my own deck where each Kanji has multiple cards that ask for different pairs of information. One of the important reasons is that I may have more trouble remembering one of those than the others, and that should not make me have to redo those others, since SRS should ask when I&#x27;m about to forget.')
