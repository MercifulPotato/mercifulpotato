I just think of it as a convenient notation since those obey similar composition rules (that probably stem from their odd and even-ness, and taylor series decomposition from there).<p>So you need at least that one, since it is by convention, and not really derivable[1]:<p><pre><code>    exp(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)\n</code></pre>\nI personally just use Euler&#x27;s notation (using exp) as a tool to derive trig formulas, since I know power composition rules quite well already, and those tend to be more useful in general.<p><pre><code>   [cos(x)]^2 + [sin(x)]^2 = 1\n</code></pre>\nIs just the Pythagorean theorem on a unit circle, which also defines sin and cos :)<p>[1] OK, you can look at the taylor series expansion, but you need to remember the derivatives for this.')
