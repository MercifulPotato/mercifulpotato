The logic here is that they baited you for so long that it suddenly became fair?<p>Apply that logic to other situations and it doesn&#x27;t make sense. I get that `you` may be ok with this, but it doesn&#x27;t change what it is.<p>Regardless of whether we individually feel what is happening is &#x27;fair&#x27;, we should be able to acknowledge why someone is upset and that this is indeed a bait &amp; switch. Customers were offered unlimited backup and storage of the photos they took. Customers used said service with that expectation, while competitors to it went out of business, and now, they are forced to pay for continued service. That is a bait &amp; switch.<p>The moment we have to start saying, &quot;well, they should have known better&quot; or &quot;how did you expect this to be free forever&quot; puts us into victim blaming territory. Just because someone could have been aware of a bait &amp; switch&#x2F;scam, doesn&#x27;t make that practice not a bait &amp; switch&#x2F;scam.')
