Are you sleeping less than 6 hours? Obviously, there&#x27;s probably 2 hours per day in small intervals where I&#x27;m not maximizing my day.<p>Because of this, I recently picked up guitar, and this is nice for the random periods I&#x27;m free, because I feel like picking it up 4 or 5 times a day for 5-10 minutes still allows me to make a lot of progress, be creative, and learn a lot about (and appreciate) music.<p>Chess is also something you could do this with, but I feel like at that time scale it would be harder and less rewarding, and this is still about 1&#x2F;4th of the two hours mentioned.<p>Edit:<p>I probably spend 30 minutes on HN per day, which is mostly a waste. But this is also in small intervals.')
