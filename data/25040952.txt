In vaccines where weâ€™ve seen ADE we usually see it in monkey trials and if not there, we see it in phase 3. SARS vaccines never made it to phase 3 because we kept seeing ADE early on and then it died out. To keep bringing it up at this point, when none of the hundred or so vaccines have seen it, seems a little ridiculous.')
