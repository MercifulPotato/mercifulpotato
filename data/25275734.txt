Item(by='sriku', descendants=None, kids=[25276108], score=None, time=1606912043, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25275054, text='While a notation for this case makes for an interesting discussion (which the post is), the &quot;blast radius&quot; of this situation is so small that (to me) it wouldn&#x27;t be worth adopting any of the proposals (not saying anyone there pushed them).<p>For a notation to be worth adoption,its impact must be far reaching. The &quot;graphical linear algebra&quot; makes a good case with a larger blast radius, for example. However even that has nowhere near the impact of, say, Feynman diagrams.<p>The x^y notation is repurposed elsewhere - ex: power set of a set S is written 2^S .. with no implication that the &quot;logarithm&quot; of the power set to the base 2 is S. Same for matrices raised to a power, where matrices are usually not thought of as a base for doing logarithms. Same for operators in calculus (ex: laplacian .. now that would be confusing to club with a triangle!)')
