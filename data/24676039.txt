If it turns out that Trump was symptomatic before those events itâ€™s a huge lack of discretion and maybe even criminal.  In theory he has access to a test with a 15-minute turnaround time. So why the delay in diagnosing?<p>His team also refused to be tested before the debate. Imagine if it comes out that they knew they were having an outbreak and showed up anyway without masks. It sounds like a conspiracy theory but I can see it happening- the alternative would have been to cancel the debate at the last minute, which has terrible optics.  If his team had suddenly worn masks it would have been an indication they knew something was up.')
