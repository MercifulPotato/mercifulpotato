However, the Buff was quite uncomfortable when I did this, so I looked into getting a proper cloth mask. As it happens, the cloth mask is more comfortable and WAY more effective at filtration!<p>I now use the Buffs on my head when I work out. They&#x27;re great at absorbing sweat; not as great for preventing the spread of coronavirus.<p>Unfortunately, football coaches and players still use gaiters on the field (at least the ones I&#x27;ve seen when I&#x27;ve seen games at bars and stuff).')
