Automation to the point of removing humans leads to stupid problems that a human wouldn&#x27;t make if they looked at what was going on.  So we automate tot he point where we minimize human contact, presenting a summary of actions that as humans we can apply our wonderful brains to and prevent those problems.  Except some percentage of the time we <i>don&#x27;t</i> actually pay attention, and depending on how the human interaction was introduced instead of complete automation, some percentage (or multiple!) of errors still sneak through.<p>Automation to the point of minimal human contact where you <i>assume</i> the human will read the presented information and make an informed decision doesn&#x27;t work.  The point is that we want a human to <i>understand</i> what is being asked, so taking some step to ensure they <i>do</i> understand is warranted.  It will never be perfect, but adding steps like she proposes are definitely a step in the right direction, IMO.')
