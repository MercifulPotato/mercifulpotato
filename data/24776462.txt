Rogan&#x27;s compensation isn&#x27;t based on Spotify&#x27;s total profits, and if you don&#x27;t listen to him, you won&#x27;t be contributing to his audience size either, and Spotify will be able to see that in their metrics. If tomorrow Spotify gains 100 million new users, that then never listen to a single Rogan episode, how would that increase Rogan&#x27;s compensation?')
