But this technique was discovered decades ago. It just took this long for computers to speed up, for it to be usable.<p>Instead, they should change the moniker from Artificial Intelligence, to Artificial Insight.<p>Because all it is doing is to comb through all that random data, to look for interesting signals.  But, the algorithm doesn’t even know if what it found, is interesting. That’s up to the human to decide.<p>Hence, the algorithm can provide Insight.  But, it is the human in the loop, that will provide the intelligence.')
