I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s as clear cut as anyone would want it to be, but your approach is consistent with a specific kind of definition from what you&#x27;re saying in your third answer.<p>Your second answer is just a question of comfort. Similar to questions around ecology, making a choice one considers &quot;right&quot; might mean that you value that choice enough that the loss of benefits isn&#x27;t a net loss to you. Much like with climate change, doing good things is hardly valued at all in terms of ethics in the current way tech does anything though.<p>And I agree with you that all companies should be scrutinized heavily, and it&#x27;s possible that Facebook just has become the symbol of that behaviour in all of tech.<p>However (1) other people doing worse things is not really an excuse that&#x27;s valid in itself (&quot;I murdered somebody but there are serial killers out there!&quot;), (2) facebook does a whole lot of dirty work especially in poorer countries like in Myanmar where it became ubiquitous by being pre-installed on smartphones and has become THE central information (and misinformation) hub of its own volition, and (3) you&#x27;re pointing out AR and the most significant actor of that field currently is Facebook itself.')
