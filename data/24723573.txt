Credit cards and Stripe are common payment mechanisms for consumer, prosumer, and self-serve SAAS. I&#x27;m not denying there is a lot of money here, but I imagine the majority of B2B SaaS companies by revenue handle payment through annual contracts through checks and wire transfer.<p>I don&#x27;t have any data here, but I&#x27;m thinking EHR, ERP, office building rent (&quot;a SaaS company plus some glass and concrete&quot;) etc. If the service provided is annually worth 100k USD, theres probably \nhuman-human interaction which facilitates the exchange of legal documents and money. Think Oracle, SAP, ADP, ServiceNow, Workday etc.')
