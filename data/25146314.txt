It&#x27;s the only CSS framework I&#x27;ve ever used since, and I think it&#x27;s very future-proof.<p>That said, I really don&#x27;t like how it&#x27;s being described as &quot;utility-first&quot;. It&#x27;s very ambiguous language to me even as an experienced programmer, and I&#x27;ve never really seen that phrase used elsewhere. Besides, all that the authors really seem to mean by &quot;utility-first&quot; is that it is &quot;composition-based&quot; as opposed to the more common inheritance-based approach to working with CSS.')
