You should really step back and rethink your assumptions here. Git is a tool that’s meant to make things easier. It’s complex enough, though, that it’s a stumbling block for a lot of folks for a workflow that really shouldn’t be so complicated.<p>If you intuitively grok how git works, that’s great. I’m going to guess you probably don’t <i>really</i> use it in any challenging or new situations and are just comfortable with your particular workflow. But <i>maybe</i> you do have that mastery level over this one tool in your code management system.<p>But guess what, other folks, true genius folks, either can’t or don’t have the mental bandwidth to learn every nook and cranny of this tool. If you don’t recognize that, you are willfully dismissing a lot of really smart people because their brains don’t work the same way yours does. But when you do that you are weakening yourself and your own capabilities.<p>So step back and re-assess your take here. It’s wrong, and it’s toxic to your own outlook as well as those around you.')
