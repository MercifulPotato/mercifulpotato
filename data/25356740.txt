However, when I come across a site which consists of text articles interspersed with some static images, and the images do not show with JS disabled, or in extreme cases, the entire page remains empty because it needs JS to even display text, that just screams wrong.<p>Web has been able to display well-formatted text and images for decades without Javascript just fine. In fact, that has been its original primary purpose, to display text with hyperlinks and some images. Why bastardize it just because you want your images to load with a cool effect or something equally silly (that won&#x27;t work well for half of the visitors anyway) ?')
