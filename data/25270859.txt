Mostly, it&#x27;s fine&#x2F;good. It works as I expect text chat too, including the niceties we&#x27;ve come to expect by now.<p>One thing that really stood out to me is that you can cross-sign your device certificates! That means your chat partners don&#x27;t need to verify the signatures of all your device keys, but only one.
