You step into publisher territory at that point and open yourself up to liability. You also can&#x27;t go and ban the whitehouse press secretary, same deal.<p>If Twitter would act honorably and allow open conversation, conversations that obviously don&#x27;t contain death threats, etc, then there would be no need or even desire for an alternate platform.')
