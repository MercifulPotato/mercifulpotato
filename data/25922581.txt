It is a very powerful tool that if you REALLY know how to use it (like, really make sense of permissions, workflows, hooks and other features) you get really good ROI.<p>Nevertheless... it is an absolute and horrible hog. It is so slow and clumsy that it is frustrating.  Also, when they changed the interface they kind of hid a lot of stuff that used to be there. Also the free &quot;Gantt&quot;  feature they have sucks, and the paid one is OK but does not justify upgrading 50+ users to the plan that makes it available.')
