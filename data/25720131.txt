I learned how to live on $10&#x2F;hour and how to cook anything quickly and have it come out tasty. And I only cried in the walk in occasionally.<p>Cooking well is mostly attitude and confidence. Prep and cook everything at the same time, figuring out the order to do it all in parallel is a fun puzzle and executing it gives you a rush. I never measure any ingredients and improvise recipes constantly.<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t cook everything evenly&quot; is very good advice. Let things sit at appropriate heat, amateur cooks are too touchy. But I disagree about recipes, they are just suggestions to me, good to know the outline and then leverage your general knowledge of cooking to get it done.')
