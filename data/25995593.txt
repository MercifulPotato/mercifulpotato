I&#x27;m old enough not to worry about microsecond lag, as my reaction times are by far the biggest factor.\nI&#x27;d be sad if Stadia was eventually shuttered, but I haven&#x27;t invested a significant amount of money, compared to building a rig, and have no intention of replaying games that I&#x27;ve already run through.')
