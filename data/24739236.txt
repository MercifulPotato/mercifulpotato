I started as a Jr front end dev &#x2F; designer, transitioned to a backend team, was doing &quot;fullstack&quot; before it was a real term, eventually was considered a sr engineer, then lead and now I run the tech for an early stage start up (vp of eng, but my title is irrelevant because Im actually also filling the roles of CTO and lead eng).<p>I despise whiteboard interviews and the hiring process in general and vowed to myself that I would do my own thing if ever given the chance.<p>I am fully in charge of the hiring process here. What I look for are good personalities, a passion for technology, and the ability to read code in the stack we use. I show the candidate a script that we run in prod which has all comments removed and ask them to walk me through it. Massive bonus points if the candidate is active on the internet (streams code sessions on twitch, contributes to open source projects, has side projects etc).<p>No brain teasers, traditional whiteboard challeneges, live coding sessions or take home projects.')
