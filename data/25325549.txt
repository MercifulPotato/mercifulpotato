The RTX 32P is a prototype machine that is the basis of Harris&#x27; commercial 32-bit stack machine design.<p>The RTX 32P is a CMOS chip implementation of the WISC Technologies CPU&#x2F;32 (Koopman 1987c) which was originally built using discrete TTL components. The CPU&#x2F;32 was in turn<p>developed from the WISC CPU&#x2F;16 described in Chapter 4. Because of this history, the RTX 32P is a microcoded machine, with on-chip microcode RAM and on-chip stacks.&quot;')
