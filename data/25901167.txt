I mean, I <i>want</i> to believe in it, but when I scrutinize it precisely, I wonder - how can you measure the <i>ability</i> to innovate of someone who doesn&#x27;t <i>want</i> (or need) to innovate?<p>At present time, China&#x27;s competitive advantage is cheap specialized labour, and they&#x27;re taking full advantage of that - as they should. That&#x27;s the whole point of being behind in technology and racing to catc up! It might very well be that when they switch their focus, from copying to innovating, they&#x27;d be very good at that as well (or very bad! we literally have very little data to tell)')
