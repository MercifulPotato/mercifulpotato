You can spread the cost across your family, and you&#x27;ll stop playing cat and mouse (at least on youtube)<p>Note that I&#x27;m not against ad blocking in general, but if you use a website a lot, it seems fair to me to remunerate it one way or another, and at least paying for membership is not a business model based on selling your data.')
