I made a deal with her that if she didn&#x27;t like the inductive, I would bring in gas and get her a gas range.<p>I really liked the idea of the range top being a flat, solid surface, and staying relatively cool, keeping spills from baking on and making cleanup ridiculously easy.<p>My wife tends to run hot, temperature wise, and gas ranges throw off a lot of heat into the surrounding area.  The inductive range heats amazingly fast, reacts as fast as her parents gas range, and I can boil a teapot, pull it off, and immediately put my hand on the &quot;burner&quot;.  It&#x27;s hot, sure, but on a gas or resistive range I&#x27;d have to go to the ER.<p>Some people put down paper towels under pots before cooking to make cleanup easier.  Cleanup has lived up to my expectations, very easy.<p>The resistive solid surface ranges still get very hot, and a friend with one talks about how hard it is to get baked and burnt on foods off.<p>Now with all this talk about the combustion byproducts being problematic, I&#x27;m convinced this was definitely the right choice.')
