The idea doesn&#x27;t include any kind of automatic stabilization system to set the UBI at a sustainable level. Because UBI is not market-based, there&#x27;s little information that flows into the process that sets of level of UBI and other redistribution systems. In a market system, a distributed consensus algorithm governs both wages and prices and adjusts both continuously to account for changes in scarcity and utility.<p>Who decides how much UBI is enough? What procedure will that person or body use? What is the algorithm that prevents UBI increasing without bound? After all, the public voting itself unsustainable transfers from the state is one of the classic failure modes of democracy.<p>No matter the initial level of UBI, there will be someone who&#x27;s able to gain political advantage by claiming that the UBI is insufficient for a dignified existence and that human rights demand an increase. Proposing a decrease in UBI will be political suicide. What prevents UBI increasing to the point that it captures all excess value production from all of society and redistributes it evenly? Wouldn&#x27;t that system be tantamount to the planned economies of the 20th century?')
