Or are they ok, only when their targeted against men?<p>I support all jokes, if they&#x27;re funny (if not, nobody is going to watch that comedian, and the market will regulate itself). You say that we should shame the jokes you personally don&#x27;t like out of the mainstream, but leave the ones you don&#x27;t mind. &quot;you slav you lose&quot; is a joke.... slavs are also always shown as stereotypical people in tracksuits, drunk and killing people... mostly eachother... and yes, i know it&#x27;s a stereotype, but as a slav, it&#x27;s not far from truth (we&#x27;re looking at caricatures here), and videos on youtube joking out of that are well.. funny (to me personally, and the like&#x2F;dislike ratio shows that others find them  funny too). Should we shame those jokes? Should we shame people laughing at those jokes? Should we shame slavs laughing at funny stereotipical representatives of our own people? Now replace slavs with some other group of people, and you get called a bunch of &quot;-ist&quot;s, &quot;anti-&quot;s, etc.<p>So, we either kill comedy for all ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;comics&#x2F;comments&#x2F;70390&#x2F;a_politically_correct_cartoon&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;comics&#x2F;comments&#x2F;70390&#x2F;a_politically...</a> ), or we let people joke out of everything and not be sensitive about it (this is the option i prefer... especially since we live in a time, where just showing a picture of a religious figure can get you beheaded in france).')
