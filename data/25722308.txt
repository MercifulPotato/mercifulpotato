I happen to disagree with it as it applies in the real world<p>No.  I&#x27;m not.  Please don&#x27;t put words in my mouth.<p>I&#x27;ll try to boil it down to as few words as possible:<p>If the government can take away your rights, then they can take away mine too.  I don&#x27;t support that and will defend your rights as vigorously as my own, whether I agree with you or not.<p>As for the example you give, bakers don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to bake a cake for gay weddings.')
