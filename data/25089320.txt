Worse is coming. Iowa is accumulating more than 3,600 confirmed cases every day; relative to its population, that’s more than twice the rate Arizona experienced during its summer peak, “when their system was near collapse,” Perencevich said. With only lax policies in place, those cases will continue to rise. Hospitalizations lag behind cases by about two weeks; by Thanksgiving, today’s soaring cases will be overwhelming hospitals that already cannot cope. “The wave hasn’t even crashed down on us yet,” Perencevich said. “It keeps rising and rising, and we’re all running on fear. The health-care system in Iowa is going to collapse, no question.”<p>Most of the US is likely to have their medical systems collapse this winter.  That will lead to thousands of preventable deaths.<p>Stigmatizing people with HIV was bad because it was a proxy for stigmatizing gay men.  Stigmatizing people who don&#x27;t wear masks is stigmatizing anti-social behavior.')
