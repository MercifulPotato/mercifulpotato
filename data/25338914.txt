Item(by='jaredcwhite', descendants=None, kids=[25339273], score=None, time=1607381974, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25338849, text='OK, let&#x27;s say you have a &quot;styled box to hold a blurb of content&quot; and in Framework A it&#x27;s a single class: &quot;callout&quot;. But in framework B, it&#x27;s called &quot;box&quot;.<p>You can switch your element from &quot;callout&quot; to &quot;box&quot; and likely move on.<p>But if your element is nothing more than twenty utility classes, good luck with that.<p>Similarly, if you have a custom class in your stylesheet using normal CSS properties you wrote alongside Framework A, you can use that same custom class with Framework B with little to no modification because it&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; CSS.<p>If instead your custom class is twenty &quot;@apply&quot; statements using utility classes, good luck with that.<p>So again I say: Tailwind is fundamentally incompatible with every other CSS framework&#x2F;no framework.')
