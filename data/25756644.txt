I agree, and there&#x27;s also something slippery in that argument taken to its extreme that we need to be careful of.<p>Some people here on HN made the same argument when Equifax leaked personal information about millions of americans. They said it was ultimately management&#x27;s fault and not the engineers&#x27; fault for not allocating enough resources to security. And the same argument was used by the engineers who made the Therac-25 radiology machine. In that case, software bugs resulted in a handful of deaths due to lethal radiation.<p>Upper management <i>can&#x27;t</i> be responsible for everything that happens in their business. Engineering isn&#x27;t their job or their expertise. Thats why they hire software engineers and security engineers - to be the local experts. We need to bear responsibility for the decisions we make in our field. And engineers have a duty not just to the companies we work for, but also to society at large. If we leave our personal judgement at the door in the morning, we fail in our duty to society.<p>To go back to the bridge metaphor, if a bridge falls down, its not good enough for the civil engineers involved to blame management for not giving them enough time &#x2F; budget &#x2F; whatever. They also bear some responsibility for the disaster. This has been enshrined in case law too, at the Nuremberg trials. &quot;I was just doing my job&quot; wasn&#x27;t considered a good enough excuse for the guards in WW2 concentration camps. These are big examples, but I think the principle is fractally true.<p>And the inverse also holds. Praise and blame go together. The biomedical engineers in the labs also deserve praise for the covid19 vaccines they&#x27;ve invented, even if upper management told them to do it. We aren&#x27;t management&#x27;s slaves.')
