I mentioned John McCarthy&#x27;s concept of &quot;elaboration tolerance&quot; in\nanother comment, i.e. the ability of a representation to be modified easily.\nThis was not a solved problem in McCarthy&#x27;s time and it&#x27;s not a solved problem\ntoday either (see my sibling comment about &quot;catastrophic forgetting&quot; in neural\nnets). For shannon&#x27;s time it was definitely not a solved problem, perhaps not\neven a recognised problem. That&#x27;s the 1950&#x27;s we&#x27;re talking about, yes? :)<p>Sorry, I didn&#x27;t get what you mean about the dynamically evaluated reward\nfunction.')
