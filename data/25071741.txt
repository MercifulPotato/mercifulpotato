The decay energy might be absorbed by a nearby nucleus in an medium to a large part, leaving only a small momentum for both particles so they can form an atom, but usually it won&#x27;t. In the average low-density case, the proton and electron will find other partners only after quite some cooldown.<p>In very rare cases most of the energy might also be carried away by the neutrino that is produced as well, so decay to hydrogen is not impossible in a vacuum.')
