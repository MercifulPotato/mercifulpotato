Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=[25659634], score=None, time=1609949416, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25657137, text='Your claim that WiFi &quot;can barely reach through 2-3 rooms and 1 floor, with no nearby stations to blame for interference&quot; is simply not believable, when it&#x27;s easily demonstrated that WiFi can cover a whole house and a good sized yard in a truly quiet RF environment. Without interference, covering a single apartment is no trouble at all unless the building materials for interior walls were maliciously chosen.<p>I think you&#x27;re simply misidentifying the cause of your connectivity issues, and blaming low transmit power when your real issue is that you have far more competing traffic on the 2.4GHz band than you think, and thus a shortage of quiet airtime. And lowering transmit power of everything (preferably done automatically and adaptively on a per-device basis) <i>is</i> the solution to the latter problem, while using higher transmit powers on everything can only make the latter problem much worse.')
