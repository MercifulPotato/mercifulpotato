Berkeley as a physics major. Then I dropped acid and became very interested in consciousness, but didn&#x27;t see that being taught in the physics track, so I dropped it. Now I see that physics is coming around to talking about consciousness. I don&#x27;t know why they stopped, because I learned later that early 2oth century physicists did talk about it. Max Planck among others. Materialism reigns supreme and I don&#x27;t know why. No one has to start being a theist when they stop being a materialist.<p>I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness\nâ€• Max Planck')
