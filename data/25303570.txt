You live in NYC, so you got the brunt of the first wave and did actually lock down. I lived in Arizona when it was the next hotspot, and it effectively didn&#x27;t. The lock down order there basically applied to indoor dining, gyms, salons, and strip clubs. Everything else was open, and 25-50% still weren&#x27;t wearing masks.<p>We&#x27;re still taking measures because we (as a country) didn&#x27;t do them right the first time. The fact that your community <i>did</i> do things right the first time still left it exposed to the rest of the country. It&#x27;s not fair, and you&#x27;ve got every right to be angry, and yet it doesn&#x27;t change anything about how the virus spreads or what it does to people.<p>There are a number of countries that proved it doesn&#x27;t have to be futile - it&#x27;s just futile if people don&#x27;t do right by each other.')
