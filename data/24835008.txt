But anything in the network is interoperable by default.<p>I think to fight something like FB the outside world would need to unite over algorithms and data formats. There should be ways trivially import and export data, ways between blogs to communicate when they&#x27;re not all on wpress or tblr. Otherwise the big guys win with no resistance. Various IM applications can&#x27;t send messages to each other. You need awkward solutions like Pidgin and one account per network.<p>Finally I have a scientific proof: quake champions grand finals had 2 American players vs 2 Europeans. The Euros had one guy from Netherlands and one from Lithuania. The Euros lost by a big margin but had some scary single combat skills. By comparison, their voice channel was nearly silent. There was noticable delay and hesitation to communicate enemy movement and situation. They had to use English to communicate and for both it was a second language. I don&#x27;t think either of them was bilingual from the start.')
