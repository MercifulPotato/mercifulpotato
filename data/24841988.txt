I also believe this issue only exists on platforms like facebook and twitter, but not google because frankly I dont think Google uses humans to moderate.<p>I think everything I just presented provides a pretty good basis for us to come together and actually discuss whether this issue actually exists right now and whether there is deliberate manipulation on the big tech side of things of the election going on.<p>I think the answer to this supposed conundrum can actually be logically deduced because I believe its impossible for the algorithms to actually be as smart as &quot;conspiratorial&quot; conservatives suggest.
