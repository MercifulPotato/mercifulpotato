The availability of so many themes and plugins is the main reason for wordpress&#x27; market share. I tried using Gatsby and Hugo, but if u want to add payment or shipping then you start feeling how limiting those tools are. U would find 1 or 2 solutions only if you are lucky. Otherwise, you have to write your own tool and spend time and money re-inventing the wheel. \nBut definitely some like Gatsby and Next.js run much faster, as they pre-render the pages, so they have their niches.\nTry looking for a shipping plugin on wordpress, you will find different ones for different countries!!\nThis explains why wordpress share is almost 40%. It is the community!')
