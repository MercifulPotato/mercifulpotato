If parameter s is big, then the branches can be taken quite often, but they also happen up to 2^63 of the times, so it&#x27;s essentially a single bit bias that is measurable via timing (maybe, if you&#x27;re very lucky).  If s is very small and incongruent then there&#x27;s the timing channel can leak values, but it can only happen every order 1&#x2F;2^64 attempts.<p>Of the two I&#x27;d be more concerned about the former; biases of that size have led to things being broken before. Technically the latter means the security is less than the 2^64, which isn&#x27;t very strong for cryptography purposes.  But the channel is so hard to measure I wouldn&#x27;t lose sleep over either, but it is the kind of the team that will get caught in some compliance testing.')
