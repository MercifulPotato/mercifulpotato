Currently the US dollar (and Treasury bonds) do both. It&#x27;s unlikely that the US dollar disappears as a medium of exchange, though there are steps being taken here, such as China + Russia pricing their oil trade in yuan rather than dollars. Yet with M2 money supply increasing 25% in the last year and the DXY crashing by 10%, the US dollar is no longer a reliable store of value.<p>The larger shift is out of Treasury bonds into different reserve assets, such as commodities (oil, gold, alternative currencies). That one is very real.')
