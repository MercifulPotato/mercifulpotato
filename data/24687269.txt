Orwell later became cynical about it, focusing on its lack of any words for things like &quot;revolution.&quot; It became an inspiration for newspeak in 1984.<p>(I honestly think this particular concern was a bit of a straw man of Wells&#x27; and Ogden&#x27;s optimistic views, a lingua franca used in a few settings doesn&#x27;t have to be a straightjacket for all contexts. But it made 1984, so maybe fine in the end.)')
