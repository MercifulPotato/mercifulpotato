Item(by='smileybarry', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603998651, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24932584, text='No, that&#x27;s not what I meant and they don&#x27;t lock you out for fraud either.<p>By &quot;fraud&quot; I meant: buying a game with a stolen payment method, that&#x27;s it. If someone does that, the specific game gets removed from their account and this message[1] is shown. The rest of their account remains untouched.<p>About the rest of your scenarios: They don&#x27;t look at how many times you launch a game (I launched 2+ copies of a game many, many times). If a game bans you for whatever reason -- like anti-cheat misdetections -- the <i>multiplayer-only</i> ban is only for <i>that</i> game and done by the publisher (not Steam). You&#x27;re confusing Valve&#x2F;Steam with EasyAntiCheat, BattlEye, etc.<p>Steam doesn&#x27;t even phone home if DRM fails, the game just doesn&#x27;t launch; DRM meddling doesn&#x27;t get you banned or anything.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;Ye6Ee2Y.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;Ye6Ee2Y.png</a>')
