If the choices are accepting headphones I need to charge to use and being a stick in the mud, I&#x27;m going to do the latter. I&#x27;ll keep my old iPhone until it no longer functions. Consequently, Apple is getting less lifetime revenue from me. But I&#x27;m not Apple&#x27;s target consumer: there are others who are far more profitable. An iPhone and a MacBook are all I need, I don&#x27;t pay for any of their subscription services (Apple Music) etc.')
