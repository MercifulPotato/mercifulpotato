That is needed so that another program can feed data into an xterm that has been created as a child process.<p>I&#x27;ve seen it used for a modem dial-up program and I&#x27;ve seen it used for the emulation of old computers with serial consoles. It would probably find use with debuggers. Sometimes you just want to pop open a new window, and xterm is the only terminal emulator that will cooperate.<p>The option parsing is buggy. Only file descriptor 0 works, but that is good enough because of the dup2 system call. Fork, set up the file descriptors, and then exec an xterm like so:  xterm -S&#x2F;0 -T foo -n foo -name foo<p>I&#x27;d love to get the feature, with the exact same syntax, into all the terminal emulators. That would mean that x-terminal-emulator, which is a link to whatever the user installed, would always have the feature.')
