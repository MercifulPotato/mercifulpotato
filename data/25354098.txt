Whatever happened to using the simplest technology possible for the task? That way you&#x27;ll end up with a page that will work to the best possible extent for any given user-agent. That is ture accessibility.<p>I&#x27;m not asking for them to go out of their way to try to show images in Lynx or whatever. I&#x27;m asking for a sane approach to making sites that does not require running arbitrary code on the client just to show some static text that should&#x27;ve come along directly in the page, something that literally <i>all</i> browsers would be able to, but is being needlessly restricted.<p><i>Plus, you can avoid 99% of the github website just by using git from the command line (or your favorite client) and using their CLI tool for repo creation&#x2F;etc.</i><p>That is true, but beside the point.')
