I&#x27;ve been in the industry forever and never heard of Quicklogic.  It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re new either.<p>What&#x27;s the deal with these guys?<p>Although I wish somebody would produce a 5V compatible FPGA part that doesn&#x27;t have a zillion pins.  I generally only need a bit of logic, but I have to use a bunch of old-school level translators <i>and</i> an FPGA because the FPGA can&#x27;t deal directly with 5V.')
