My personal files exist in far fewer places and the OS does absolutely nothing to stop a malicious application from damaging them.

It is possible to jerry-rig the kind of permission system we actually want using the user account system, but it has a lot of problems in practice because it isn&#x27;t designed for that. It is not a good abstraction.')
