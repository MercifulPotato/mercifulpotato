He literally fled to Hong Kong first. So again, what did I state that was a lie?<p>I didn&#x27;t say he wanted to be there, but he clearly wanted to be in Hong Kong, then move on... and ended up in Russia? Again, what part of this is false?<p>Did you know him? I did, he&#x27;s a fucking tool. The information leaked was piecemeal. Take the bible, leak random pages and one will say live a joyous life, love each other.. where a different page might tell you to sacrifice your only child. Unless you&#x27;ve been privy to all of the information at the right scale, you&#x27;ve been sold a piece, a piece that paints a narrative.<p>The FISA courts weren&#x27;t new. You have have to have a secure means to disclose data without risking release in a non classified environment. Obviously this concept is over your head.<p>Even if he was genuine in trying to blow a whistle on one program, that doesn&#x27;t mean he has a right to do a smash and grab and release un-related materials.
