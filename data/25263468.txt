It goes back more than 11 years.<p>I&#x27;ve spent nearly 20 years getting better when that&#x27;s supposed to be impossible. I&#x27;ve done so while dirt poor and even homeless for several years. What I&#x27;ve spent to get better is a drop in the bucket compared to the millions my condition is supposed to cost under conventional treatment while merely slowing your slow, gruesome, torturous death.<p>No one&#x27;s interested and I&#x27;ve been thrown off of various forums over the years and been openly hated on and called a liar, teller of tall tales and insane.<p>No wants it because no one will get rich off of it. No one wants it because I&#x27;m a former homemaker, not a physician or scientist. And no doubt several other reasons, none of which I can really fathom.<p>The world basically agrees with you, turns a blind eye to any and all evidence to the contrary and actively tries to silence people like me.')
