If a business model leads to infeasible costs due to fundamental issues, maybe that business model shouldn&#x27;t exist as such.<p>Obviously Facebook (or any other company) doesn&#x27;t want to do anything that significantly increases their costs without providing revenue if they can avoid it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it shouldn&#x27;t be expected of them.')
