I’ve taken the Gilead combo pills since a few months after I was diagnosed, first Stribild and now Genvoya, the difference being a new form of tenofovir.<p>I miss probably one dose a month, maybe two. I don’t take my pill at the same time everyday, probably in a 4 or 5 hour window vs. the 2 hour window my doctor recommends. I’ve never had any side effects and I’ve been undetectable since I began treatment.<p>I’m not sure I’m interested in this injectable regimen. My HIV treatment will last for the majority of my life; I don’t feel like I can risk any amount of reduced long term efficacy with a new drug. I also don’t love needles. I’m excited to talk to my doctor about it, though.<p>Like birth control, the more options there are, the better. HIV treatment is truly a marvel of modern medicine.')
