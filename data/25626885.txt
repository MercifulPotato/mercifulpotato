Right-sizing slack makes you more, not less, competitive.<p>It&#x27;s quite often not <i>company</i> performance concerns that drive out slack but the short-term performance of the unit at exactly the level the decision is made, and it&#x27;s typically an eyes-open decision to gamble on unsustainable short-term gains lasting long enough to meet a short-term goal of the decision-maker (often, a bid to get a better job where they are no longer immediately responsible for the function being compromised).<p>One of the biggest fallacies is there management decisions within a company are consistently, or even mostly, driven by interests of the company as a whole, rather than the individuals making decisions, who often face practical personal incentive structures (especially in terms of career advancement) in which seeking the broad interests of the company and it&#x27;s shareholders are not optimal.')
