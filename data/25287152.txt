I only have 20 days of vacation, medical coverage is horrible, with 2-3 month waiting lists for even an MRI, and education is absolutely horrid.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t even call them free, nor cheap: income taxes come out to about ~35%, and VAT is the highest in the world.<p>And to add on to that, achieving compensation above ~80k usd is basically impossible. With ~3 years of experience I barely get half of that at a Google L4 level equivalent.')
