It&#x27;s just that different &#x27;groupings&#x27; are usually less useful.<p>E.g. it is far less likely that you&#x27;d want to specify that the &quot;green knife&quot; entity is to be used for whittling. It is far more likely that you&#x27;d want to specify that the &quot;whittling knife&quot; is green.<p>Similarly you&#x27;re unlikely to group &#x27;lovely knife&#x27; as the most low-level entity to which you&#x27;d add higher leverl characterisations.<p>Some of the other ones though are reasonably interchangeable, as long as it is understood that the focus is slightly different each time.<p>E.g. a priceless old knife, and old priceless knife mean slightly different things, and you&#x27;d choose the order depending on whether you wanted to emphasize that the old knife happens to be priceless, as opposed to that the priceless knife happens to be old.')
