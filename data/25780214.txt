Having run two web search engines in the past: search.netscape.com (pre-google) and blekko.com. Robots accounted for &gt; 80% of traffic at Netscape (around 3M searches&#x2F;day in 2000 IIRC) and definitely more than 80% at blekko. Maybe 90% or more. Some traffic is obviously bot traffic (single source IP, common patterns, obvious bot useragents) and then there&#x27;s the non-obvious bot traffic that is random-ish, but in aggregate is clearly bot traffic. For instance, way too many queries matching the pattern &quot;(mortgage|home loans) (zip|county|city|state)&quot; even if they are coming from random IPs and user agents.<p>At blekko, under high traffic, we would loadshed obvious bot traffic first and prioritize searches from humans.')
