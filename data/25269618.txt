I’m currently completing a Masters in Computational Data Analytics at Georgia Tech.<p>For the last eight months I&#x27;ve been CTO and co-founder at a startup I founded with a few co-workers after the last startup we were all working at shut down due to impacts from COVID. We released an iOS and Android app in September, but I am looking to move back into an employee role where I can focus on solving technical problems rather than running a startup.<p>Prior to my startup I was the second employee at another startup creating enterprise analytics software. I spent multiple years working in a hybrid backend engineering, data science, and devops role where I developed machine learning models and REST APIs and deployed them on Kubernetes using SQL and noSQL databases on GCP. I was heavily involved in the full implementation cycle from ideation, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.<p>I am looking for a full time backend or data science role (ideally a bit of both!) in Denver or Remote. I have been fully remote the last 8 months and discovered I work very well in that environment.')
