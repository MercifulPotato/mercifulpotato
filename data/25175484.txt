It&#x27;s a tax. You pay it now to cover those taking it now, and the social contract says future generations will do the same.<p>This is a very important distinction, so I&#x27;ll repeat it. Social security in the United States is not a pension, it&#x27;s just a government program. We&#x27;re told it will continue, but that&#x27;s only because the current government says it will. A future government could just decide to stop payments, and there would be no recourse because it&#x27;s not a pension. If you live in the United States, please plan accordingly.')
