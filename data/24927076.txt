Nothing here reaches “colossal”.<p>Never underestimate the folly of large organizations of any stripe.  They are all comprised of individuals who are just as silly as you are.  There are just more of them and sometimes they have greater firepower.<p>Don’t know what you mean by “such operations” in the final sentence.  Do you mean no “psyops”?  Talk-talk is almost always better than bang-bang.  If you were targeted with both, I think you would agree as well...')
