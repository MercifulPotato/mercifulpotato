My boss asked me to test it.  In 10 minutes, my test of its one and only  basic function failed.  My boss turned to the guy and said &quot;Did you test this?&quot;.  He said &quot;All my unit tests passed&quot;.<p>Unit tests don&#x27;t tell you anything about overall functionality. Somehow, too many people don&#x27;t know this simple fact.')
