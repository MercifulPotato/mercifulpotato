You really think this language is reasonably mutually intelligible with Mandarin?  Or Shanghainese?<p>I&#x27;m a (non-native, formerly fluent but now pretty poor) Cantonese speaker and I&#x27;d describe the difference between Cantonese and Mandarin as roughly the difference between Portuguese and Romanian.  Sure, they&#x27;re both romance languages, and maybe with a lot of work and hand-waving and drawing characters on your hands with your fingers you can get your point across to someone who speaks the other language, but in no way would I call them mutually intelligible, even by talking &quot;slower&quot;.<p>Cantonese and Mandarin have very different pronunciation, vocabulary, and even grammar for common cases.  In fact there are extremely common words in Cantonese for which there is <i>no modern chinese character</i>: instead roman words or even single letters (like &quot;D&quot;) are substituted in comic strips etc. So you can&#x27;t even write them down in Chinese for a Mandarin speaker to puzzle through with a dictionary.<p>I&#x27;d say that your perception of these things as &quot;western centric&quot; -- they are not at all -- strikes me as very &quot;northern Chinese centric&quot; view of China. :-)')
