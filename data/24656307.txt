I was a CSR who while newly licensed, was also forced to do rote busy work for my superior instead of stretching my legs with billings and developing my own book of business, and really getting to know the claims process on my end.<p>I was expected to sit all day at my desk sans bathroom &#x2F; coffee breaks, and never deviate from the set list of tasks to deal with re: mailing, endorsements to policies, follow-ups on mortgagee changes, etc.  But when they finally let me attempt to do billings, I didn&#x27;t truly understand the process after months of being forced to do mindless shit work, and of course messed something up.<p>And then when you fail one time, they justified further restricting you despite the &quot;issue&quot; being A.) instantly fixable, B.) not dealing with much money in policies (such as misc. articles), and C.) Never being pushed or expected to perform on your own by your own boss, who at this point was more interested in me organizing their decades old folders of policies to be digitally scanned.<p>When I was told I would need another designation (CISR) to be &quot;taken seriously&quot;, which would&#x27;ve involved another year of classes in addition to busy work, I said fuck all of that and went back to college within a years time.')
