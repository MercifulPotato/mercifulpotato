You can easily pull that number with OP’s experience in the southeast, and I’d bet good money the cost of living is a lot cheaper than most anywhere in Europe.<p>&gt; day care for kids for example is 100% free (as in tax funded) in Berlin.<p>This kind of hits at why some people prefer higher salary versus “free” government programs.  My kids won’t need daycare forever.  I’d rather make a helluva lot more money and pay for daycare out of pocket for the 5 years they actually need it than pay for everyone else’s free daycare for the entirety of my working life.')
