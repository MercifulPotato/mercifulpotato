It is innocent until proven guilty and due process. All of which are Human Rights issues. Or at least used to be.<p>Due process is inefficient and slow compared to letting unelected mega-corps determine what other businesses can exist and what speech can and can&#x27;t be heard.<p>Imagine how awful a system with a &#x27;burden-of-proof&#x27; and &#x27;oversight&#x27; would be compared to just trusting the invisible hand of the market and profit motives determine the optimum course of action!
