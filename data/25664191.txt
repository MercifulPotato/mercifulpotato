Taking a complex, multidimensional space of ideas and beliefs (and by multidimensional I mean something like 100+ dimensions, not 3 or 4) and projecting it into a number line is one of the things that bewilder me about the world the most. Doubly so in countries that don&#x27;t have a two-party system like the US.<p>And if anything, I think that this classical projected political spectrum isn&#x27;t a line, it&#x27;s really a circle. Extreme left and extreme right are the same thing; the particulars of the beliefs don&#x27;t matter (if you think they do, you can always imagine this being a flat strip of paper glued into a MÃ¶bius strip).')
