Item(by='joelbluminator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607550783, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25365417, text='&gt; Except that in any civilized society<p>Gonna ignore that one.<p>&gt; I used to work for a top NL based company and this situation was often discussed around the office that NL companies are abusing expat workers promising them riches and instead using them for 2-3 years then rotating them with new workers until they get fed up with this and move back to their home countries<p>I really haven&#x27;t experienced this at all. Tons of expats I know are on permanent contract (btw - many employers offer a permanent contract after 1-1.5 years if they&#x27;re happy with the emplyoee, at least that&#x27;s what I see in tech). Of course people in the hotel&#x2F;entertainment business may have a different experience. I bet flex work is more common there.<p>&gt; That actually sounds legit bad IMHO if mental issues are the becoming the norm in employment relationships.<p>I didn&#x27;t say mental issues are the norm in the Netherlands, lol. Far from it, it&#x27;s one of the happiest countries in the world according to research. I&#x27;m just saying - the law enables you to take a LONG paid leave if you have burnout. Now some employees actually get burned out, and some are probably abusing it a bit. When you&#x27;re protecting employees there&#x27;ll always be people who dishonestly try to take advantage.')
