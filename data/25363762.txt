Item(by='gjulianm', descendants=None, kids=[25364414], score=None, time=1607543824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363126, text='It&#x27;s funny because I explicitly said that writing a comment and talking to friends is way different from making a video or a podcast because of the audience you might have and the presence of counterpoints, such as your comment.<p>And it&#x27;s also fun that you took a comment that basically said &quot;channels with big audiences should care about not saying wrong things&quot; and took it as a support of censorship.<p>Finally, you took the one example where the evidential basis is exactly there!<p>- Facebook wanted to create a digital currency, and wanted it to be used by as much people as possible.<p>- Monetary sovereignty is the capacity of a state to control what currency is used as legal payment, how much of it is issued and how much of is it retired.<p>- If Libra became widespread in a country under the conditions that Facebook wanted (i.e., the Libra association controlling issuance and retirement), it would complete and (partially or completely) replace the state&#x27;s currency and therefore the state would not have power to control its own currency, therefore losing monetary sovereignty to the Libra association.<p>- The Libra association was an association of private companies, QED.<p>And all of this brings me again to the point of how comments and videos are different. I made a comment, you made a comment, I made another one, and most people reading will watch the different viewpoints. If this was instead YouTube videos with millions of views, a lot of people would see the video title and take it as fact, another group would watch it and wouldn&#x27;t care or wouldn&#x27;t have the capacity to search for the opposing viewpoints, and only a minority (I think) would actually see the full debate. That&#x27;s why I say that the standards should be different if your potential audience is bigger and they&#x27;re less exposed to other viewpoints.')
