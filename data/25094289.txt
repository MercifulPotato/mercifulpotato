Updates and view rendering are run independently.<p>I have an application that tracks mouse movement using pointer events for the user to draw, and I&#x27;ve definitely had a message from that come through <i>after</i> my model has updated and I&#x27;m no longer on that screen (and so nothing in the view generated from the model should produce that message), so it definitely can happen, even if you haven&#x27;t encountered it.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t encounter it that way, there are a bunch of footguns using this approach (e.g: doing this with tasks, HTTP requests, anything that has a defined delay before the message comes back).')
