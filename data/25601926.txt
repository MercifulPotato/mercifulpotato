Your mini bio doesn&#x27;t sound bland at all. Maybe you fit the formal criteria for group membership (in the group you describe), but aren&#x27;t an average exemplar? Maybe people in general tend to think of themselves as more typical than they are? Or maybe that&#x27;s true especially for guys in the group you describe? That would certainly explain political rhetoric talking to regular Joes who aren&#x27;t so regular anymore.<p>Also probably true: the group you describe is so large that the variation within it is large, and stereotypes have little predictive predictive power for individual members.')
