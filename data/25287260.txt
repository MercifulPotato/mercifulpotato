It took a grand total of 8 hours to go from ground zero to making them able to write things involving loops, variables, etc... and making simple generative art autonomously - if anything, they struggle a fair bit more with the maths needed to make pretty things (here are my slides, feedback very welcome! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interactive-design.jcelerier.name&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interactive-design.jcelerier.name&#x2F;</a>).')
