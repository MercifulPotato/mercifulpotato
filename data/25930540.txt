Or it might just come down to convincing the jury. In this case, I&#x27;d say that the statements on WSB and the fact the price rose 2 (3?) figures with no change in the underlying company is a pretty strong indication. But it&#x27;s not a slam dunk, &quot;anything over x% is manipulation&quot; rule AFAIK.<p>Still, plenty of others are convicted of it, so either juries can be convinced or there is a mathematical rule I&#x27;m missing.')
