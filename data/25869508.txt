Once a technology like this makes it into a space it’s unlikely to ever get removed if it’s actually useful (ie good perf&#x2F;cost&#x2F;power wins) as there’s a competitive advantage to having a better one. The longer it’s around, the more second order-effects you have (eg if you need SW integration, tooling etc) entrenching the tech (the same forces that make it difficult to get off the ground in the first place). Apple is a great example of being a company that can pull this off as they have the vertical integration to get it off the ground AND the commitment to ensure a consistent application within a vertical. It may not be within Apple’s business interests if this is primarily useful for “big data”. That seems unlikely to me though so you’d need other applications they might see as strategically useful. SQLite is used heavily at Apple, so accelerating such workloads may be useful. A good chunk of what an OS does overall is largely manipulate memory, so something like the Os scheduler could be bifurcated to pick the next task and have that ready, including modifying the various lists, so that the CPU is doing even less (although unlikely to be a good example as I suspect this is a relatively short operation since it happens so frequently that there’s not really any room for a win).')
