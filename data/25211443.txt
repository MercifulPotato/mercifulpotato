The user issues the report command in the UI and the client takes its local copy and uploads it to the server as part of the report. So it&#x27;s mainly a convenience feature.<p>The only case where the current E2EE security model is changed is when the protocol gains a feature to enable the client to attach a cryptographic proof about the message&#x27;s content. That would violate the non-repudiation properties of the Signal protocol, but it would make reports more believable as you can&#x27;t fake them any more with a modified client. As I&#x27;ve said I don&#x27;t know the implementation, but it&#x27;s entirely possible that they didn&#x27;t include any cryptographic proof and keep it equivalent to screenshotting.')
