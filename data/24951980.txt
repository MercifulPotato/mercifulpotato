It&#x27;s very hard to make it nuanced and fleshed out though. Sure, a character can be conflicted between human and Klingon moral codes... but it tends to be a lot flatter than real life. The motivations are more explicit and single dimensional. Fictional honour codes and such tend to be much more legible than real ones.<p>If we go to a past (including fictional ones like game of thrones or lotr), we get a moral contrast for free. There are still trope traps like giving the &quot;good guys&quot; a relatable, dissenting, modern moral sense. But on average, a writer can give a 19th century nun a worldview that is both sufficiently deep and sufficiently different to ours. In a futuristic or fantasy setting, you tend to get a lot more &quot;orcs and vogons&quot; philosophy.')
