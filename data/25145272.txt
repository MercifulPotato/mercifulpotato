It&#x27;s not clear if Apple would have ever been affected by government regulation here. It&#x27;s even less clear if this would affect any potential regulation. This is purely speculation.<p>&gt; it has zero ounce of altruism<p>Irrelevant and unknowable. While we can speculate about Apple&#x27;s motivations, none of us have access to insider info on this so it is just speculation and ultimately doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>The simple fact is it helps Indies. Whether it&#x27;s altruism or pure profit motivation, doesn&#x27;t matter.')
