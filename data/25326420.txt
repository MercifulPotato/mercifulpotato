I hear what you&#x27;re saying, but I think it&#x27;s perfectly possible to injure your back with bodyweight exercises over time. Even if we&#x27;re just talking about yoga, there&#x27;s a good amount of evidence that incorrectly practiced yoga can and does cause back injuries over time.<p>Now I&#x27;m sure that the optimal answer to that would be to make sure you correctly practice yoga. But the back is probably the worst joint I can think of injuring, and at the same time I&#x27;m basically just watching youtube videos and copying them - which isn&#x27;t really a guarantee of correct practice. So I try to err on the side of caution by keeping my spine neutral :)')
