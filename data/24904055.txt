Or if you are desperate to have a job, I guess. Otherwise it&#x27;s relatively easy to evade and deflect these things.<p>I&#x27;ve been in a late-stage startup where options and RSUs were given very haphazardly (and in fact almost every grant I had was on a different vesting plan for whatever reason, too), so when a BigCo HR person pressed me for my compensation history and I tried to explain the whole thing, after a few clarifying questions and answers their head exploded and I was given a larger than expected sign-up grant, probably based on one year where the confluence of schedules made for the largest total comp :)<p>OTOH when I joined that late stage startup in the first place, I was in another bigco with a relatively low salary so IIRC I evaded questions and pushed them to use the market rate; although that was a long time ago.')
