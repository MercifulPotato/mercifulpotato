I am realizing now that I am trying to write these way too fast, and I&#x27;m not doing my research well enough or taking my personal opinions out of it.<p>I&#x27;m going to take a step back and ensure I am meeting the standards of HN before posting again. The truth of the matter is I am not a writer and am new to posting anything online. The questions you asked made me realize how little I critically analyzed my own writing. As I mentioned in a comment above, I&#x27;d like to make these neutral and lose the incendiary tone.')
