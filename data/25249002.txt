By many measures retail investors have outperformed institutional investors since March. The simple reason is that options have a built in exit strategy, the thing that&#x27;s missing when most people <i>lose</i> in scams - including Ponzi schemes!<p>On the flip side, why then do they outperform? High risk, high reward. Opportunities where you lose your entire principle, like out of the money options, turned out to be wildly underpriced, simply because institutions never buy them.<p>Anyway, I get it, those people are stupid. But they made money.')
