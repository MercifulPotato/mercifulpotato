Here in Australia anyone can walk in to a public hospital and get treated for free.  Why do so many Americans think it is better to have to pay (the most expensive prices in the world) and be tethered to your employer for health care?<p>I put that question to a Trump voter who asked me, who pays for the health system in Australia?  I told her taxpayers.  Everyone pays a little bit, and that works because everybody benefits.  She told me her answer straight away.  She said it&#x27;s not fair to have open access hospitals because then illegal immigrants will get free health care.<p>Is that why (some) Americans reject &quot;socialised medicine&quot;?  Because they are afraid that outsiders will take advantage of a system they pay (expensive prices) for?  It sounds like a version of Stockholm syndrome(?). If there are other reasons, please enlighten me.  I&#x27;d really like to understand this.')
