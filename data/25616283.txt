Even if you explicitly try to bring to light things like poor handling of Covid by the Trump administration large portions of people will not believe that.<p>So I think something similar may happen inside governments, most government employees believe and accept the official truth, and don&#x27;t try to spread a counter-narrative, or be critical about the official truth. Truth is what benefits the person telling the truth and it usually does not benefit you to be critical of the official version.<p>If we all believe it is the truth then who&#x27;s gonna say it is not, except crackpots and people we label as such. Who wants to be labeled crackpot?')
