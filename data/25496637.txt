Didn&#x27;t buy my shares, and they ended up being acquired in a fire sale and gave 1 penny per share to those that did exercise. Company had gone through three rounds of layoffs (&quot;normal trimming down before you IPO&quot; lol), and I still had friends that exercised their shares.<p>For me, I&#x27;m willing to take the tax hit by waiting to exercise since I&#x27;ve seen so many companies fail.')
