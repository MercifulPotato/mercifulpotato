Item(by='danpalmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611154532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25846243, text='On the Photoshop marketing page it&#x27;s advertised as a monthly fee (no *, no â€ , no footnote). Not even a &quot;from $X&quot;, it just says the price.<p>Clicking &quot;Buy now&quot; takes you to the product selection page. On this page each plan has the exact price. It&#x27;s the same as the price on the previous page. No footnotes, asterisks, or anything else. There is an asterisk next to the free month of stock photo access, which implies that they do use footnotes where necessary. Again the price is not &quot;from $X&quot;, it&#x27;s just $X.<p>Click &quot;Buy Now&quot; and you&#x27;re in the checkout flow. The call-to-action is entering your email address. The summary shows the total as being the exact price. No footnotes, no asterisks, no fine print. However, the price is only now listed as not a per-month price (as it has been on the previous 2 pages), but as an annual price paid monthly. You can change this to monthly price, but it&#x27;s 50% more expensive, proving that the &quot;$X per month&quot; advertisement is incorrect.<p>In the UK I think this would probably be classed as false advertising, and I think any refund complaint would be upheld in court or by the trading standards authority, which is probably why they gave me a refund when I pushed them.')
