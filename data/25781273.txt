Laid out like in your comment, there isn&#x27;t anything wrong with the line. &quot;our&quot; could refer to humanity.<p>For reference, the famous quote that is VERY similar is &quot;We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children&quot;. Notice the missing &quot;white&quot; from rchauds quote.<p>Again, not sure if on purpose, or who butchered it, but it might not mean what you think it does.')
