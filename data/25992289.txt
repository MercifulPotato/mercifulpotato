Our mission is simple - to change lives by bringing patients and their healthcare teams together. Our technology is revolutionising how technology is adopted and how care is delivered in healthcare.<p>Established in 2016 and now with Â£9m in Series A funding, accuRx is one of the UK&#x27;s fastest-growing tech startups. In two years, we grew from only a few GP practices using us to over 50% of practices in England. Today, over 95% of GP practices rely on us to communicate with their patients. We&#x27;ve just launched in hospitals and are already used by over 15% of hospitals in England. Our vision is that anyone involved in a patient&#x27;s care can communicate with each other.<p>In response to COVID-19, we spent March and April working tirelessly to release new features to help frontline staff. This includes a video consultation solution that went from zero to 35,000 daily consultations in the space of 8 weeks. We spent November and December building a vaccination booking system that has already saved frontline staff many hours and helped with vaccination uptake for vulnerable people in the UK.<p>Apply here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.accurx.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.accurx.com&#x2F;careers</a>')
