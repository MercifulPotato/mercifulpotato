But it is heir to a legendary “Golden Age” of Arabic science frequently invoked by commentators hoping to make Muslims and Westerners more respectful and understanding of each other. President Obama, for instance, in his June 4, 2009 speech in Cairo, praised Muslims for their historical scientific and intellectual contributions to civilization.<p>So first it says Contemporary &quot;Islam&quot; is not known for its engagement in the modern scientific project.<p>Then it says Golden Age of &quot;Arabic&quot; science.<p>Funny distinction. If you gonna use &#x27;Arabic&#x27;, use it everywhere.<p>Also another funny thing that the &quot;Idealistic&quot; president, Obama, who they say praised muslims for their historical scientific and intellectual contributions to civilization, had no problem working with dictators who are the main reason for the decline of scientific study in the region. And also had no problem supporting Al Sisi coup after the Egyptian revolution.<p>Edit: Adding that the Obama administration didn&#x27;t want to admit it is a coup to be able to keep giving aid to the Egyptian military, which is prevented by the American constitution in case of a coup.\nProfessor Chomsky always said that the US won&#x27;t allow true democracy in the middle east. He even had a lecture in 2011 just after the revolution started predicting exactly what happened.<p>So the US uses its power to keep the situation as it is, then the very much honest westerners come and say that we are backward in scientific study. Thanks guys. You are very wise and honest.')
