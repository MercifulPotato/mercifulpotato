I spent about six months pursuing the exact same idea about five years ago with the hope of building a company around it.  I got reasonably far with a prototype, but gave up on the business side of things after doing more extensive market research and interviews.<p>One of the people I talked to had been involved with a startup called Adrenaline Mobility which did something very similar, but ultimately ran out of runway and was acquired by Twitter.  He told an interesting story about how they (over-)built a highly scalable service but had a really hard time selling it.  Those who lack the training to know the difference between good security and hand waving didn&#x27;t see the value, and those who did have the training and skills didn&#x27;t trust a third party to do it right anyway.<p>Nonetheless, a lot has changed in the past five years, and end-to-end encryption is more widely appreciated now.  I hope you have better luck with the commercial side of things; this looks like a very promising start.')
