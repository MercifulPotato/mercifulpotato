It grossly overstates what&#x27;s happening. They called it that here in the USA too, and it was just as ridiculous. We had these so-called Stay At Home orders, which had tons of exceptions and were both ignored by the population and unenforced by the government. They might as well have been called Stay At Home Suggestions.<p>An actual sustained lock-down would likely stop the virus&#x27;s spread, allowing us to finally get back to normal. But nobody wants to claim ownership of the economic fallout, so instead they do these half-assed lock-downs which don&#x27;t really accomplish much besides making the government look like they&#x27;re doing something.')
