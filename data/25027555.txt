One of those is a &quot;subscribe until you don&#x27;t want to pay for it, then the last major version that you subscribed too is yours to keep forever.&quot; Another is &quot;pay for the specific version once and be done with it, here&#x27;s your license key.&quot;<p>I am not affiliated with JetBrains. I have a continuing &quot;pay once a year&quot; &quot;subscription.&quot; Should I ever need to cancel that subscription, or let it lapse (I did that between July 2019 and August 2020), I can still use the last major version from the prior year.<p>I think the JetBrains model of &quot;we have a variety of ways for you to give us money that is fair to us and you&quot; strikes a good balance.<p>There are a number of tools I have taken off of my workbench because they have gone subscription only: Tower, 1Password, and so forth. I only purchase &quot;one time licenses&quot; of MS Office these days (we&#x27;re about 3 years behind). I&#x27;m in the process of excising Adobe from my life, but unfortunately finding it rather hard.')
