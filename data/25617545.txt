Can it potentially cause harm when you do it and is there&#x27;s no beneficial reason to do it? If yes to both then it&#x27;s an ideal candidate for a lint rule.<p>Yeah sure, it <i>should</i> be a lint rule, we can quickly agree on that. But that wasn&#x27;t really my point: my point was that random people from the internet are running these kind of high false-positive linters without asking and start emailing people about it.')
