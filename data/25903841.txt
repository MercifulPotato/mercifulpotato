I use a jsonpath like column names, so putting the values A and B in a column named &quot;some.property.items[0]&quot; results in<p><pre><code>    [\n      {&quot;some&quot;: {&quot;property&quot;: {&quot;items&quot;:[&quot;A&quot;]}}},\n      {&quot;some&quot;: {&quot;property&quot;: {&quot;items&quot;:[&quot;B&quot;]}}}\n    ]\n</code></pre>\nTo avoid very long column names, values starting with &quot;[&quot; or &quot;{&quot; are parsed as json, so putting {&quot;a&quot;: 1} in a column named C results in [{&quot;C&quot;:{&quot;a&quot;: 1}}]. Doesn&#x27;t cover all edge cases, but worked well enough form my use case, which was providing a batch upload interface for a giant json (instead of a bunch of web forms) for excel savvy power users, allowing them to batch upload semi-structured data. I used jsonschema for validation on submit, worked well enough.')
