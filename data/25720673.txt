Item(by='PlsDontBan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610317020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719853, text='I don&#x27;t buy that explanation at all. The underlying assumption here seems to be something like this:<p>&quot;Everyone eats X calories per day. If those calories are &quot;healthy food&quot; they will get fat, and if those calories are &quot;unhealthy food&quot; they will not get fat.&quot;<p>That simply isn&#x27;t the way things work. One calorie of a McDonalds milkshake is interchangeable with one calorie of broccoli with respect to how much weight it causes you to gain. The reason that people in this country are too fat is because we have a culture that enjoys eating too much.<p>This is incredibly obvious to me as a person who has had to lose 100+ pounds before. I atomically facepalm every time I have conversations with obese family members who have blatant  misconceptions about physical fitness. There&#x27;s certainly a lack of education and understanding of this issue in America. It&#x27;s a damn shame that we have not solved this problem.<p>Furthermore, the reason why poor people (and yes, that disproportionately includes minority groups) tend to have higher rates of obesity is not that they don&#x27;t have access to healthy food. The whole notion that it is possible to be &quot;fat because of poverty&quot; is absolutely absurd because an obese person always has the option of simply eating less. The true reason why poor people tend to be fat at higher rates America is because low class people universally have a certain mindset. This mindset is characterized by not having the discipline to reject good things when they are presented. It&#x27;s just like how a poor person who is given a large amount of money becomes &quot;hood rich&quot; while a person who was born into a rich family was taught from an early age how to control themselves when it comes to spending money.')
