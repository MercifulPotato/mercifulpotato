It&#x27;s a monthly subscription service, but the time saved from not having to deal with accounting plus the tax savings from be set up as an S-Corp pays for itself. Just speaking as a happy customer for the past 18 months. They are extremely supportive and responsive; it&#x27;s like having your own accounting team. In terms of invoicing, like everyone and you have mentioned, it does depend on the client. I usually invoice at the end of the month.<p>Feel free to message me for more guidance on getting situated as a freelancer and if you want to learn more about my experience with Collective. I was in your position and someone had explained all this to me instead of learning about it the hard way!')
