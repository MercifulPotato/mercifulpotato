The introversion&#x2F;extraversion scale is commonly taken to represent whether (and to which extent) one is energized by solitude and drained by socialization and vice versa. It has nothing to do with conflict avoidance.<p>As evidence for this, check out the Big Five personality model, one of the golden standards on this topic.
