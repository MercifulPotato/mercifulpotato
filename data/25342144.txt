It&#x27;s not, and has never been, about you.<p>To add some things that are actually informative and constructive:<p>- Chuck Yeager did a fantastic job as an X-plane test pilot. Half of his colleagues died, and Yeager and most of the others were severely injured in accidents at the bleeding edge.<p>Stopping the X-plane program to focus solely on the space program was a huge mistake at the time, but has partially been revived. There is&#x2F;will be a lot more research around the world into hypersonic flight.<p>- We&#x27;re finally at the time when engines are as powerful as needed, and twice as efficient as 50 years ago (they improve on average 1% per year in terms of efficiency.) This is why narrow-body airliners like te A320 are being used for 8.5+-hour flights now.<p>- the challenge facing militaries today is how to defend against drones, as shown in the recent Syrian and Azerbaijan&#x2F;Armenia conflicts. (Turkey supplied a drone with 50-pound missiles that can destroy tanks and radar sites.)')
