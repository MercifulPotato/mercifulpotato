The developers notice that function components are as good as class components and start using them. So, now the project no longer follows the original coding guidelines. Itâ€™s more like a personal choice for each developer. And for me, that is OK.</i>&quot;<p>This is where the screw up happens. This is not okay, and as the person responsible for the architecture the author should have made a clear and concise decision and then get everyone to comply with it. You cannot let your developers run wild and then complain a year later when everything is a jumbled mess. Even more opinionated frameworks won&#x27;t save you because the application is so large it likely would have happened regardless.')
