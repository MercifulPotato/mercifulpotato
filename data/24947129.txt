KDE largely stopped doggedly naming new projects K-something over a decade ago. Yes, there&#x27;s examples to the contrary, and of course there are major projects sensibly sticking by their already-established brands, but plenty of core projects don&#x27;t follow this scheme anymore (obviously Plasma, for one).<p>It&#x27;s largely a relic of a time before interoperability-enabling standardization via freedesktop.org specs, when &quot;k = will work well with your desktop&quot; had much more utility to users. The Gnome crowd did the more or less the same thing with g, and also stopped.<p>As others mentioned, plenty of other tech orgs have pulled branding moves like this, be it iSomething or &quot;My Foo&quot;, and arguably those provided less actual utility. I would argue this should affect the relative levels of irksomeness. :-)')
