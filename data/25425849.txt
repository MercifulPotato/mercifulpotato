If you&#x27;re a good classical player you&#x27;re probably reasonably good at puzzles, but the opposite is not necessarily true.<p>Competitive coding, despite superficially involving typing code into an editor, has almost nothing to do with working on large pieces of software. It&#x27;s a lot of rote memorisation, learning algorithms, matching them onto very particular problems, and so on, it&#x27;s more of a sport. Just like playing too much bullet chess can be bad for your classical chess I can honestly see how it gets into the way of collaborative work.')
