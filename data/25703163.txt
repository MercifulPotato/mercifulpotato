The constraints placed upon epitopes by the cell receptor vs antibodies aren&#x27;t the same.  Rhinoviruses and Influenza viruses escape past immunity without fundamentally altering their biology all the time!  \nThe 2nd paper cited does in fact show functional virus with a charge-shifting E-&gt;K mutation in its receptor binding domain that escape many antibodies raised against earlier strains.\nI used to engineer viruses and human immune cells for a living - maybe read a little more virology&#x2F;immunology.')
