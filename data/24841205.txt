Just look a bit harder. AI is actually used in things like computer graphics (hello nvidia DLSS?) and hollywood special effects. Also its used in other entertainment. Does lectures on machine learning on youtube that collect massive amounts of money through patreon count? How about language translation? Aren&#x27;t state of the art models used in language translation today? Does google use transformer today in google translate? I&#x27;m not sure but it seems like it could definitely work. Sure it seems most use cases are not profit-generating. Is that they key here? I&#x27;d say its more marketing related tech-feats. But does that mean there is no benefit?')
