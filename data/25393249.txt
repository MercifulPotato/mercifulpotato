Not true.  The vast majority of US farms have power for one simple reason, they irrigate.  It&#x27;d be far too expensive to irrigate using a gas pump.<p>The exception MIGHT be dry farms, but those aren&#x27;t as common as you might think.  Further, most farms have shops for repairs which almost always have power for lights (and heat sometimes).<p>&gt; And what to do if battery runs out on the field?<p>Simple, grab a gas generator, run to the tractor, and charge it up enough to hobble it to the shop and to a full charge.  You might waste an hour running your generator, but that&#x27;s really not that big of a deal.  Many farmers already have those generators (welding is a big reason why).<p>A particularly ecologically focused farmer might buy some solar panels to do the same thing :).<p>&gt; how long does it take to recharge? A lot of farmers will not have fast charges on their farm.<p>Doesn&#x27;t really matter, it can charge overnight slowly.  So long as the farm has access to 240V they likely can get it charge up in the 14 hours of downtime.<p>At $50k, this is a particularly cheap tractor as well.  I&#x27;d suspect that farmers would buy 2 and completely sidestep the charging problem if they wanted to run for more than 10 hours.')
