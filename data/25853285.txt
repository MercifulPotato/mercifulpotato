It&#x27;s not necessary to have these open and closed brackets&#x2F;parenthesis. They don&#x27;t add anything, and if anything, they confuse the matter. An interval is just (1, 2) (or [1, 2] if preferred aesthetically). Since a base cannot be &quot;on&quot; either 1 or 2, it&#x27;s not meaningful to have these open&#x2F;closed interval notion. In other words, (1, 2) == [1, 2) == (1, 2] == [1, 2].<p>Open&#x2F;closed intervals only come into play in continuous dimensions. DNA sequences, arrays in memory, et al are discrete.')
