They are probably going to have to clear at least 30 min from their schedule so $5-$10 for a day&#x27;s participation is more fair.  You have to cut 50 checks a month,  probably hire an FTE to manage the program.  If 10% of the people have trouble and need tech support you may need to handle 5 simultaneous support calls.  Once people start getting bored maybe 30 people show up on any given day -- it&#x27;s not realistic to sanction people for not showing up other than withholding pay,  even then one of them might take you to small claims court if they think you&#x27;ve ripped them off.  You&#x27;ll need to recruit a larger panel than you think and have somebody always recruiting new members as others churn away.<p>If it is a service somebody else provides they have to do all that plus manage entropy that comes from you.  They&#x27;d also like to make a profit.  If it is $1000 a day you are talking a lot more than a full-time coder or tester cost.<p>A plan (B) is as follows:  stress test the server with an automated system.  That&#x27;s got to be a lot more affordable.<p>A plan (C): embed telemetry in the client and server and see it as a sales task to recruit a group of &quot;heavy consumers&quot;; maybe people who want to do church or karate lessons on line.')
