He has a &quot;7 baby steps process&quot; that I believe everyone should know (and adapt to his&#x2F;her will&#x2F;preferences&#x2F;life setup). Yes is a fanatic christian, yes, he can be a bit tiring when he takes a religious tangent, but still, I find his message very useful. I would really liked to have discovered him 20-30 years ago (or whoever was the Dave Ramsey at that time).<p>I really appreciated&#x2F;found really helpful the tip of the &quot;seven bank accounts&quot; (Jordan Page, FunCheapOrFree)(also not connected in any way): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=auzLhKvsxnQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=auzLhKvsxnQ</a><p>(Ramsey a similar type of management the &quot;envelope system&quot;).<p>Edit: from what he sometimes says on his radio show, some schools in the USA &#x27;teach&#x27; his program&#x2F;system&#x2F;7-step-process. I find this amazing and I wish that this (or something similar) is properly taught to every school on the planet.')
