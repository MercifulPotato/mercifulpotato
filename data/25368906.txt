The craft beer explosion has definitely hit here, too, and even more so around Sacramento.<p>A terrific new tiki bar opened in Oakland (The Kon-Tiki) and multiple terrific new tiki bars opened in San Francisco (Pagan Idol, Last Rites, Zombie Village; Smuggler&#x27;s Cove opened in 2009, so not technically within 10 years, but they&#x27;re considered one of the best bars -- not just tiki bars -- in the world).<p>As much as San Franciscans like to dump on San Jose, I think downtown San Jose has actually gotten pretty cool in a lot of respects, and that&#x27;s entirely in the last decade.<p>There&#x27;s a fair number of other smaller towns scattered around the Bay Area which are seeing some silver linings of gentrification.<p>I could probably come up with a more detailed list, but despite some very real downsides, particularly economic -- real estate prices really are out of control (and there is no One Single Cause to point to, despite a lot of folks trying); homelessness has become a genuine epidemic -- it&#x27;s still a great place to be, and it&#x27;s hard for me to think of another place in America where I&#x27;d genuinely <i>rather</i> be.
