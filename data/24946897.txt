Item(by='klyrs', descendants=None, kids=[24946985], score=None, time=1604092005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946801, text='&gt; It&#x27;s very unclear to me if they meant to say Jeremey was not guilty when they talked to him at a certain point in time or if he is still not guilty.<p>It&#x27;s clear to me that they&#x27;re trying to not express an opinion there.  I read this as them recusing themselves from the situation and doing their best to not express an opinion about a ruling which may or may not have been made (the murkiness about this also seems deliberate)')
