It can assist in societies without formed legal systems and can help foster higher trust within its members.<p>Humans have insufficient time to evaluate all of the motivations and priorities of others, and religion provides a nice framework with all the various social events and traditions for the tribe to coalesce around.<p>Growing up, I learned that plausible deniability is very important for humans.  For the same reasons that flirting is a thing, it’s not beneficial for someone to walk around with an explicit list of people&#x2F;tribes they value over others, in push comes to shove scenarios.
