Stadia is a PC game streaming service, not a physical game console. Google doesn&#x27;t own the PC game platform, they&#x27;re just facilitating it.<p>If Google had never attempted a game studio and launched Stadia as a standalone platform (as it will now be), <i>no one</i> would have said &quot;ok but it&#x27;s a bad sign that Google isn&#x27;t getting into the game development business&quot;<p>&gt; Stadia being good tech is just another sign that Stadia deserved better than Google.<p>Probably true. I wish it were a standalone company also, but it&#x27;s not.')
