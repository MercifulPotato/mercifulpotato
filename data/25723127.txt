For these types of people, their next move is usually to escalate. You see this with bullies, abusive relationships, rapists, serial killers, terrorists, etc. They learn what they can get away with, they like the power it gives them, and they try something more.<p>Therefore, we can&#x27;t make decisions based on the fear of their response, even if we have a personal aversion to conflict. That&#x27;s falling into the trap of the abused. We have to make decisions based on defending our principles and standing up for what we believe is right.<p>No matter what, some people are going to be pissed off at any sufficiently meaningful decision (or indecision). If the people pissed off are violent types, well, then perhaps that&#x27;s a sign the right decision was made.<p>I understand that there&#x27;s a hell of a lot of nuance to this - sometimes you don&#x27;t poke the sleeping bear.
