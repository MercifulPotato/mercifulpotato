I worked in a bioinformatics lab ~10-12 years ago and I remember using his fast short read aligner to help speed things up.  Back then the nanopore devices were still just rumors.<p>Computers have Moore&#x27;s law with a base or time constant of 12-24mo.  Batteries seem to have the same with a base of about 10 years (slow Moore&#x27;s law I&#x27;ve heard it called).  It feels like genome&#x2F;genetic things have the same behavior but with a base of something like 5ish years.')
