ANSM is the french local body, but it is EU MDR you probably have to meet; this at least gets you the EU countries but for example will allow your device to be used in the USA, you would still need FDA there.  Some jurisdictions, particularly smaller ones, will rubber stamp things if you have the right approvals but it&#x27;s still finicky and of course with a physical device you have to deal with things like different power standards.<p>The approaches are similar but annoyingly different enough that this isn&#x27;t easy. Luckily they are both reliant on ISO13485 at core, so there is overlap. It&#x27;s not just paperwork either, you can definitely design something that will not pass in another jurisdiction if you aren&#x27;t careful (e.g. due to materials used).  Further, you need separate certification to a standard as both a manufacturer and developer, and these don&#x27;t carry over automatically either.<p>People are working on making this easier to do worldwide, but it still isn&#x27;t easy.  For example you can use MDSAP to get a regulatory audit that meets multiple countries requirements at once.')
