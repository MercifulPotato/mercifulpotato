Especially given that, as you said, many people simply don&#x27;t appear to have any mental energy left to do anything more &quot;productive&quot; after a workday, never mind a workday AND childcare. Of course, that&#x27;s again a problem caused by <i>work</i>, not procrastination, but I very much challenge the notion that it&#x27;s good for you to worry about whether your leisure time is of high enough quality!<p>Now, I do agree that social media and other things in the digital world can be actually addictive and psychologically harmful, but given the aforementioned state of mental exhaustion I&#x27;m totally not surprised that people should get hooked on things that are designed to continuously give your brain small rewards with minimum effort spent on your part.')
