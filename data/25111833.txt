The new training scenarios in DE are quite helpful and I&#x27;d recommend them to new or returning players.<p>DE has led to a massive resurgence of interest and a 3rd generation of players. First gen was AoE2 (CD), 2nd gen was the forgotten empires continuing things, 3rd is DE. Some players have spanned all 3. My current favorite streamers are Viper and Hera.')
