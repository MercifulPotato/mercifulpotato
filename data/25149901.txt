This seems very, very cheap per-TB compared to other hosted storage. Are you making any compromises here that your users should know about? How do you explain the price difference between this and, for example, a Hetzner storage box or rsync.net?<p>The compromises seem to be spelled out in the description in a fairly straight forward manner. There isn&#x27;t flexibility beyond 8TB storage blocks, and it defaults to just one which in my opinion is fairly useless for ZFS, you lose some of the real self-healing and safety advantages (yeah you can have copies within a single drive, but that halves&#x2F;thirds your space just like a mirror and it&#x27;ll be slower and with less redundancy than just two half sized drives in a mirror). So basically double or more the pricing there. The data transfer limits and pricing on that is also somewhat higher, so not for high churn. I&#x27;m assuming that &quot;1 TB included&quot; is per month, so for offsite replication essentially there&#x27;d be a &quot;loading fee&quot; per drive, then bandwidth is covered going forward if churn is less than 1 TB&#x2F;month. And even in the best case they don&#x27;t claim you&#x27;d be able to saturate even 1 Gbps, so loading will take a while. At 100 Mbps bringing an 8 TB pool to ~3&#x2F;4 would take around 6 days. There is no SLA, appears to be no autobackups or anything like that.<p>The pricing could use some more clarity too. Under rent-to-own for example, it&#x27;s not clear what the pricing is after you have covered the drive(s). Not clear what payments they take and through what service. I wouldn&#x27;t personally put keys there either, but since ZFS supports raw send&#x2F;receive there is less need to trust the far side unless your metadata is sensitive as well.<p>So basically it&#x27;s ultra bare bones, for cheap.<p>Which isn&#x27;t a bad thing to have in the mix. I&#x27;m happy to see more space for people to experiment with very minimal focused efforts that lean more heavily on ZFS itself to try to economize vs traditional models. Personally, right now this is still a bit farther on the rough side of the line then I&#x27;d feel comfortable with (I&#x27;d want to at least have a vague idea of who they were and where exactly the data center in question is). But the basic idea is a neat one, amortizing something someone wanted to do anyway.')
