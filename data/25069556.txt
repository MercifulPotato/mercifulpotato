Assuming that things _will_ get better and passing the buck onto your descendants is madness. Also how much growth has been stunted by the weight of ancestral spending?<p>Birth rates are declining and the cost of maintaining our infrastructure is at the point in most high-GDP locations (New York, California, etc) where obligations cannot be met and credit status changes were inevitable _before_ Coronavirus. Look at the insanity New Jersey has gone through with the criminal pilfering of infrastructure&#x2F;development funds to pay pensions (aka, Christine Todd Whitman should have gone to jail).<p>We&#x27;re looking at cascading failures in a complex system. Nobody can see enough of the picture to predict what&#x27;s next or realize that it&#x27;s already dead. To assume that we&#x27;ll right the trend with growth will most likely require either war or (a technical) revolution.')
