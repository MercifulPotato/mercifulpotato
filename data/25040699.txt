Like yeah, its sorta like cheap bag cheese, cheese with more sweaty feet undertaste that I couldn’t not picture once I made the mental connection. Usually doesn’t melt, I&#x27;ve taken a torch to some trying to get it to melt and just end up searing it.<p>Vegan burgers sometimes suffer from this when they lean away from the bean&#x2F;tex mex route and try and tackle a hamburger. It ends up tasting like the grease is masking all the flavor, and it isn’t pleasant rendered fatty grease like in a burger but vegetable oil and a surprising amount of it. I don’t know if its the way its prepared or what, but imo its a tough prospect trying to ask $15 for a burger that tastes like oil soaked starch, hidden behind the aioli on the bun hoping you don’t notice. Impossible burgers fall into this grease pit area for my pallet, I’ve tried them pretty much anywhere I see them at least once and no matter how they try and hide the patty with the other components it still stands out like a sore thumb to me.<p>I’ll wait another 5 years and try again. Hopefully more food science development can iron out these kinks.')
