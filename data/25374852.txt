If I store your language preference in a cookie is that the same as if I store a unique identifier so I can track you where-ever you go on the internet (as long as the site has enabled some silly facebook type button)? Of course not, it&#x27;s the intent which is wrong not the simple act of <i>offering</i> cookies to your browser.<p>If they really wanted to make cookies completely optional then they should have pushed the responsibility onto browsers. At least then we&#x27;d have a consistent interface rather than some javascript which pops up 10 seconds after the page has loaded.')
