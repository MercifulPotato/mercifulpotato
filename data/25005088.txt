If you want rent to go down, allow more building. End of story. There&#x27;s actually nothing else to it. Lower property values caused by an increase in supply will yield lower rents because rents are generally indexed to mortgage rates which are indexed to property values.<p>The problem is twofold.<p>1. Americans view property as an investment while also wanting it to be affordable. These are mutually exclusive. If you want something to be a good investment you want it to become less affordable over time.<p>2. Renters tend to be younger, transient, non-voters with weaker ties to the community. Landowners tend to be older, established voters with strong ties to the community. This means the city council panders to landowners, and they pass policies which prevent development.<p>SF is the worst for this, the city is basically unchanged since the 1970s to the absolute and sole benefit of landowners.<p>There are wonderful examples of cities which pretty much default-allow building housing, like Tokyo. Tokyo is <i>incredibly affordable</i>, downtown starter-home&#x2F;condos cost $200K USD, and people in Japan do not view property as an investment but rather as somewhere to live. More like a car.<p>Yes, prop 13 sucks, yes a land value tax is pointing in the right direction, yes rent control isn&#x27;t helping, but none of these things are a substitute for the simple unit economics of supply and demand. Anything other than permitting tons of new building is at best a band-aid over a hole in the dam.')
