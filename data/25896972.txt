Super power efficiency without compromising  on power? Yes please. It&#x27;s the first big advancement in a while. It&#x27;s priced very well for what you get.<p>The only reason I&#x27;m not jumping on the M1 train is I&#x27;m die hard linux. I also prefer desktops and never work outside of a home&#x2F;work office. So I can get the same&#x2F;better performance with AMD Ryzen and not need to care so much about power&#x2F;battery.')
