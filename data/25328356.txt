Item(by='captain_price7', descendants=None, kids=[25328509, 25328501, 25328871], score=None, time=1607303285, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25325716, text='The summary of this essay appears to be that Paul Graham relies too much on his own intuition, but intuition can lead people astray- a lengthy discussion on the failure of PG&#x27;s own Arc language is used to support this argument. And apparently his recent political&#x2F;social commentary fails for the same reason. The author went as far as to call him &quot;profoundly unserious public intellectual&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that role of intuition is exactly similar in something as subjective as political commentary as in designing a programming language. Even more frustrating is that the author doesn&#x27;t clarify what characteristics someone needs to have to become a &quot;serious public intellectual&quot;. He clarifies what PG should have done for Arc (read a scientific paper), but there isn&#x27;t any such specific criticism directed against PG&#x27;s political essays.<p>The actual thrust of the argument seems so broad (i.e. reliance on intuition), this could be used to label almost anybody outside pol-sci academic circles a &quot;profoundly unserious public intellectual&quot; for commenting on politics.')
