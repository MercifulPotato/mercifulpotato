Beautifully written with layers upon layers of meaning - each time you reread a Carre you see another facet.<p>If there was a theme across his books - he was always concerned with the nature of betrayal. &quot;Love is whatever you can still betray&quot;. Betrayal of country, of a spouse, and even of a parent.')
