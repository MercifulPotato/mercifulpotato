You don&#x27;t hear about people running local GPU compute clusters because it&#x27;s not newsworthy -- it&#x27;s <i>obvious</i>. Put a few workstations behind a switch, fire up torch.distributed, you&#x27;re done. And after two months, you&#x27;ve beaten the AWS spend for the same amount of GPU compute, even if only 50% of the time is spent training. Timesharing is done with shell accounts and asking nicely. You do not <i>need</i> the huge technical complexity of the cloud: it gets in the way, as well as costing more!')
