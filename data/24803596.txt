Item(by='meowface', descendants=None, kids=[24805081, 24805999], score=None, time=1602872940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800980, text='I watch and very much enjoy his Twitch streams, and he&#x27;s definitely and obviously very intelligent, but I&#x27;d say not necessarily more than a top ~70th percentile HN commenter who works in software engineering. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s necessarily a genius, but just super curious and motivated and confident in his ability to learn anything if he dedicates enough time and practice.<p>You can see his learning and motivation process in his streams, when he dives into something he&#x27;s totally unfamiliar with. It&#x27;s very inspiring and fun to follow along with (partly because he clearly is having fun). He really enjoys learning things and has the kind of ego (not in a bad way) that just doesn&#x27;t let anything stop him from trying to catch up on any concept in any field, even if he&#x27;s totally &quot;veering outside his lane&quot; and going in blind (like his COVID-19 bioscience streams). He has a deep, almost hypomanic hunger for knowledge, and keeps Googling things until he understands everything he&#x27;s reading. I think a lot of it&#x27;s psychological and not purely IQ&#x2F;cognitive speed, though of course it helps.<p>If anyone&#x27;s curious, you can find an archive of his streams here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;commaaiarchive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;commaaiarchive</a>')
