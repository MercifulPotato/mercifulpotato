I have to admit that I don&#x27;t know a single person who is (I&#x27;m sure some of them are, it&#x27;s not like I ask everyone if they use some specific platform).<p>The point is that a lot of media people is, and posting there gets you exposure. But as this group of people is much smaller than your proverbial &quot;everyone&quot;, moving them off Twitter is a much easier affair.<p>I have often thought about what would happen if a small number of very high profile Twitter users with a wide reach to various different groups decided to set up their own servers (Mastodon perhaps) and asked their followers to go there. How many such high-profile users would you need before Twitter&#x27;s momentum completely stops? I argue that that number is very small.')
