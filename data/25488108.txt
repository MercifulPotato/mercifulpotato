When the first test chips came back from the lab on the 26 April 1985, Furber plugged one into a development board, and was happy to see it working perfectly first time.<p>&gt; Deeply puzzling, though, was the reading on the multimeter connected in series with the power supply. The needle was at zero: the processor seemed to be consuming no power whatsoever.<p>&gt; As Wilson tells it: â€œThe development board plugged the chip into had a fault: there was no current being sent down the power supply lines at all. The processor was actually running on leakage from the logic circuits. So the low-power big thing that the ARM is most valued for today, the reason that it&#x27;s on all your mobile phones, was a complete accident.&quot;<p>&gt; Wilson had, it turned out, designed a powerful 32-bit processor that consumed no more than a tenth of a Watt.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;03&#x2F;unsung_heroes_of_tech_arm_creators_sophie_wilson_and_steve_furber&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;03&#x2F;unsung_heroes_of_tech...</a>')
