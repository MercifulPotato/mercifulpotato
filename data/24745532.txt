First of all, when I mean average user I referrer only to those people that actually have a business&#x2F;website to use those tools for, not to the average internet user. So, if they already have a website, they probably know at least how to purchase or even edit one (through code, WordPress or a visual editor).<p>My goal is that for those people, who are already technical enough to have their own website, &quot;self-hosting&quot; of their desired tool is just as simple as using 3rd party tools. It should not be harder to use self-hosted userTrack than it is to use Google Analytics. This is almost possible now, but the server&#x2F;cloud providers are still working on providing APIs and services for making this more accessible.<p>Even now, you can go to certain GitHub repositories and click the &quot;Deploy to Heroku&quot; button, and with one click you have your own server running your desired application. The problem is that this is mostly limited to some hosting providers and to a very few applications. This should be possible to do, in an easy, secure and maintainable way for a wide variety of applications and hosting providers.')
