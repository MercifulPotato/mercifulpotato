I didn&#x27;t think of this situation.  I&#x27;m pretty new to the language and only have done hobby projects so I haven&#x27;t run into this specific scenario.

There is otherwise no danger from a memory standpoint since Elixir is immutable.  But I can appreciate your use of it here.  [edited to add a missing word]')
