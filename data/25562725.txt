I don&#x27;t think that necessarily speaks to the <i>unsuitability</i> of that language for personally uninteresting things.<p>I thought your point about bootstrapping to popularity was a good one.  It&#x27;s not easy but I&#x27;m convinced that Haskell is good enough that it&#x27;s possible (in fact I think it&#x27;s inevitable that either <i>some</i> Haskellish language will become popular or some popular language will become Haskellish).')
