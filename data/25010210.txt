If you like what you&#x27;ve got, don&#x27;t try real actual socialism. Believe me, it sucks. You&#x27;d regret it.<p>&gt; I have a good reason to be salty towards the rich<p>If my guess is correct, you experience is an unique result of a very bad situation which was manufactured by some dirty politicians, some PhD&#x27;ed idiots and some greedy bastards (see my comment about the assholes above). That doesn&#x27;t mean everybody who is rich is a bastard. Having money is a wrong marker, and your saltiness is way off target.<p>&gt; it meant that the wealth the rich folks are accumulating at record pace would be distributed<p>That never ever happens. I mean, even if it happened it would amount to tiny crumbs for you (&quot;you livelihood and all you&#x27;ve done for living are gone and you have no means to support you family or procure food, but here&#x27;s your check for $275, enjoy it!&quot;) - you can&#x27;t both whine about &quot;tiny number of people owning stuff&quot; and expect taking their stuff would make you rich - &quot;tiny number&quot; means you only get a tiny part of it. Arithmetics is a cruel science.<p>But in fact there&#x27;s no &quot;distribution&quot; ever possible. Never happened, never will. There&#x27;s only destruction and desolation. It is possible to target Bill Gates&#x27;s wealth and destroy it. Shut down Microsoft, make all its workers unemployed, blow up the campuses and wipe out the backups. Can be done. You won&#x27;t be even $275 richer from that though. Nothing will be &quot;distributed&quot;, just destroyed. This is the only way it has ever worked or can work. Revolutions do not make anyone richer, but they do make a lot of people starve and die.<p>&gt; I would rather make minimum wage in a world where that was the norm<p>No you wouldn&#x27;t. I lived in that world, and I haven&#x27;t seen any single person who after experiencing both wanted to remain in the minimum wage world. Millions wanted to move out and took extraordinary efforts - often risking their lives - to do it. Remember the Berlin wall? Why do you think they needed the wall - is it to hold out the West Germans itching to experience the blessings of the East German minimal wage? How many South Koreans you think want to move to North Korea to enjoy the guaranteed rice rations?<p>&gt; a world where that was the norm then to be taken advantage of by a wealthy class who consistently adds to their own wealth while the rest either stays the same or gets poorer.<p>But that&#x27;s not true. The rest doesn&#x27;t get poorer - in fact, the number of people living in poverty is declining steadily. Yes, I know you had a bad experience in 2008, but if you&#x27;re willing to have a broader look you can easily see it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;extreme-poverty" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;extreme-poverty</a>')
