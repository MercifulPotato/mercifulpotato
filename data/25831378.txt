I can change the colors and the wallpaper, but that is about it.<p>But in the Linux world, if I like a minimalistic appearance and the Gnome shell model, I use Gnome. If I want a powerful desktop that I can configure a lot, I choose KDE&#x2F;Plasma. If I want something lightweight, there are plenty of choices.<p>And why are there different distros like Manjaro, KDE Neon, Ubuntu, Fedora? This is somewhat orthognal, but they all have important differences.<p>I don&#x27;t think one &quot;Desktop Linux&quot; could give me the breadth of choices that multiple desktop environments can. If they were to merge and make one big enviroment, that would have to be <i>really</i> good because it is competing with Windows and macOS.<p>I used to use Gnome, but since Linux <i>is moving</i> in the direction you describe and homogenizing under the hood (see systemd for example), I found that current desktop Linux is no longer the radical different OS - it is just an inferior alternative Windows (for me personally, at this point in time!).')
