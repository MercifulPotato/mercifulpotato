My early interest in linguistics made me realize that glossolalia doesn&#x27;t function in any capacity of language, and that the random phonemes only come from your native language. Theologically it&#x27;s suspect because the gift of tongues in Acts 2 is said to be human languages... &quot;we have heard them speak in our own tongues.&quot; Even metaphysically it doesn&#x27;t make sense: the telos of language is communication, and supposedly this is God talking... to Himself?\nA lot of good that early interest in linguistics did for me anyway. I took a single NLP course and hated it. Historical linguistics is a fun topic though; I have a history of English gathering dust, half-read, sitting on my bookshelf.\nGood note from the author on &quot;Everyone knows a language and thus everyone thinks they know about language.&quot; I agree on the conflation of language with writing is wrong because most languages that exist do not have writing systems, but a language having a writing system created for it could be argued to be &quot;better&quot; in the same way an armadillo or an ant is &quot;better&quot; than a slug; it has &quot;armor&quot; against &quot;death.&quot; But yeah, thinking a language is dying because speech is drifting from text is boomer.')
