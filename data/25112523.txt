Ads drive consumerism, and we have an economy that is driven by consumerism. Technological advancement, economic stability and growth, it is paid for by the creation of economic value driven by consumerism. Societies with unstable economic systems do not stay stable themselves for very long unless the economic issues are addressed.<p>So we cannot remove or drastically reduce advertising without it causing far-reaching second-order consequences that in turn have their own consequences. Less ads, people buy less stuff. Places that make stuff make less of it, or go out of business, and not as many people are needed to make that stuff. Businesses that supported those businesses suffer the same problem. Countries whose economies rely on us buying their stuff or having our stuff made in those countries suffer major economic losses.<p>Lets take the consumer electronics industry. Lets say we just got rid of advertising for things to the point where everyone was willing to keep their stuff twice as long and buy less stuff they don&#x27;t really need. That industry is about $1 Trillion&#x2F;year. Let&#x27;s say the second-order economic effects from support industries that depend on that are another $500 Billion. Still doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot in the scheme of things, a little under 1% of the world GDP. But it&#x27;s also not evenly distributed. Some countries are hit much harder. The economies of South Korea &amp; China are hit particularly hard. And a part of China&#x27;s stability is driven economic growth that supports propaganda promising increased quality of life. War may not break out, but small cracks start to appear. Do that same for the automobile industry, and that&#x27;s about another $2.5 trillion out of the economy.<p>So we cannot remove from this system a part we don&#x27;t like and still have that system function the same way. I guess we can go into it eyes-open and say &quot;it&#x27;s worth the consequences&quot; and go ahead with it. Or, and this is my preference, we can try to understand the system well enough to figure out how we can change the parts we don&#x27;t like smoothly enough to avoid the worse of those consequences.<p>None of this means we shouldn&#x27;t complain about ads, and want them to go away. But if we&#x27;re being practical about it, we don&#x27;t just need a way to get rid of ads, we also need a way to patch that hole in the system.')
