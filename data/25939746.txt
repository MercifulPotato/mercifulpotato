They do not flip over in an instant.<p>What I believe we&#x27;re seeing is a society-wide disagreement on the connotations of the word. It will shake itself out, one way or another - but this process used to take decades and was barely noticeable. Now it takes months to years, which is catching people by surprise.<p>Also: the flip side of &quot;words change meaning&quot; is that, during a period of change, you&#x27;ll encounter people using a different meaning than you. The arguments favoring the updated weight of the word we&#x27;re discussing here seem frequently of the form, &quot;$word truly means $my-meaning; surely you do not really believe it means $your-meaning, you&#x27;re just pretending, and in reality you&#x27;re just a hateful person who hates $me and $mine&quot; - which is essentially twisting logic and sanity into a pretzel.<p>(For better or worse, I expect the &quot;revisionists&quot; to win over &quot;conservatives&quot; here, now that the updated connotations have institutional backing of big social media companies, in form of the ban policies.)')
