I have had friends who were told to STFU and take a frequenting ticket or spend the night in jail (and thus risk losing their minimum wage job).  I even had a friend who was led to a cop car <i>by the FBI</i> but (thankfully) he refused to get in because there was a mysterious baggie in the back (which was surreptitiously spirited away <i>on camera</i>).
