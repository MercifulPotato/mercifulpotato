What I&#x27;m doing is driving everything off Music Thing Modular Chord Organs, with firmware I programmed. Everything&#x27;s based off a chord (or note) choice within one of twelve keys, and the secret is that you&#x27;ve got to modulate by circle of fifths, not chromatically. Also, chords are better arranged off pentatonic roots, rather than diatonically.<p>Do that and you can go to challenging jazz chords, but things hang together in a logical&#x2F;musical way.
