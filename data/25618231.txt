Each VM had dedicated memory, but no ownership of the cores they were pinned to, so overnight if the &#x27;workstations&#x27; were idle, another VM (also with dedicated memory) would spin up (the other VMs would be backgrounded) and consume the available cores and add itself to the render farm. An artist could then log in and suspend the job to get their performance back (I believe this was one of the reasons behind the checkpointing feature in RenderMan).<p>The Teradici stuff was great, and from an admin perspective having everything located in the DC made maintenance SO much better. Switching over to VDI is a long term goal for us at Blue Sky as well, but it&#x27;ll take a lot more time and planning.')
