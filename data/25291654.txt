The slide rule teaches in a very direct physical way how logarithms work and how they can be used. This is something that most people never learn, but is extremely valuable.<p>&gt; <i>This seems to imagine that the only thing being taught&#x2F;worth teaching on the mathematics curriculum is number sense</i><p>First of all, number sense is extremely important. Probably the most important thing taught in primary&#x2F;secondary math courses. But it is certainly not the only important thing.<p>Students can learn to use an electronic calculator in very little time. A person of average intelligence who understands the relevant math should be able to learn to use their calculator pretty much independently, and become fluent at it with a tiny bit of practice over a short time. There are very quickly diminishing returns to teaching “calculator skills”, because those are extremely shallow.<p>&gt; <i>And secondly, number sense is easier to teach without depending on particular algorithms.</i><p>I really have no idea which ‘particular algorithms’ you are talking about. Have you ever used a slide rule? It is a very flexible general-purpose tool.<p>&gt; <i>This is the same complaint as people grumbling about &quot;common core&quot; math, or saying we should go back to the basics of just rote learning times tables and long division.</i><p>No, it is precisely the opposite recommendation to those.<p>&gt; <i>A perfectly reasonable assigned problem might be: add the 7.1% sales tax to this ticket price, do you have enough cash?</i><p>This is a reasonable problem to teach students about for like 1 week at age ~10. If they learn how to do it using pen and paper, or a soroban, or mental arithmetic, or a slide rule, or a pile of loose pebbles, they’ll have no trouble accomplishing the same with a calculator. It is not a reasonable problem to spend 5 more years on. We are talking about exams for 15-year-olds.')
