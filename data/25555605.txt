Does it propagate into space (electromagnetism)? Theoretically, could an idea&#x2F;experience be reconstructed from the private thoughts of an individual?<p>If all mental workings have a physical component, would that mean that there is an encoding mechanism for subjective experience?<p>I could be asking the wrong questions here. My knowledge of physics and neuroscience in borderline nonexistent.<p>Thanks!')
