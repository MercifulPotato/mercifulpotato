They have a vested interest in power staying centralized.  This all makes it a lot funnier when it&#x27;s their sister being burnt at the stake.  Someone might even break out a saying.<p>With how evasive you&#x27;re being, I can only assume your stances would cast you in an unfavourable light, similar to the guy who&#x27;s &quot;Just asking questions about race&quot;.')
