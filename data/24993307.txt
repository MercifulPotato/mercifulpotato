So there is no way to combine a Tiger Lake-U iGPU with Xe MAX and double your DOTA framerate, for example. Functionally, Xe MAX is closer to a graphics co-processor – literally a second GPU in the system.</i><p>This basically seems to make it only useful as some sort of encoding&#x2F;decoding co-processor, with potential but currently undescribed &#x2F; undefined ML benefits.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16210&#x2F;intels-discrete-gpu-era-begins-intel-launches-xe-max-for-entrylevel-laptops" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16210&#x2F;intels-discrete-gpu-era...</a>')
