The idea wasn&#x27;t to do something every N millis, the loop was &quot;process work, if there isn&#x27;t any more work to do, sleep(1), repeat&quot;. Like you said, the &quot;work&quot; part can take any amount of time - but when it does run out, the thread needs to sleep&#x2F;wait. We have experimented with several APIs for this, including the methods you suggested, and it had no effect on actual time spent waiting for more work to appear - sleep(1) had the exact same effect as simply using WaitForObject and the work producer signalling on that object - the times were literally identical.<p>Edit: reading your comment again I think I see the misunderstanding - sleep wasn&#x27;t used to do something periodically, if that&#x27;s what you want to do then indeed, sleep is the wrong tool.')
