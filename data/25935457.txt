Who do you trust with you private stuff?<p>On the left corner, Whatsapp. Owned by a company who has been caught red-handed with plenty of shady stuff. From  accepting money to manipulate democracies, to exploiting the human brain (young and old) to catapult their product FB is a live testament of what being a greedy, evil corporation really means.<p>On right corner, Telegram. As far as I know, they have been caught in zero shady enterprises. Their discourse seem a bit cocky and preachy, but honestly I couldn&#x27;t agree more with their principles and their responses to criticism seem logic.<p>My choice is Telegram, thank you very much!<p>There is still Signal, but less than a quarter of my contacts are there. To me it smells a bit of G+... great idea and features, but low adoption which makes the product irrelevant.')
