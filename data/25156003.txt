One company shouldn&#x27;t be able to control the web this way.<p>They&#x27;re talking about their own services that they require accounts for here, not &quot;the web&quot;, or even general search, AFAICT.  You can still use google, you just can&#x27;t log in using an app they aren&#x27;t sure is trusted, for user security.  Google goes a great many problematic things these days, but I&#x27;m not sure this is one of them.<p>You could keep a trusted browser around and use it <i>just</i> for authenticating and getting a token.  That&#x27;s all they care about here, that they have a certain base level of assurance that you aren&#x27;t being directed through an application that can steal credentials.')
