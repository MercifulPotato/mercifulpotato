Because I think that &#x27;The Saga Begins&#x27; is indeed making fun of &#x27;American Pie.&#x27;<p>Weird Al is not simply adding any lyrics over the song but instead chose a long and convoluted story arc that awkwardly fits into American Pie&#x27;s song structure. By including so much story detail from Star Wars into the song Weird Al effectively points out how ridiculous the profound but ultimately meaningless character archetypes are in the original song.')
