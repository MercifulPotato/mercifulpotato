Here&#x27;s some feedback about the idea, hopefully helpful. :)<p>Pricing seems really tough for me. In general my meals are around the £1-3&#x2F;serving range, when cooking at home. adding 33-100% cost to my meals regularly is a deal breaker.<p>As a curiosity I&#x27;ll absolutely be interested to try this out - probably as a lockdown tastetest &quot;date night&quot;. To me, that is a much more viable niche for this product, and thus I&#x27;d be in the £10 range for the product.<p>You stress 30s versus minutes like that is a deal breaker. I&#x27;m not confident this as strong of a selling point as you think - at least not for me.<p>Site looks nice, and the free UK shipping is awesome!<p>&gt; NATURAL<p>Please, as a neuroscientist - who therefore also studied biochemistry as part of their degree - don&#x27;t use this word in this way. All things are natural (what is &quot;unnatural&quot;? Ectoplasm?) and you know that there is nothing inherently wrong or different about synthetic compounds.')
