Resist the temptation to look up formulas. Trying to figure out your retirement? Get out a pen and paper (and excel or something to compute with). Curious about what that headline about income inequality or infection disparities? Google the relevant stats. Those are all quantitative things you’re probably already interested in. So nurture it by trying to answer your own questions about it (which are quantitative questions). Those questions will lead to other ones that you might not know how to work with, so look that stuff up. The only thing to avoid is looking up formulas to plug in.<p>Instead in trying to learn what formula to use, look up how to derive that formula. Deriving your own formulas is a skill you can develop that will change how you think, while collecting formulas to plug things into might be useful but won’t grow you new angles and frames of mind.<p>Most of all, just practice turning intuitive things into their mathematically precise equivalents, a level of precision and unambiguity you’re probably already nurturing as a law student.')
