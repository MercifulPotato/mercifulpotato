One has to look elsewhere to understand free speech protections (if any) in other contexts.<p>[1] I have not reviewed the EFF&#x27;s complete history regarding free speech on social media. Of course, the EFF tends to opposes censorship, but I would also expect they have a history of taking more nuanced and calibrated stances on free speech outside the scope of the First Amendment.')
