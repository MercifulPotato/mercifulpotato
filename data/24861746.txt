So the people making 2.8% of the national income are really taking home more than that since they (collectively, not every individual receives all of these) are receiving snap, section 8, tanf, social security&#x2F;SSI, Medicaid, etc.<p>From a post transfer perspective, America’s tax system is firmly progressive, but less so than European countries.
