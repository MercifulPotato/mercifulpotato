It does make it so that you need to be doing very large amount of PEDs to even have a chance at winning Mr Olympia though.<p>I don’t feel qualified to remark on other sports but based on casual observation of the opinions of bodybuilding fans or even wrestling fans&#x2F;people into Hollywood, it seems most regular people are very ignorant about PED usage as a phenomenon.<p>There are limits to the rate that you can pack on muscle mass or how much you can maintain at a low body fat percentage which are telltale signs of PED use (not that I judge it, but just to temper my own expectations). I think many people’s ignorance of these signs are fueling body dysmorphia and insecurity. It’s better if people are aware of how common PED usage is in bodybuilding, Hollywood, and “instagram bodybuilders”')
