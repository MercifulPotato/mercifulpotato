Therefore making a video sharing site always draws attention, as they&#x27;ll get abused.<p>2) Along with pornography are videos that are racist, teach about bomb making, conspiracies, are anti-government.  These also draw the ire of government.<p>3) The monetary value of videos is all over the place. Most videos aren&#x27;t worth anything, except to the creator. Old films and t.v. shows aren&#x27;t really worth anything financially.  New releases do make money for companies, but fade away quickly. There are millions of films, shows, etc.\nI think this needs to be addressed.  If someone shares an old music video, how much should they really be fined? How much is it really worth? The music company would say they lost millions. A consumer would say that they can buy the song for pennies, so the song is only worth pennies. We need a justice system, and judges that can really asses the actual value of things. This is the discussion that hasn&#x27;t happened yet, but I feel is coming.')
