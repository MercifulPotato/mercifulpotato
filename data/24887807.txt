It&#x27;s hard to imagine there&#x27;s NOT a genetic component (genetics effects all the rest of the body, so why not the brain?), but given the sorry state of statistics in social sciences,the evidence may well be poor.<p>Also, Robinson is right to point out that this entire question is irrelevant to the question of equality vs equity.  The latter is simple a matter of values, after all.<p>But holy smokes, look at the contortions Robinson makes to claim that we can&#x27;t possibly know whether academic performance is limited by genetics!  It&#x27;s laughable.<p>I do like his story about Sara Slow -- I was that kid in grad school stat mech. The prof was a terrible lecturer. I got stuck on the assumption of equal a priori probabilities in phase space, and I had a hard time with the rest of the class. In fact, grad school largely destroyed my curiosity b&#x2F;c I didn&#x27;t have time to stop and chew on things like this, I just had to soldier on to the end of the course.')
