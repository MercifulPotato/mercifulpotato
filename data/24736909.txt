They don&#x27;t realize that the reason we do things is because that is how we do things.  And they put a lot of effort into rationalizing the way we do things, without realizing the subconscious psychological (rather than rational) basis for that.<p>Most people fundamentally are generally unable to question assumptions about technology or how the world works.<p>This is one reason why, even though I am rooting for the human species, I am doubtful we will be able to stay relevant for long as autonomous general machine intelligence is built and deployed.<p>Even with extensive augmentation, it&#x27;s obvious that there are just severe limitations to the human mind.<p>The nice thing is that we have the opportunity to design successors that will not be limited in so many ways.')
