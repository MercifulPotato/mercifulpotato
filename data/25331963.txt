Up to then there were still <i>some</i> scientists who denied the existence of atoms, one of the last of the famous ones: Ernst Mach: &quot;he famously declared, after an 1897 lecture by Ludwig Boltzmann at the Imperial Academy of Science in Vienna: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that atoms exist!&quot;&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ernst_Mach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ernst_Mach</a><p>Newton died in 1727. He followed however not only unscientific paths in alchemy, but also in his analysis of the ancient texts. Both reflect the time he lived and his own beliefs, which influenced these endeavors. With hindsight, we know that these investigations didn&#x27;t advance humanity&#x27;s knowledge, but are interesting for history. It can be that he even discovered something scientifically interesting while doing alchemy, but he had his reasons to try to hide that work and apparently some of these papers never survived to this day. And what survived wasn&#x27;t public until 20th century, contrary to the principles of science. But then, particle accelerator already existed.')
