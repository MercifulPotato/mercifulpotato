We got a rooster because our hens were picking on each other. That stopped once we got him. He even used to sit between the conflicting hens on the perch at night.<p>Also a good rooster will find food for the hens, and call them over to it. Ours used to find bugs and then make this cute &quot;coo coo coo&quot; and they&#x27;d come running, and eat while he watched and waited to take his turn.<p><i>sniff</i> miss our guy. I think we&#x27;ll get a new rooster in the spring, maybe a really neat looking bantam.')
