I&#x27;m a different animal than their target demo. Small is not cute to me. Smaller means I&#x27;m sacrificing something. I can sympathize with the move from USB-A to USB-C. We had to learn the same with the transition from ADB-&gt;USB and&#x2F;or SCSI-&gt;USB. The one thing I feel is inexcusable was the removal of the SD card reader.<p>What does &quot;maxed out&quot; on the battery front mean to you? Every laptop&#x2F;iDevice comes with a different battery design&#x2F;shape. Laptop batteries should be like water looking to fill every crack and cranny with more space to store electrons.')
