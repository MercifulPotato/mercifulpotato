If they can open a browser, or better, click a link at the bottom on the taskbar that opens their &quot;application&quot; then they don&#x27;t care what&#x27;s behind it.<p>Chromebooks definitely have their place... that being said, Google&#x27;s customer service leaves a lot to be desired and putting all your eggs in that basket is a risky proposition.')
