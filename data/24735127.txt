Nearly all the resources on the Internet focus on what&#x27;s popular or what&#x27;s fancy in the community these days and sometimes you just don&#x27;t want to follow a trend.<p>I wanted us to avoid the groupthink and skip the confirmation biases of our society and that meant building a resource that&#x27;s !sorted by popularity or votes&#x2F;likes.<p>The book lists all the baby girl names in the world (~70,000) alphabetically instead so one can go after just a few alphabets and find all the names that begin with that alphabet. International names are included so it is useful for new parents around the world as well.<p>How do you like it? Please do help me spread the word!')
