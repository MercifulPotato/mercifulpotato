I publicly posted my MVP on a tech forum, and a few days later a tech company filed a patent for the same thing. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s a coincidence, and that we were both working on the same thing at the same time. Had anyone experienced this before? And is it feasible someone could pull together and submit a patent in less than a week?')
