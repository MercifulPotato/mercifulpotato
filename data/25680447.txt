They got people killed and caused billions in losses for other companies. Someone that steals a car goes to jail for up to 10 years. Which person had a bigger negative impact on society?<p>&quot;Then no one would want to make decisions, other than psychopaths. No thanks. It&#x27;s unrealistic to think everyone can know the consequences of every decision they make.&quot;<p>They build aircraft that fly at 30k feet stuffed full of people. Without actual legal consequences beyond docking paychecks, it is a recipe for disaster. How exactly are we supposed to stop the literal gambling with peoples lives because of the potential for a large upside and with the only downside being that they won&#x27;t make lots of money (so, they just end up even and don&#x27;t actually lose anything). Las Vegas would go bust in a week with rules like that.')
