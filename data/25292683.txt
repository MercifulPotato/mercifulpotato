The all-core turbo for TR is 3GHz. If we assume linear scaling on M1 cores, if you dropped them in to replace the x86 cores and the had to reduce from 3.2GHz at 4w down to 2w per core, the all-core turbo would be a mere 1.6GHz AND about a third less cache per core.<p>TSMC claims 30% less power going from 7nm to 5nm. That means those x86 cores power usage drops from 2w to 1.4w. With the same linear scaling and 4w at 3.2GHz, the M1 design is now operating at 1.1GHz competing with a part that is still 3GHz and the M1 still has only 3mb of cache per core instead of 4.5mb.<p>Now, I&#x27;m betting that actual power usage is 3w which bumps frequency up to 1.5GHz. Still half the frequency, but possibly close enough in performance to Zen 3 at that frequency.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s apparently 3.45w during cinebench according to these benchmarks.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;panzer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1328715510100344833" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;panzer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1328715510100344833</a><p>I&#x27;m betting that if they didn&#x27;t bottleneck on the IO that the M1 would perhaps be faster, but at that scale, interconnects are a much, much larger issue than the cores themselves.')
