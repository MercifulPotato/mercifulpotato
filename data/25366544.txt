This isn&#x27;t a tactical debate, it&#x27;s a philosophical and foundational one.  Until we all defend the right of people we despise to voice their opinion, everything else is playing at the margin.<p>People have forgotten that it&#x27;s not just good for the people we detest, it&#x27;s good for us to be able to listen to bad ideas and form rational and compelling counterarguments and defences against them.  And since none of us is perfect, there will be times when it is _us_ that is espousing the bad idea, and it will be damn good for everyone that people are able to speak up and correct us.<p>There are indeed growing pains as the world comes online and starts being able to talk to each other.  We&#x27;re really in our adolescence as it pertains to life online.  But we&#x27;re making the most naive and expedient appraisals and supposed remedies to the discomfort its causing.
