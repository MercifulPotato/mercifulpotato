In theory there is a c99 standard but it was never adopted by MSVC so good luck with that (that is a long story on its own).<p>On the C++ side, C++ didn&#x27;t get more spec until C++11 (2011), then it took a decade to be supported by compilers. Imagine how long it takes to roll out a language&#x2F;library change when compilers themselves are on a 3+ years release schedule.<p>Either way, the C++ world is heavy on proprietary extensions and tools. There is little care about standards. The standard itself is hard to consider a standard, all it does is suggest tens of new features -some of which are impossible to implement- that may be added one by one over the decade.')
