I love NZ honey and make a point of buying a particular NZ manuka honey (arataki) when I see it, but the Australian manuka honey is not &quot;cashing in&quot; on the NZ trade, it has existed for decades and medicinal honey for tropical ulcer treatment has existed for decades in Australia.<p>The decision to award DOC classification was itself a &quot;cashing in&quot; move despite manuka being patently a semi generic term for plants found throughout Australasia.<p>It was a smart move, and I don&#x27;t fault them for seeing this as a tactic in a competitive trade market, but lets not pretend there is a substantive difference between the products here.<p>NZ manuka honey is now also riven by violent gang crime cashing in on the huge profits. Hive stealing is a thing.<p>Sugerbag, a dark runny native bees honey in Australia is worth more per kg. Designer chefs want it.')
