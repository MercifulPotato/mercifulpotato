Prior to Terraform, all CI environments had this messy step that was like &quot;create&#x2F;manage infra&quot; and it was mostly homegrown scripts that are cloud-specific.<p>Today, CI systems often have &quot;deploy&quot; which are similarly: home-grown logic that is platform-specific (kubectl for K8S, packer&#x2F;terraform for VMs, etc.). We believe the &quot;deploy&quot; step in CIs can be replaced with &quot;waypoint up&quot; or &quot;waypoint deploy&quot;.<p>The link above shows you how to do this.')
