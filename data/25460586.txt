I interviewed there recently and some of the technical details about how they store keys etc. boggled my mind.  I ended up going back to Google instead, but it was easily Google-level security.<p>And yes, the potential market for Coinbase Custody is companies like Wells, Goldman, family offices, etc. that manage money for the actual rich people.  On the application form they ask you how many millions (or billions) you have under management.  They&#x27;re clearly marketing it to hedge funds, WaAM divisions, family offices, etc that are managing institutional money.')
