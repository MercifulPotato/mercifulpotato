We can then apply tools from analysis, like bifurcation theory.<p>The “halting problem schema” has a bifurcation at the finite&#x2F;infinite boundary, which isn’t particularly uncommon for high level functions.<p>But it’s important to know, when writing proofs.<p>And generally speaking, places bifurcations <i>can</i> happen are regimes where your model is going to struggle. In the business world, knowing the “logic faults” of your model and keeping yourself in a “smooth regime” is important.')
