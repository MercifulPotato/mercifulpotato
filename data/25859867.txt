I&#x27;m not sure if its still true, but it used to be that if you were shipping any AOSP based device Google wouldn&#x27;t give you an Android license  for any of your other devices so manufacturers that were interested in serving more price sensitive markets (e.g. India) will sometimes use it across their whole product line.')
