You can even collaborate on private internal websites.<p>After you install the chrome extension, push the circle icon to open the comments for any page.<p>It&#x27;s possible to give site owners admin tools like moderation and the ability to sticky posts.<p>Feel free to send suggestions that might help you use it, and I&#x27;ll update it quickly.')
