When a car self-drives, the liability might be on the manufacturer.<p>I think this is a point that needs more emphasis, especially on the word &#x27;might&#x27;.  Without both laws and a history of court cases giving evidence for how those laws are interpreted and enforced, it isn&#x27;t possible to tell where liability may end up.  I wonder if that is part of the reason people are hesitant.  Liability is being removed from the driver, but it doesn&#x27;t see have have found a place to settle back down at, so people are viewing it as if liability is just being removed.  For initial court cases (and the amount of time and money it takes to fight them), this may not be an unrealistic expectation.')
