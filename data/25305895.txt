I did over a dozen on-sites, and every single one of them was 5 hours plus, sometimes multiple, w&#x2F; take homes or phone screens additionally.  The results were shockingly random in terms of many different factors ranging from familiarity and fluency with the class of problem, to the style of the interviewer, to the order of the interviews and how exhausted I was by the end.  The outcomes in terms of offer&#x2F;no-offer also bore little relation to my perception of how the interview went.<p>I think this doesn&#x27;t sit well with people (especially technical people) because they want things objective and fair.  However standardizing process and addressing biases only gets you so far because at the end of the day interviewers and candidates are all unique.  Success in a role is highly dependent on context that one operates in.<p>Honestly I don&#x27;t think the hand-wringing helps anyone.  At the end of the day you have to just play the game.  Hopefully companies continue to employee a variety of different interview techniques, because they all have different biases and so the best thing is just to ensure a diversity of techniques so everyone can find their place.')
