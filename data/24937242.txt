Dixon&#x27;s method [1], in particular, has had a proven running time since 1980. The number field sieve itself has had some recent progress on that front [2].<p>However, those algorithms are _probabilistic_, not _deterministic_, which is what sets this linked method apart.<p>This algorithm, much like Pollard-Strassen before it, is pretty much irrelevant to integer factorization in practice. But it is nevertheless remarkable to see some progress on deterministic factorization after such a long time.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1090&#x2F;S0025-5718-1981-0595059-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1090&#x2F;S0025-5718-1981-0595059-1</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1016&#x2F;j.jnt.2017.10.019" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1016&#x2F;j.jnt.2017.10.019</a>')
