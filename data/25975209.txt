I play from my ipad with a wireless xbox one controller. Quality is really good and I only see some stutters very rarely. I’ve played other games with the same experience. I would love to see SFV but I imagine the lag might make it a bad experience. all the games I tried were single player first&#x2F;3rd person view and lag was not noticeable, I’m assuming there’s a lot of input prediction happening, but even in menus things were instantaneous.')
