I wasn&#x27;t paying as much attention as I should have when setting up partitions during installation, and didn&#x27;t totally understand the implications of using Btrfs back then.<p>Eventually though, it filled up my entire drive with snapshots, causing me much confusion and many disk full errors until I could figure out what had happened.<p>That experience turned me off from openSUSE for several years, until I finally started using it (with a more conservative choice of Ext4) again for a few machines a couple years ago.')
