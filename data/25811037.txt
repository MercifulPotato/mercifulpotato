I’m sure there was. It’s unrealistic to think that everyone there was advocating for a violent act to happen. Unfortunately, Apple and Amazon (Amazon documenting cases of threatened murder, rape, etc. that Parler wouldn’t remove) allegedly had been requesting that Parler clean up the more extreme content which allegedly they refused to&#x2F;didn’t do. To Apple, that’s probably no different than an application being riddled in bugs and as such they don’t want it on their app store.')
