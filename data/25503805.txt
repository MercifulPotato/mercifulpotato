My family and family friends who were free love hippies in the 1960s and 1970s are Trump haters on Facebook today.<p>To give some more solid data than people in my circle of friends: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1984_United_States_presidential_election#Voter_demographics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1984_United_States_presidentia...</a> This is the demographics for the 1984 election, the one where Reagan wiped Mondale out.  Among 18-24 year voters, 39% voted for Mondale (liberal&#x2F;D); 61% voted for Reagan (conservative&#x2F;R).<p>Now, let’s fast forward to 2004, which is the first election where young people were more liberal than older generations: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2004_United_States_presidential_election#Voter_demographics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2004_United_States_presidentia...</a> Here, among 19-29 year old voters, it was 54% Kerry (D), 45% Bush (R).  It was also the last election where a Republican won the national popular vote.<p>This year, with 18-24 year old voters, it was 65% Biden, 31% Trump: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2020_United_States_presidential_election#Voter_demographics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2020_United_States_presidentia...</a><p>Point being, our youth and our society are a good deal more liberal than they were 15 or 25 years ago.')
