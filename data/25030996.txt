It&#x27;s <i>my</i> computer, it&#x27;s a developer&#x27;s sacred right to have any kind of code that acts against my interests.<p>Please read the linked reply. It was a real issue, not an hypothetical. Installing software required by my bank REALLY screwed up my computer in the past, and I didn&#x27;t really have a choice.')
