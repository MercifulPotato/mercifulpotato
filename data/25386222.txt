If I&#x27;m using it at a desk, I have to unplug the power, wait a few seconds, and then close the lid. If I close the lid and then unplug the power, the power change event seems to wake the system back up and I&#x27;ll find it hot with a dead battery in my backpack when I get to my destination. Running Ubuntu 18.04. When I finally get around to the 20.04 upgrade I&#x27;ll test it again and see if it&#x27;s fixed, but I have my doubts.')
