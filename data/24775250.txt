Always. You can resize, blur etc. and you get the expected results as if squinting, looking from a different distance etc. Works fine in RGB.<p>However, with linear color you need to cover a lot of range for decent results, so instead of using linear 16+ bits per color channel, floats or ugly 8 bits, people unevenly squished them together, making a nice representative range of intensities in 5-6 or 8 bits, which we call &quot;gamma space&quot;. Memory was very expensive and this way colors were nice.<p>We have been using 8-bit colors (24bit RGB, 8bit grayscale) for so long that most people don&#x27;t realize the difference between linear and &quot;gamma&quot; space values (I didn&#x27;t for a long time). They say colors are weird and merrily average a couple of gamma values, because it kind-of gets the job done and no one&#x27;s got time for this. It doesn&#x27;t matter if your pictures get darker and off-color each time you resize them in your typical program.<p>Working with colors properly would take more time and&#x2F;or memory, so it&#x27;s not really welcome everywhere and compatibility is a big issue. Even many artistic effects depend on these effects of gamma space &quot;calculation&quot;. Instead, we add all sorts of workarounds, e.g. font darkening and lightening, because antialiased fonts are a fraction of a pixel thinner when dark, but thicker when white, when the AA &quot;averaging&quot; is in gamma space.<p>¹ Gamma space is a properly defined transformation, but you should really treat gamma-space values as palette color.')
