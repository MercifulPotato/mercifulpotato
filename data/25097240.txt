A typical CPU can do a lot of computation per unit of time, but ends up starved because of low memory bandwidth.<p>I hope that we see either an existing fast memory technology become cheap, or a new technology arise that will bridge this gap.<p>I think modern day CPUs and GPUs remain underappreciated and not used to their full potential because of how hard it is to program around slow memoryâ€¦<p>Seriously, we don&#x27;t need esoteric new computer architectures, just give us cheap fast memory in a dumb flat memory hierarchy that is easy to program for.')
