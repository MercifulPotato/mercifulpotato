See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metric_tensor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metric_tensor</a> .<p>When you have a space that isn&#x27;t just normal globally euclidean space (such as: on the surface of a sphere), the idea of a vector as in like &quot;a direction you can go in and an amount of how much or how fast or whatever&quot; isn&#x27;t something that makes sense as something independent of a base location. Instead, each point in the space has associated with it a space of &quot;tangent vectors&quot; at that point, and these spaces are related to each other.<p>The metric tensor associates to each point a &quot;bilinear form&quot; with some properties, essentially a way of doing something like a dot product of two tangent vectors at that same point.<p>This in turn allows for defining the notion of the length of some curve through the manifold.')
