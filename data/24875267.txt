This would mean that it makes a lot more sense to invest in the economy and wait until renewable technology stops becoming cheaper&#x2F;more reliable before buying.<p>But what do we do in the meanwhile? What do we do if storage technology isn&#x27;t able to match energy demand when the sun isn&#x27;t out and the wind isn&#x27;t blowing? What do we do in areas that don&#x27;t get as much renewable energy? Many questions. Probably more than one sensible answer.<p>Renewables might not be a magic bullet. We need a plan B. Nuclear as a long term base load power source? Not as crazy as it sounds.')
