For female people <i>of any age at all</i>, that meant gang rape followed by murder.<p>Of course it was not only women who suffered and died:  failing to demonstrate peak enthusiasm for the above was itself fatal. Soviet soldiers who had been captured and somehow survived (Germans routinely starved them) were considered, exactly, deserters (because why were they alive?), and were sent directly to the gulags. Bringing up the rear during an advance got you shot in the back by the NKVD -- although there is no documentary evidence of an actual quota.')
