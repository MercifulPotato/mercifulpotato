Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[24866837, 24866895], score=None, time=1603436612, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866468, text='&gt; I have a MP4 file and a SRT file with subtitles is there a convenient way to re render the video with subtitles drawn on it so I can use it in places where subtitles are not supported?<p>You&#x27;re going to have to reencode it, which is a lossy and CPU-intensive process (unless you manage to get hardware encoding working with your video card, which is possible but very fiddly IME).<p>&gt; Is it a super cpu intensive process that takes a long time for let&#x27;s say a typical 2 hour movie?<p>There are a lot of compute&#x2F;filesize tradeoffs that you can make. If you don&#x27;t mind a file that&#x27;s 2-3x larger than your original then you can do it fairly quickly (say 1&#x2F;3 of realtime). If you don&#x27;t mind an effectively uncompressed video (so tens or hundreds of gigabytes) then you can do it as fast as your disks will write. If you want something similar to the original without sacrificing too much quality then it&#x27;ll probably be slower than realtime.')
