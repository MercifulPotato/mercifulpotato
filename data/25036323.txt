A few examples:<p>America - $900,000 investment for permanent residency (EB5)<p>Ireland - €1.0 million investment (plus €2.0 million net worth) for permanent residency for your family<p>Portugal - purchase and renovate at least €350,000 in property for residency, with an expedited path to citizenship<p>Germany -  €360,000 investment for 3 year residency with a path to citizenship after 8 years<p>UK - £2 million investment for 3 year residency with a path to citizenship after 6 years.')
