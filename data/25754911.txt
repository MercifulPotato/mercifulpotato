Xorg is itself a huge monolithic mess, but it takes all the messy bits into itself and lets you extend it with nice small programs (ex. window managers, screenshot programs, keybinding programs, whatever). Wayland is in some ways actually better because it removes the massive central mess that is the X server... but then forces every other component to deal with those things, and does so in ways that to date play badly with composability in the software (ex. now a &quot;window manager&quot; is a compositor and must do most of what the X server did before, <i>and</i> you can&#x27;t factor out things like screen capture because that functionality is restricted).')
