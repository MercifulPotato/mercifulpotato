Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[25643495], score=None, time=1609836074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25643434, text='&gt; china lied about the numbers BIG TIME<p>I&#x27;m sure they lied, but by how much could they have realistically lied? Their death numbers could 10x higher than reported and they&#x27;d still be 4x better than the US per-capita. Could they cover up 10x the bodies that have been reported? I&#x27;m highly skeptical.')
