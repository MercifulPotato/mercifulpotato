Nor would I draw my weapon without real fear for my life</i><p>Does it make you sad or disappointed you feel the need to carry a gun in your regular life just to feel safe and secure in your society?<p>I&#x27;ve lived ~20 years in Canad and ~20 in Australia. My sister has lived ~20 in Australia and ~20 in the UK. The idea we would ever, ever feel the need to carry a gun is preposterous.<p>The number of handguns either of us has seen in those countries in our life is exactly zero.<p>I&#x27;ve spent time in 55 countries around the world, including almost all of Latin America and Africa, and I have never once felt the need for a firearm.<p>The idea of living in a place where I feel the need to carry a lethal weapon is extremely hard to grasp. It&#x27;s hard for me to read your comment and not think something is very wrong with a society when regular, peaceful and intelligent citizens feel the need to carry a firearm.<p>FWIW, I own a hunting rifle here in Canada (.30&#x2F;06, Remmington 700) and I enjoy hunting very much.')
