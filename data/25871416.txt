Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611321696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25871315, text='I have way too much clothing even though I periodically give a bag or two away. The past nine months are obviously not typical but during normal times, I travel for maybe a third of the year and pack very lightly so I basically have a very compact set of travel specialty clothes. And most of the rest of the time I work from home. Plus I get a ton of swag given to me--t-shirts but also nice fleeces, jackets, etc. I do turn of it down but a lot I can&#x27;t really do so and it is nice at the time. But how much can one realistically use.<p>Just about the only thing I buy these days is underwear, socks, replacement shoes, and the odd article of either travel or outdoor-related clothing.')
