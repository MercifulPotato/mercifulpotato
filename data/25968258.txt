After said XX century event another wave of scientists arrived (or were brought) to the US, only these were &#x27;quite Aryan&#x27; but facing career oblivion in Europe due to their past political associations. One way or another, a critical mass of excellent researchers ended up in the US and became a technological asset that no other country could frankly match or even get close, solidifying its technological preeminence for the rest of the century. Obviously, this wouldn&#x27;t have been possible without generous US funding for science as well (the economy being another area where the US has dominated the XX century).<p>Also, &#x27;90%&#x27; sounds suspiciously like a number you produced from deep within your colon.')
