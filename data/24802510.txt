It depends what your goals are. Norwegian is &quot;standardised&quot;. There are official versions of the two variants that are used. The prescription has significantly affected the evolution of both variants over <i>decades</i> of gradual language reforms used to bring them closer together.<p>E.g. we used to count closer to Danish in one of the Norwegian variants - 27 used to be &quot;syv og tyve&quot; (&quot;seven and twenty&quot;), while it is now &quot;tjuesju&quot;, both altering the order and the words for twenty and seven. The Danish form was abolished in 1951. You&#x27;ll still hear people - especially older - use the Danish form now and again, but it has become relatively rare outside of small geographic areas.<p>It does however not work if you&#x27;re not prepared to deal with real-world use. E.g. &quot;syv&quot; was reintroduced as a valid (but deprecated) word for &quot;seven&quot;, because its use has remained more persistent and proved harder to eradicate.<p>Norwegian language reforms have mostly been quite pragmatic in that respect - there&#x27;s a general direction of travel, but the reforms sometimes undoes changes that proves not to &quot;take&quot;. But control over what is taught as &quot;correct&quot; in schools has proven to work quite well as a means of making these changes happen, as long as you&#x27;re patient and accept that certain types of changes are a lot easier to make happen than others.<p>It also of course matters that the changes makes sense to the users of the language. In the case of the &quot;Danish counting&quot; a lot of Norwegian dialects already used the &quot;new&quot; form, so it was a simplification, not a new\ninvention - getting people to buy into something entirely new is generally harder.')
