The authors propose that their extreme poverty is a meta-stable state that prevents them from accessing wealth-building opportunities. The authors show that time-limited wealth transfers of sufficiently large size can help these people escape the meta-stable poverty state and transition into a wealth-accumulating state.<p>However, the comments here rushing to project the conclusions on to the relatively wealthy (on a global scale) citizens of countries like the US and Europe are abusing the study’s conclusions. Similar wealth traps may exist in these countries, but the relative thresholds would be akin to a homeless person living on the streets trying to secure a job. Attempts to project these study results on to things like hiring practices at big tech companies, where anyone able to apply at all is already orders of magnitude more wealthy and privileged than the subjects of this study, are missing the point entirely.')
