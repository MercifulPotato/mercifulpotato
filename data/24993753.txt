There were local outbreaks at farms and some of these spread to nearby farms. Authorities scrambled and these farms were isolated and the mink killed. However, the spread continued to more than 200 farms, sometimes across large distances, and I still don&#x27;t think the vector is known. Some speculate that birds might be the carrier (not infected but just carrying the virus from farm to farm).<p>As the number of infected farms increased more preventive measures in the form of killing mink on nearby farms were mandated. The farmers were not happy about this and there has been negotiations about how many mink to kill and how to compensate the farmers. Mink fur is a huge export and from a pure economical (and cynical) viewpoint this is a disaster.<p>This summer it was discovered that the virus in the mink had mutated and that some people had been infected with the mutated virus which didn&#x27;t cause alarm at that time. However, the new development is that a mutation has been identified in five mink and 12 people that has a decreased sensitivity to antibodies and this might result in a vaccine not being effective against this mutation.<p>So now the discussions about how many mink to kill has stopped. They will all be killed. Sometimes you have to be decisive and the Danish prime minister was decisive today.')
