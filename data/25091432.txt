Feelings should not enter the discussion. I can assure you that capitalism never gave a shit about my feelings and I never complained about that aspect.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced the exact reverse of this: Glowing reviews of my work, but 0 funding. I still envy these people. Their situation is way better than mine.<p>The article is great. I wish more people would write such articles.')
