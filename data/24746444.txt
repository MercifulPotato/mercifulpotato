And as you&#x27;ve pointed out, their choice of maps now forces the user into Apple&#x27;s hands as the  choice of navigation, a company which I do not trust, and I certainly don&#x27;t see it as the least evil.<p>Even placing my mistrust aside, it&#x27;s once again a US-centric move; as garbage as Apple Maps is, it&#x27;s even worse outside the US.<p>The only reason for this choice that makes any sense, is that they&#x27;ve received a monetary incentive for this, and neither company has been open about it.')
