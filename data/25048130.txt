Opium wars? Boxer rebellion? I&#x27;m not chinese and I seem to know your history more than you. Why is that? And china opened up their economy as a result of threat of nuclear war by the soviets and the west.<p>&gt; in the hopes that China would also grant more freedoms to its people.<p>This is just propaganda. Since when did we care about freedom for chinese people? Did we invade hong kong while the british ruled it to give freedom to them? Heck, for most of the 20th century, chinese people like you were banned from even coming to the US. The only nationality to specifically be banned for immigration to the US was your people.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chinese_Exclusion_Act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chinese_Exclusion_Act</a><p>&gt; Now, China is also trying to expand its territory.<p>You mean take back its territory right? What non-chinese territory is china expanding to?<p>&gt; I fear that Chinese hegemonic status will have negative consequences for other Asian peoples.<p>More propaganda.<p>&gt; I hope that one day, people in China may enjoy their right to a liberal democracy.<p>More standard propaganda.<p>&gt; people in China may enjoy their right to a liberal democracy.<p>The founders hated the idea of liberal democracy. It&#x27;s why the US is not a liberal democracy but a constitutional republic. You seem to be very keen on what the US was founded for. It wasn&#x27;t for equality and it certainly wasn&#x27;t for liberal democracy.<p>It&#x27;s hard to take you seriously when you claim to be chinese and you spout anti-chinese propaganda. Not just in this comment but your other comments - &quot;false moral equivalence&quot;, &quot;US was founded on the idea of all men are created equal&quot;, etc. It would be like an iraqi claiming that the US invaded iraq to bring freedom. You sound exactly like gordon chang except I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s aspiring to be a hacker. And for an aspiring hacker you sure seem down on your state propaganda.')
