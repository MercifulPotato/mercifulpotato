Obviously the spike proteins are using an existing mechanism (ACE2) in our bodies to bind to cells. Of primary importance to both viruses and our reproductive system is the membrane fusion function for instance. We must also consider how our bodies developed in the first place; “RNA world” and “virus world” theories predict our genetics evolved from RNA-based processes or even a primordial graveyard of viral RNA.<p>We also don’t fully understand what causes autoimmune disease, but various environmental causes have been explored including bacterial and viral infections. Presumably if a viral infection could trigger an autoimmune response in certain genetically predisposed groups, then so could a vaccine designed to mimic a virus.<p>Unfortunately the incentives in our medical system are not designed to find cures for autoimmune diseases, although they are very much incentivized for palliative care, so progress has been painfully slow in understanding the deeper complexities of the immune system.')
