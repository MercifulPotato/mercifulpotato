Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601570438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24650470, text='&gt; <i>Why is that? If our ideas are good, don&#x27;t we want the most number of people to know them?</i><p>We want that. But notation is for working <i>with</i> and <i>on</i> ideas, not teaching them. You want a tool that maps well to the problem domain, that lets you efficiently operate difficult concepts by proxy of simple symbols, whose relationship maps closely to the rules governing the problem domain.<p>The task of a beginner isn&#x27;t to grasp a complex domain immediately (as that&#x27;s impossible). Their task is to gradually ingest ideas (and increasingly complex notations) until they can operate at the level of the experienced, with the tools of the experienced.<p>Demanding that a notation used for work is also easy for beginners is just handicapping the experienced, and making advanced work near-impossible. It would be like demanding that every excavator be no larger than 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 meters and be made entirely of colorful plastic, because that&#x27;s what little kids can work with.<p>The &quot;barrier&quot; that a notation creates isn&#x27;t there to keep people from crossing it. Building ramps over that barrier is a good thing to do. But the barrier has a purpose - it&#x27;s there to contain and control the forces of thought that are unleashed inside it.')
