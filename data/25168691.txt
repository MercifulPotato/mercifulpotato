Thus, divs and spans and class attributes are <i>forbidden</i> (again, in mvp.css). I am not finding fault with semantic HTML elements (I choose my own markup very carefully), but with this <i>abuse of</i> semantic HTML elements—so that the touted “semantic HTML” is actually “HTML with incorrect (or at best convoluted and dubious) semantics”.<p>If you’re wanting a lightweight starting point for rapid prototyping, &lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt; is much nicer and more obvious than sticking an &lt;aside&gt; inside… hang on, was it an &lt;article&gt; or a &lt;section&gt; that I had to put it inside to make it a card?<p>So largely I’m saying that for something targeting the space mvp.css is targeting, rabidly avoiding classes is a bizarre and pretty much indefensible choice.')
