For example, I&#x27;m pretty sure my dad can&#x27;t replace the infotainment system on his truck because it&#x27;s married to the VIN somehow and requires special programming upon replacement.<p>So even though I think it&#x27;s awesome to give people more diagnostic data, I don&#x27;t think it goes far enough if that info is along the lines of &quot;Unauthorized tires detected. Your vehicle must be serviced by an authorized repair shop.&quot;')
