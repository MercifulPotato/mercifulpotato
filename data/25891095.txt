I got this idea for a small service and hacked it out as a classic MPA over a couple of weeks in node JS.<p>Train for Treats lets you set a target for how many activities you want to complete in a month or week. If you hit it, we send out something sweet to you like a brownie or a cookie. At its core, its a service that helps people find motivation to start or maintain a fitness routine.<p>It is completely compatible with Strava. So after signing up, you can continue logging activities in Strava and get rewarded for it without needing to manually log things through yet another app. I&#x27;m currently able to serve the United Kingdom.')
