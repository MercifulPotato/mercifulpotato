Tiny microkernel, yet the system can do almost all of POSIX. Driver are in user space. File systems are in user space. Networking is in user space. It&#x27;s used widely for embedded applications, especially automotive, but since Blackberry took over and locked it down, access is expensive. Blackberry also killed off the QNX desktop environment and self-hosting. You used to build QNX on QNX.<p>L4 is even smaller, but too small. You have to run another OS on top of L4 to get anything done. QNX can run ordinary application programs. At one point there was a version of Firefox for QNX, and all of the GNU command line tools worked.')
