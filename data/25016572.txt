As late as the mid-2000s it was considered (national-level) political suicide to publicly support gay marriage. Even plenty of politicians that might otherwise have supported gay marriage refused to comment on it for fear of their seats (this happens all the time for plenty of other issues as well; e.g. how many obviously-fake churchgoers there are among politicians who hope to avoid the ire of religious voters). Once a few politicians put their necks on the line and demonstrated that it wasn&#x27;t impossible to seek election while sympathizing with homosexuality, that served as the activation energy for a lot of pent-up endorsements. So it&#x27;s been with the decriminalization of marijuana.')
