I think I know why. I&#x27;ve had some traineeship &#x2F; internship requests from French students and their mentality seems so much more like &quot;engineering&quot; career trajectory than &quot;hacker&quot;.<p>Engineer: &quot;yes, of course it is normal to be a trainee for 2 years, then a junior for 5, then a medior for 5 and of I&#x27;m really good I&#x27;ll be a senior. I would be really thankful if you consider hiring me.&quot; With this mindset you don&#x27;t expect high wages.<p>Hacker: I am a ninja rockstar, I don&#x27;t need any certifications and you should be happy if I decide to work for you because I should actually be working at FAANG.')
