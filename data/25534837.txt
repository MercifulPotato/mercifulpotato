If this weren&#x27;t the case, there wouldn&#x27;t be so many homeless people living on freeway on-ramp embankments.<p>Case in point: I remember a hackerspace had a large winter food donation barrel that was sitting out for weeks returned with 1 can in it. 1. One. That says &quot;F U&quot; to hungry people.<p>Also consider how many churches in the SF Bay Area don&#x27;t do meaningful community outreach and just show up on Sundays.<p>I just hope none of the comfortable and privileged ever end up poor and hungry, because they&#x27;d be in for a shock.')
