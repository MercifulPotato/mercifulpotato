That’s not, like, 1% or anything comparable, that’s zero (with temporary deviations). Any clock which referenced line frequency would be dead accurate over the long-term. There’s a system called Time Error Correction (TEC) which would do this (refer to WEQ-006 and the like). Obviously this error is measured relative to some reference clock.<p>I’m not sure what the current status is, but my understanding is that there are efforts to retire this system and allow the speed to drift more.')
