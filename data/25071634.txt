Either it&#x27;s wrong to call IRB&#x2F;pry a REPL, or it&#x27;s wrong to call what Clojure gives you a REPL, unsure of which one.<p>But basically there is a massive difference. Basically the Clojure REPL is not another process you type into, then you copy paste code into your editor. No, you usually write code like you do in your editor, then you can select snippets of code that gets evaluated in the REPL, in the context of your application, with all the running state already there.<p>I advice you to take a look at the link in my previous comment, which explains it better than I can, and also adds more information about why the Clojure REPL is so different, especially if you embrace it in your development workflow.<p>In case you missed it, here is the link again: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vvvvalvalval.github.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;what-makes-a-good-repl.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vvvvalvalval.github.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;what-makes-a-good-repl....</a>')
