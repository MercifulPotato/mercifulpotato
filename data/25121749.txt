You need to understand the internals to be able to use it.<p>Contrast this with &quot;black boxes&quot; where you don&#x27;t have to or even can&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on.<p>Some would argue that software shouldn&#x27;t be built that way, but I will respectfully disagree. It&#x27;s not an end user facing consumer product, it&#x27;s a tool for professionals. You wouldn&#x27;t expect anyone to operate a table saw or a milling machine without some understanding of what&#x27;s inside the machine.<p>I do agree that the git user interface is inconsistent and full of caveats. But as long as you understand it&#x27;s just a directed acyclic graph of commits, you can dig yourself out of any hole you get into.')
