Coins which do not have first mover, publicity, hash power, market cap, and capital inflow rate on their side like bitcoin does will behave entirely differently, and must justify themselves existentially.<p>Why bitcoin? because dollars suck. \nWhy altcoin? is a legitimate question, but bitcoin has flaws. Personally I like to believe that the &#x27;flip&#x27; will occur at some point to ethereum due to its technical and monetary superiority, but I think its more likely that due to the network effect, bitcoin will keep its crown as main coin.')
