In common usage, we recognise, as knowledge, various things that cannot be communicated by language, such as knowing how to ride a unicycle on a tightrope (I doubt you can learn it just from a book) and the infamous qualia which supposedly prove that the mind is dualistic. And what about the knowledge of how to use language? How does that get bootstrapped?')
