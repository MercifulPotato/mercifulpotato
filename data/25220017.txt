The issue was that it was limited, and it wasn&#x27;t a good fit for every kind of website.<p>Want to write documentation, or a personal website full of text and pictures? Maybe a simple text site for your restaurant or small business without much fluff? Then it&#x27;s alright.<p>Want to do a professional-looking site that looks like the ones you pay money for? Maybe look for something else, or at the very least start with a handcrafted template, instead of &quot;faking it&quot; with sliced images and javascript hover.<p>The reaction against Dreamweaver was IMO understandable because there were definitely some people in the industry who were convinced that Dreamweaver was enough for anything.')
