Permission is given by the government, and thus the government set the terms.<p>In the US this power relationship is the other way around. People have a default right to bear arms, and so government have to take away rights in order to enforce gun control.<p>One could easily imagine a country where driving a car would be part of a constitution, in which case a driving license would be a hot discussion. How, when and where should the government be allowed to step in and remove peoples right to do with their car property as they wish? People from other countries would look at the debate and find it a bit odd.')
