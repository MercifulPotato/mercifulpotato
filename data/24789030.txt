YouTube definitely doesn&#x27;t promote conversation of any kind. It&#x27;s a platform for consumption with essentially no standards applied to what&#x27;s on it (contrasted with TV which has at least some bar). I can&#x27;t speak on Facebook, but Twitter is also lacking in conversationality. Replies are limited in length and the way they&#x27;re displayed means that you have to go out of your way to see replies to replies. So, that&#x27;s why both YouTube and Twitter are closer to &quot;selfish media&quot;')
