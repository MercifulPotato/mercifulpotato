Nobody pays off your debt. Nobody else will look after your health if you don&#x27;t do it yourself. Nobody will come and provide you shelter when you become homeless<p>You picked some extreme examples. We are in this world together. It&#x27;s called a society. It&#x27;s unfair, it&#x27;s cruel,\nit&#x27;s skewed, but to imply everybody is completely on their own is disillusioned. Humans cooperate. Not always willingly, but effectively. This is how we prospered for millennia and occupied every corner of the globe. You&#x27;re sharing your thoughts now thanks to cooperative work by countless people who built the information age.<p>Thinking you can lift yourself up from your bootstraps and only think for yourself is ignoring how interconnected the society where you live is.<p>Pointing out extreme cases where people put a limit to their compassion doesn&#x27;t change the fact that you do owe your successes in your life also to the effort of others you have never met.')
