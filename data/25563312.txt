It was very exhausting and I was pretty down about it for several months (luckily I was employed still). Most recruiters I worked with ghosted.<p>I interviewed at one of the big companies and did not get the job, but I remembered one of the hiring managers I met during the interview process and followed up with them on LinkedIn and ended up getting another interview for a similar role and got that job.')
