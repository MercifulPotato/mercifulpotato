Additionally, on average people have not gotten all that smarter (while scammers have become more sophisticated).<p>Its all about defense in depth.  Plan for compromise, trade off the costs (nothing is free).<p>At a technical level there are basic things like: separating dev from production, requiring 2FA across the board, strong passwords, certs, separation of privileges, up to date software, secret management, etc that form strong defenses.<p>Another way to approach this is to pose scenarios and understand defenses:<p>* What information could an employee give away that would then lead to a compromise?  How do you stop it?  Password to a phisher?  Check in credentials to github?  Wire money to a fake vendor&#x2F;wrong account?<p>* If X was compromised, what is the impact?  What would it take to recover?  Where X is: dev box, production box, customer facing service, etc.<p>Two insidious scenarios that happen way too often:<p>* Latest malware distributed via legitimate sites (ad networks, sharepoint, dropbox, etc) -- Hard to prevent beyond up to date systems and content filtering.  If paranoid, all browsing through VMs or other forms isolated environments.  It won&#x27;t stop compromise, but it will restrict scope.<p>* BEC -- Attacker studies your company.  They impersonate an employee or partner (down to linkedin profiles) and convince someone to wire money.  Or worse -- account compromise of a trusted partner.  The attacker then uses this partners&#x27; account to hijack an email thread or send a &#x27;normal&#x27; request like: &quot;Our account has changed, future payments goto account YYYY.&quot;<p>Which brings us to vendors.  Can a vendors&#x27; weak security break your company?  Is it a good idea that your Microsoft Office 365 account allows unlimited password attempts (at least MS used to by default)?')
