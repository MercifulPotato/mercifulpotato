The legal minimum is 72 sq.ft per person. Dorms and shared kitchens and bathrooms can also be a solution.<p>There should be no room for thought processes that pretend that we can solve homelessness by any other means than just give people a home.<p>Just build high density villages with basic facilities so a place exists for people to take stock before figuring out their lives. Maybe they can be there till they finish education. Maybe till they recuperate from illness or use it as rehab. Or live there till they get a better job. Short lease, minimal rent. A breathing space.')
