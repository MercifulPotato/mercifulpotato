Item(by='HenryBemis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607701166, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25386671, text='&gt; seems crazy to me is how much time alone increases with age<p>Many (to a degree or another) get tired of other people. Divorces, break-ups, tired of fights for money&#x2F;inheritance, tired of people acting stupid, tired of fighting about politics, favourite teams, and many many many more.<p>I think people are getting tired of not getting &#x27;what they want&#x27; from life, a partner, their kids, society, &#x27;the system&#x27;, so they self-isolate, do the things they enjoy (nothing, fishing, watching the birds, watching tv, etc.) without having anyone telling them to get their feet of the couch, don&#x27;t eat cookies in bed, and other similar annoyances.<p>Also, depression, poverty, lifestyle, nostalgia. I was reading* that men tend to go back to their hometown and grow old&#x2F;die there, women want to stay where they are or move forward. I assume that (for the 50+) this maybe has to do with the inequality and how women suffered&#x2F;were treated badly when they were growing up in place A, 50 years ago vs living on place B, with today&#x27;s change social mechanics.<p>I can think of a dozen more reasons.. I am not a psychologist, I just started observing how the 50+ like to live, as one day we will all get there :)<p>*Addition: I tried to remember more about that book and a couple of interviews but for the life of me I cannot remember the guy&#x27;s name or face.. just his voice. He went on to explain the reason for that; in some countries&#x2F;societies, when a couple marries, it is accustomed to live to the MAN&#x27;s hometown, and in some other countries&#x2F;societies they go to live to the WOMAN&#x27;s hometown. So there could be the chance that they are not &#x27;very&#x27; happy, they spend a life oppressed, and towards the end of their lives (and especially if the couple drifts apart -post empty nest, or one passes away) they want to go back to the place they grew up, which was not tarnished by &#x27;hurtful memories&#x27; and they only have fond memories. Somewhere where they &#x27;always belonged&#x27; either if they have not been there for 20-40 years. They will return and find their old friends.')
