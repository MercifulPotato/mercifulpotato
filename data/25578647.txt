The nearest decent place to backpack is a 7 hour drive North, and it&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s the Midwest, not the mountains. For mountains, the last time I went backpacking in the Sierra, it took me about 24 hours and a taxi, an airplaine, a bus, another bus, an uber, and one more bus to get to the trailhead.  That&#x27;s why for me, getting to Bishop, not so bad.')
