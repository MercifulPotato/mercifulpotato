A tool so people can easily find how to say someone&#x27;s name, sneak on what someone does in the company etc.<p>I almost got a big school hooked up to start paying subscription (it is an international school) but they decided on creating their own solution due to privacy concerns. Extremely disappointing and lowers morale straight away.<p>I have few hundred profiles but the growth is stale atm. I don&#x27;t really have time to actively look for new users and would love a co-founder as what they say on y-combinator it is REALLY a lot easier if you have someone you can share thought and can both motivate each other. So my advice is add a step and get a co-founder.')
