Also contains numerous examples of tank and vehicle columns as well as fixed emplacements exploding.<p>I think we&#x27;re there. As of 2020, and in particular the Nagarno-Karabakh war it&#x27;s clear that having more drones than the other side is the key. Number of troops, tanks and gun emplacements isn&#x27;t as relevant anymore. Mid-sized drones such as the Harop drone trump all of those.')
