That&#x27;s about what happens when you use videochat in important meetings. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the way people used to have meetings.<p>Some will claim it is to read body language --&gt; Don&#x27;t depend on body language and stop assuming things from audio alone. We&#x27;re adults. People will tell you when something is up.<p>The only argument I can&#x27;t go against is bonding. But if you don&#x27;t want to bond with your team past business-only, that argument is voided.<p>And I haven&#x27;t named the cons yet. One of my pet peeves being people will start calling you over every single thing, make you repeat yourself often, misunderstand or even forget what was said in 10 minutes.
