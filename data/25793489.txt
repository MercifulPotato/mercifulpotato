I definitely don&#x27;t want to have 100GB+ games on my disk, 150MB+ Electron based messaging apps, Docker images with 1GB+ node_modules&#x2F; folders, or even worse, Docker images with 600MB+ of binaries (looking at Terraform and it&#x27;s plugins.)<p>However, I care even more about having apps&#x2F;tools that help me achieve the desired goals, in an easy, clear, and elegant way.<p>If having bigger apps means that developers have more time to implement or improve features, and solve bugs, I&#x27;m all for it.')
