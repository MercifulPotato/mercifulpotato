There&#x27;s more doubts and paradox of choice at every level. Add to this the fact that most people have only access to &#x27;some&#x27; information .. they&#x27;re not informed about some principles (like the paradox of choice) and will not be able to filter or integrate that much thus react on wrong information.<p>The old system was foggy and absolute truth was surely impossible but it feels structurally more sound to me.')
