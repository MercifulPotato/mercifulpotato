For us, the only thing that determines if we work or not is the weather. Maybe the only advantage I have noticed is that the parts dealership is open an hour later if we have a breakdown. However, we&#x27;re also not yet done for the year and won&#x27;t be before we go back to standard time, so that falls apart for our late season work anyway.<p>Further, if the UK is anything like my country, only ~2% of the population are farmers, so even if they did all object the 98% wouldn&#x27;t care and move forward anyway.')
