Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=[25088918, 25086083], score=None, time=1605290084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25082255, text='&gt; Perhaps it is considered more of a commodity now?<p>It is and it should be. What the white beards all too often forget is the fact that the generation before them would say the exact same thing about them (lack of enthusiasm, lack of interest and knowledge, etc.).<p>This is a story as old as time:<p>&gt; The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households.<p>attributed to Socrates (469â€“399 B.C.)<p>How many 80s kids were into HAM radio or <i>actually</i> building computers (Ben Eater-style: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;BenEater&#x2F;videos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;BenEater&#x2F;videos</a> ) instead of toying with micros or basically playing Lego with PC components? Same difference.<p>Today&#x27;s computers have reached a level of tight integration and complexity that simply cannot be grasped by a single individual anymore.<p>People keep whining about that when it comes to computers but happily accept the very same thing in other commodities like cars, clothes(!), highly processed food(!), hygiene and cleaning products (soaps, hair gels, rinsing agents, ...), utility grids, etc.<p>It&#x27;s hard to get young people enthusiastic about glue or forging metals, even though both are essential to our daily lives - often in ways we don&#x27;t even realise. Same deal, no whining from metallurgists or chemists.')
