Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610925882, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25816060, text='&gt; <i>If you’re just giving it away as a free disposal service, then sure it doesn’t matter.</i><p>For my wife and me it&#x27;s not just free disposal (I can handle my free disposal by going downstairs and dumping it by the side of the trash container). It&#x27;s about ensuring a working item doesn&#x27;t get trashed, but will continue being useful for someone else.<p>In all my wife&#x27;s giveaways, there&#x27;s one or two people out there who are regular, repeat &quot;customers&quot;. But we can&#x27;t tell whether they&#x27;re hoarders, or whether they just happen to need all the stuff they get from us, or whether they pass that stuff on to their family and friends. Or hell, maybe they resell it. Doesn&#x27;t matter, as long as we&#x27;re somewhat confident someone will make use of it - because that&#x27;s someone who saved their money, and that&#x27;s one less item being bought.')
