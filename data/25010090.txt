The kind of thing I assume inspired Elixir in the first place (although in general I like Erlang as a language, it’s small enough and my complaints are few - it just feels syntactically quirky sometimes).<p>But I never felt inspired to use Dialyzer largely for these reasons. Never seemed to “fit” the syntax entirely and made it quite ugly IMO.<p>Which is why I’m happy to see these modern attempts, they look much better.<p>Good luck with the project. It should be an excellent learning process regardless.')
