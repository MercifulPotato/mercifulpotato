Did the thought that &quot;surely, there must be a better way to do this!&quot; really not cross the minds of these interns? Of course, Word has a feature for this exact purpose.<p>Interns get paid by the hour. Work expands so as to consume the time available for its completion. Consider that after completing this task, there may be more work to do that is less pleasant, so stalling makes sense. Consider that this work, dull as it may seem, is actually somewhat enjoyable as a social activity.')
