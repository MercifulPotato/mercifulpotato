Like, everyone that uses Go for an extended period eventually complains about how it&#x27;s an error to import a module and not use it... until they enable goimports-on-save and then the problem vanishes (mostly).  (My point is not to compare go&#x2F;rust module systems but to illuminate how a pain point introduced by the language&#x27;s guarantees can be eliminated by tooling.)<p>If there is such an easy to define 1:1 mapping, then could there be a rustmods-on-save tool that automatically adds mod statements according to a fixed scheme whenever any *.rs file is created in the current directory or a child directory?')
