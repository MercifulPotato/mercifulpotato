So, some additional startup boom will not happen because one other issue, parallel with Brexit and pandemic UK government decided to kill (predominantly) IT contacting by creating some changes to IR35 law (basically increasing taxes significantly to that specific group).<p>All those combine will have strong impact on UK, I live in London, and finance is probably 80% of how UK makes money. Most of the goods are imported, we do not produce anything (I am exaggerating but not far from truth). \nJust to remind, people voted pro Brexit because of a red bus with a large text saying that each week £350 million goes to EU (which was wrong but hey...) that is £18.2 bn a year. Meaning Morgan Stanley is shifting permanently, with one swift move, 6.5 years ... and heaven know about how many jobs... All that also have combined effect as each person working there feeds many others (builders, bakers, creditors...)<p>&quot;Remain&quot; side was warning about all this, but unfortunately, people have not listened.')
