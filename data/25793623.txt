Shallow acquaintances are usually just to make an impression and there are no pre-conceived notions so it&#x27;s easier to be more comfortable having a quick interaction with someone you&#x27;ll never see again.  Maybe because it feels fresh and there isn&#x27;t any baggage.<p>I didn&#x27;t particularly like the ex-girlfriends responses regarding him because I think speaking ill of the dead is lame when they aren&#x27;t there to give their side of the story.  Also, it sounded like she has issues of her own - which for someone who is already suffering with mental illness, trying to care for another person who also has mental illness is just a fool&#x27;s errand.  But often time these sort of relationships happen where there is so much negativity but due to illness both parties continue with it despite that.')
