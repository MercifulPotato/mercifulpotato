Flutter uses Dart, whereas React Native and Native Script rely on JavaScript. Answering the question of hybrid vs native is out of the scope of this roadmap.<p>I would learn &#x27;normal&#x27; Android development with Java (or Kotlin) for sample apps, but quickly switch to Flutter&#x2F;Dart where the app doesn&#x27;t specifically have requirements that preclude its use.
