They said salary is &quot;your worth to the company&quot; -- meaning, the amount of money they&#x27;re willing to part with to have you, or to keep you from working elsewhere (your &quot;worth&quot; to them).<p>I think you took it to mean actual calculated dollar-value driven-by-the-eng worth. Even thinking about that, your example is wrong because it ignores expected value (EV) of a project which takes into account risk. For example, if your theoretical project has a 10% chance of generating $5mm&#x2F;yr and a 90% of completely failing, the EV of the project is $500k&#x2F;yr - so it&#x27;s totally worth it to pay an eng $100k&#x2F;yr to work on it, even if it fails.')
