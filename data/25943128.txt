But I know many people who&#x27;ve succeeded that way.  I&#x27;ve known a number of successful academics (like Galbraith),  but I met them in grad school or after they were successful.<p>2000+ years before Marx the greeks talked about &quot;class&quot; as being networks of families that gravitate to towards certain family wells and that is alive and well today.')
