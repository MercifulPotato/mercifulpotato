Hellman&#x27;s idea actually predates the terrible Microsoft cryptosystems which are famously vulnerable to it, because too many software engineers don&#x27;t realise Computer Science and thus Mathematics are applicable to their work whether they like it or not.<p>Oechslin improved on Hellman&#x27;s idea to make &quot;Rainbow Tables&quot; by sightly perturbing the reduction function with the depth, so that collisions are fleeting unless they also coincidentally happen in the same position on a hash chain, this makes his Rainbow Table far more efficient&#x2F; reliable for the same pre-computation effort and it produces the &quot;rainbow&quot; picture in his slide deck.<p>For my purpose Oechslin&#x27;s improvement was irrelevant of course because I actually wanted collisions.<p>But memory fades, it is possible either that I got lucky, that I actually had 16GB of RAM, or that I made some minor efficiency improvements that were enough to make it work.')
