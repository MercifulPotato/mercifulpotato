I have heard this line all too often to encourage people spend more money.  In this case it is not “a bit more”. But a whole lot more.<p>Pricing needs to be brought to levels of sanity. The reason we are seeing ridiculous prices like these is because millennials don’t pay attention to prices or there is way too much credit in the market or because the gap between rich and poor is getting larger and larger.<p>I understand the whole paying more for something that works better.
