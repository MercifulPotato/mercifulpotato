Hard to believe those odds are credible even 24 hours out from the event at the velocity these objects were traveling.<p>1 in 23 billion are fantastically long odds - roughly 8 sigma. What would the confidence intervals on direction, speed, and drag measurements have to be to put the possibility of a collision during an expected 70 meter flyby at relative velocity of 50,000 kph that far out?<p>How exactly predictable even is drag at that altitude on space junk which probably doesnâ€™t have attitude control?<p>For example, I think LeoLabs 1 sigma confidence interval was +&#x2F;- 18 meters, but they had calculated them crossing at 25 meters apart.')
