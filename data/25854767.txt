To evict a &quot;no-fault&quot; tenant in San Francisco, it must be done in a court and the tenant gets financial recompense (and like Japan, wanting to sell the unit is not a valid reason to evict). I&#x27;d argue that San Francisco tenant protection laws are stronger than Japan&#x27;s. Likewise, going off [2], in Google translate, a Japanese landlord can increase your rent as long as they are increasing it to &quot;market rate.&quot;')
