Similarly, you do not need to be a security expert to recognize that 15 months of active undetected infiltration demonstrates a nearly comical inadequacy. To provide real material mitigation you would likely need to be in the hour to day range at most to actually stop a double-digit percentage of value-weighted exfiltration. This even ignores the cases where they just want to damage your systems which would generally only take minutes.<p>Now maybe nobody can do that, maybe these systems are the best available, but even if that is true that does not suddenly make them adequate. Adequacy is an objective evaluation of reaching a standard, if nobody can reach the standard, then nobody is adequate. We would not let somebody use a new untested material in a bridge if it can not support the bridge just because &quot;nobody knows how to make a bridge that works with the new material&quot;. And, by any reasonable metric, an inability to recognize active infiltration for months indicates that against a threat actor similar to what attacked them, they are about as adequate as a piece of paper against a gun.')
