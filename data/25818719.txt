Most of it exists at the intro and outro to chapters. I think it&#x27;s important to consider <i>how</i> they are meant to be used. More than many other books, the <i>Schemer</i> books come across as a dialog with the reader, not just a block of text to read and incorporate (somehow) into your mind. (Of course, this is deliberate and discussed in the books themselves.)<p>Things like the &quot;space reserved for jelly stains&quot; are meant as break points for readers. It&#x27;s not intended (unless you&#x27;re already advanced to the point the book has little new to tell you) for readers to go straight through. Just like we don&#x27;t take college course lectures and run through them in a week (16 weeks, 3 hours&#x2F;week, 48 total hours, approximately).<p>Doing that would be overwhelming, just like reading one of these books straight through. And it eliminates the time needed to let information and ideas properly integrate into your mind. It&#x27;s the difference between a cram course and a chance to actually learn.')
