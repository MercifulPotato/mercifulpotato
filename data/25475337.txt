Combine them with a large fixed credit (i.e. UBI) and you can make them as progressive as you want, by increasing the size of the credit, despite having a uniform marginal rate.<p>Also realize that the status quo, counting benefits phase outs as marginal taxes (which they are), is <i>more</i> regressive than a flat tax, because lower income people pay higher marginal rates.')
