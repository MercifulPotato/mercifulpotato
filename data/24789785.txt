It&#x27;s easier than coming up with new regulations specifically around open source funding.<p>Billions of dollars are spent each year by the federal government on custom software development anyways. And on the whole, they end up spending about what big tech companies do for engineers (but not getting the same level of quality) Forcing the contractors to be more open will probably keep them more honest and make them write less shitty code.')
