So here we&#x27;re seeing -- from one day to another -- people complaining that Robinhood and other financial intermediaries won&#x27;t let unsophisticated traders easily access particular kinds of financial trades and products, and also that complicated terms may apply to those same trades and products. Couldn&#x27;t these two issues be related?<p>(I don&#x27;t mean to accuse people of hypocrisy by mentioning this!
