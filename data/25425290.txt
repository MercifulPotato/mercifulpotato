I&#x27;ve been using gmail since the early days.<p>Gmail has been &quot;fine&quot; for my needs, but now that I think about it, the filter and label dialogs have always been a pain in the ass. They&#x27;ve been more or less the same since the beginning, one would think that Google would freshen this stuff up-- but no. Moreover, gmail has become more aggressive about &quot;categorizing&quot; stuff on my behalf.<p>Will check it out. I think a key thing for me will be stability and the ability to transition my shit to another provider if needed.')
