A couple of people complained continuously about headaches and sickness and blamed it on the tower. One quit. This was entirely related to their borderline alcoholism and terrible diet rather than the phone tower but failing to see the causality is a typical human trait. How do we know? Well when they were putting the tower up they managed to damage the roof which caused all work to stop before it was even powered up. At that point the insurance companies were duking it out.<p>Also Iâ€™m an amateur radio operator and ex RF engineer. I spent a number of years working in fairly high energy RF installations in the defence sector and not once did I see a reported problem from someone in the field.<p>I suspect you need to check your causality before being hooked on solutions which are usually sold by a combination of con artists and morons. This is one step from burning 5G towers on the thought spectrum.')
