(He thinks voters would converge on laws like in France or Germany, allowing abortion up to 12 weeks with limited exemptions after that.)<p>He supported Bush (and thought Gore tried to steal the 2000 election) and the Iraq war initially. He soured on it later and reeled at Bush’s deficits and fiscal excess, and Bush’s support for the federal marriage amendment. He supported Ron Paul for the Republican primary. He hates Hilary Clinton but begrudgingly supported her against Trump. He is very much against the rise of critical theory and wokeness: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andrewsullivan.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-roots-of-wokeness" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andrewsullivan.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-roots-of-wokeness</a>. On LGBT issues, he thinks “the war has been won” after Gorsuch’s decision in Bostock: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;when-is-it-time-to-claim-victory-in-the-gay-rights-struggle.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;when-is-it-time-to-c...</a>. In particular, he opposes the Equality Act’s attempts to eliminate religious freedom exemptions.<p>Circling back to the point: this is why a quarter of gay people identify as Republican (though Trump has been very unpopular). Most people have heterodox political views and don’t fit neatly into any particular camp. And the parties shift over time to capture different blocs so folks who aren’t strong partisans can find themselves shifting around. There’s plenty of people who would support the party of Biden over the party of Trump, but the party of Marco Rubio over the party of Bernie Sanders.')
