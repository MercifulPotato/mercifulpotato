They&#x27;re being gamed. That&#x27;s fine for things like Stack Overflow or finding the background of a person. But it&#x27;s not good for finding a place to eat, a book to read, health advice, a specific game genre, or the best tom yum recipe. Google subsidiearies like YouTube and Google Play do a really poor job at this, and Google isn&#x27;t much better.<p>I think what might work better is an unweighted filter. A google style search engine filters out all tom yum recipes below a certain quality or all health sites below a certain credibility level. And then it tosses you a random one. Google tries to make a one size fits all engine, so it&#x27;s doing very poorly in many of these. But Bing&#x2F;DDG isn&#x27;t faring much better. Stack Overflow and wikis are basically just search engine plugins')
