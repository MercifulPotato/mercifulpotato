My time machine is on the fritz. That said, it is true that I would have been happy to buy a Zen 4 laptop. It is also true that they were not available.<p>The laptop I ended up buying comes in a Ryzen 5 4500U flavor as well as a Tiger Lake i5-1135G7 flavor. I would have preferred the AMD-powered device but it was not available from my preferred retailer and sold out from the manufacturer, so I ended up going with the Intel version.<p>Thanks for the explanation. I didn&#x27;t realize that the leading number didn&#x27;t denote generation.')
