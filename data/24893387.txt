Even free return trajectories can require a secondary burn. So in many situations throwing your engines away is not a great idea.<p>An NTR can be designed such that the engine and spacecraft &quot;chassis&quot; are reusable over multiple missions. NASA has&#x2F;has an NTR concept with such a reusable vehicle. The fuel tanks are disposable and slot into the central frame like AA batteries. The crew portion would be a TransHab-like habitation module with a docked crew capsule and Mars lander. Propellant tanks would be disposed of during the mission and the vehicle parked in Earth orbit between missions. For a new mission propellant tanks would be fitted along with a new crew and off it goes. It&#x27;s an interesting design but a little passed the current bleeding edge of in-orbit construction.')
