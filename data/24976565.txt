I read the other comments here, but they weren’t helpful for me.<p>I understand technology, I understand the concepts of public key cryptography, I think I understand what DKIM is used for (verification that the specific domain’s server did send a specific email because it’s signed, which can be verified by the receiving party using the key published in the DNS record)...yet I found this article to be terse (along with the short Twitter thread initiated by Matthew Green).<p>Is the author just building plausible deniability by publishing the keys? Would this even truly stand up as believable for any scenario? And why is Matthew Green suggesting this?<p>Thank you very much!')
