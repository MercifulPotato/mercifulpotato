Justin and I are the creators of Taste (Yes! That movie recommendation app)...we spent our entire COVID time developing this shopping version of the Taste appâ€”it was a beast to figure out how to catalog &amp; organized millions of products...much much harder than movies &amp; tv shows I&#x27;ll tell ya!<p>Give it a spin, but it&#x27;s the same idea: swipe &amp; rate the things you like and we match you with more items that you&#x27;ll like. The algorithm is still based on collaborative. So obviously, the more users&#x2F;swipes we get, the better everyone&#x27;s rex will be.<p>Hopefully this makes online shopping a little more fun and cuts down the hustle of have to go from store to store to look for things.')
