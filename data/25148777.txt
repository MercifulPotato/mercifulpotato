I got a free battery replacement on my Macbook Pro after 3 years of having it because the battery was unusable.<p>After going into the Apple store, they said that the battery was a &quot;consumable part&quot; and therefore not covered by the warranty. However, when I asked what the part number was and how I could order a replacement myself, they said that the batteries weren&#x27;t serviceable and even they had to replace the keyboard unit as that contained the battery and it was all glued together.<p>I pointed out that they&#x27;ve therefore designed this product to fail after a few years as you can&#x27;t order replacement batteries as a consumer, and they agreed to replace it for free.')
