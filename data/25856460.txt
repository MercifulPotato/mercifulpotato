I wont be the last to ask this question, so they should really document this so that people don&#x27;t need to pull up pinout lists and compare them to answer this kind of obvious question.<p>If they are compatible, they should release either a version with all 40 pins on the same side, or an adapter PCB this can be soldered onto. A big part of what makes a RPi boards so useful is the ecosystem of HATs ands Shields that are compatible with the 40 pin header of the Raspberry Pi.')
