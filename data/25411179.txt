Gold has a derivative value in the faith that it will be accepted as a default currency, but also an intrinsic component borne of the relative scarcity as well as material properties having some use.<p>I may not understand what youâ€™re specifically asking. Intrinsic value is fairly straightforward. A company may have some amount of material worth (machines, intellectual property etc.). The balance of that equity minus their debt is the intrinsic value. After selling all that property and paying off the debt whatever left is the intrinsic value. Similarly, melting down a metal and selling it as a commodity gives the intrinsic value of a currency. A borderline intrinsic value would be a currency that has very little commodity value when divorced from its derivative value (e.g., the paper stock has only a limited marginal value and essential no intrinsic value). Some commodities get most of their worth from intrinsic value (milk, pork-bellies get value from the fact the are <i>food</i>) where fiat currencies has disproportionate derivative value.')
