I just type code :)<p>From my understanding, the SPAC goes public (with an S1) with the intent to acquire &quot;some company&quot;. Then the company being acquired doesn&#x27;t have to file an S1. I would guess that the SPAC&#x27;s S1 is going to be a lot less complicated, as it&#x27;s a do-nothing holding company set up to acquire some TBD company.')
