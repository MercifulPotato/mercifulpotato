One of them made enough money to tour the world non stop, and currently lives a digital nomad esque lifestyle, and the other one had to get a job after his channel couldn&#x27;t support a lifestyle in rural China.<p>Generally, the more you rely on YouTube for your income, the higher your stats will need to be to live full time off your work. Whereas if you&#x27;ve got money from Patreon, merchandise, etc... then things don&#x27;t need to be as extreme.<p>So someone in the former group will likely need about 200K subscribers and hundreds of thousands of views per video on YouTube, whereas one in the latter could get away with a 30-50K channel and far less views per video.<p>The topic obviously matters too. Gaming content is hell to monetise, whereas financial or business related content seems to have much better ad rates and what not.<p>If Neil Patel was a gaming blogger, he&#x27;d be maybe one tenth as rich.')
