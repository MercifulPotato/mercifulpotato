My local supermarkets have baggers today and you&#x27;re literally not allowed to bag yourself.<p>I don&#x27;t see there being anything irrational about not wanting to pay the price for certain services. And I don&#x27;t expect either individuals or companies to sell me things on terms that aren&#x27;t attractive to them. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> those things even if I accept that I can&#x27;t have them on terms acceptable to both myself and the person providing them.')
