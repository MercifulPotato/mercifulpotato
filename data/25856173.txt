In that particular case, it was just a pragmatic decision, since I needed an emergency USB stick that would work in whatever PC was handy, but no commercial motivation.  But even that obscure distro arguably contributed to discarding leverage, at least in principle.  And a couple years ago I compromised on drivers for GPU computing, but maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have had to, had some before me wielded leverage better.)')
