You have industrially cooked food, mostly through automated process, in supermarkets, sold as &quot;prepared food&quot;. and actually, many cheap restaurants will have several microwaved prepared food in their menu items.<p>Everyone agrees these products are inferior in quality to the comparable manually produced offerings.<p>&gt; Automatic driving is a very easy task in roads and cities that are designed for it. Instrument all bus lines with ground wires, put a radio beacon on each crossing and sign, a front radar&#x2F;lidar to detect obstacles and 90s tech is enough to automate a whole city. If it was desired, we would already be there.<p>It&#x27;s not that easy to redesign an entire city to accommodate a second transportation network. A lot of buildings would have to be modified. Its probably better to approach this task incrementally using the existing road system.<p>&gt; It would be interesting to make a Turing test for cooking. I am sure that there are many robot-made meals that are undistinguishable from chef&#x27;s preparation.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a cooking Turing test as well because I disagree with you and this is in fact testable, one of us is mistaken.')
