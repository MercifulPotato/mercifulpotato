They aren&#x27;t selling anything- it&#x27;s a feature which people can use if they like.<p>The server implementation for sync is mostly compatible with Chromium and can be used without Brave. Someone could clone <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brave&#x2F;go-sync" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brave&#x2F;go-sync</a> and stand up their own server. It would require some patches on top of Chromium (similar to what is done in Brave) to implement the authentication - but once that is done, all of the Chromium tools like chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;sync-internals work just fine')
