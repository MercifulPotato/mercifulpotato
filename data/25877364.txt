I&#x27;ve had a simple model in mind for a while:<p><pre><code>  conflict resolution\n          &#x2F;\\\n         &#x2F;  \\\n   violent   \\\n             &#x2F;\\\n            &#x2F;  \\\n   commercial   \\\n               political\n</code></pre>\nThis makes sense to me, but I get the feeling very few other people see &quot;politics&quot; this way.')
