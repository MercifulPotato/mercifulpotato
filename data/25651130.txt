They&#x27;re a Christian organization. &quot;Service&quot; is also a part of their mission, that means having people physically work for&#x2F;with the needy (and not just give money).<p>Moreover, much of their work is done domestically where construction labor is NOT cheap. Yes, some things are going to be shoddy, but it&#x27;s really hard to get a house built and renovated for low cost in the USA. There are challenges not only in finding labor but also general contractors and materials.<p>Could all the &quot;building of houses&quot; be done more efficiently if Habitat for Humanity was all just finance and management operations? Perhaps, but the service aspect would be missing.')
