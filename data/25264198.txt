So that&#x27;s an example that&#x27;s clearly not leasing or subletting the devices.<p>Likewise, you might read it that Circle is simply providing a service to users, and the users are paying a fee for the service.<p>But a CI service will set up your dev account, your container image, to run your jobs. It&#x27;ll even let you shell in, and it tears it all down when you&#x27;re done.<p>And it really starts to look like leasing when they also charge for time used on various hosts. (IIRC, Circle charges for this a bit obliquely as max parallelism.)<p>If it went to court, Circle might argue the hosts can only be used within their larger CI system, that they don&#x27;t guarantee a particular task will complete on a given host, and that they&#x27;re not providing other requirements for virtual hosts, e.g. dedicated routing or names. And then Apple&#x27;s lawyers might counter all that.<p>So this is where I think lawyers would start digging through case law to figure out where providing a service ends and leasing begins.')
