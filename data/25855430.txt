But there&#x27;s just only so many shortcuts I&#x27;m capable of memorizing. This is not a problem for me exclusive to vim, of course. In IntelliJ I also sometimes find an amazing new function that I then don&#x27;t keep using since I&#x27;ve already exhausted my limited &quot;inclination&quot; of learning new shortcuts. Also, I don&#x27;t think my productivity gains at this point are going to come from faster input anyway. Sorry, vim, it&#x27;s not you, it&#x27;s me.')
