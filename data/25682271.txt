Item(by='ChrisLomont', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610088925, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25679474, text='Colleges have of tens thousands of people doing a quite limited number of things - mostly classes and teaching, with some support staff or service easily placed around campus. It&#x27;s easy to plan for that. I&#x27;d guess most campuses in the US can easily be walked across multiple times a day. I went to Purdue, W. Lafayette, about 40K students, and didn&#x27;t need a car. One could walk between classes and dorms and food trivially.<p>Cities of hundreds of thousands to millions of people have easily thousands and thousands of varying jobs, different size and scale employers, a huge range of skilled and unskilled labor, a vast array of specialists and specialty employers, and even several entire campuses - a massive amount of different requirements. It&#x27;s not reasonable to expect everyone to have employment within close range, so immediately people need cars to commute. It&#x27;s not reasonable to put some large employers evenly mixed with housing - no one wants the garbage facility or any of a host of companies next door. Many companies also have huge inflow&#x2F;outflow requirements like trains, shipping, power, waste, again complicating the picture, since people need to travel larger distances to reach them. Zoning laws didn&#x27;t just pop up to prevent campus living everywhere - they popped up to solve the issues that occur when living and industry was co-mingled.<p>So while I&#x27;d love to have all of life be as serene and pretty as a top university, I also prefer to have specialized jobs and places to do such work, and I don&#x27;t see how these can possibly be merged.')
