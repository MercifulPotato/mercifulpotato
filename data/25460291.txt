The problem that must be &quot;explained away&quot; -- according to the article -- is not a particular flaw of a specific project, but the observation that OSS is not, in general, technically better.<p>TFA states that OSS, by claiming it&#x27;s technically superior, must defend itself when it&#x27;s not superior. On the other hand, FSS must not defend against technical flaws or limitations because it doesn&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s technically superior, only that it respects user freedoms better.')
