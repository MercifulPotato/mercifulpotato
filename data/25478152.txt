I think the issue here came from the PR strategy of CD Projekt Red, they were getting some negative coverage and they came out and told everyone to just ask for a refund if they were unhappy.  It seems like Sony didn&#x27;t want to do that at first and with the shitstorm that it created, they decided great get a refund and we&#x27;ll just remove the game from our store.  Everyone loses.<p>I think a better strategy would have been saying, &quot;We hear you and we are working hard on it, we&#x27;re confident we can get this experience in great shape soon.  If anyone is considering buying now, please understand that the current version is a buggy and you might want to consider waiting.&quot;  Instead they made promises of refunds they couldn&#x27;t afford, hurt their distribution partners and might have created a death spiral for the game and their studio.  How miserable it must be to be an employee who worked so hard on this game.<p>My brother is pretty upset that he didn&#x27;t buy it in time and when I tried to let him play on mine over shareplay, it doesn&#x27;t let him because &quot;the game is not released in our region&quot; (the US).')
