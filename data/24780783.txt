It might be helpful, but that would be more accidental than deliberate.<p>The hiring pipeline setup is probably similar for other tech roles, but I cannot vouch for anything else. I&#x27;ve had a technical program manager and a tech writer tell me it helped them somewhat. Two product managers read the beta, but when I reached out to ask if they found it helpful, I never heard back: so I assume it was not that useful for them.<p>What I would assume applies to other tech roles as well is this:\n- Try to get a referral, where you can. This will 10x your chances of progressing from the resume screen.\n- Use a clear format that hiring managers can scan easily.\n- Aim to tell a story with your resume. This is your sales pitch.\n- Be specific and use numbers, where you can. Talk about the impact you made and the business results you enabled.\n- Tailor your resume to the job description if you cold apply, over sending the same one, over and over again.')
