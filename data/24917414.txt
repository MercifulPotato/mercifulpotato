I honestly can&#x27;t shake the feeling that a not insignificant part of Apple considers the future of the Mac as the place you go to run multiple iPad apps and because of that the technology Sketch is built with will eventually be discontinued within 10 years.<p>Not to mention, they&#x27;ve had 4 years since Figma&#x27;s launch to know they need a collaboration feature shipped, it&#x27;s been &quot;Coming Soon&quot; for years now. I actually presumed they were just doing a full webtech rewrite but judging from this it&#x27;s just that writing those kind of features into a native app is a gigantic task.<p>Really a professional tool in 2020 that doesn&#x27;t have Google Docs style collaboration is a broken tool, it&#x27;s very difficult to work with remote workers without having presence within the documents.')
