Most independent restaurants fail, I don&#x27;t recall the exact stats off the top of my head but very very few last &gt;5 years and the majority fail within the first year (this was before DD or any similar services) and yes maybe tech pressures have exacerbated that, but I&#x27;m not sure the stats on that are conclusive.<p>Anecdotally apps are how I and a lot of people I know have come to discover or order from many independent restaurants for the first time. Even with a 25% cut, without knowing the exact numbers of how many new customers these services introduce, its not that easy to say that big tech boogey monsters are destroying independent restaurants, especially since its a fairly risky venture to start with.')
