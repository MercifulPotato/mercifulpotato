I can think about my job for a certain amount of time and then my productivity plummets, I can read for pleasure for a certain amount of time before I get antsy and my mind drifts, and so on. There&#x27;s no &quot;cure&quot; for this because humans are intrinsically capable of stepping outside of the system and imagining what <i>else</i> we could be doing at a given moment; getting in the zone is a way to quiet this line of thinking, but humans have a specific amount of &quot;zone&quot; in them and that&#x27;s it.')
