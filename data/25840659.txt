Didn&#x27;t help.<p>2. It&#x27;s very hard to do casual check-in with another person.I feel like I&#x27;m bothering them too much. I can&#x27;t get over it. Too stressful. Was way easier in person. Just feel the room and interrupt as needed.<p>3. I wake up early, take my pre-workout or red bull or 5h energy but just stare at the screen for 4 hours between 8 and noon and can&#x27;t start.<p>4. I love the product but I can&#x27;t start working wihtout others around me.<p>5. I hired multiple therapists. They put me on meds. I took medical leave. Nothing helped.<p>For me, work is for work and home is for home or for &quot;work on autopilot&quot;')
