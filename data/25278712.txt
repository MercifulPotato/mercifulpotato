Finding answers inevitably lead to more questions that I had answered in the first place.<p>I don&#x27;t know that we will get to the point that will stop being true, or how many lifetimes it would take a single person to understand it all. It certainly feels like we are past 1 already.<p>[Edit-] My comment originally focused more on natural sciences in general, but then I changed the opening quip to the personal anecdote about programming. The last paragraph, however, was geared more towards science, and knowledge in general, not programming languages per se.')
