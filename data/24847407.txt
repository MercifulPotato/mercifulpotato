Both have been in contact with other survivors who&#x27;ve reported the same thing.<p>Now obviously this is just a single data point (or two depending on how you see it), and I am no medical professional, but I have no doubt what they&#x27;re experiencing is real and a direct result of COVID. If we assume there are others, even if it is just a small percentage of the people who recover, then we&#x27;re still going to end up with a shitload of people who will live with a multitude of issues that will make life very difficult. And the worst case is we don&#x27;t know how much more is to come.')
