That will create confusion (thinking of all the for types of loops in JS!), plus it&#x27;s still not an enum and cases will be missed.<p>And the worst being the attribute #[] syntax... why?! Almost every other language uses @attribute, and it is successful: simple to write, easy to read, why on earth a new and such complicated solution?<p>While php is making progress step by step, it has no chance of ever becoming of good reputation if it goes all the way to make itself more crazy.')
