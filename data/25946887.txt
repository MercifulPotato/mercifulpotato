It tells what is the company doing well, and what things does the interviewer value. I have got various answers here.<p>- Some people say they like the autonomy given to them<p>- Some like the work enviornment<p>- Some like the technical challenges<p>- Some care about the impact the company is making<p>- Some like the money (not a bad thing, honestly)<p>For each answer you can ask for follow ups and examples. If they give a fluff answer like &quot;I like the fast paced enviornment&quot;, its a red flag. If they have difficulty answering the question, its a red flag.<p>2. &quot;What happens when something goes wrong?&quot;<p>This is to know how the organization handles failure, also if you ask examples it tells you what does the organization defines as failure. Ideally you want an organization which has a no blame culture and which handles failures gracefully. Also this is the place you want to ask about on-calls.')
