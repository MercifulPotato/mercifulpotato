I don&#x27;t understand why people bother working for free to e.g. run Linux or even write a GPU driver? I get this is a nice developer challenge, and being involved with Apple stuff is still being seen as &quot;cool&quot;, but why don&#x27;t those developers actually support some truly open source projects instead of helping filthy rich company for nothing?')
