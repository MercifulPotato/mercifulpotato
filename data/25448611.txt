There are snippets of this kind of speculation from many decades ago, plus of course there&#x27;s sci-fi to look at, and it&#x27;s amazing how much further we&#x27;ve advanced than most people expect.<p>If you look at where we are now vs. 100 years ago, our technology would be utterly unrecognizable to them. When people of that age predicted the future, they didn&#x27;t do great. I&#x27;d like to think we have better foresight, but the reality is we&#x27;d probably be just as bad at predicting what things will be like in 100 years.<p>The thing that amazes me is the exponential nature of human progress. Even if we made linear progress - that is, some &quot;equal&quot; amount of advancement in the next hundred years as we did in the last, that would be incredible. But of course our progress builds on itself, and so if we assign a value of 100 to the amount of progress in the last hundred years, we&#x27;re likely to have a 200, 300 or 400 over the next hundred years.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m betting on pretty much all computer interfaces being directly connected to the brain and people living off of earth permanently.')
