Firstly because, as stated in the article, Chrome is far worse than all the other alternatives. Secondly, because Chrome has a near monopoly (at least of mindshare - it is hard to guess real numbers because Chrome happily reports its use to Analytics, and FF does not, which means FF always is under-represented) and contributing to them supports that, and third because there are other tricks they have like hiding URL data (and sometimes not letting users know they are on an AMP page instead of the real one).<p>Ungoogled-chromium may solve some of these issues, but it adds new ones. Last I tried, it&#x27;s update mechanism was non existent, which is the opposite of the other&#x27;s auto-update. And it encourages Google&#x27;s eco-system monopoly. And of course, it inherits Google&#x27;s terrible (from a security perspective) app marketplace.<p>All the other browsers are missing features to the point of not being contenders.<p>So, I think that in real terms, the best we can encourage is fixing FF with the changes he states plus plugins, and evangelize that.')
