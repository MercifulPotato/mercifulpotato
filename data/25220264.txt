How is this acceptable for a utility that will mostly do some simple text-mangling?<p>- Mozilla is the birthplace of Rust. Why do I have to install Node to get a pretty simple utility like this? This should be a basic Rust executable you can just drop anywhere, no installation required.<p>- the very first line of `npm install web-ext` is a warning that some library is obsolete and should not be used. It&#x27;s promptly followed by tons of similar ones. Again, how is this acceptable in 2020 for something so basic?<p>In the end I just dropped it.<p>Web-ext is not doing machine-learning billion-pageview-crunching rocket-launching stuff. It&#x27;s a utility to roll up a few text files. The fact that it was built with Node seems yet another sign that Mozilla is dominated by SFBA cargo-cultism.')
