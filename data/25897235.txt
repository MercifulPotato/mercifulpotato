In fact comparing the two frankly, the GPU is the only thing that lets the 2014 machine down.<p>Now I personally know that Intel’s CPU performance broadly hasn’t increased very much per core in that time. Your average customer is not likely to know this - but that they can see a significant difference in basic usage is very interesting.')
