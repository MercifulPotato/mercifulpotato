They&#x27;ve thrown away the benefits of a incredible wiki-based platform<p>Ideally, you want to cater to both the CLI centric workflows of developers&#x2F;build-systems and the WebUI centric workflows of everyone else (the old system). The Mozilla blog posts mention the JAMStack so I&#x27;m guessing that the intent was to port the server-side Django apps&#x2F;editors to a browser-side framework like React or one of its alternatives.<p>If the design and implementation of the new platform was perfectly executed then only the new functionality would be apparent; both systems are essentially &quot;wiki-based&quot;. Platform transitions are rarely seamless as your lost content&#x2F;metadata clearly shows.')
