Subreddits are usually in their own bubbles (which has its benefits, but may be boring in the long run), and Twitter doesnâ€™t allow for any long-form discussion. HN is for the most part centrist, but the standard deviation is big enough that everyone would have some people to agree and some people to argue with.')
