After their vimtutor hour, no student asked me how to edit git commits.<p>I know it might seem lazy (it is), but when there&#x27;s a teacher better than you, don&#x27;t teach it yourself, delegate. I happily delegate to vimtutor. Miss or mister vimtutor, you&#x27;re a better teacher at vim than I will ever be.')
