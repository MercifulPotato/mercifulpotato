Item(by='jancsika', descendants=None, kids=[25065899], score=None, time=1605149455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25065322, text='Unlike a slider, a GUI knob&#x27;s visual feedback and skeuomorphic comfort comes at the cost of ergonomic interactivity.<p>The whole point of physical knobs is to leverage a person&#x27;s thumb and forefinger (or tennis muscle if it&#x27;s a huge knob) to twist precisely and efficiently to a desired position. With the two most popular digital input devices that torque doesn&#x27;t exist-- you can&#x27;t &quot;twist&quot; a mouse or tweak a touchscreen to change the position of a knob.<p>At least in most of the audio GUIs I&#x27;ve seen that use knobs, the author seems to have no idea that their skeuomorphic interface actually degrades interactivity. E.g., if they had simply used a slider the user could swipe their finger efficiently to quickly change several sliders in a row.<p>Even worse-- with a knob you have a similar &quot;90-degree ambiguity&quot; problem as with touchpad scrolling. Do you use dx, dy, or some other algo to choose the relationship between touch&#x2F;drag and knob rotation?<p>Even worst, some devs try to &quot;bring the torque back&quot; by coupling the knob movement to the distance of the mouse from the center of the knob. I really wish someone would feed this awful behavior back into the physical world, and ship a mixing board with knobs that only update their value if you twist them using an included set of &quot;knob tongs&quot; :)')
