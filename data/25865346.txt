AWS charges a big premium for Elasticsearch and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d drop their prices to try to squeeze Elastic - for one, it would be unlikely to even work - but even so it&#x27;s always best to differentiate on being the better quality&#x2F;&quot;value&quot; than the lowest cost.<p>Having used AWS Elasticsearch, it has a lot of deep problems with it in its current state so Elastic can compete on value just fine.<p>In other news, I think the Elastic licensing change beyond being ethically a dick move (legally it&#x27;s their right), is just horrible business strategy. I said on this site several days ago that Amazon was just going to make an Apache 2.0 fork and keep chugging along, and that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re seeing.')
