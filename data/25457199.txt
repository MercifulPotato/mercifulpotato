So yes, radiation levels rose inside the primary cooling system. This is what triggered the automatic emergency shutdown. But the primary cooling system is anyway 100% isolated from the environment.<p>In particular, no change of radiation levels whatsoever outside the reactor building was ever detected. But initial reports did not make this quite clear.')
