You would need to adopt an extremely high standard for prosecution, similar to libelâ€”no suing someone for being wrong, or having a strange belief, or saying something that&#x27;s misleading but has a shred of truth.<p>But, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for society that I can create a fake website purporting to be a way to vote online, and send it to members of an opposing political party to suppress their vote. If I know that I&#x27;m lying, there should be laws against that.<p>If we don&#x27;t do anything, our problems are going to get so much worse as deep fakes improve and doctored footage becomes indistinguishable from reality.')
