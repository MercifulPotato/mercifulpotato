So the Perl programs I’ve been writing all include this as part of their arg-parsing loop:<p><pre><code>  pod2usage(-verbose =&gt; 1) if &#x2F;^(-h|--help)$&#x2F;;\n  pod2usage(-verbose =&gt; 2) if &#x2F;^--man$&#x2F;;\n</code></pre>\nThat second line is all it takes to produce a manpage too. Then it’s just a matter of writing the POD documentation for it.<p>It is admittedly a little unusual to consume a manpage by typing `someprog --man` instead of typing `man someprog`, but it’s very convenient for self-contained scripts.')
