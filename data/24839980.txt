I&#x27;ve been using KDE Neon as my daily driver for a few months now and it&#x27;s amazing. Connects to my android device to share notifications and clipboard content, is heavily customizable and themeable, the whole OS feels very snappy and uniform in terms of UI&#x2F;UX, and installing alongside Win10 and macOS in a hackintosh setup with full LUKS disk encryption was a snap through the installer GUI. Absolute 10 out of 10.')
