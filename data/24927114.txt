That curiosity never left me. I&#x27;m very sure that&#x27;s true of many if not most people, in both the arts and sciences.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a personal thing, but I suspect strong curiosity inborn in most of us. We all had to learn a very complex language after all.  Necessity may keep many from feeding it --cultural factors may also discourage it -- a crappy educational environment may foster cynicism - then maybe it goes away if it isn&#x27;t nurtured. A lot of (well-known human) educational researchers came to similar conclusions.<p>If a study of brain circuits in rodents finds otherwise, well, rodents aren&#x27;t human.')
