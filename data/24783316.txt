Social media and recommendation algorithms are a truly new thing. We&#x27;re just starting to understand how they intersect with society. Mass media has to be widely palatable to spread. The flat earth society would struggle to pay to run national newspaper let alone a TV station, but you can find hours of &quot;quality&quot; flat earth videos on the intent. We now have systems that can pick out for you exactly the group that agrees with you. Where before you&#x27;d only get exposed to the opinions of your surrounding community now, it&#x27;s easy to find that there are thousands of people who agree with the little bits of racism that you subscribe to.<p>I think I agree that this article shouldn&#x27;t have been blocked partially because it don&#x27;t fit perfectly into this distinction<p>Bonus second reason why people might feel differently. People know and treat the NY Post as suspect. People like me don&#x27;t read it. Probably some advertisers won&#x27;t touch it, but I do use Twitter and FB. Most people do.
