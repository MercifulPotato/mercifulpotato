Then do the estimate, high if you don&#x27;t want to do it, low if you do want to do it.<p>Any kind of reality doesn&#x27;t factor into it.<p>In the Word example, somebody really thought this project was worthwhile for some reason, so they gave a very low estimate to get things started. As soon as money has been spent on a project, it isn&#x27;t likely to be cancelled as easily, so you are safe to continue even if you exceed your original estimate. In the worst case, you need a few excuses.<p>External estimates, i.e. estimates you use for writing up a contract with an external customer, are different. Those actually do matter, depending on the wording of the contract. But a smart contractor will try to get the contract into a shape such that the above for the internal estimate does apply.')
