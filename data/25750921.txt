The US should be in a state of emergency now, and it&#x27;s obvious to me that it&#x27;s solely because a white supremacist has replaced the civilian leadership of our government with those complicit in this act.<p>You&#x27;re free to ignore what has happened, or believe in an alternate reality. Some of us would be guilty of violating our oaths were we to do the same.')
