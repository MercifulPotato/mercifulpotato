One which I&#x27;m quite disappointed to see companies just caving to, through little insertions of ridiculous practices like these.<p>Having everyone declare their gender is a little bit ridiculous, just to serve the desires of a ~1% group who are trying to gain more recognition.   I am frankly surprised how people are willing to distort their behavior when they refuse to do so for other groups who are far more downtrampled in their rights in greater percentages.  I suppose somehow transsexual people just became popular for some reason.<p>Frankly, it&#x27;s a symbol and problem of the modern liberal&#x2F;democratic mind (at least at the party-level) that these problems rise to the level of national and corporate attention -- and apparently we solved all our other material needs and have time to spend on this in comparison.')
