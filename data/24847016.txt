Item(by='jabl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603282581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24846100, text='&gt; The worst part of centrally planned economies is that they are prescriptive and essentially authoritarian in nature. If they make mistakes then nothing prevents them from repeating the same mistake. There is no threat of the central planner being replaced.<p>From reading the book synopsis (again, I haven&#x27;t read the book itself), it seems the authors are proposing some kind of democratic socialism rather than USSR-style authoritarianism. Is it workable? I have no idea. To me it seems that USSR-style authoritarianism and current Western neoliberal capitalism are but two small dots on the political economy spectrum. There are other ways of organizing society as well; certainly worth thought experiments to see what kind of other options there might be and what we might learn from them.')
