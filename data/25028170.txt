If just ion generation is enough to reduce viral load so effectively, then that is a big boost to reducing indoor transmission rates (effectively reducing R0), and would be comparatively cost effective next to HEPA filtering large spaces (think: a Costco warehouse).<p>———<p>ION TECHNOLOGY<p>MORE IONS, MORE DISINFECTION<p>Clean Air System’s certified ozone-free ionizers generate tens of thousands of ions per second, safely eliminating airborne and surface pathogens and resulting in fresher, cleaner conditions. The ionizers’ precise integration allows for maximum ion production and delivery throughout your space.<p>DISTRIBUTED BY AIRFLOW<p>Our fans’ airflow amplifies not only the number of ions that are generated but also their effective coverage areas. Aside from disinfecting air and surfaces, our fans’ airflow improves occupant comfort, HVAC efficiency, and energy savings, providing real benefits for business owners.<p>KILL VIRUSES WHERE PEOPLE BREATHE<p>An ion’s lifetime is only about 30 seconds, so it’s essential that ions be delivered to the air your people breathe and the surfaces that they touch. Rather than concealing ionizers within ductwork, Big Ass Fans integrates ionizers into our fans to distribute ions directly to your people.')
