If I need programmers, and I&#x27;m only willing to pay minimum wage, then only one or two show up, is there a programmer shortage? There&#x27;s plenty of programmers available, just not at minimum wage. The same applies to the school district example. The shortage is <i>because</i> they&#x27;re not willing to raise wages.')
