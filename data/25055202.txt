I think it&#x27;s just that we grew up with the internet, and although we haven&#x27;t &#x27;seen it all,&#x27; we&#x27;ve picked the low-hanging fruit.<p>When I was a kid, the first time I walked into a video store, it blew my mind. I spent every weekend for <i>years</i> binge-watching 3, 4, 5 rented movies. Now, I haven&#x27;t actually watched a movie in years. I think that although there are new movies coming out, the patterns are fundamentally the same and so movies have gotten boring. After you&#x27;ve seen Apocalypse Now, Evil Dead, and Blade Runner, the Wire, Caddyshack, Oldboy, No Country, Night of the Living Dead, Y Tu Mama Tambien, and on-and-on-and-on, you&#x27;ve seen damn near most of the plot variations that can conceivably be constructed. So, new stuff just looks the same as the old stuff and it&#x27;s not so exciting.<p>Same with the internet. I discovered 90% of what I still think is cool by the time I was 13. I picked the low-hanging fruit. So, now I&#x27;m at the point where I go deep on things. It&#x27;s not sexy, but it is pretty rewarding. Used to think Magic-1 was awesome, well now Ben Eater&#x27;s 8-bit-kit is half-assembled on a table in my living room. Used to think rock climbing was cool, but now I have to put in weekend after weekend at JTree moving over granite. Used to think Fravia was cool, well now it&#x27;s time to construct my own web-crawlers. Used to think metalcasting and the Lindsay Catalog was fascinating, but now it&#x27;s time to build <i>actual</i> internal combustion engines from scratch. Used to listen to the old Defcon DVDs on a pre-iPod mp3 player, but the time came to <i>actually</i> work through Erickson&#x27;s AOE.<p>I think it&#x27;s a natural evolution of life. When you&#x27;re young you make a shallow pass and find what really resonates with you. When you get older, you spend more time digging down deep into those things and it&#x27;s not as <i>exciting</i> as it once was, but there is a satisfaction from getting good at those things.<p>An alternate approach is to try viewing the internet through the lens of cannabis. I&#x27;ve had many nights in life where smoking some pot and watching YouTube has segued into a late-night coding session implementing something fun in Python that&#x27;s been kicking around in the back of my head for a while. Pot has a way of helping you see things you&#x27;ve seen a million times in a completely new light. Some people love it, some people hate it. YMMV.<p>Most people seem to hit this point in life and just have kids to keep stuff interesting when things start to get boring. They take up a lot of time, teach you a lot of stuff, and suck up a <i>ton</i> of time.')
