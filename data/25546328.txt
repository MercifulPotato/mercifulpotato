It&#x27;s assuming to be as convenient as gasoline</i><p>And it won&#x27;t be. H2 is terrible for convenience of handling compared to gasoline. Handling liquid H2 is a nonstarter, it liquefies at 21 K at atmospheric pressure; cryogenics like that are not convenient at all. Gaseous H2 will escape through every tiny gap in whatever containment setup you choose, plus it&#x27;s highly flammable, much easier to ignite inadvertently than gasoline.<p>And to top it all off, at the end of the day, its available chemical energy per unit mass is only two to three times that of liquid hydrocarbons. That&#x27;s simply not enough of an advantage to overcome all the downsides.<p>What H2 <i>can</i> be used for is to <i>make</i> liquid hydrocarbons, through various chemical processes.')
