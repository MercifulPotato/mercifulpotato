What happened at the Capitol was serious. So was what happened over the summer. But over the summer I heard nothing by &quot;mostly peaceful protests&quot; as literally billions of dollars of damage was caused and numerous deaths were racked up. Captiol protesters break some windows and I hear nothing but &quot;violent rioting insurrectionists&quot;.<p>Back during the summer, Trump being secured in a shelter because of the riot security risk was LAUGHED at by the left. They accused him of being a coward for being taken to a bunker due to the risk of BLM protesters who burned a church across from the White House. Where&#x27;s the same media laughing at the Congressional representatives fleeing from the people they&#x27;re supposed to represent?')
