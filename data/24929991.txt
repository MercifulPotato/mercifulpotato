Go look up on CBC &quot;about-our-social-experiment&quot; where they got caught red handed trying to push that all Canadians are white supremacists. Or how about CBC articles that are in Urdu saying Canadians are adopting and killing Indian&#x2F;Pakistani children. If you try to use google translate or bing translate it will fail. Or how about the endless &#x27;parents&#x27; articles about how it&#x27;s sexual assault if you don&#x27;t have consent to hug your own 5 year old child. How about &#x27;dear white people&#x27; where the CBC clearly says that racism against white people is impossible.')
