What&#x27;s amazing is that Indian classical music has no key. There is no absolute sense of middle C or whatever. It is relative to the tuning of the drone. I don&#x27;t have a strong background in music, but this seems to get rid of the complexity of the notation system in the west with a much more fluid aspects - pick a note and make it the root. Off you go. That&#x27;s the key you&#x27;re in.<p>Furthermore, I find the construction of these musical scales (correct me if I am wrong but there is no analog in western classical music of what a raga is) very interesting. Going up in the scale is different than going down and there are some key phrases that identify a raga. Then its all about interpretation.<p>Is there any specific tabla percussion associated with a Raga?<p>Some of my favorites:<p>- Raga Bhimapalasi: Beautiful lazy afternoon raga.<p>- Raga Tilak Kamod: I would describe this raga as a playful and less serious, very romantic.<p>- Raga Bhairav: Intense and great for early mornings. For reflective, pensive moods.<p>- Raga Desh: Festive feel to it.<p>I personally like vocal renditions of ragas. Spotify has a large selection.')
