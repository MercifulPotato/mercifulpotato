A few comments:<p>- I am not a Bay worker, I don&#x27;t even live in the US, I never had a pay like an average SV engineer and I am not even an employee right now. This blog post was not written with the intention to help myself, but others.<p>- Anyone can find any flaws in any argumentation, but that is not the point. I wrote this because I thought if it only helps a single person to motivate them to fight for a better pay, then it is worth it. If someone doesn&#x27;t stand up for their own pay then it doesn&#x27;t make other employees better off. The alternative is that some big corporation just managed to exploit the general public in yet another way. My blog may not help everyone, but if it does for some I consider it a success.<p>Thanks for sharing and your inputs though!')
