Really, we&#x27;re arguing about how the logical&#x2F;rational part of the brain can emulate the other capabilities of the brain, which seems less interesting than the more general question of how to build <i>any</i> machine that can do that.<p>Consider BEAM robotics:<p>&gt; BEAM robotics (from biology, electronics, aesthetics and mechanics) is a style of robotics that primarily uses simple analogue circuits, such as comparators, instead of a microprocessor in order to produce an unusually simple design. While not as flexible as microprocessor based robotics, BEAM robotics can be robust and efficient in performing the task for which it was designed.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BEAM_robotics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BEAM_robotics</a><p>&gt; ...computers can imitate all of human thought (not just one kind of it), since humans are physical beings.<p>Leaving aside the metaphysical questions it raises, we may well be able to build virtual humans someday by emulation of physics of the biology of the neurology of the psychology of people.  It just might not be the most efficient way to do it, eh?')
