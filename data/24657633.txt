It sounds great and it is great for as long as you keep and enjoy that same job. Once you move into the boonies, company knows they have leverage on you. You can no longer ragequit on Thursday and start at a new place with a better salary next Monday. You&#x27;ll be forced to hold on to this job even if it turns sour. Or what if there are layoffs.<p>Then you&#x27;re stuck in the boonies with no other employment choices other than compete for other remote jobs at a much reduced salary now.<p>Moving back to the Bay Area is very difficult if you sold the house when moving out.<p>TL;DR: Only move for personal reasons, not for company incentives.')
