But CentOS was just RHEL with the branding removed, I&#x27;m not sure it was that much of a headache to maintain.<p>IMO CentOS was kind of a bait to get people into the tent, and then if they needed help once using it across all of their infra they would eventually have to migrate to RHEL w&#x2F; enterprise support.<p>Also what confuses me here, is that they claim CentOS Stream is going to be the cutting-edge distro for RHEL... however Fedora already serves that purpose.')
