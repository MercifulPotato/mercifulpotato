Item(by='nicbou', descendants=None, kids=[25823012], score=None, time=1610985347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25822645, text='Public ISSUES are important, because they measure the need for a feature. An important issue will generate more noise, and that indicates a lot of people struggle with it. &quot;Me too&quot; is a valuable metric, as is additional reproduction information from other users. User requirements are not final, so the answers to it should not be.<p>On the other hand, stale TICKETS make it difficult to get an overview of the project and its priorities. Actually important issues can get lost in a sea of wishes. You can&#x27;t have the team vote on the priority of 400+ tickets with no description, no justification, and no owner. Those tickets just sink to the bottom of the backlog, never to be seen again. On occasion, they&#x27;re actually important, but hard to notice amid the 400 other tickets.<p>I always liked Kanban, because the to-do column is sorted. You can only sort a list by going through every item.<p>When I was the agile whip, I always pushed for separate &quot;triage&quot; and &quot;to do&quot; tickets. The former is a bucket of wishes and stream-of-consciousness tickets. The latter is for tasks we understand and commit to. Our backlog refinement sessions cleaned the triage column, then sorted the to do column.')
