As a designer&#x2F;dev the library is definitely addressing a hole in the market where libraries like fabric.js and konva aren’t serving: customer support (esp enterprise) and feature requests.<p>Coming from Teespring and recently at Figma, I’ve seen both sides of this problem: home rolling a teeshirt maker in canvas and also trying to use parts of an editor at Figma for marketing (wasn’t decoupled enough). I’m excited to see where this team takes this and grows.')
