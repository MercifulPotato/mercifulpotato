I&#x27;m a black guy with a Ghanaian name, so I laughed out loud reading the comment.<p>It&#x27;s not like black people aren&#x27;t allowed to have &quot;euro-centric&quot; names, but, surprise surprise, Caucasians represent a large majority of people with those names<p>Likewise there are names that almost no Caucasians have (like mine)<p>If someone is reading your resume intent on being biased, a name like &quot;Austin Walters&quot; is going to appear as... a white guy.<p>There black guys named Austin Walters but they&#x27;re also not conducting a census... if someone really wants to discriminate against you based on race, your name is plenty to go on.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mynamestats.com&#x2F;First-Names&#x2F;A&#x2F;AU&#x2F;AUSTIN&#x2F;chart-distribution-by-race.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mynamestats.com&#x2F;First-Names&#x2F;A&#x2F;AU&#x2F;AUSTIN&#x2F;chart-di...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mynamestats.com&#x2F;Last-Names&#x2F;W&#x2F;WA&#x2F;WALTERS&#x2F;chart-distribution-by-race.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mynamestats.com&#x2F;Last-Names&#x2F;W&#x2F;WA&#x2F;WALTERS&#x2F;chart-di...</a><p>Again, they&#x27;re not conducting a science study, an 80% chance is plenty for the kind of person trying to discriminate...<p>Likewise, someone who reads my name, which uses consonants in a way that English doesn&#x27;t usually ( causing people to mispronounce my very simple last name even when reading it verbatim) will <i>instantly</i> assume I&#x27;m black.<p>It&#x27;s something I accept as a person with a very black name, it tells you the main audience of HN is this is really such a revelation for some of you lol')
