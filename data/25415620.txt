If you want to be able to actually work in software development then whether you&#x27;re going to a bootcamp or a university there&#x27;s going to be ton of extra-curricular learning and practice that you need.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with quite a lot of fresh university graduates over my career and you can tell which ones have actually practised beyond doing the required coursework, because they understand to some degree how software is developed professionally. The ones who didn&#x27;t do further learning can certainly write code to some degree, and would completely demolish me in some sort of competitive algorithm contest, but they&#x27;re going to stumble on things like using git and automated testing. They&#x27;re also going to have trouble taking requirements and working out what to do with them.<p>Bootcamp graduates tend to be somewhat the other way round, they get the professional side of things, but struggle with the actual software development because they have a shallow knowledge of each element.')
