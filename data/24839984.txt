However, it&#x27;s true that we do remove individual rooms from the server if they break the server&#x27;s T&amp;Cs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;policies&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;terms_and_conditions.md#6-play-nice-clauses" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;policies&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;matri...</a>) - but that&#x27;s completely different to unilaterally blocking other servers or shutting down rooms based on the pattern of their name(!), which we don&#x27;t (so far, at least).<p>There&#x27;s a whole bunch of conspiracy theories that we do block servers though - but ironically this tends to be due to federation problems (often the remote server hasn&#x27;t tuned its rate limits, and so as its users get more active, busier servers trying to talk to it get rate limited.  matrix.org is one of the busiest servers, therefore the first symptoms of the problem are that it looks like matrix.org is explicitly blocking the server.  comedy, eh?).<p>However, if folks want to believe the conspiracy theory instead, we&#x27;re not going to shed too many tears.')
