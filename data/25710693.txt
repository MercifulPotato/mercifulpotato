There is also a distinct Western and English cultural bias in how articles describe and frame other countries, other cultures, and other religions.<p>The problem is real as I&#x27;ve mentioned elsewhere, but it&#x27;s overwhelmingly a <i>sourcing</i> problem. There simply aren&#x27;t many sources about non-Western or traditionalist (as opposed to modern&#x2F;progressive) worldviews.')
