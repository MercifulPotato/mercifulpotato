The senators are simply urging YouTube to exercise their freedom of speech to run fact-checked, non-crackpot videos on their platform. Why do you want to force YouTube to carry videos of bizarre conspiracy theorists on their (private) platform?<p>If the Senators <i>ordered</i> YouTube (or indeed, Fox News) to suppress specific videos, that would indeed be taking away free speech.')
