The ~35% of gross salary employer side social security contribution comes on top of this, so is not included.<p>- ~53.5% taxation. This includes national and local tax, but excludes regional tax.<p>Note that from about the top tax bracket, you receive no extra health, unemployment or pension rights in return:<p>- Health care is universal.<p>- Unemployment compensation is not limited in time. It has recently become degressive with time though, and it&#x27;s capped at a relatively low maximum.<p>- Pensions are repartition based as opposed to individual capitalisation based, meaning current employees pay for current pensioners. They&#x27;re also capped at a fairly low maximum.')
