I think we have a mechanism to eliminate irrelevant inputs, focus on what is important and then we have the abstractisation and generalization tools.  Then we can reuse same modules in our mind to play RTS games that are more complex then chess.<p>Anyway do you disagree that ANN are just a search&#x2F;function approximation ?  Or you think that when you played an RTS for first time the brain already had itself trained from genetics or previous experienced playing in the sand and you could win on the easy difficulty level without any training on millions of games.')
