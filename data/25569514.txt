Here&#x27;s a bit of feedback &#x2F; thoughts I&#x27;m having related to a similar project, Archivy [0].<p>The problem I have with these type of solutions is basically the time it takes to just quickly bookmark. Browsers bookmarks are built-in, and do this pretty well - it&#x27;s just one button next to the search bar.<p>Solutions like these are a bit more limited as they aren&#x27;t embedded into your browser UI, so you have to open a new website and paste the link in. This mere effort adds a layer of complexity which can kind of turn the user off to bookmarking.<p>I wonder how this issue can be solved, in my project and yours... Maybe browser extensions can provide a more native experience with less &quot;content to bookmark&quot; time spent.<p>Sync is another way to kind of counteract this -&gt; people use normal browser bookmarks or whatever they prefer - and then there are options to sync them to your software for better organization &#x2F; whatever your functionality is.<p>However, hand-coding all of these integrations is difficult and that&#x27;s why building a framework of plugins [1] so users can work and distribute these integrations themselves, is in my opinion, essential.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archivy.github.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archivy.github.io</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archivy.github.io&#x2F;plugins" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archivy.github.io&#x2F;plugins</a>')
