Conspiracy theories were fringe and didn&#x27;t have a way to spread.<p>Today more than half the population believes in conspiracy theories because they learn the &quot;truth&quot; from disreputable sources on social media. This is dangerous for society.<p>I am glad social media companies are taking action themselves, instead of the government forcing them (which would be a 1st amendment issue).')
