It&#x27;s just not the way we wanted it to ideally manifest as a species.<p>We want to believe that the revolution should be altruistic in nature. Bettering the human race through only &quot;positive&quot; methods - Star Trek style utopia if you will.<p>But reality shows that even with all this available computing power, it&#x27;s still a finite resource.
