I seem to go through an endless cycle of having either too many or too few. I prefer to spend most of my day-to-day alone, but I feel very lonely when I don&#x27;t have enough local friends to reliably find a social event on friday&#x2F;saturday nights. on the flip side, having too many friends quickly becomes stressful. I don&#x27;t know how to gracefully handle the situation where I get invited to do more things in a week than I have the social energy for. sometimes it gets to the point where just replying to all the invitations saps most of my social &quot;budget&quot; for that week. I end up doing a lot of stuff that I don&#x27;t really want to do just to avoid declining someone&#x27;s invitations over and over. eventually, I semi-intentionally let friendships fizzle out and forgo forging new ones (since I am still in the &quot;excess&quot; mindset). then I am back to square one and the cycle restarts.<p>I think there is a sort of critical mass effect with friends. when I only have one or two, I have to try really hard to make a third. once I hit a certain number of friends with overlapping circles of their own, it&#x27;s easy to make new friends whenever I want. but then it starts snowballing fast and suddenly I find myself in a deluge of messages and invitations that I don&#x27;t want. I&#x27;d love to be able to hover in that sweet spot, but I don&#x27;t know how to make that happen.')
