And somewhere in between, a gray area.<p>- mussels&#x2F;mollusks (zero sentience)\n- insects (very low demonstrated consciousness)\n- fish (low demonstrated consciousness)\n- chickens&#x2F;reptiles (disputed level)\n- dogs, dolphins, primates, etc (high)<p>You can&#x27;t equivocate chicken sentience with human sentience. What you can do is suggest they have a high enough level of sentience to warrant that certain treatments be immoral. I think infliction of constant stress and suffering certainly would be immoral, however, raising chickens does not necessitate it. And moreover, the level of sentience is not so high that captivity in itself &#x2F; exploitation be problematic. If that were true keeping domestic pets ought to be just as problematic.<p>Animals suffer in the wild, that is a constant. They require vigilance over a) predators, b) constant search for food, c) other natural threats. In captivity, these issues don&#x27;t exist.<p>Notwithstanding the symbiotic evolution of chicken with humans, a chicken is arguably better off in a free-roam farm than in the wild. This is constantly ignored.<p>The vegan solution is such that these animals basically cease to exist (i.e. are killed) because they are more dependent on humans than their ancestors. That&#x27;s what letting them be &quot;sentient&quot; beings instead of commodities would mean.')
