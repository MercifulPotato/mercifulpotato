I dont know enough about them to know what variety they are, but this year I got 20 6-8&quot; long 3&quot; diameter (yes, they are stubby and fat) bananas that once ripe were among the tastiest and sweetest Ive ever eaten. My goal now is to see if I can start encouraging the plants to make more next year...<p>Edit: most likely theyâ€™re Orinoco bananas')
