Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610403876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25738058, text='&gt; Many environmental crimes can be hidden in a recycling program.<p>Yep<p>But by the same token, many materials in consumer electronics are mined unethically and&#x2F; or end up causing toxic pollution. If companies can effectively recycle these products without, a great amount of environmental (and human) damage can be avoided.<p>I would argue that having a responsible battery reclamation process is more important that having questionably repairable devices.<p>Also, while we&#x27;re being cynical here. If we make a device &quot;Repairable&quot; that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s going to ever actually get repaired. If it doesn&#x27;t make economic sense from the end user perspective, repairable products end up in the trash. This is particularly true in this world where manufacturers stop releasing software for old hardware. (Or worse, remotely brick old hardware)')
