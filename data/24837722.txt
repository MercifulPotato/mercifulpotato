Item(by='code_scrapping', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603204284, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836181, text='&gt; Thanks for the Kudos<p>You&#x27;re welcome and you deserve it!<p>&gt; Let&#x27;s not imply that all decisions are malicous and all lawyers are evil.<p>I&#x27;m really not. But I can imagine that if you&#x27;re a professional versed in blindly protecting IP - this is what you would do. The decision to do it in that specific way (suing infringement left and right) needs to come from the top and typically is not a decision that a lawyer would make alone. So, 3 scenarios:<p>1) this is an unsupervised default action of a lawyer that&#x27;s just applying the law without guidance from management, because that&#x27;s what they expect that they should be doing.<p>2) management approves of this and they&#x27;re short-sighted thinking that the logo IP is more important than the community<p>3) management decided that they&#x27;ll make a business move that requires stronger branding and purposefully want to kill the community to monopolize the support.<p>In case 1 and 2, we can hope that this will be corrected. I really don&#x27;t like case 3, but again - I was never a very good business-person.<p>EDIT: Wow, so it was No.2. Glad to see the feedback loop working. But as pointed out by others on this thread - it&#x27;s not that RPi should not protect themselves and their trademark - it&#x27;s that they can do it in a better way than sending take-down orders.')
