I kinda feel like &quot;works quite well most of the time&quot; is about all I can hope for on most things. It usually buries &quot;bad&quot; (yes, that&#x27;s a subjective word) comments here. It&#x27;s not perfect, I&#x27;ve seen perfectly reasonable things get grayed out sometimes, but these things happen. It&#x27;s not a perfect system, but it usually gets the job done.<p>That being said, I do think your criticisms are good, but I just don&#x27;t think those are reasons to get rid of downvoting here on HN.')
