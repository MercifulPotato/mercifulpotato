We have provided it with shelter (a cat kennel at the top of the garden) he will use during bad weather, we provide him food so he isn’t reliant on hunting and the little bugger will often take a swipe at me while I’m giving him his food. It’s not like I’m cornering him with, he comes running over to me now expecting me to have food.')
