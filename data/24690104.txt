One is on Chrome, the other inside a Firefox Container. When I do a google search or just browse something in Chrome, the YT account inside FF will recommend me videos related to the search &#x2F; browsing, even if they&#x27;re not at all related to the videos I watch on that account. The YT account on FF will also regularly suggest me videos related to the ones I watch on my Chrome YT account.<p>The reverse doesn&#x27;t happen: my DDG searches and FF browsing never bleed on Youtube.<p>Google (and many others) doesn&#x27;t care about private mode, separate accounts, profiles or containers.')
