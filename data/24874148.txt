I can flip somebody the bird for obeying the speed limit and nobody calls cops with guns to stop me from being a shithead.  I think it&#x27;s <i>generally</i> true that people are more willing to be assholes to strangers than their close acquaintances.  This has certainly been my observation of American culture at least.  People are ruder to people the further removed from those people they are and are very rarely ever ruder than they are in public.  I&#x27;ve heard similar sentiments from people who work in public facing jobs, particularly retail.')
