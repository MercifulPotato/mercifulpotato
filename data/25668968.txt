They put some pressure on Saudis for social progress but that&#x27;s that.<p>The US is trying to help &#x27;hold things together&#x27;.<p>The result of this, is that Saudi can provide oil - not to America, but to the world, at market prices.<p>The only special provision that comes along with US protection of the Gulf is that the Saudis cannot for example sell their Oil exclusively to China or Russia or do some kind of big strategic deal with them.<p>Put another way - US presence there is to stop Russia&#x2F;China or some other power from taking hold.<p>Saudi has an interest in Yemen because it&#x27;s right on the border, and full of rebels who&#x27;d like to overthrow it, ultimately, they also want peace and stability.<p>Iran wants to cajole, control and antagonize the Arab states and Israel and not in a nice way. They now have Iraq as a vassal state, and they&#x27;d prefer the Arabs to be their vassals as well.<p>If Iran did not exist, there would be almost zero ongoing fighting right now in the ME. Syria, yes, but outside of that no.')
