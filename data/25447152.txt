There is online multiplayer. Dismissing VR because you played descent on a 3dof box 25 yrs ago is kind of lame.<p>&gt; There is no amount of technology that can get over this problem. It&#x27;s not about FOV or resolution or immersion<p>This is frustratingly dismissive and easily disproven. Look at Acron: Attack of the Squirrels! Look at Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes!')
