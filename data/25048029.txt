I was about to say I like being able to find all references and usages of internal variables, but I see now the site does a pretty good job. I also like directly seeing how my code utilizes the library functions (not just the .NET libraries, sometimes nuget packages too). The decompiler also removes ambiguity of &quot;what code is actually being ran&quot;. ILSpy has worked nicely for me, it has the extra perk of having nice integration with LINQPad (another must-have for .NET developers)')
