Item(by='subsubzero', descendants=None, kids=[25563406], score=None, time=1609190219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562816, text='&gt; Sometimes I don&#x27;t - that task falls through the cracks.<p>That line to me is unacceptable. Your(recruiters) job is entirely dealing with people, no coding, no architecture, no design mockups, no capacity analysis or quality testing.<p>The fact that you cannot even get the people portion right means there is alot of recruiters that should not be in that position. I get that the company itself may be somewhat to blame but not getting back to a candidate should be an offense similar to an engineer pushing untested changes to a production application blindly(meaning it should never happen).')
