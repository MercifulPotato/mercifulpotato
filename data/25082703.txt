DoorDash is practically giving away money with their service it&#x27;s unreal.<p>DashPass is $10&#x2F;mo which which turns every delivery into ~$1+tip. The idea that I can buy 30min-1hour of a real human&#x27;s time and labor for $3-4 to deliver me food is silly.<p>My usual Indian take-out order is $16 if I spend 40 minutes for the round trip or $18 to get someone to deliver it to me.')
