A x4 increase equates to a 6dB increase.&quot;<p>Also:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electronics-tutorials.ws&#x2F;transformer&#x2F;audio-transformer.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electronics-tutorials.ws&#x2F;transformer&#x2F;audio-trans...</a><p>&quot;One of the main applications for audio frequency transformers is in impedance matching.&quot;')
