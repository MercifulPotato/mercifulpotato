There are different types of routes. Some are:<p>- built for humans to walk on[1]. Cars are not allowed on here <i>at all</i>.<p>- built for cars to drive on[2]. See the big double yellow lines in the middle? That&#x27;s how you know this part of the road was designed with cars in mind. However, because we don&#x27;t have the money to build footbridges over every road, we put a zebra crossing in the middle of it so that pedestrians can cross between the routes that <i>only they are allowed on</i>.<p>Cars get the right of way on roads because <i>that&#x27;s what we built them (or in the case of old roads that existed before cars, repurposed&#x2F;maintain them) for</i>. Just like we built the sidewalks&#x2F;pavements&#x2F;footpaths&#x2F;footbridges&#x2F;etc for pedestrians (and sometimes cyclists).<p>Maybe part of the problem here is that you seem to be using &quot;road&quot; to mean &quot;things people go on&quot;, when the rest of us are using the word road to mean &quot;the things people drive on&quot;, and generally use other words to describe the things we&#x27;ve built specifically for walking on.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.designingbuildings.co.uk&#x2F;w&#x2F;images&#x2F;8&#x2F;8c&#x2F;Pavement.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.designingbuildings.co.uk&#x2F;w&#x2F;images&#x2F;8&#x2F;8c&#x2F;Pavement....</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgs.6sqft.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;22110146&#x2F;NYC-Open-Streets-West-End-Avenue.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgs.6sqft.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;22110146&#x2F;N...</a>')
