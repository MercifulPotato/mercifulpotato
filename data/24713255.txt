I think their existence is necessary for fundamental technical reasons. I also consider the &quot;link everything statically&quot; approach failed, because in the end you want at least <i>some</i> run-time linking (vdso for instance and actually also the fundamental system libraries).<p>But also languages like rust and swift and before them OCaml and Haskell show that the current prevalent C&#x2F;C++ ABI is not powerful enough. And in principle, there is not much of a difference between the reason for header-only libraries in C++ and rust not having a composable ABI. It is always about the lack of information one can pass through the ABI.<p>Interestingly, one does not even <i>need</i> to exchange the definition of a rust function or that of a C++ template for monomorphisation. One could easily define an extensible library that will create the new specialisation for any given input. One would only need to &quot;freeze&quot; the compiler that was used to create the library and ship it with that library. Ok, easier said than done, of course.')
