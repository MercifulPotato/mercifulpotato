I was thinking a lot about The Old Web when I built this, so maybe some of that sentiment came through, but I tried not to make it so quirky that folks wouldn’t get it.<p>I’ve been trying this out with friends and family for a couple of weeks. Some things we like about it: no setup or signup, it’s fast and snappy, it doesn’t demand or abuse attention. I guess the third one would keep it from ever being big, but maybe that’s fine. I think I’d rather make something nice than something big.<p>Some things I’m still thinking about: image scaling and optimization, discovery (search? hashtags? web-rings?).<p>I’d love to have your thoughts and perspectives. Is it something you can see yourself enjoying? Why or why not? What would you add or take away?')
