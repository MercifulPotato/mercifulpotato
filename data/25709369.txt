Meaning: if someone is making death threats, go ahead and arrest them and try them in court under whatever laws they have violated.<p>If they have not violated any laws, then that speech is legal and should be allowed to stay up. Right now there is a weird middle ground where nobody is directly prosecuted but they do face consequences in the form of de-platforming. But if someone is so dangerous that they do not deserve a platform, then the right answer is obviously not to take away their Twitter privileges, but to place them in jail where they cannot continue to cause more harm. If they are not deemed harmful enough to jail, then de-platforming them is (they argue) unfair.')
