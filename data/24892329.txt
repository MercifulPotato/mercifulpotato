I can speed up video 2x or even 4x and still keep up with a lot of these videos - that&#x27;s how slow they talk.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t understand why most of that needed to be done in VsCode. Surely they could&#x27;ve done the setup and asset export in the XD app that then also generated snippets for easy access in vscode. Instead, they&#x27;re setting up all that meta data and complex workflows in a vscode extension.<p>Not only is that unnecessary, it&#x27;s extremely annoying. Putting aside the additional bloat that has to go through electron, just debugging performance issues alone would be a PITA.')
