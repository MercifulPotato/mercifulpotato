Item(by='bserge', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606739876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25252674, text='&gt; they toss perfectly good large appliances too.<p>Oh they do, they really do. I worked at a recycling factory in the UK, the amount of household appliances, TVs, computers and computer parts, laptops, phones that people toss away is staggering.<p>Many are in absolutely perfect working condition! Like, a 48&quot; Samsung TV and a 52 inch 4K Sony TV would come in, we&#x27;d test them, <i>nothing</i> wrong with them. I can only assume someone moved house and just left everything, or they upgraded to bigger TVs.<p>Not even going to mention the washers, dryers, dishwashers, fridges, about a quarter of them would be in good working condition. Who throws away a perfectly fine washer? Why? A new model has nothing new inside technology-wise, I can promise you that.<p>It was against company policy, but employees would take them home, either for a low price (got myself a nice Neff microwave oven and a Bosch vacuum for Â£10 each... retail price in the hundreds) or just by being friends with a supervisor...<p>I&#x27;m actually glad about that, because otherwise they&#x27;d be loaded into containers and sent to Asia or Africa somewhere. Absolutely ridiculous.')
