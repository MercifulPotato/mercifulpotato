Item(by='oh_sigh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610316968, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720267, text='Part of the reason no one wants to put in the work is because all it takes is a technical dictator to say &quot;I don&#x27;t like this approach, let&#x27;s rethink this&quot;, and scuttle your weeks of work. Even if you got a sign-off on the approach earlier. This has happened enough times to me in open source projects that I only submit code to projects that I know have reasonable maintainers that I&#x27;ve interacted with in the past.<p>Developers frequently hate it when &quot;product people&quot; get a say in the direction of the product, but the alternative is commonly to have developers prioritize perceived code purity over actual user interests. And emphasis on &quot;perceived&quot;, because usually the codebase is a hot mess but maintainers want it to be <i>their</i> hot mess, not someone else&#x27;s.')
