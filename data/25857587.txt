They need to stick to issues with no bipartisan support and clear policy changes already broadly agreed and actually pass some of their manifesto.<p>That mostly rules out changes to big tech legislation.<p>They should shore up Obamacare, take action on foreign interference in elections, get universal internat access, go after China for 101 reasons and force through some major upgrades in climate and science policy.
