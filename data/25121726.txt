We shouldn&#x27;t need Linus&#x27;s brain dump to be able to use a tool. The Git UI directly models the Git internal model and that&#x27;s just bad design. It&#x27;s a completely leaky abstraction.<p>I can use git all right but the fact that I need about 20 different commands to do my job, 95% of them with extra parameters and almost all of them with names that don&#x27;t reflect what I want to do from a functional point of view is utterly dumb. Again, functional! not technical! The UI should reflect end user functionality, not internal technical details.')
