Cycnicism is OK - there have been a lot of crappy products in this space and devs are sick and tired of LinkedIn spam.<p>The plan is to become a trusted partner to engineers and technologists - helping to update their resume yearly, produce better resumes by having a deeper insight into their performance.  That trust and that relationship will be super valuable and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll find the business model.<p>As mentioned in FAQs -- &quot;In the future, we will offer additional upgraded services for purchase such as resume distribution, hosting, tracking, salary negotiation, vetted job opportunities, recruiter outreach and cover letter writing.&quot; -- but at this moment we don&#x27;t really know.<p>The core product today is writing resumes and building that trust. I think if we do that very well, we&#x27;ll have a lot of opportunities to make a successful business out of it. If we do that poorly, we&#x27;ll have nothing.')
