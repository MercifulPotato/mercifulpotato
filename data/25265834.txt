Right now, all OpinionX surveys are automatically set up to collect email addresses (mainly because we haven&#x27;t implemented a caching system to enable participants to re-join existing surveys).<p>We&#x27;ve just linked a normal OpinionX survey as our demo for now as we haven&#x27;t built something specific that&#x27;s better suited for a landing page demo yet - this is on our to-do list though, we know it&#x27;s not the most user friendly for trying it out.')
