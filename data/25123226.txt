If these tickets sell out in 10 minutes, creating a better technical solution to let them sell out in 2 minutes isnâ€™t actually improving anything meaningful.<p>i am sorry i don&#x27;t understand how is forcing users to buy those tickets in 10 minutes instead of efficient 2 minutes helping anybody?<p>its not like i can just buy PNRs like i can do on airlines to inflate the demand. i have to buy a ticket now, if its available, i pay and thats it. why do you need complications. its not like i could sell my ticket or transfer or whatever.<p>where does ticketmaster come in? that is a for profit system designed to charge people to buy more tickets for their own commissions.<p>why is irctc wanting to be like that?')
