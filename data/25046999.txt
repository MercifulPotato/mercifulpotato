You&#x27;re right, Micro was trying to do too much, based on prior experiences at other companies that provided the all encompassing platform experience. Once I realised that I started to scale back. With Micro 3.0 we also knew docs was one lagging thing from before and the fragmented projects were causing huge issues. So now we have betters docs <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;micro.mu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;micro.mu&#x2F;</a> and we have a single project <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;micro&#x2F;micro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;micro&#x2F;micro</a>. The product M3O (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m3o.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m3o.com</a>) has its own set of docs, sort of like how Git and GitHub would have different docs.<p>Hopefully we&#x27;re headed in the right direction.')
