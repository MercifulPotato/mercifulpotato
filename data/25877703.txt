Or rather, they did, but I couldn&#x27;t set up the app for them, one because it didn&#x27;t have an English option, one because it wouldn&#x27;t accept my non-German card and another because it was giving me an extremely helpful &quot;unspecified&quot; error. But even here in UK it&#x27;s a mess. There is a charging station near my home that seems to be out of order 90% the time. There is another one where I can&#x27;t set up an account and their customer support is non existent. Funnily enough the best experiences I ever had with charging stations in the UK were always at Shell charging stations - plug in, tap your payment card on the side, done. No apps, no stupid fobs or anything, it&#x27;s easier than paying for petrol. I really do think that legislation should come in to force all providers to accept card payment at the charger, even if the cost is higher(offer discount to account holders, but at least let me pay even without an account)')
