Item(by='ovi256', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606742592, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25253191, text='&gt;Steve Jobs wanted all iphone &quot;apps&quot; to just be websites<p>I wouldn&#x27;t weigh that too much, as it seems it was PR deflection until the native app SDK was ready. Basically Steve&#x27;s world class reality distortion field at work that left one content but going &quot;wait what&quot; hours or days later. Very useful if one is a journalist that has already turned in their copy by then.<p>Once the native app tools were published, Steve didn&#x27;t say anything else about iPhone &quot;app sites&quot;.')
