Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25122329], score=None, time=1605607007, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121754, text='&gt; Why would you - the customer - pay a restaurant 24$ for a pizza while you could get that same pizza for 16$ via DoorDash in a far more convenient fashion?<p>Maybe some of it&#x27;s unsustainable, sure. But why should the restaurant care? They&#x27;re still getting their $24; they should make hay while the sun shines.<p>&gt; If and when the price gap closes over time, incumbent delivery services who remain get to flip their losses into a profit.<p>Maybe. This has supposedly been the business model, but has anyone actually managed to execute on it? As soon as they started jacking up the prices it would be very easy for a competitor to enter.<p>&gt; Keeping a regular restaurant open becomes prohibitively expensive (which is why ghost kitchens are becoming a thing)<p>As they should - it sounds like they&#x27;re a more efficient way to do things all round. I&#x27;m not worried about regular restaurants disappearing though, because I still like them and am still willing to pay a premium for them.<p>&gt; low wages for gig and restaurant workers<p>It&#x27;s always had a reputation as a minimum-wage (or even below-minimum-wage) job, no?<p>&gt; impact on the quality and diversity of the food on order.<p>Sounds like a self-correcting problem - as and when quality and diversity drop, an opportunity rises for anyone who can offer them.')
