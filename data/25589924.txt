Photons hit particles, get absorbed, and re-emitted<p>Well, actually the speed of light, specifically the rate of propagation or phase velocity, is not slower in mediums because of absorption and re-emittance. Instead, a photon is affected by feedback loops between its oscillating electric field and the charges of atoms it is passing near, without being actually absorbed by the atoms.<p>Paraphrased as best I could from:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Refractive_index#Microscopic_explanation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Refractive_index#Microscopic_e...</a>')
