Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604206834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24952202, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve been thinking about it over the last several days and, legitimately, the only possible recourse is to run your own email server.<p>A possible alternative that is almost as good might be to get your own domain and use some email service like Fastmail with that domain. Have something that regularly downloads all your mail from the service (which might be as simple as configuring your normal email client to download and retain everything).<p>If you ever have a problem with Fastmail, sign up for some other email service that allows you to use your own domain, such as Protonmail, and change your domain&#x27;s mail-related records to point to that service.<p>Your incoming email will be down during the time it takes to sign up for the other service and change your domain setup, but hopefully getting tossed off email services is a once in a blue moon event for you so.<p>(If you do this, make sure that changing domain settings at your name service provider does not depend on receiving email at your domain. It would be very irritating to not be able to point your mail-related records to the new provider because your name service provider is sending a TOTP token to your old email provider).')
