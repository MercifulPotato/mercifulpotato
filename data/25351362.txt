If a site&#x27;s DNS record indicates that it supports eSNI, and a connection with eSNI fails, then the browser should hard-fail. And middleboxes can&#x27;t lie about whether a site supports eSNI, since that&#x27;s protected by DNSSEC (and it should be coming over DoH anyway). This would break the bad actors without breaking every site that didn&#x27;t upgrade to eSNI.')
