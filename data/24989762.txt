And for what reason? So that you can cater to the 0.00001% of the users because they hate javascript for no other reason than that they hate it?<p>&gt; Of course I couldn&#x27;t do photo editing with that concept in a browser, but that&#x27;s not what I use a browser for anyway.<p>Maybe not you, but I certainly use my browser for that kind of purpose as one example of several that won&#x27;t work with javascript disabled.<p>&gt; Having this fallback also has the advantage that it helps disabled users and users on poor network connections.<p>Yeah maybe having an alternative for drag n drop helps disabled users but just removing javascript doesn&#x27;t help them at all. I would actually argue the reverse. With javascript you can do text to speech for example for people that may have bad eye sight. On poor networks a well written PWA works a lot better than a traditional server side generated page, depending a bit on the application itself of course. I would agree that because SPA apps need to do stuff the browser does for you, people simply don&#x27;t build resilient enough apps that handles failures well.<p>There are many bad SPA apps out there, but also many good. I was travelling and used Airbnbs web app that was terrific when I had a bad connection. I could still open up cached content and access a lot of stuff even if some things wouldn&#x27;t load which was very good for me.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to use javascript but still want a SPA like feel there are alternatives like Phoenix Liveview for example. They still use javascript, but it works without it since it&#x27;s just server side generated stuff. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work well on bad connection or at all when offline but I guess most sites would be ok with that trade off.')
