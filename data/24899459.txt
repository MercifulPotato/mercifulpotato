Also unlike ReactOS, Wine has been pushed a lot by companies like Valve explicitly so that people can move away from Windows.<p>Also if it is found that someone did indeed copy code from Windows, then they can simply replace that code. This isn&#x27;t the first time such an accusation would happen to open source software - even the Linux kernel was targeted like that, yet you do not see people saying that the writing is on the wall for Linux because anyone can contribute to it.')
