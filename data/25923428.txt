I <i>hate</i> it. I also need to access other JIRA boards with different email addresses occasionally. It takes forever to sign out, login again, navigate to board, find the issue. It puts me off using it so much.<p>One light at the end of the tunnel is the Mac app (for some reason there is no Windows or Linux version). It&#x27;s much more lightweight and feels way faster than the web version. However, it is buggy in my experience, and a fair few things I do a lot can&#x27;t be done in it and require the web interface, but for quickly checking stuff it mostly works.')
