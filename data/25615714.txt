At the same time, it creates a window where the virus is under selective pressure to escape some of the immune response from the vaccine&#x27;s effects.  Individuals who have smaller&#x2F;partial responses to the vaccine are more likely to have this happen.<p>That is all I&#x27;m saying, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really that controversial.  I&#x27;m not trying to make a robust immunological argument.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s inevitable, but it&#x27;s another reason to reduce transmission.  We already have the UK variant, which many have suggested is better at immune escape due to perhaps evolving during a long infection in an immunocompromised individual.')
