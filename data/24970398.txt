The hard part of the Pi is the display.  The kit also doesn&#x27;t include a cam nor a headset, nor even a mic. This is super important for online learning. Maybe you could fit in a mic in the keyboard somewhere?<p>A Pi all-in-one (iPi if you excuse me) or a Pi-book in an affordable price range would be revolutionary. I have an old VGA-only monitor but guess what - no D-SUB on the Pi 400 and a proper dongle would be another... $30?<p>As is, nostalgia value is super-high but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s as practical as one would hope without any kind of display.')
