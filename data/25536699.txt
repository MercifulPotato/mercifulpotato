It feels like even if I had billions, I&#x27;d try to be an Elon Musk and use my money to create something. Or maybe even buy and bankroll a NGO, a sport team, artists, whatever. Is this already saturated, are all the opportunities that don&#x27;t look like a sure scam already taken?<p>I feel so out of touch with this world, I struggle to even comprehend it.')
