I have seen your argument before, but I&#x27;m yet to see it quantified. I don&#x27;t see how Stadia would be slower than any other games whose ground-truth &#x27;state&#x27; lives on a server somewhere, which I think is the majority of games these days[1]; trusting the client to faithfully maintain state is a no-no because of cheating. If anything, I would expect Stadia servers&#x27; ping-times to be better than most.<p>I don&#x27;t expect Stadia to work very well with Super Smash Bros were frame-perfect parries&#x2F;combos are expected (at he highest level) - but for the rest of us who do not qualify for a spot on an e-sports team, it works well enough.<p>edit: So I went and looked for the numbers - PCGamer[2] says that Stadia is about 60-80ms slower than PC for Tomb Raider and Destiny 2 (eg. 63ms PC &#x2F; 125ms Stadia @1080 Stadia gets worse at higher resolutions and on TVs, obviously)<p>1.
