Item(by='giraj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603835453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24902852, text='For people wanting to learn HoTT, I&#x27;d rather recommend Rijke&#x27;s book assembled from his lectures at CMU: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EgbertRijke&#x2F;HoTT-Intro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EgbertRijke&#x2F;HoTT-Intro</a><p>(Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a mathematician working in HoTT and (higher) category theory.)<p>Like with most advanced concepts in any field, there are lots of misunderstandings pertaining to HoTT. To me, the underlying insight is that the &quot;right&quot; abstract setting for a lot of classical homotopy theory is that of an infinity-topos (whose precise definition is an open question, but we have candidates). Theorems proven in HoTT hold in any infinity-topos, and HoTT is (conjecturally) the internal language of these.<p>For anything outside of homotopy theory, HoTT isn&#x27;t (immediately) interesting. It&#x27;s certainly not trying to provide foundations for set-based mathematics, but for (categorical) homotopy theory, sure.<p>Some mathematicians take issue with the logic being intuisionistic; e.g. neither the law of the excluded middle, nor double negation hold in HoTT. This is not about constructivity (which I agree, mainstream mathematicians will reject), but about the spaces being modeled. For example, a mainstream mathematician will say that <i>a space is either empty or has a point</i>. However, in the category of bundles over the circle, points are sections; and so the double cover doesn&#x27;t have any point, for example. Neither is it empty.')
