I think the idea is that individual crystals are &quot;alive&quot; in that sense, and the bulk is maybe a colonial organism. Maybe quartz crystals forming in a chunk of what will soon be granite are only &quot;alive&quot; in the brief period where they are still growing. When the rock solidifies, the crystal &quot;starves&quot; and &quot;dies&quot;, leaving only a corpse. Melting and refreezing granite would basically be composting, using formerly alive material to foster new life.<p>On a similar note, a dead human is &quot;compositionally identical&quot; to a living one, at least for a little while, so I think that&#x27;s entirely a red herring. :)')
