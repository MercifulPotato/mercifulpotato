Otherwise I’d borrow a ton of money and transfer the debt to Bill Gates. A PE firm borrows to buy a company, attempts to make it a better money making machine by making process improvements and having it borrow to fund expansion and then sells it. The people who lend to the company know what they’re doing. They’re making a bet that the PE firm was right and they’ve made a better money making machine. Sometimes they’re wrong and they lose this money. That’s capitalism. If you make a bad investment you can lose all your money.')
