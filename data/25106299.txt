(Obviously it&#x27;s different for Regular Joe User, I&#x27;m talking about the HN audience).<p>&gt; No bullshit forced updates when the OS feels like it.<p>In practice, my Windows install always updates in the middle of the night when I&#x27;m not using it. It closes all of my apps and only reopens the web browser. But, it&#x27;s not so bad. It doesn&#x27;t bother me. I can however see how it might annoy some people. But I think the effects of this are exaggerated.<p>&gt; No phoning home with you being unable to launch an app when your manufacturer&#x27;s server is slow.<p>Windows phones home, but to be fair, this post is about Linux vs Windows, and being unable to launch an app is a MacOS problem, not Windows.<p>&gt; No shuffling about trying to install drivers for a thousand components before your computer is usable.<p>This is true in some situations. For instance, if you install Windows from scratch you&#x27;ll have to wait while it downloads drivers. More of an automated process, no shuffling about. The alternative on Linux is to roll the dice and hope your drivers are baked into the kernel, if not you&#x27;re back to (very manual) shuffling about.')
