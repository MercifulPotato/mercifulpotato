Yes, gold is a decent option as well. However I view Bitcoin as digital gold and it has a few nice properties that gold doesn&#x27;t have (of course gold has some good properties that Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t have). One of the aspects of Bitcoin that I appreciate the most, is that it&#x27;s very easy to carry around with me, for example when travelling on an airplane to another country. The same is not true for gold.<p><i>&gt; I would also point out that the market expectation clearly isn&#x27;t aligned with currencies being &#x27;in trouble&#x27; - very low inflation in general right now.</i><p>Inflation is actually really high, but its mostly hidden in rising prices for stocks and real estate.')
