Initial Linux build was the 32-bit x386 version, though 68k amiga portability also started rather early. Ultimately resulting in a variant for the 64-bit dec alpha, after receiving an AlphaStation 500. My recollection of the AlphaStation circa 2000: it was indeed a powerhouse for CAD type apps, though Silicon Graphics would come to dominate in arenas like Hollywood. Thanks for clarifying ;)')
