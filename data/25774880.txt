If you own an apartment in a village of McMansions you&#x27;re poor.</i><p>And let&#x27;s not mistake comfort with wealth. Just because I have electricity, a WC, a fridge and don&#x27;t plow the fields like my grandparents did might make me seem rich, but my grandparents owned that land they were plowing while I don&#x27;t own the &quot;land&quot; I am &quot;plowing&quot; at my comfy deskjob, but the corporation does, nor do I own the land I live and sleep on, but the landlord&#x2F;bank does.<p>Our lives are now much more safe and comfortable than 150 years ago, but in the end, most of us who are not asset owners, are set to be serfs for life, just like 150 years ago except that instead of being serfs to a crown we are serfs to banks and publicly traded megacorps.')
