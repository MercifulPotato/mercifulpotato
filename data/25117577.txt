If you bring in a great sous chef and ask them to make you an omelet, they will make a great omelet. If you bring in a committee of people -- some sell omelet pans, some run hotel chains where free omelets are part of the package, some want you to adopt their vegan egg substitute -- you are not going to get a great omelet spec. Adding one omelet expert to the committee doesn&#x27;t add anything over just asking an omelet expert to make some eggs.')
