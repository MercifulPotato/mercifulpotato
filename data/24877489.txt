It is like bowling, and finding your ball in the next lane over. You didn&#x27;t throw it hard enough to hop the lane barriers, but there it is.<p>&gt; particles can exceed c0 (the speed of light in a vacuum) during tunnelling<p>No particle&#x27;s speed is measured here, so it cannot exceed c.<p>What does &quot;during tunneling&quot; mean? Tunneling means measuring its position here, and then over there. You can&#x27;t do that simultaneously with measuring its speed in between, because of the uncertainty principle.<p>The wavefunction can be thought of as a probability distribution. That can be updated instantly, even if it becomes very bimodal, because it&#x27;s just a change in knowledge.')
