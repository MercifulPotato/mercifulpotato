In this example, it is O(1). When your N is <i>fixed</i> (or even upper bounded), then it is always O(1). This is standard in how it is taught, and I&#x27;ve even said O(1) in interviews where I had a nested for loop, because the size of the iteration was fixed in both loops. The interviewer agreed with me.<p>Heck, I did this even in an interview where N could be arbitrarily large, but I argued that for the problem domain, it is extremely unlikely that N would be bigger than some amount - here N represented the number of direct reports a manager has. I said that <i>in theory</i> it was O(N), but in practice (or on average), it would be O(1). Again, the interviewer accepted the answer.')
