I was obsessed (and still am) with adding high-quality remote jobs and providing people with a wide selection or remote job opportunities.<p>However, the more jobs I added, the harder I made it for people to find the best match.<p>The job &quot;discovery&quot; process became harder.<p>And this is a problem for almost all job boards.<p>Frankly, many job boards keep the discovery process only at the category level (e.g., marketing jobs, sales jobs).<p>Over the last month, I set a new goal.<p>Not only to provide a wide selection of remote jobs but to help people easily discover those jobs.<p>To make the discovery process easier, I used AI.<p>I wanted to make the job discovery process as easy as possible.<p>You just set the job match criteria once and then receive the best matching jobs in your inbox.<p>Today, I am launching this feature on PH - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;dream-remote-job-alert<p>Now, you can set a remote job alert, and with the help of AI, I score each job based on your alert settings.
