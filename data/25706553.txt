Given the formula:<p><pre><code>    &#x2F; 0              (n &lt; 20)\n    \\ 10000*2^(n-20) (n &gt;= 20)\n</code></pre>\nWhen &#x27;n&#x27; reaches 30 (years) you’re already looking at ~$10 million dollars. A number like that looks like it benefits the big players, but what about 40 years? That’s ~$10.5 <i>billion</i> for <i>one year</i>. Disney’s going to have to think twice about if it’s worth it to keep paying. Add another 5 years, and now they’d be paying a <i>third of a trillion</i> dollars for one year. I don’t think they’d even reach that point before dropping it.<p>The big problem with copyright is that some things don’t make sense to have copyrighted for 20 years, but some do (depending on who you ask, this may not be true). This becomes a problem when multi-<i>billion</i> dollar corporations own the copyright to something. That scale of money wasn’t a thing in the late 1700s when copyright was written into the Constitution.')
