Item(by='gmurphy', descendants=None, kids=[25538823, 25538880], score=None, time=1608927729, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25536760, text='I love Lora - our apartment&#x27;s garage remotes have a range of about 5 meters, and the gate opens super slowly. This is annoying for us and everyone around us as we live on a business street, so have to either be parked across a footpath, or block traffic in the street while we wait for it all to happen.<p>So I rigged up a bunch of stuff using some RFM95 Lora modules, relays, and a smattering of crypto, and now I can start my garage door opening from several blocks away. Now by the time my car gets there, it&#x27;s ready for us to drive in.<p>It started as breadboard&#x2F;feather mess, but has progressed over time as I&#x27;ve taught myself PCB design to make ever-smaller remotes. It also means I can make multiple remotes, and put them on each of my bags, bikes, cars etc.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;B11m1y5J3qc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;B11m1y5J3qc&#x2F;</a>')
