And all this following prior threats of litigation against the company within the past year?<p>And you saw this from men or non-persons of color who were not fired? Obviously not, but if you do have examples that are sufficiently comparable in your mind, feel free to describe them and make a case. As it is, you&#x27;re again falling back on unfalsifiable claims.<p>And I&#x27;m still curious to know why you&#x27;d expect a company <i>not</i> to fire someone in this scenario?')
