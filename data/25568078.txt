We know bond yeilds are super low, whcih is putting pressure on people to move into more risky investments like the S&amp;P. This measure seems to simply show that pressure. What it says nothing about is whether those investments are good. What it seems to show is that there&#x27;s enormous pressure on the stock market to go up. At some point though, those companies have to actually make money. We know they&#x27;re not going to be making hugely higher earnings - we&#x27;re a long way into a good economy, there&#x27;s no real reason to think everything is going to get massively better. The only alternative is that inflation sky rockets and that&#x27;s how earnings go up.<p>So what happens if inflation goes up? Well for inflation to have any meaningful effect it would have to blast past the fed&#x27;s targets and the fed would need to massively increase bond yields. Which would remove the pressure on stocks, causing stock prices to drop.<p>What I&#x27;m not so sure about is what happens if inflation really does stay flat. If inflation stays flat, then everyone is just holding a load of stock with really bad yeild. Does that also cause a crash when people realise they&#x27;re holding bad investments and those bonds don&#x27;t look so bad because there isn&#x27;t inflation?')
