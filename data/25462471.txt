America is also the only rich country that&#x27;s built that much of its wealth on slave labour, so does that mean slave labour is a good thing?<p>I&#x27;m curious about this one. Most of what I&#x27;ve read indicates that modern American wealth was largely circumstantial due to european economies being obliterated during WW2. Do you have a source for how much slavery affected American wealth?')
