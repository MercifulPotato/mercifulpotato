I&#x27;ve tried switching to it a number of times (from a standard 87key board), even getting unto &gt;60wpm consistently, but its use in terminal sessions was always frustrating. Not being able to type &quot;cd&quot; with the index and middle finger of the left hand means I always felt super slow in the terminal.<p>Should I have persevered? Is this a typical frustration of moving to a split ortholinear layout board using QWERTY?<p>edit: spelling')
