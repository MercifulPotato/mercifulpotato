To log in to Discord, I have to provide my e-mail address, be logged into a Google account (because of reCAPTCHA), and possibly even open my mail box to confirm to Discord that I am, in fact, me.<p>This is the Web experience at least, on mobile they presumably already have all of this (or the equivalents) right after installing their app.<p>EDIT: to add to this, I once created a Discord account associated with a fake e-mail. After a while they presumably figured that out, but instead of, e.g., letting me log in and change the e-mail, they just locked me out.')
