Conspiracies will still spread on other sites (Reddit: The Frontpage of the Internet, anyone?). Ad revenue will continue to go to electronic platforms and use tracking (Google is huge in this space too).<p>I can see that Facebook has engaged in anticompetitive behavior, such as buying some competitive companies. I don&#x27;t see them as a full monopoly. There are plenty of other sites (some of them large) that allow you to connect with others, share content, and create an online identity. Just look at LinkedIn, Reddit, TikTok, etc. There are other large ad services too, like Google.<p>A strong democracy requires an educated and diligent citizenry. We can break up Facebook, but that won&#x27;t fix the root problems in our society. We could start by teaching basic logic in schools. And I&#x27;m sure this will be controversial, but I do think we should make a citizenship test part of school curriculums so that the citizens know their rights, the structure and function of our government, etc. Then we still need to hope that voters do their homework.')
