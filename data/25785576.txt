It&#x27;s a traditional asian salt which contains sulfuric ingredients and it makes everything taste like eggs. (It&#x27;s not heat stable tho.) With avocado you get something that tastes and feels like egg. A sulphur note is also very typical for non-vegan food, as animal protein decay releases these molecules at any stage. I do a modified version of the kinky vegan &quot;Mett&quot; (german, raw minced meat) based on rice cakes and tomato extract (don&#x27;t judge it before you tried it) and the sulfuric hint really adds to it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kala_namak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kala_namak</a>')
