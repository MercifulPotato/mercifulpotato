While I see nothing wrong with disagreeing with the goverments stance on the lockdown (For my own reasons: Being in a tier 3 and 4 region for so long, I&#x27;m missing my friends, I&#x27;m missing being able to have a beer with them and its getting to a mental health issue with me now. But thats just my own personal reasons) TalkRadio would also tell its listeners to not bother with face masks and spend their money on beer instead on the basis that unless its a well fitting N95 or better mask it offers less than ideal protection to the wearer (ignoring the fact that face covering also help prevent those without symtoms spreading it to others).<p>So where do you draw the line? Disagree with the goverment? Yeah I disagree with them on many things. But what about when they start pushing people to break the rules?<p>But then again do I want a corperation dictation what can be said? Nope. I like the idea that shitty ideas&#x2F;speech should be countered with more speech then to nuke the speech in the first place. So even though I heavly disagree with what they were putting out to the public, I think they shouldn&#x27;t of just got nuked of YT for having shity (imo) ideas.')
