That’s what unsupported means here: not the PC or Android meanings where everyone has to kludge it in, but the Apple meaning where they will release without warning an OS point release version 15.2.7 that shatters an entire ecosystem built on unsupported APIs.<p>These instructions are just unsupported APIs in Silicon. Use them at your peril.')
