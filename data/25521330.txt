I would say try to ease yourself into lowering your dose slowly. I am not sure if its even possible with your situation but with IBS I try to control everything else including stress, food and sleep. I take loperamide if those dont work and it allows me to reset myself into being normal for sometime, that way I can retry. I try to go as long as I can without one and see if I can push myself. But I dont get too far due to work stress anyway.<p>Honestly the whole thing about people abusing it and FDA clamping down works against normal people who are genuinely using it.')
