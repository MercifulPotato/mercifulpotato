Not everyone may agree on that definition especially as views change. Only one thing everyone agrees on is that &quot;open source&quot; is software for which the source code is published, and an &quot;open source license&quot; is a license attached to such software. This is not an extermely useful definition as far as the license is concerned, so if you want to be more specific you (and OSI) have to use more specific terms instead of the broad term &quot;open source&quot;.')
