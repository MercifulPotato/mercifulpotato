I think you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a modern mathematician that rejects the diagonalization argument, outside of finitists, which are pretty far from the mainstream. I mean the proof that there is no bijection from a set to its power set is pretty straightforward and constructive. I&#x27;m pretty sure the proof is valid even in intuitionist logic.')
