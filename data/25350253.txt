This is how these upgrades can be deployed if you don&#x27;t want to wait for the OS.<p>The problem is that browsers and other applications are just unwilling to let the user see how their products work or decide anything for themselves--or even just architect their installers to involve dependencies on a shared resolver upgrade--and so we end up in this hell of applications actively hiding their traffic from you.<p>And like, &quot;great&quot;: now we have a new version of DoH and have to wait for everyone to upgrade their apps that upgraded to DoH before? This is ridiculous bullshit... this should be a single app on your device you now upgrade. Hell: Cloudflare even develops that app for a number of platforms! They aren&#x27;t even the problem... it is everyone who jumps on &quot;embedding&quot; this behavior :&#x2F; :&#x2F; :&#x2F;.<p>(For a more technically-comprehensive rant about this, read my comment from a year ago:)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21701808" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21701808</a>')
