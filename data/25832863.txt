It&#x27;s noticeably worse than uncompressed CD quality (ignoring CDs that were mastered from sources that were lossily compressed to begin with - what a great trend that was).<p>This isn&#x27;t a complaint, more an observation: Spotify works really well if you&#x27;re outside, in a car, or even in an office environment with plenty of low level background noise. It&#x27;s not so great when you run it through a half-decent hifi in your own home. Still, good enough for casual listening. However, if you&#x27;re paying attention, you&#x27;ll notice the flaws easily.<p>So, some of that noise is probably just that: noise. But some of it will also no doubt be the watermark.')
