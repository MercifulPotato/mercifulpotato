There are a lot of talented engineers out there who A) have zero interest in working for a FAANG, B) are perfectly talented, C) have jobs that pay just as well. Yes, that applies to those in government too.<p>In terms of qualifications, people have different things that motivate them to work in certain fields&#x2F;jobs. People value things other than money as well, such as power and influence, ability to impact change at scale few organizations can match, feelings they are contributing to a meaningful mission&#x2F;cause, etc. It&#x27;s not just about money and overqualification is many times because of the way career ladders work in government and the educational, training, internship opportunities the government pays&#x2F;provides for that you are unlikely to experience in the private sector. Government will sponsor employees to work an internship in the U.S. Senate for 2+ years, or attend a postsecondary education at Georgetown&#x2F;Harvard&#x2F;GWU, etc. Not just for senior level employees, for mid-career ones.')
