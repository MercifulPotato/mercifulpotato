This provides the affordance in the start of a project where you don&#x27;t have to think that much about system load from users.<p>You don&#x27;t have to think that much about your relational model, so you can postpone all kinds of nasty questions about data integrity and multiplicity early on. This enables a team to move fast and break things.<p>The switch to something like Postgres comes later in the project where you know your requirements better and you need a system where you have more control over your data.
