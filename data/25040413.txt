Like a dentist giving you movie tickets or DigitalOcean giving you hosting credits, etc..<p>It&#x27;s a fine line tho because that referral logic doesn&#x27;t apply back to leaving reviews. It&#x27;s an interesting topic because so much of it is based on &quot;feel&quot; rather than black and white rules.')
