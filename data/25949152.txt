That process is the same as burning except in that the energy is used by the organism. The net result being the carbon being turned into C02 same as burning.<p>AKA, whether you burn it, or leave it in the environment to rot&#x2F;compost&#x2F;etc the carbon eventually turns back into C02. In order for trees to be a carbon sink they have to be sequestered in an O2 free environment forever. AKA, they need to be feedstock for the oil the cockroaches are going to use to build their civilization in a 100M years.')
