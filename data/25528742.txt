Nobody is actually capable of stopping you from doing what you want to do. They simply don&#x27;t agree with you.<p>Many teachers can teach once a month. Many music are free on IMSLP, musescore, etc. There are cheaper ways to get started than what you have been apparently told.<p>My main objection to using an app are 1) it doesn&#x27;t correct your posture which might lead to injuries in the long run (though not a concern if you don&#x27;t play frequently) 2) it usually takes a <i>lot</i> longer to reach the level you have in mind. Learning from a teacher actually saves time.<p>But, if you just want an interface to DAW, I think an app is fine, since there is no need for phrasing, or timing, etc. You&#x27;ll probably be fine even without the app.')
