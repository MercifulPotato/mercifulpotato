Temples, churches and venues (opera halls, in particular) needed high ceilings to carry sound before electronic amplification.<p>I have lived in a home with high ceilings. I find them gaudy and poor design features, unless you live alone. If you have high ceilings, particularly in open floor plans, everyone is going to hear everything all the time. Doubly true if the stair case opens up to a wide space instead of being closed off.')
