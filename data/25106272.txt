Forest fairies tell the deer how many babies to have?)<p>Thinking about this, I just realized a simple thing: balance in animal population via starvation might not be as grim as we expect (i.e. it happens completely because the weakest&#x2F;least fit individuals cannot compete for food and literally starve).<p>The sexual reproductive system is apparently one of the things that stops working earliest when you&#x27;re affected by disease or malnutrition. This means that malnourished deers will just start having fewer&#x2F;no babies while they&#x27;re being famished.<p>Still grim, because lots of animals would starve, and still very uncomfortable for the deers which, even if they might survive to &quot;old age&quot;, will fail to breed due to starvation... but still better than the alternative in which every baby deer gets born in the world as usual, only to then starve to death while they&#x27;re still very young.')
