I&#x27;ve observed both cc and various linkers take hundreds to thousands of seconds on template-heavy and sometimes not-well-organized c++ on machines running around 4ghz with ddr4, nvme storage, and plenty of both to not be constrained (1TB RAM, 6TB disk). The preprocessor steps barely register in the bazel profile of my repo, compared to places where we hit slot paths in the compiler and linker due to massive mains which are fundamentally separate programs glued together with a switch&#x2F;case and a read from a config file.')
