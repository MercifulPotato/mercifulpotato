Further, we aren’t talking 1&#x2F;200th the size, a ~1GW reactor can only be so small because the amount of heat being transferred.<p>That said, ITER is a very old design based on outdated limitations.  But, again the goal is research not low cost power generation, a stable design is more important to them than an efficient design because the secondary equipment is so critical.')
