Of course I&#x27;m comparing very different things, I was looking at more than just the database and there are lots of other aspects I probably did in a different way.<p>I find this interesting as it probably means that my bottleneck wasn&#x27;t entirely where I thought it was. I have to play around with that some time again.<p>If I wanted to find out the baseline Postgres performance on my hardware for trivial read queries like looking up individual rows by primary key with a database that fits entirely in RAM, how would I do that? I know there is pgbench, but that performs more complex queries as far as I understand.')
