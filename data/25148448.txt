It is a set of sane defaults that I agree with mostly.<p>Standard was also complaining a little but omitting the explicit else branch made it happy.<p>Anyways you can customize RuboCop to your likings, use standardrb that comes with a lot of carefully considered defaults and uses RuboCop under the hood or don&#x27;t use a linter at all and move on with your life.')
