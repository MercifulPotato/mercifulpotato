Yeesh. Actual people work on this stuff, you know, and they may have different goals, requirements, etc than you. This whole post reeks of someone who&#x27;s so in love with being a maverick speaking uncomfortable truths that they&#x27;ve lost sight of this human element.<p>If you&#x27;re offended by (say) research papers that fail to break enough new ground to satisfy you, sorry about your luck, but again, not everyone&#x27;s optimizing the same function as you.
