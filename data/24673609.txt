I came across this randomly during my pandemic reading (<i>The Great Influenza</i>, about the Spanish Flu of 1918). It was really shocking to read how thoroughly the US government suppressed speech during WWI - it&#x27;s not something I was at all aware of before.<p>The Espionage Act is almost certainly unconstitutional, though it&#x27;s still on the books. Ever since the Vietnam War, there&#x27;s been a tacit understanding that the government will only use the law to go after government employees who leak information, but that the government won&#x27;t prosecute the people who publish the information. With this prosecution, the Trump administration is breaking that understanding. The precedent is being set that whenever a newspaper publishes, &quot;Sources tell us...&quot; or &quot;According to documents viewed by...,&quot; they&#x27;re opening themselves up to criminal prosecution.')
