So sorry again not much useful information.<p>I guess it might have been better to not post this without trying to find the articles&#x2F;dokus I had read&#x2F;seen about it given that I don&#x27;t remember to many details besides the conclusion I had.<p>(EDIT: Try searching &quot;warmer weather fungi humans&quot; at least on duckduckgo this yielded some articles about this which are not the sources I had read and I still have to read and evaluate them, but might find some useful information)')
