Many more people are getting tested, for job requirements, travel, etc. It results in more positives, naturally. In a county of more than 3 million, we have around 50 in ICU, lowest in many months. As positive tests grow. Two things (at least) might be at work: better treatment is one, the other is that there were far higher numbers of people infected than known, earlier in the year. Iâ€™m sure treatment now is better, but I would not be surprised if many more people have been exposed, and have recovered, from this virus than is assumed.')
