We&#x27;re not prepared to have a debate in the UK about what the NHS should and shouldn&#x27;t do, yet at the same time people are living longer and want to pay less tax. Something has to give.<p>Tbh, I&#x27;m happy to save for my retirement, but I&#x27;m slightly biased towards a slightly less welfare society (though not as far as removing essential support and health care). I can choose to save more now for an earlier retirement, for example. I think the auto enrollment has gone a long way there.')
