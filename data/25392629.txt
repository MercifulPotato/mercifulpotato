This is sometimes effective.<p>In general I agree with the news media complaints in this thread. In February this was all just racism against the Chinese. In March masks didn&#x27;t slow infections. A vaccine has been a month away since April. We should be so afraid of brown people overseas that we should bomb them before they get us. Trump is Putin&#x27;s buddy. Etc. All bullshit. If someone had been <i>trying</i> to undermine public confidence in journalism, they might have made the same editorial decisions. I totally understand why people don&#x27;t believe what they&#x27;re told. I have myself been accused of skepticism.<p>Let&#x27;s not despair, however. It is still possible to learn facts about the world around us. The headline on TFA shouldn&#x27;t surprise anyone; I&#x27;ve been thinking the same thing for weeks. (Granted, I&#x27;m a moron not a CDC director. However, I don&#x27;t have the wishful thinking disease that nearly everyone on TV seems to have.) Even so, it is news to someone. Vaccines, even if they&#x27;re effective and available, aren&#x27;t going to save us for many months. More people could be wearing masks right now. Some people will start wearing masks, this week, in response to the perfectly natural comparison between covid and 9&#x2F;11.')
