Facial recognition is a field where you commonly see overfitting to culture where the tech package was created in.<p>One dead stupid example, I can think of is biometric cameras being unable to differentiate between faces accurately on the default settings. The cameras are sourced from Europe, and universally use an exposure setting that&#x27;s too short to do anything more than bring out the whites of someones eyes if you have dark skin tones and are in a normally lit room. Just setting the explore to be a little longer, results in decent results for dark skin tones (and of course, worse results for light skin tones).<p>Consumer technologies like iPhone camera&#x27;s on the other hand get it right, because they were forced to start testing on different culture groups due to bad press, but their ubiquity leads to people forgetting that every single setting in a camera can lead to better or worse outcomes, and you can&#x27;t always rely on having a fast processor like an iPhone to autocorrect for you.')
