Taken literally it&#x27;s &#x27;three or more&#x27;, but not everyone uses the word that way.<p><i>&gt; Unless the person is hopping from FAANG to FAANG (hopping for pay bumps)</i><p>I wasn&#x27;t thinking of pay bumps per-se, but of promotions for increased responsibility.<p><i>&gt; They had to go from one shitty job to another because they couldn&#x27;t get the right one.</i><p>Sure, but employers are often insecure.
