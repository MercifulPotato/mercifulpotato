The QA on the panels is <i>much</i> more rigorous, too (it&#x27;s the same thing as with Intel CPUs, the yield on panels hitting the standards for commercial signage is lower than your average consumer TV).<p>Also, you&#x27;ll be getting spare parts for these in a decade if you need it (or, at the very least, can purchase a new device with identical specs in that time), there will be support from the manufacturer over that time, and more often than not you&#x27;ll be able to find decent documentation about how to integrate them into whatever you&#x27;re building.<p>And: some of these carry <i>amazing</i> features. Some two years ago when I was doing videography stuff for an event, there were four 60 inch full-HD monitors in a 2x2 grid - supplied with one DVI cable for the signal that was passed between them using in daisy chain mode, they were configurable to run in grids of up to 4x4 I believe, and the monitors simply took the incoming signal, cropped their section out of it, and displayed it scaled. Was a hell of a lot of fun playing with them.')
