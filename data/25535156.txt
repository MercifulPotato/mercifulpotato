Over engineered, which makes sense in a new market.<p>I had a friend, who would get annoyed&#x2F;frustrated, and literally THROW the joystick against the wall.  The floor.  Your head. :P  Tantrum kid.<p>Anyhow, other than the rubber top coming off of the stick, it just worked forever.  I remember when I moved to the Vic20, then the C64 and eventually the Amiga, I <i>still</i> had those Atari joysticks in use with each newer machine.<p>Incredible joystick.  I can&#x27;t imagine a modern console controller standing up to Tantrum Kid.<p>(Not saying your kids are throwing controllers at walls, floors, people&#x27;s heads, etc...)')
