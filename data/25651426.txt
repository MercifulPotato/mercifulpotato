Not all, but most noticeable ones are and that is what is used when doing photorealistic rendering etc.<p>If you do a 2x downscale, you need to average 4 pixels together. Linear RGB should (by theory and definition) give you a (theoretically) physically accurate result, as if you did a physical 2x downscale by putting it further away in a uniformly lit room or whatever. You can&#x27;t reproduce that precisely, but neither can you reproduce 1l + 1l of milk = 2l of milk.<p>This is in stark contrast to downsizing, blur or whatever &quot;performed&quot; in sRGB, where images get curiously darker and slightly off-color (or is it lighter?).<p>I&#x27;m not sure what is perceptual average of colors, but if you mix pixels in 1:1 ratio and apply blur &#x2F; look from far away, there is only one correct result, and linear RGB average (is one way that) gives you the single correct result.
