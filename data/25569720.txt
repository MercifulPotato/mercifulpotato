Sounds reasonable. Of course we want the surgeon to be prepared for his job. It&#x27;s important.<p>But then there are those in this thread arguing that Elon Musk&#x27;s reward should be unlimited because he&#x27;s &quot;arguably ensuring the long-term survivability of our species.&quot; Wow, that sounds very important. I guess he should have the most money then.<p>Nevermind the fact that the majority of his wealth is literally gained by &quot;sitting in a chair and taking cash&quot;. That&#x27;s the job of a capitalist after all - they don&#x27;t work for their money, they sit in a chair and let the ownership of assets make them money. I mean, sure he&#x27;s &quot;doing things&quot; but are the things he&#x27;s doing worth $140 billion? What has he &quot;done&quot; in the last 9 months that made him $88 billion richer?
