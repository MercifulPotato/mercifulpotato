Note also that the $35&#x2F;MWh figure includes all operating expenses and amortized capital costs i.e. it takes all costs into account already.<p>However, as you imply with your first question regarding maintenance burden, the correct comparison is not &quot;how much would it cost&quot; but rather &quot;how much would it cost relative to projected costs of energy&quot; - and again per [2], utility PV solar is already cheaper than new utility thermal power generation.  There is of course plenty of nuance when it comes to energy consumption - you point out, for example, that aviation will be a difficult sector to &quot;electrify,&quot; a true enough statement in and of itself.  However, it&#x27;s pointed out in [3] that jet fuel represents 12% of transportation energy consumption and that transportation overall represents 25% of global energy consumption, implying that aviation only represents about 3% of global energy consumption.<p>Based on this, I speculate that aviation fuels can be produced in a 100% solar PV energy regime without increasing - and likely lowering - energy production costs above the current regime.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;energy-production-consumption" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;energy-production-consumption</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;perspective&#x2F;lcoe2019" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;perspective&#x2F;lcoe2019</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maritime-executive.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;transport-uses-25-percent-of-world-energy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maritime-executive.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;transport-uses-25...</a>')
