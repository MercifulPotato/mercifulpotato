Also, if you&#x27;ve ever driven one of these things you will know how low to the ground they are... it&#x27;s not the same as some silly lowered hatchback, the whole thing is _tiny_ compared to modern cars, so 60mph feels you are breaking some kind of ground speed record.<p>This will be a crazy fun car... I will kinda miss the manual transmission - I guess i&#x27;m getting old.')
