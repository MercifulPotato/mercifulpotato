Item(by='dwohnitmok', descendants=None, kids=[25204000, 25205472, 25204392], score=None, time=1606256578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25203038, text='Proposal 1 is the thing I want.<p>Please just list out a total number of steps and log when each of those steps is completed (with a short message describing what the step is so that we don&#x27;t end up back on square one with fractional progress bars). If possible make the steps granular enough so that a step can be completed in under a second (so this may be hundreds or thousands of steps depending on the task length). In the case of say &quot;bytes currently downloaded&quot; this becomes essentially a continuous stream of steps (which is a good thing!).<p>First and foremost what this communicates to users is that the system is doing <i>something</i> useful. This is what frustrates me about spinners. They are functionally indistinguishable from a frozen system, to the point now that users synonymously identify an indefinitely spinning spinner with a frozen system. And progress bars that asymptotically approach completion even when the program is frozen have trained users to be similarly suspicious of progress bars.<p>Secondarily it offers the same vague assurances as a progress bar about approximately how much time is left. If you see 250 GB out of 500 GB downloaded you&#x27;ll assume that you&#x27;re half-way there, similarly if you see 250 steps out of 500 completed. Especially in the case of the latter, there&#x27;s no guarantee that the total elapsed time is already 50% over, but that&#x27;s true of progress bars as well.<p>Finally, if something goes wrong, there&#x27;s usually a useful error message that can be shown since there&#x27;s the context of all the previous steps that led up to this error.')
