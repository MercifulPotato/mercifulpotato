The sound the music the writing.  It is all a lie.  Someone made it up and a group of people made it &#x27;real&#x27;.  But it is not real.  The one thing that really nailed that home to me was the movie cobra.  In the middle of a big fight he stops and drinks a coors beer.  They had to stage it, film it, edit and foley it.  There is a fractionally small amount of things we see on TV or movies that is real.  Even what we watch on the news is an edited show done for effect.  Once you know how the sausage is made the &#x27;magic&#x27; is gone.<p>My biggest gripe with many movies is pacing.  It is hard to get just right.  You either move to fast and everything is a blur, or too slow and it is &#x27;boring&#x27;.  That is just me though.  I enjoyed GI Joe but it is not something I am going to go back and re-watch anytime soon.  Something like John Wick I have watched it a few times since it came out.  It is full to the brim with tropes.  But they are done very well.')
