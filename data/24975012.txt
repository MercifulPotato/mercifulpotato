It was planned and designed pre-ridesharing and instead of making $2 million in the first two years, it cost $860 million to operate.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eastbaytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;27&#x2F;barts-oakland-airport-connector-losing-money-uber-lyft-to-blame&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eastbaytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;27&#x2F;barts-oakland-airpor...</a><p>Now if technological progress in transportation were to completely stall, I&#x27;d agree that it likely would make sense, but the last thing I want as a taxpayer is a very expensive project that is eventually outcompeted by advances in ridesharing in the time it takes to build out the network. Given that there is no lack of public transportation boondoggles that have left taxpayers holding the bag, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to ask questions and exhibit some skepticism, especially when the population density is below 8000 people per square mile.<p>In places like NYC, I would be in complete agreement with you as the population density would dictates that only a subway would ever make sense because you simply don&#x27;t have the road system relative to population density for a ridesharing solution to ever make sense.<p>Lastly, I commented in good faith, but this condescension, &quot;but it seems like you have an opinion and you&#x27;re looking for a way to defend it&quot;, doesn&#x27;t exactly help you garner support for what you&#x27;re trying to achieve.  That&#x27;s also the kind of accusation that comes from someone accusing others of doing something they are guilty of. Perhaps it&#x27;s you that has an opinion that you&#x27;re looking for a way to defend?')
