The DoD funding is framed in this context (and 60 years ago, NASA&#x27;s as well - when it was almost 10x the fraction of GDP that it is today).<p>If people think there is an existential threat to their way of life, it&#x27;s hard to convince them to take from that pocket to fund something more fanciful and likely only relevant generations away (if ever).
