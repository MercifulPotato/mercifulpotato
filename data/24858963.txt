For most cases you&#x27;ll need a controller, but setting one up can be daunting with the various options and having most of them under constant change with varying documentation.<p>This is why things like K3s will bundle Traefik with it to save you the pain, but really this should be the standard. It should be swappable (like it is in K3s), but come with something already available.<p>Updated - Thanks for the reminder - it&#x27;s ingress controller, not ingress.')
