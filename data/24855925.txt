For instance, even if your bank uses nothing but AGPLed software, you can&#x27;t just &quot;git clone&quot; their code and run your own fork of their online banking site.<p>Or: even if Facebook were thoroughly AGPLed, running your own copy would be next to useless because only you and three other people would be there.<p>Not having a copy of the exact software that services are running is not what is gnawing away at your freedom. It&#x27;s completely the wrong problem to be focusing on.')
