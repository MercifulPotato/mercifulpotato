RH is paid for this, and theoretically passes on some of that payment in the form of commission-free trades.<p>It&#x27;s more complicated than that (even defining &quot;better prices&quot; is an unsolvable problem), but if you take that at face value, it&#x27;s easy to understand by the practice isn&#x27;t immediately regulated out of existence.')
