I really didn&#x27;t see the point in grinding for top marks when they were meaningless, but I put in a little effort because I felt like it&#x27;s what I should be doing.<p>At uni, I managed to scrape by for a couple of years doing little work and getting C- to B- marks mostly. Again, doing it because it&#x27;s what I thought I should be doing and I felt obligated to go to university and get an engineering degree since that&#x27;s what smart people are supposed to do.<p>I dropped out when I realized that I had been following the path I was &quot;supposed&quot; to take rather than what I wanted to do.<p>It sounds like OP finally chose a path instead of just following the one that was laid out for him.<p>Note: I don&#x27;t live in the US')
