If you want to build these projects with gradle or maven you still have to invoke MSBuild in my experience. It&#x27;s not strictly necessary AFAIK, but you&#x27;d be giving up a lot of what visual studio offers you for little in return.<p>In general, if you aren&#x27;t already using a JVM language, there is not a whole lot of reason to use maven or gradle. Pretty much every language has equivalent native build tooling that you should be using instead.<p>If you are using a JVM language, even for part of your build process, then both can be used as the primary build tool and invoke the build tooling of the other ecosystems as needed. This is most useful when you have a native component that you are using from the JVM.<p>I have in the past used gradle to build the native C++ components for apps, but in general it reached out to msbuild on windows, and make files on linux.<p>I&#x27;ve used gradle it to invoke npm commands to build the frontend component of a WAR java webapp.')
