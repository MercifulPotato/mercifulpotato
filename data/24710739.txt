Adding up your income and performing 2 or 3 basic arithmetic operations is not &quot;dramatically&quot; more complicated, nor are marginal tax rate increases dramatic enough to affect any decision about doing more work or not.<p>And with the use of computers and electronic databases containing individual&#x27;s unique ID # (e.g. social security #) and the internet to transmit payroll information, even a marginal income tax does not require employees to do any paperwork.<p>&gt;It also creates arbitrage opportunities to minimize the rate, e.g. hiring your nephew who is in a lower tax bracket and then deducting his wages as an expense from your own taxes even though the money remains in your family.<p>This is irrelevant and I don&#x27;t see why anyone would have a problem with people &quot;minimizing&quot; taxes in the way shown as it&#x27;s above board, and tax policy taxes individuals, not families.  If you want to consider money distributed to other members of your tribe as yours, then go for it.<p>That kind of stuff doesn&#x27;t last too long in my experience though, once people get a taste of financial independence, the individuals in a &quot;family&quot; start looking out for themselves first.')
