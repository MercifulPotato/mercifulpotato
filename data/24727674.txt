One set of hypotheses about this are population bottleneck theories[0].<p>As an example, the Toba Catastrophe Theory[1] posits that:<p>&quot;The Youngest Toba eruption has been linked to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution about 70,000 years ago,[28][29] which may have resulted from a severe reduction in the size of the total human population due to the effects of the eruption on the global climate.[30] According to the genetic bottleneck theory, between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago, human populations sharply decreased to 3,000–10,000 surviving individuals.[31][32] It is supported by some genetic evidence suggesting that today&#x27;s humans are descended from a very small population of between 1,000 and 10,000 breeding pairs that existed about 70,000 years ago.[33][34]&quot;<p>Whether such theories are correct or not, they <i>appear</i> to fit with the lack of genetic diversity among humans.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Population_bottleneck" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Population_bottleneck</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Toba_catastrophe_theory#Genetic_bottleneck_theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Toba_catastrophe_theory#Geneti...</a>')
