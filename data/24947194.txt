Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=[24948400], score=None, time=1604094473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946750, text='To be fair, in practice people don&#x27;t choose gRPC as a protocol and serialization standard so much as they choose preexisting gRPC libraries and code generators. Open source ASN.1 tooling sucks while Google maintains gRPC tooling for a great many languages. This is why gRPC, Thrift, etc have so much more mindshare than ASN.1 in the open source community. The only good open source ASN.1 (DER, PER, etc) code generator for C is asn1c. I believe Java has a couple of good libraries. But other than that ASN.1 tooling is a horrible train wreck of broken or abandoned projects that don&#x27;t provide adequate ASN.1 tooling. Many people rely on OpenSSL&#x27;s DER library, but its far too low-level. AFAICT, the same is true for Python and other high-level languages--no open source projects where can you pass an ASN.1 specification to generate (at compile-time or run-time) a full serializer and deserializer.<p>There are plenty of commercial, proprietary ASN.1 tooling solutions out there. Presumably it&#x27;s why ASN.1 has persisted as long as it has in industry. Even Fabrice Bellard sells a commercial solution: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bellard.org&#x2F;ffasn1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bellard.org&#x2F;ffasn1&#x2F;</a> When you have access to good tooling ASN.1 is arguably superior to the open source alternatives as there aren&#x27;t as many broken corner cases that can cause interoperability problems.<p>We only have ourselves to blame. If I ever have time I want to write an ASN.1 spec parser using LPeg that can generate LPeg-based DER parsers. I already have a fairly comprehensive LPeg-based DER parser for PKIX messages, but generating that from an ASN.1 spec is a significant step up in conceptual complexity. While I&#x27;ve written more than my fair share of parsers before, I&#x27;ve never written a proper parser <i>generator</i>, so it&#x27;s a steeper hill to climb for me even though I already have more ASN.1 experience than most.')
