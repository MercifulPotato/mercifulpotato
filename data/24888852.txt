Channels and go routines, I can reason about. (Tho they are slower - I have a runtime stats package that just stuff the numbers into a channel and then returns to the calling goroutine. I did an implementation using Atomicâ€™s and it could sustain like 20x more calls per second before using all the callers CPU. But I still use the channel implementation.')
