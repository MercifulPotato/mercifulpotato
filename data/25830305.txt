Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611034102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829929, text='&gt; That is not the same thing, not what we&#x27;re talking about here, and it is not honest to equate them. People who disrupt rallies absolutely deserve to be removed from those rallies with appropriate force.<p>But saying that punching a peaceful rally attendee is &quot;very, very appropriate&quot; and the kind of action &quot;we need a little bit more of&quot; is not.<p>And asking police to be more violent when handling suspects is encouraging violence (&quot;when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough, I said, please don’t be too nice.&quot;)<p>On Greg Gianforte, the Montana Governer who assaulted a reporter (&quot;Any guy who can do a body-slam ... he’s my guy.&quot;)<p>Then he joked about shooting immigrants:<p>&gt; In his remarks, he asked, “How do you stop these people?” A woman at the rally reportedly yelled “shoot them” in response. Trump then joked, “That’s only in the Panhandle, you can get away with that statement.”<p>Then there&#x27;s the pattern of statements by trump that predict violence against the groups the attacks are aimed at:<p>- Trump calls Covid the &quot;Chinese virus&quot; and plays up its origin to stoke anti-Chinese sentiment. A random Asian family is attacked in a Texas Walmart because they&#x27;re &quot;infecting people with the coronavirus&quot;.<p>- Trump attacks &quot;the Squad&quot; (congresswomen AOC and co), they see an uptick in racist attacks and threats<p>- Trump says &quot;Liberate Michigan&quot; and criticizes the governor for her coronavirus lockdown. Months later, a group of militia members is uncovered with a conspiracy to kidnap and kill her.<p>- &quot;You also had some very fine people on both sides.&quot;<p>- &quot;Stand back and stand by&quot;<p>etc.<p>He has a pattern of tacitly encouraging violence and then making halfhearted condemnations when the violence actually happens. It&#x27;s why when so many people commit violence, they think Trump is asking them to.')
