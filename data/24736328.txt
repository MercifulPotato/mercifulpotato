Our cloud hosted next generation knowledge graph management system is a highly performant database and query optimization engine, and it&#x27;s written 100% in Julia.<p>We love Julia for the same reasons others have stated here: It&#x27;s easy and intuitive to write, making it productive to work with for both our engineers and our mathematicians. It&#x27;s reflection abilities make performance tuning and optimization easier than any experience I&#x27;ve had before. The ability to fine tune the assembly emitted for your hotspots _matters_, and it&#x27;s straightforward to do in Julia. And for the rest of the code, being easy to write, easy to read, and close to the math are all a big win.')
