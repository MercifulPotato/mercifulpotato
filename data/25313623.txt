In our case we have Jenkins and BitBucket. It&#x27;s not in my power to change that, and these tools aren&#x27;t integrated that well (to my knowledge) that you could say which PRs are open and which branch merges into which.<p>Maybe if you have a workflow where it&#x27;s always the same target branch (master) it works, but we often have long standing feature branches that get multiple smaller merges from other branches.')
