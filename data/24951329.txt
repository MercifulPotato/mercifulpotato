Someone looked up the musical information and measured and found a discrepancy. Given that most western music does in fact use 12TET, the claimed &quot;out of tune-ness&quot; was reasonable to note. The problem is that there are cultures and genres of music that do not use 12TET. In the west these are rare, and many musicians would not know about this. But the measurer had the misfortune to be measuring music that did, and thus was incorrect.')
