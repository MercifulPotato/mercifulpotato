We have a program to share salaries between employees internally, based on that and conversations with my lead I understand that I’m not at the top of the salary band. You can probably make 90k before you’d need a promotion to principal engineer or switch to management.<p>Our company is also not aiming to pay above average salaries, as explained company wide by people on a VP-level.<p>Context: 4 years of work experience.')
