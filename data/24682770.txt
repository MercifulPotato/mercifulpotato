We clearly don’t have that last piece today. A recent example is Microsoft building Teams and stealing Slack’s innovative ideas. Now they can deploy massive developer resources on it and take advantage of bundling alongside Office. What recourse does Slack have? Even if Slack had patents to protect their ideas, Microsoft probably has enough random frivolous patents and a large enough litigation team&#x2F;budget that Slack can’t afford to fight. The idea of a “defensive” patent portfolio is laughable - the biggest companies use them to make small companies’ patents ineffective, not to defend themselves in some virtuous manner.')
