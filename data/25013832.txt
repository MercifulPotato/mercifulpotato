That&#x27;s why the republicans have an opening, even on social issues. The &#x27;whassamadda kansas&#x27; guy has made an entire career of noticing this, but nobody listens to him. Particularly hilarious in his last book, &quot;Listen Liberal&quot; was his skewering of the &quot;microfinance&quot; fetish of the &quot;left&quot; -aka, let&#x27;s get the third world in hawk to American userers.<p>It&#x27;s a titanic shift; I&#x27;m old enough to remember guys like Walter Mondale and Tip O&#x27;Neill who made Bernie look like an Ayn Rand fan; they were mainstream democrats who actually did help the working man. Now, even the far left are screeching ninnies who are obsessed with things which would actually destroy the working man&#x27;s life more than the last 40 years already have.')
