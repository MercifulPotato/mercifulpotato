We found some older services which offered similar prints but they were all down and we couldn&#x27;t order anymore. So we decided to build our own service to convert all the pain of our contributions into nice wallart ;)<p>What do you think about it? We would also be very interested in other ideas or designs how to convert data into geeky art.<p>cheers, Matthias and Wolfgang')
