Once a board is supported by the open source community, it is no longer dependent on vendor updates. I think Armbian has a good track record of long term support, and mainline Debian has a fantastic record of it. The RockPro64 (which I mentioned above) doesn&#x27;t even require any vendor blobs.<p>&gt; the ODROID-H2+ kicks the pants off all these devices<p>That device uses an Intel Celeron processor, and probably more power, and costs nearly twice as much. I don&#x27;t consider it comparable to a low-power ARM board outside of a superficial sense. (Nice to know it exists, though; it seems like an interesting middle ground.)')
