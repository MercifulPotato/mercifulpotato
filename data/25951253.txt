I resolve it in three ways:<p>1) I try to make the writing entertaining enough that people won&#x27;t mind reading something they already know<p>2) I added an anchor tag saying &quot;click if you already know this stuff&quot;<p>3) I added tooltips explaining vocabulary words, so if you skipped a section and end up not knowing everything you thought you did, you can use the tooltips to refresh your memory.<p>These three factors I think combine in a really nice way. I&#x27;m excited to post it here when I&#x27;m done with it.')
