Imagine recording a 1-hour long video, only to have some unrelated issue abruptly stopping it all (e.g. the application crashes, or the video camera suddenly loses power), thus rendering an unplayable file because the damned metadata didn&#x27;t get to be written at the end of the file...<p>(luckily there are post-process methods that in some cases are able to restore such broken files, but still, a priori the file will be unplayable)')
