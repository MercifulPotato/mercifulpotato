One can only imagine the comments had HN existed when Marsh v. Alabama was decided. What if some racist wants to hold a meeting in my living room? So a company makes available a <i>free</i> space and then has to allow people to use that in a way they don&#x27;t like? Kind of insane. Plus long lists of accusations against various US politicians, ways in which the US doesn&#x27;t live up to the first amendment, etc.. And of course the utterly bizarre argument (but at least one that actually relates to the real issue) that forcing a company to allow speech on their property constitutes forced speech.')
