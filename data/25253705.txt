Many hours pulling hair out trying to do very simple things (like a page that appears if the user just enters a directory (e.g. &quot;mysite.com&#x2F;stuff&#x2F;&quot; and not &quot;mysite.com&#x2F;stuff&#x2F;page&quot;))<p>I found Jekyll to be much, much, much, much easier to work with than Hugo - I ported a site from dokuwiki and with Jekyll I was done within a day (complete with writing a custom theme), but with Hugo I spent days and days just wrestling trying to get basic things to work before I had even started theming before giving up and just using Jekyll.<p>I am sure there are people who need compilation in 20ms vs 1000ms, but I can wait a couple of seconds if it means I don&#x27;t have to spend days messing with Hugo just to get it to do basic things.')
