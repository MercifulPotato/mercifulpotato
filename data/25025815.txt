Two other situations where this comes up, and in my experience people fail to see this:<p>a) In a standard house (real estate) transaction: One party (Buyer) brings money in. Three parties take money out directly in proportion: Buyer&#x27;s agent; Seller&#x27;s agent; Seller. Buyer wants lower price; All others want higher price. That&#x27;s the payout structure (and the induced incentive structure). It&#x27;s that simple mathematically.<p>b) In a standard job offer, the employer has a budget to spend; they don&#x27;t actually care how much of it is &quot;above the line&quot; (employer taxes, 401k matching, employer&#x27;s contribution to social security) and how much is below (salary, income taxes, employee&#x27;s contribution). If an item below the line changes (e.g. lower income tax), they won&#x27;t offer &quot;lower salaries&quot;. If an item above the line changes (e.g., lower employer taxes), they will. These changes are not immediate, but they converge rather quickly.<p>Yet, in both cases (as in the VC case), many people fail to see that. You have to have enough detail when doing such evaluations until every change is a zero-sum game between the different players -- and it is only at that point that you can evaluate the merits of a rule.')
