Where the independent judiciary branch uses the due process to independently evaluate the situation and decide who wins the case.<p>These safeguards are put in place to counter abuse. They make sure that the laws (and their interpretation) serves the best interests of the general population.<p>Modern workplace politics completely bypasses these principles. If your activism fits a few select topics, you get to conduct it on your company&#x27;s expense. You get to force people to follow the rules you set without any semblance of voting. You get to punish people you don&#x27;t like without any due process. You can respond to any criticism of yourself with an accusation of one of the new deadly sins, and this immediately destroys your opponent politically and financially.')
