One reason being that they have the strongest sense of what true certainty is, and the ability to measure uncertainty relative to that.  For example, proving the efficacy of a vaccine: we really can be extremely certain that a vaccine is effective.  Other areas of study (that I believe are still entirely valid and important), just can&#x27;t achieve that level of rigor.<p>I should note my views may be skewed as the entirety of my career has been as a software engineer at an options trading firm, where we are buying and selling uncertainty in a sense, so we have to be comfortable with it.<p>After writing that all out.. maybe I&#x27;m just confirming you example of constraining uncertainty until there can be certainty, or at least a well-quantified form of uncertainty.')
