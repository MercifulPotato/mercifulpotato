Even if the user wants to install you&#x27;re binary it&#x27;s hard to make it work on both redhat and alpine, if they don&#x27;t want it it&#x27;s even harder. A contrast to this is the extreme monoculture in &quot;mobile Oses&quot; and iOS in particular where even the IM app is more or less dictated by a single small group of people.')
