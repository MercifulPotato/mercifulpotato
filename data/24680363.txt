Sure, they’re fine for the first 20-40 years. But then they deteriorate and the maintenance costs pile up. Tax rates increase to compensate. Wealthy residents who basically run their lives on tax avoidance simply move to a more recently developed suburb and the rest stay and suffer through a broke government, forced to do things like rely on police fines to sustain the budget (Ferguson, MO).<p>The “ring of wealth” moves around over the decades due to the pyramid scheme effect.<p>It isn’t hard to find suburbs with far worse roads and infrastructure than the city of Chicago. Maple Heights, OH, Parma, OH, Euclid, OH. I’m sure Chicagoland has plenty of them, I’m just not familiar with them. You also won’t see any upper middle class people living in these suburbs, not anymore.')
