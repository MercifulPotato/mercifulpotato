This plant is powered by a dam that was built to provide power to that plant.<p>These dams are built in such a way that they need to continue to provide power or the equipment starts to fail.<p>It is also literally too expensive to build and maintain the lines to ship the power elsewhere.<p>Alcoa was more than happy to lease their space to someone who was going to use the power going to their facilities. There isn&#x27;t much industry at this point that would fit.<p>All of the successful facilities that I know of (including my own) seek out cheap power... which happens to also be clean power. Hydropower. Most use existing facilities that were otherwise going to waste.')
