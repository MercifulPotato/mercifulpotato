Local stuff will continue with the local language but all the international dealings can be conducted in English.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much the standart on the internet and the younger generations are already used to it. If a website, an app or a game doesn&#x27;t support your language you simply use English and it&#x27;s all good. From the admin side it&#x27;a also good, many people who are not native English speakers who want to build projects for the global audience would simply start with English as a base language and localise from there.<p>It works fine for the most international thing we have: The Internet. Should work fine for the EU too.')
