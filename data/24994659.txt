A UK company tested these GMO mosquitoes on brown people first. \n&quot;Oxitec conducted pilot releases of its altered mosquitoes in Brazil, Malaysia, and the Cayman Islands, it knew the inserted gene wasn’t inevitably lethal. Lab tests had shown that when the GM males mated with wild females, roughly 3% of their offspring survived.&quot;\nAt first, the mosquito population does decrease. After the population &quot;rebounds&quot;, some of these mosquitoes appear to be hybrids that can reproduce in nature.\nYale study report notes, ‘rare viable hybrid offspring between the release strain and the Jacobina population are sufficiently robust to be able to reproduce in nature.’<p>Who knows what these implications have...<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-019-49660-6#Sec10" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-019-49660-6#Sec10</a>')
