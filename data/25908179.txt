One of the reasons I used the services when they came out was that my driver was likely to be a local who generally knew where things were, but I wouldn’t have to suffer the abuse of regular taxis (try going to Oakland or the sunset at night).<p>As the demographics changed most drivers are more often than not immigrants coming from as far away as Tracy and Sacramento with less local knowledge and potentially a bit of a language barrier, and they’ll often refuse rides just like the pre ride share taxis. I don’t care at all about the national origin of my driver, but it does get frustrating having a driver with little sense of where they’re going and a limited ability to communicate the best route. Taxis at least tended to know their way around if they didn’t refuse to drive me.')
