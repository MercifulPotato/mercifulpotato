SUVs were rare and large pickups were usually only seen in rural areas. Today it seems as if everyone on the road has gone bigger and I feel very small in that car.<p>Whenever I&#x27;m stuck between several SUVs, often with the added disadvantage that the one behind me has its low beams on the same level as my rear view mirror, I can&#x27;t say I feel safe.<p>If I were starting a family, I would definitely want a bigger car, even though I don&#x27;t have any data indicating that it would be safer.')
