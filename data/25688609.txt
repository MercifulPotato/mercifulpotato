There were countless objectors attempting to invalidate the Pensylvannia vote, all echoing each other  on a variety of reasons including voter fraud. Republican house members made very convincing arguments on the floor that caused me to wonder what information I was missing.<p>The democratic house members who argued against the objections easily tore down their arguments. Their largest point with respect to voter fraud was that there were was actually _no_ legal action mentioning voter fraud brought up in the many many court cases launched by Trump&#x27;s team. The reasoning being because lawyers can have their licenses revoked for intentionally lying about serious accusations and no lawyer was willing to put their career on the line for something they had no evidence for.<p>I respect everyone&#x27;s views and consider myself to be somewhat moderate, but damn overall republican house lost a ton of respect from me that night.')
