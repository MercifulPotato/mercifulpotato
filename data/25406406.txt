Tho I&#x27;ll need and am hoping for a more reliable legally sound comment from GitHub or someone who&#x27;s qualified to answer definitively.<p>I&#x27;m also thinking about the case of, like, a typo contribution to a README, and considering if that would give a &quot;contributor&quot; a copyright claim on an owner&#x27;s repo that the owner would need to get a release &#x2F; assignment from when that owner wanted to sell their work.<p>If that did, then it&#x27;s sort of like a very low-effort &quot;copyright troll&quot; action to go around and make very small typo contributions on projects that don&#x27;t have copyright assignment agreements, because then that work is forever beholden to that &quot;contributor&quot; in any future sale due diligence, I would imagine. I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;m incorrect about this, but I do not have the legal background to know either way, hence the Ask HN.')
