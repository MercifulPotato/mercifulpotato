I&#x27;m very sensitive to these kinds of compressor and can literally hear the gain ramping up and down.<p>If you want movies to have lower dynamic range for some reason, use the built-in dynamic range compression that comes with Dolby Digital.<p>If you want equal loudness between different songs or albums, use replaygain. My entire library has replaygain applied and its wonderful to be able to keep my stereo set at a decent level and just press play on anything. Without it you always have to turn the volume knob down first &quot;just in case&quot;.')
