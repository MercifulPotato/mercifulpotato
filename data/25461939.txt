Where the weird artifacts showed up most was when the overtones weren&#x27;t precisely edited the same way. It was especially obvious in stereo, where weird glitches were really obvious hard-left or hard-right because of differences in the smoothing. Even if you couldn&#x27;t identify what happened, it would catch your attention one side or the other. And it took away a lot of the &quot;alive-ness&quot; which I described as making guitar sound more synthy.<p>Here&#x27;s the type of image I was working with: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.music-software-reviews.com&#x2F;image-files&#x2F;adobe_audition_spectral_logarithmic.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.music-software-reviews.com&#x2F;image-files&#x2F;adobe_audi...</a><p>This was back in the latter 90&#x27;s &#x2F; early Y2K, so there might be significantly better methods available for keeping it consistent now.')
