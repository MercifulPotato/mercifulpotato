If you&#x27;re unfortunate to end up in that situation and you don&#x27;t have a laptop with USB-C... you literally <i>won&#x27;t be able to charge your new iPhone</i>.<p>Especially worrying because I don&#x27;t have a personal laptop with USB-C or any USB-C wall warts. I have a lot of friends who don&#x27;t have any USB-C gadgets at all. Kids who finally get old enough for a phone will be in for a rude awakening.')
