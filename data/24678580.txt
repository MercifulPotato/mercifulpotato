You can&#x27;t have wells and septics at high density, though you could probably localize certain things more than they are now.<p>Cities, small towns and rural locals have different costs. Rural areas maintain more kms of road per home, for example. Power&#x2F;Data lines also cost more per home. Maybe these won&#x27;t be necessary in the future, but they are for now. Obsolete is a strong word, still.<p>Like you though, the $10k price tag seems high to me. Is it really this high for the right reasons?')
