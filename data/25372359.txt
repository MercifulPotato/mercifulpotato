There are jobs out there for folks who want 7.5 hour days, but these will not be jobs where you&#x27;re putting feet on Mars.<p>There will be people who want to work long, hard hours on complex problems, and for them, somewhere like SpaceX will be perfect. Just because it doesn&#x27;t fit the ideals of others doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s bad.<p>The key is choice. I doubt anyone is forced to work at SpaceX. I&#x27;m sure they could leave if they had enough, or not join if they didn&#x27;t like the deal.<p>If anything, having it available for people who &#x2F;do&#x2F; want to dedicate themselves to something is a good thing. I think some folks could do to remember that. There are enough easy jobs.')
