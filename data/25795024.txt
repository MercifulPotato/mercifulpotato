We get a lot of &quot;not much bad is said about them&quot; without much comparison to sources that aren&#x27;t funded by them that might be more neutral.<p>In the end it&#x27;s very hard to tell if they are talking about pit bulls or puppies.  Having nothing bad to say about a dog breed known for high profile attacks, dog fighting, and other negatively associated events would be extremely suspect.  Having nothing bad to say about puppies in general is expected of such a benign subject.  I doubt the Gates foundation is either a pit bull or a puppy, but I can&#x27;t <i>responsibly</i> make an assumption even about what side of the spectrum they are from  an article about how suspicious the <i>absence</i> of criticism is for an organization which is supposedly trying to do good as a charity.')
