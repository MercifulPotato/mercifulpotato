I&#x27;m trying to give my VPS access to other computers on my home network. The Pi and my VPS can communicate with each other just fine. For some reason the pi won&#x27;t forward any packets from the VPS, they just seem to drop.<p>I&#x27;ve scoured all config that I could think of, iptables, network adaptors, Wireguard, but can&#x27;t find the cause.
