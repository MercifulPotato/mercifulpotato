I looked around, but didn&#x27;t see much about a few things, which are probably not standard use cases:<p>Do you have thoughts about using this on other systems. Bare metal, VMWare, or maybe even a cloud service without the use of their secret manager? I know it may seem odd, but those are cases where I would think this would be even more useful.<p>How about the use of client certificates for user authentication. Or maybe kerberos tokens for server authentication.')
