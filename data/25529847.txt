Their marketing page said it works on all 2021 models. The detailed list says Series 1, 2, 3, etc.. I thought this feature is really cool. I am going to buy this car for it. I talked to 2 dealers and confirmed the feature. I looked up all the info online but could not find any more details. I bought a 2021 m240i for $50,000 USD. I could have got a heavily discounted 2020 model off the lot. But no, I wanted to be _sure_ I got the digital key. I was really looking forward to using this feature. Guess what.. no digital key. Frantically go searching the marketing pages. I now find a compatibility table buried deep in their web site (this document didn&#x27;t exist at time of purchase) where it has a #7 footnote on the series 2: must be 235i cars running iDrive 7.<p>Thanks BMW! Get your shit together! Anyway, this anecdote is just a taste of what is coming for the car industry. Carplay is only a small preview of the level of integration consumers are going to expect over the next 5-10 years. If they can&#x27;t sort out a digital key across their lineup, they are kind of fucked.')
