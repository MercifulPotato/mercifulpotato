Some notepads might be missing (see pg 11). I <i>really</i> wish the scans were better.<p>1-2: Ideas for a screeps AI. (Screeps seems interesting! From a brief look, it&#x27;s an open-source online MMO&#x2F;RTS for programmers. It&#x27;s seems kind of like an AI tournament akin to Battlecode, but persistent. You write your AI in JavaScript or WebAssembly.)<p>3-5 (top half): Unclear. Maybe from a game idea? Maybe part of the screeps AI?<p>5 (bottom half) - 6 (top half): CPU time calculation for screeps?<p>6 (bottom half) - 10: More screeps notes.<p>11: A table of contents for the notepad(s). Not clear what &quot;3s&quot; refers to. t I <i>think</i> it&#x27;s the name of a game he wants to make. Seems like some of those notepads might be missing?<p>12-15: Idea for a peer-to-peer backup&#x2F;storage system.<p>16: &quot;BLL&quot;, a programming&#x2F;scripting language, probably short for &quot;B... L... Language&quot;.<p>17-18: Nutritional wafer&#x2F;bar notes. (Probably for an &quot;all-in-one&quot; hiking food.) The mention of &quot;future&quot; and &quot;no allergies, minimum ingredients, natural ingredients&quot; makes it unclear whether this was something he tested, or just an aspiration.<p>19-33: More Screeps AI notes.<p>34-40: &quot;Nanites guild&quot;. Either a full game idea, or from a game he wants to make and that he provisionally titled &quot;3s&quot;.')
