Obama is on track to become a Billionaire in the next few years through a mix of capitalizing on clout and the technically-legal process of rewarding politicians after they leave office because it legally isn&#x27;t bribery, but it sends a message to everyone else currently in office that they&#x27;ll get their just rewards for serving corporate interests.<p>I&#x27;m not whatabouting Trump here, fyi.  I think he ought to be held legally responsible for a ton of stuff, but if selling a book about being a whistleblower crosses a line, why wouldn&#x27;t selling a book about being the President?')
