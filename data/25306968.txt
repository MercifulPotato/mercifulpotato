You can plug your amino acid chain into NWChem and have it spit out the system hamiltonian. From there it&#x27;s just using the Schrodinger equation to evolve the system in time. Good luck finding a computer that can do that before the universe goes dark, though.<p>I guess you&#x27;re hoping for some higher-level heuristic that would let us skip a lot of the computation. Maybe it exists. That isn&#x27;t how nature does it, though.')
