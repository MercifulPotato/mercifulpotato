The way we treat animals is the slavery of our time, if not much worse.<p>We keep using words like &quot;cull&quot; instead of &quot;kill&quot; or &quot;mass murder&quot;, as though it&#x27;s not killing if the animal doesn&#x27;t look like us. Just because you&#x27;re more intelligent or more capable than a different kind of animal, that doesn&#x27;t mean that your life is worth more than theirs. And it definitely doesn&#x27;t mean your life is worth millions of times more than theirs.')
