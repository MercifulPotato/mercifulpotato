It would work, of course, but if the sensor fails, or there&#x27;s a bug in the firmware, or if power fails... gas spills everywhere. Whereas if you couple the trigger to a physical phenomenon that doesn&#x27;t need electricity to work, now there&#x27;s only one thing that can fail, and that&#x27;s the part converting the physical phenomenon to a mechanical action.<p>I love computers as much as anyone on this site, but I like mechanical things too. I much prefer mechanical locks to digital ones. Mechanical locks are extremely reliable and well made ones work for centuries. Whereas I wouldn&#x27;t trust a modern fingerprint padlock at all - what if the sensor fails? What if the batteries run out? What if moisture gets inside and corrodes the circuit board? One of the main jobs of a lock is to open when I need it to, and I just don&#x27;t trust battery powered locks to do that.')
