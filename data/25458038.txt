Or to the painters of your walls regarding the color?<p>As an employee you get money for using your skills in the way they ask you, like you ask the waiter to bring you the food you picked, not something he rather wants to bring you.<p>As an employee you are not part of a self-governed community. In a democratic state its the opposite. People <i>pay</i> taxes into a common pool and then (ideally) have a seat at the table to decide how to use it. See how the money goes in opposite direction?
