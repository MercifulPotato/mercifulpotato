I was hunting for merit scholarships, as this has been a tough year and college is pricey, even with the scholarships I have.  For existing college students, most of those I found were for women only, especially for CS.  But I&#x27;m not eligible, because I was born a guy.  fml.<p>Edit: btw the thing that annoys me about this is that I already won some tough and prestigious merit scholarships so I actually would have a good shot at these and probably get one if I applied to several.
