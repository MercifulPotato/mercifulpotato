Are you opposed to the pardon of Davidson?<p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Jaime A. Davidson. This commutation is supported by Mr. Davidsonâ€™s family and friends, Alice Johnson, and numerous others. In 1993, Mr. Davidson was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in relation to the murder of an undercover officer. Notably, witnesses who testified against Mr. Davidson later recanted their testimony in sworn affidavits and further attested that Mr. Davidson had no involvement.  Although Mr. Davidson has been incarcerated for nearly 29 years, the admitted shooter has already been released from prison.')
