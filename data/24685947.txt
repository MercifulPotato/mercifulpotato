Same issues and resolution affect all of the other mechanisms you mention. Talking about those separately would just introduce unnecessary complexity to the discussion without any advantage.<p>So no one would rely on Sleep for periodicity. Getting reliable timing performance out of Windows is... challenging.<p>So ultimately it&#x27;s just simpler to talk about Sleep. Windows developers who have to deal with it understand that same mechanism (which used to be determined by the global timer frequency, which you could adjust by calling timeBeginPeriod) affects all of the different timers.')
