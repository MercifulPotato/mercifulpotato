There are already a ton of inscrutable complexities between all facets of the organization and its products. Trying to add security to all that is like teaching a juggling elephant to ice skate.<p>So you need someone who&#x27;s very good at managing security in the context of all those other problems. That&#x27;s hard to find. It helps to have people who&#x27;ve seen problems in the same general space from a lot of different angles.')
