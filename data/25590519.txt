I quickly gave up on the project, but I&#x27;m sure I poured hundreds of hours into it before that. I&#x27;m not too despondent about it anymore, and learned a lot (it&#x27;s my first ever website, and only one so far!) - it was quite gruelling to manually go through all of the authors and choose pictures and attach affiliate links.. I&#x27;m sure the affiliate links have already expired as there wasn&#x27;t a single buy through them.')
