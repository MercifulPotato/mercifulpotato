I don&#x27;t give the few apps I still use - I try to use self-hosted web services where possible - access to location data, other than those which need it to function (OsmAnd~ etc.). To use some WWII-related terms, &quot;Feind h√∂rt mitt&quot; (seen om german-language equipment, it means &quot;the enemy is listening in&quot;), &quot;En svensk tiger&quot; (a Swede stays silent (so that the enemy can&#x27;t listen in)) or, more tangentially related &quot;loose lips sink ships&quot;.')
