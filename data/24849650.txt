Item(by='Judgmentality', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603299212, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24849570, text='&gt; what actual, specific crime did they commit that warrants a custodial sentence?<p>As another commenter pointed out:<p>&gt; Conviction of 3 felonies including conspiracy to defraud the United States and yet no one is going to jail.<p>Those are crimes punishable by prison sentences, if the judge so chooses to enforce the law.  I bet nobody lost their right to vote either, despite the felonies.<p>Admittedly I am not a lawyer, and I am definitely not an expert on Citizens v. United (which is essential to the arguments being made here), but I still don&#x27;t believe they couldn&#x27;t be put in jail - all it would take is for the judge to have a motivation to do so.')
