And if you need this data, you have to get that data one way or another. What’s so hard about that? Now if you can make a single query to select that data, then great. In most cases there’s enough information to generate it automatically and efficiently and refine it if not. What’s not clear about that? Oh, maybe you have some magical and complicated infrastructure? Well, you have to query them anyway, right? It’s not automated you say? Sure, but you can always get insight from libs like Haxl, made by same Facebook. The magical database tool is a simple and comprehensible example (but still is  brilliant in how well it works). The bottom line is that if dev team is capable of working with graphql, it’s just a better choice. Most of the projects I saw unfortunately are made in such a way that you hope they sticked to the good old Rest, because when you do that, use graphql as rest, the result will be disappointing. But come on, that’s the same as people migrating from react to vuejs bc it’s feels less alien or use mobx and other bi-directional storage instead of relay or redux, they’re obfuscating the problem for short-term benefit.')
