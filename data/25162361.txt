Great Britain is England, Scotland and Wales. Those and Northern Ireland are in the United Kingdom, and Great Britain, Ireland and a bunch of irrelevant islands make up the British Isles. The British Isles are in Europe, but the United Kingdom isn&#x27;t in the European Union, except they kinda still are for the next month and some. But one of the Irelands definitely still is, but the entire island of Ireland isn&#x27;t fully in the European Union, except that they don&#x27;t want a hard border despite the fact that it&#x27;s now one of the outer borders of the EU.')
