It&#x27;s called Newsy<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsy.co<p>Problem<p>I have more than 30 domains that I&#x27;ve bought over the years. I plan to (eventually) do something with them, but meanwhile, they are un-used and just sitting there. I want to use them somehow. I know there are a few impulsive domain buyers out there! :)<p>My Solution<p>I wanted to turn my un-used domains into something useful without me having to do too much work. So I created Newsy<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsy.co<p>It turns your un-used domains into a Reddit-like content aggregator. It automatically crawls the web based on the keywords I provide (or RSS feeds) and creates a Reddit-like content-based website.<p>Over the past few months, we&#x27;ve added following features - memberships, voting, comments, themes, automated newsletters, integration with other tools &amp; monetization by bringing your own ads.<p>Examples<p>Check out some of mine and some of other users who have their domains on Newsy<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dataloco.com<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heystartup.com<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getinfosec.news<p>It&#x27;s still early days for us, but I&#x27;m glad that I am now using most of my 30 un-used domains for somewhat interesting things and everything is pretty much automated so I don&#x27;t really have to do much work on them.<p>Would love for you guys to check it out! Thanks!')
