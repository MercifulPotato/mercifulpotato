Someone who has been in the private sector takes a sabbatical to serve in Congress for a term or two. When they&#x27;re done, they go back to their old job.<p>2. Someone spends their life working on campaigns and for politicians, then gets elected and holds the same Congressional seat for 50 years.<p>I think my earlier comments make it clear I think #1 is an ideal and #2 is at best a bastardization of what we should have, but I tried not to editorialize the two options too much.')
