I just don&#x27;t see any discussion on this topic and it concerns me. Historically, I don&#x27;t see any vaccine which was effective against such a virulent virus, unless it had a much higher rate of immunity. I&#x27;d gamble on 5% odds if the reward was high enough, so 95% immunity sounds good but it&#x27;s only half as strong 97.5% immunity, for example.<p>I do know that the immunity may only be temporary--1 out of 20 cases of the most virulent strains may then have a larger substrate to mutate within, but I&#x27;m not sure if you can get many strains at once, for example. I do know that the flu mutates each year, and I guess I&#x27;m basing this whole &quot;increased selection pressure could cause more mutations&quot; on that fact. When there is less available space for the virus to propagate, it&#x27;s only chance of survival is to be able to infect those who are already immune.<p>In my opinion, we have an immune system crisis here--we need to focus on eating better and exercising more: we have to fight this virus with every tool we&#x27;ve got, but if we wait a few more months it&#x27;s possible that we&#x27;ll get a stronger vaccine. I suspect that&#x27;s why it ended sooner in certain places--I doubt any measure we can take have had any real effect due to the virulence of COVID--it&#x27;s in the air and on surfaces and lives there for days, and is transmitted by asymptomatic carriers--so your uber eats driver driving in their car with the AC will infect your food etc.')
