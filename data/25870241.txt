Item(by='yyy888sss', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611310460, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870164, text='5) Companies in the rest of the world bringing &#x27;boring&#x27; stuff to the masses there. A low cost airline growing in South Asia or a concrete plant opening in Nigeria or modern tractors replacing human labor in India all help raise the living standards. I feel that the level of tech that people in the West have is already pretty good, and there&#x27;s diminishing returns to your dishwasher or TV improving. Having a global economy that gives everyone on earth a $50,000 living standard  though will be a huge improvement.')
