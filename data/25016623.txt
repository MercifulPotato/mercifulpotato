Item(by='gravypod', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604770596, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25016272, text='&gt; As a general rule, politicians will say or do whatever furthers their agenda ... Few politicians have the wherewithal to lead, most reflect (in a focus group driven sort of way).<p>We just saw a focus group questionnaire given to the entire population and, from my position, there was a significant difference from the data being used to drive the political candidate&#x27;s general propaganda and the reality of what our population (in NJ) want.<p>Will elected officials ignore this information (sticking to data from internally run focus groups) or will they change their behavior because of this wide spread pattern in voting?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s that most ppl are against drug laws. It&#x27;s that the laws aren&#x27;t working. They&#x27;re not delivering on what was promised.<p>I&#x27;ve spoken to some people around where I live (coworkers, at stores, etc) in NJ and brought up the ballot. More than half of the people I&#x27;ve spoken to were excited to be able to get good weed legally and on Tinder in my age range a majority of the profiles are &quot;420 friendly&quot;.<p>This is obviously all anecdotal but it would be really cool to see some sentiment analysis by region because I think a lot of people just want access to pot. Someone on the research side of Tinder could probably make a heat map and predict (from 420 friendly profiles) where the next vote to legalize pot will be. Might be a great way to preemptively buy up farm land, set it up for growers, and sell land&#x2F;equipment to people after votes when people want to buy in.')
