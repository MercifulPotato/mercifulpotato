Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed since the 80s:<p>- More wealth and more choices now.\n - More eating out now.  Meals are bigger, sweeter, richer, etc.\n - Less activity now.  When I was a kid, video games were just getting started and most folks didn&#x27;t own computers.  TV &amp; media was less engaging.<p>Food addiction seems more... refined these days.  There is a lot less fat shaming too, although I&#x27;m not suggesting we bring it back.  I think it did have an effect on reducing obesity though.<p>I grew up on fast food and TV dinners, so I don&#x27;t see food being significantly more refined now, but I am aware there are newer ingredients(thickeners, texture modifiers, preservatives, etc).')
