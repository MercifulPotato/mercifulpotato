In fact, good on them for beating everyone to the punch. Nonetheless, they are in a situation where they are the only game in town and should either act like that or be made to act that way.  I mean, if the Edison electric company (they only local power provider) decided to kick me off their grid cause my views don&#x27;t match theirs or for whatever reason, I&#x27;d be screwed.  That&#x27;s why they are treated as a utility, and not just another private company.<p>&gt; DoJ has done fuck all to break them up<p>There is no disagreement here - I am just giving you my opinion on the way things should beÂ©.  DoJ should be more aggressive, but they are hamstrung by laws written in the days of robber barons.  They couldn&#x27;t even break up Microsoft 20 years ago when it was clear that monopoly position abuses took place on a regular basis.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s a fair argument to use against conservatives here<p>I&#x27;ll concede this point.  However, the well known &quot;first they came for the %group% and I didn&#x27;t care cause I wasn&#x27;t a member&quot; applies here.  Cause when they come to demonetize you, ain&#x27;t nobody gonna be around to help.')
