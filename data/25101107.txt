The Store sales would inevitably have to go up – it would become the only way to get software on the device. Not like every user would immediately drop the Mac. I can imagine a non-trivial fraction of users wouldn&#x27;t even notice that something has changed.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t happen right next year, or in one go, but the more I think, the more I am growing convinced that it&#x27;s sneaking up.<p>&gt; <i>It would be widely panned as a ham-fisted move.</i><p>If it doesn&#x27;t affect the bottom line, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. They got away with 4 years of perhaps the worst laptop keyboard of the decade; are getting away with inflicting the TouchBar price tag on tens of thousands of users(1), making devices unserviceable, and even with the matter in question.<p>Given Apple&#x27;s size and user base, I&#x27;m afraid that outside of straight-up illegal activity, there&#x27;s little Apple can&#x27;t get away with. Especially if the janky move is factored into small, cruddy steps.<p>(1) I realize it&#x27;s a lame point, but it annoys me personally')
