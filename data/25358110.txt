Some risks can be mitigated by installing stuff in containers if you don&#x27;t need them to interact with the rest of your system. It&#x27;s conceivable that the whole situation could be improved by a combination of reproducible build and packaging processes, transparency logs etc., but none of that exists today in any way that would provide a reasonable level of protection.<p>Right now the curl|bash-pattern isn&#x27;t any more problematic than downloading an installer from a random page and doing chmod +x;.&#x2F;install.sh or using a package manager installing an unreasonable amount of dependencies.')
