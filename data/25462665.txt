Games exist in an environment and social context. Competitively playing street fighter online is one context, and the way you are suggesting play should happen is probably correct given the established norms of that community. Playing Smash Bros with my kids though? A complaint that I&#x27;m simply &quot;winning too much&quot; is absolutely valid. If my kids never beat me, they won&#x27;t want to play anymore. They can go ahead and change rules to make it easier to win.<p>What&#x27;s more, changing a rule can make a game fundamentally different experience that appeals to a new audience. Simple rules (no sniper in counter strike for example) lead to a different game that a subset of the addressable audience finds more enjoyable.<p>I&#x27;ll finish with taking a quibble with the statement that &quot;winning is not meant to be equally divided among players.&quot; That is true to a degree, but it also should not be overly concentrated among just a few. It is not fun to be consistently dominated and a game where a feeling of success or enjoyment is only accessible to a select few is unlikely to attract much of an audience.')
