Be educating people to be healthy and conscious of their surroundings.<p>Physical exercise and proper nutrition prevent most diseases, but no one talks about it. Why? Cause big pharma would rather you be sick and pop pills for the rest of your life.<p>Make sure you take multi vitamins, eat healthy, are not vitamin d deficient, load up on vitamin C in the winter, exercise, meditate, breathe clean air and 90% of diseases wont touch you.<p>Keep proper distance, practice good hygiene, eat a balanced healthy diet, exercise.<p>Hey look!
