Audiophile industry definitely provides you the spending experience but taht&#x27;s not what I expect from products.<p>Man, its painful on my eyes to even read stuff like that, how you contradict yourself within few lines. It would help to have some rational discussion about pros and cons, but you undermine the pro-Apple side pretty badly.<p>In this case Apple isn&#x27;t doing anything magical or novel, there are similar products on the market for 1&#x2F;4 of the price, looking better, possibly even sounding better. But sure go ahead and buy them, there are tons of folks buying &#x27;quality&#x27; like Bose, Beats or similar.<p>I&#x27;ll keep my cable plugged for my Sennheisers, but my main criteria is sound quality.')
