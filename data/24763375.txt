I dont, but that&#x27;s another discussion.<p>Back to the original question, making programing language and making music are nothing alike in there purposes. Music are specifically made to be consumed while proraming languages or any kind of software&#x2F;protocol&#x2F;standard are meant to be productive.<p>You can argue that people make languages for their own amusement, those exist. However if a language rises to some sort of adoption there was definitely some amount of effort put into promoting it and convincing other people to use it. At that point a language ceases to exist for amusement purpose and become an investment that cost individuals and the whole industry a lot. It better has a good pitch.')
