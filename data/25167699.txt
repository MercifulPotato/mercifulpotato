The 5nm TSMC can explain this, but probably not completely.<p>And that is why I have a doubt about the following statement:<p>&gt; which will make scaling up to more-cores more difficult.<p>Apple has not yet released a CPU for the desktop. But I don&#x27;t see anything that prevents them from removing the GPU, Icestorm cores and multiplying the number of Firestorm cores.<p>In fact, Firestorm cores seem to have a remarkably small surface area and very low power consumption and dissipation.<p>Which is very good for scaling up to more cores.')
