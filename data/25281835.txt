They have no knowledge of the hurricane coming in a month, or the yellow fever next door, or the goings with tax laws back in the metropole, etc. The grand effects of nature and other people outside of your little plantation were totally unknown to our Jamaican.<p>This has been true for eons, and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s mostly still true today.<p>But, strangely, it is a bit <i>less</i> true today. We do have pretty good hurricane predictions now, and pretty good practicing epidemiologists (though with covid it&#x27;s debatable), and pretty good information on the goings on in the capitol, etc.<p>I feel that the complexity of the world is finally being laid a bit more bare, whereas it was more covered before.')
