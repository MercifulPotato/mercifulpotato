The first year the ICE wins quite handily, but the EV chips away over time and after 3-4 years (depending on the local grid and driving habits) is a net carbon reduction.<p>Plus the ICE vehicle is the cleanest it will ever be on delivery day.  Even with modern catalytic converters and engine management ICE vehicles will start to use more fuel and emit more particulates over its lifespan.  EVs get cleaner as the green decarbonizes.<p>Then take into account that ICE worst case scenario for carbon emissions is around town, stop and go traffic, which is what most passenger cars spend their lives doing.  It also happens to be the EV best case, since region braking makes the most out of the available energy.')
