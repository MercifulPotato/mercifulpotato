Say Charlie has decided to go hold that share forever; how is Alice ever made whole?<p>In the only-one-share-exists situation, there&#x27;s no real way out of that. In a situation where more than one share exists, Bob could, say, obtain a call option so that he at least has a plausible way to acquire a share in the future to make Alice whole.')
