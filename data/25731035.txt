When the sun isn&#x27;t cooperative for too long and I find my storage battery being depleted too low, I simply start my engine and start charging the battery using my 12V DC cigarette lighter port.<p>I have 200W of solar feeding a 100Ah 12V battery with an MPPT charge controller and I thought I had calculated enough redundancy to handle up to a week of bad weather, but end up using my alternator to charge when the sun is unreliable more often than I thought I would.<p>PS: Are you using a PWM controller or a MPPT controller? The latter can increase efficiency by up to 30%.')
