Don&#x27;t worry about the noise they generate. They have nothing else to contribute.<p>Here is Hermann von Helmotz on Michael Faraday (who knew no math) -<p>&quot;Now that the mathematical interpretation of Faraday&#x27;s conceptions regarding the nature of electric and magnetic forces has been given by Clerk Maxwell, we see how great a degree of exactness and precision was really hidden behind the words which to Faraday&#x27;s contemporaries appeared either vague or obscure; and it is in the highest degree astonishing to see what a large number of general theorems, the methodical deduction of which requires the highest powers of mathematical analysis, he found by a kind of intuition, with the security of instinct, without the help of a single mathematical formula.&quot;')
