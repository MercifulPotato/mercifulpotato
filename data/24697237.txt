I once made a similar site but for a completely different purpose -- language learning. Unfortunately I never finished it but it&#x27;s still in my TODO list.<p>The workflow was:<p>- you read the sentence<p>- the sentence disappears<p>- then you type from memory<p>- every time you mistype something -- the next couple of words appears for a few seconds and you keep typing<p>That way you not only learn to type that foreign language. But you also memorise the sentence in your short-time memory and you get a feel for sentences are created (order of words, phrases, etc.).<p>PS. Didn&#x27;t finish the site, but I did made a simplified version as an Android app: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tkrajina&#x2F;10000sentences" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tkrajina&#x2F;10000sentences</a>')
