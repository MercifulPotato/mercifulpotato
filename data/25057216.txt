I&#x27;ve tried to engage with a number of Trump supporters, as I&#x27;d really like to understand how reasonable, ethical people could vote for someone I see as so despicable and dangerous. Obviously I&#x27;m missing something, and I honestly don&#x27;t want to think that half the US population is unreasonable on unethical.<p>I&#x27;ve found that the most reasonable people tend to be staunchly pro life. And I can see thatâ€”if you truly believed abortion was murder, it would be reasonable to support almost anyone who might stop it. I don&#x27;t believe that, but I can respect it. Others tend to believe things about the world that I don&#x27;t think are true, like climate change isn&#x27;t a big deal, other countries have been taking advantage of the US for decades, democrats are controlled by the military-industrial complex, etc.  Their conclusions might be reasonable if you take their beliefs as fact, but I think their starting position is flawed.<p>And then there are of course those who aren&#x27;t reasonable.  Those who just enjoy watching Trump troll libs.  Those who want to see the whole system burn. Those who just believe whatever Fox or Breitbart or whatever says.  Etc.<p>I mean, I&#x27;m sure I have my own biases. I <i>despise</i> the very thought of the man, because of the way he acts and how he doesn&#x27;t care about the damage he does. But I&#x27;m sure that feeling makes it difficult for me to see any of his positive qualities, or that someone could (perhaps rationally?) value those qualities over the negative ones I see. So far though, I haven&#x27;t been able to find evidence to change my mind.')
