I tried it for a few weeks and it really changed the way I develop - and I started delivering code faster (this was the bet).<p>Now-a-days, I don’t always write tests first. I definitely fool around or cowboy code sometimes especially when working with something new. Once I’ve figured out how to use the API, tool, or library; I delete my code and write tests to work through what my API will look like, then write my code.')
