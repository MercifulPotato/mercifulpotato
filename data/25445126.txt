Were you using this in a Rust project, or building it from scratch for some other language?<p>For the latter, we do provide libraries for Python, Ruby, Java, Nodejs with the Rust core precompiled. It&#x27;s a tricky CI challenge for us, but shouldn&#x27;t affect users.<p>If you&#x27;re using in a Rust project, then you will indeed need to pull in our dependencies. Though we are pretty lean on dependencies, and I would expect most projects using oso would be using serde anyway.<p>That being said those times you&#x27;re seeing seem very long, even for Rust! Is that building with `--release`? Also, the time to compile it the first time will be slow, esp. including downloading the source. But incremental builds are a lot faster. We do a <i>little</i> caching in CI to make this a bit less painful.')
