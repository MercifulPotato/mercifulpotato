The lower (hardware) level locks are the steps in the cache coherency protocols (potentially including explicit cache line locking signals) that allow an execution unit to, eg, perform a correct atomic compare-exchange operation on a 32&#x2F;64&#x2F;128-bit piece of data.<p>See also, eg, the LOCK prefix on x86 instructions.<p>(disclaimer: I only have approximate knowledge of anything, I&#x27;m not an expert)')
