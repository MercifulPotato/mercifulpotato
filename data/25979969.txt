Got it, maybe consider that your experience isn&#x27;t universal.<p>I don&#x27;t know why you think dismissing legacy code is valid! More code is old than new in the world, and the idea that you&#x27;re only going to run into codebases with the most up to date versions of software seems pretty naive to me.<p>Serverless runtimes have historically been behind on Python versions, Airflow had a hell of a time with dependency issues and Python 2, etc etc.<p>I also don&#x27;t really care whose fault it is - the question isn&#x27;t &quot;is Python morally wrong&quot;, the question is &quot;can I rely on the technology that you offer as the solution to a problem as being actually used by the community and therefore actually a viable solution to the problem.&quot; Python type annotations are not popular.')
