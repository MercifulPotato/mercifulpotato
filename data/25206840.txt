Not only that won&#x27;t be possible (considering people don&#x27;t even always use same variable for something, e.g. Pythagorean theorem being a^2+b^2=c^2, α^2+β^2=γ^2, x^2+y^2=c^2, ...) but is also a bad idea even if it could work as it will imply you&#x27;ve to remember every single emoji used.<p>Again, math is about concepts not what symbol you use for a variable. Using emojis won&#x27;t make anything easier to teach or to understand.')
