People end up homeless because they are cut from society, have no social support to fall back to, no way of supporting themselves. Most commonly they get to that situation due to mental illness and addiction&#x2F;substance abuse is an ever-present comorbidity with that.<p>But the fact is, not having a shelter, running water, a way to cover their basic needs is what amplifies their suffering and dispairs to level where they simply can&#x27;t get back on their feet. They can&#x27;t get a job if you smell, your clothes are dirty and you&#x27;re desperate and hungry. A shelter is a necessary condition I think for getting out of that cycle, and thus a very important first step.')
