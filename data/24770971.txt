Marketers are trying to convince users that 5g is absolutely essential even if you aren&#x27;t quite sure what for yet. The news post I read today listed 4g as enabling video streaming and 5g as enabling &quot;Hyperfast gaming and augmented reality&quot;. What a load of meaningless bullshit.<p>I&#x27;m not going to be one of those &quot;the eye can&#x27;t even see 60fps&quot; people but lets not pretend that 5g is going to be anything but an incremental infrastructure upgrade that won&#x27;t affect people in a non congested area.')
