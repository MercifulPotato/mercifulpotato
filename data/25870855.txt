They&#x27;re widely regarded as not being as good as Google&#x27;s. Since other search companies are not covered by this code because they are not dominant, they will have an incentive to remain non-dominant, which implies that they will have an incentive to not significantly improve their algorithm.<p>Obviously leaving the market will not be great for Google, and staying in the market will not be great for Google. This is from their perspective an entirely crappy situation.<p>Moreover, the entire situation for Australian web users will be harmed by this.<p>But the fact of the matter is, the Australian government doesn&#x27;t care about Australia web users, Australian businesses, or American web search companies. They do not care about free markets or equitable remuneration.<p>Their primary interest is in a certain American media company, because to get the American citizen who heads that American media company on your bad side means you lose government.')
