I work in an office with 10 people (with a few people that also own and operate mask-less bars on the side), my wife works in healthcare treating COVID patients, and I have 2 kids that attend in person public school 2 days a week (who I&#x27;ve also given 2,000 mU to every morning).  None of my immediate family has gotten sick, but nearly everyone at the office, and nearly all of their family members have gotten it.   Some very bad cases.<p>Everyone thought I was weird at first, but the 2nd half of 2020, everyone was taking pills when I passed the D3 bottle around.<p>I also heard tobacco had a positive deterring effect even though doctors were reluctant to state that publicly... so I also would keep a dip in my mouth most of the time in the office.')
