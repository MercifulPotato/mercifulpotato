I was on a medication previously that had a rare chance of causing Stevens-Johnson syndrome (very severe rash with other possible complications). I did some research on it, and the standard approach for the medication is to titrate patients up slowly, and if anyone has a serious reaction they back off to a lower dose and “rechallenge” with a good success rate.<p>Not sure if something like that is possible with the vaccine and patients who have an allergic reaction but I’d be curious to find out if a similar approach of “rechallenging” would work.')
