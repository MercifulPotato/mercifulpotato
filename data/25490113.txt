What there isn’t, is conclusive evidence that lets us say with a 95% degree of probability that masks work. Or carefully designed scientific studies that prove this.<p>Well, if we take the view that evidence doesn&#x27;t require scientific studies then it is just your bullshit vs my bullshit. You say different levels of Covid hospitalizations in districts with mask mandates vs districts without. I say confounding factors. I say the U.S. has high levels of mask use yet still high levels of Covid spread. You say confounding factors. Etc.<p>The entire IT industry is a great example because there is a massive amount of bullshit, cargo culture, and magic silver bullets that doesn&#x27;t really work in it.')
