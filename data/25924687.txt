The dependency graph between the jobs is stored as a bunch of live processes flock()ing on each other’s log files. Once the files are unlocked, the process execs the requested job. This makes the scheduling and error handling code much simpler. Also, right now the dependency graph is dense (a job depends on all previous jobs) but it would be straightforward to thin it out to allow parallel jobs.<p>Overall, a clever trick I intend to steal.')
