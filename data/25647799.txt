I was about to post this exact same thing. It seems like automating the shutter control kind of kills the entire point of having a shutter: a solid manual control of the usage of the camera. I guess it is a bit better than just an LED as at least you can look at it and <i>know</i> its open or closed (can&#x27;t trust the LED to always light) but nothing is preventing it from opening up when you&#x27;re not paying attention, grabbing a quick picture, and closing back up before you notice.')
