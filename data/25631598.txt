This would enable e.g. very precise indications in messages to the end user of what was wrong with the input.<p>In general, because currently it&#x27;s super-ergonomic to return just error codes but more of a pain to return errors w&#x2F; payloads, what you&#x27;ll get in practice is no error payload even when it would be useful, which will end up turning into less-helpful-than-ideal errors for end users, which is contrary to zig&#x27;s goal of enabling the creation of perfect software. :-)<p>I found this thread interesting<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ziglang&#x2F;zig&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2647" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ziglang&#x2F;zig&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2647</a>')
