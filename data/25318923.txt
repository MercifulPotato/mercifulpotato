Nothing&#x27;s crippled, don&#x27;t worry.<p>If my screen is already at 100% brightness then there&#x27;s no HDR effect. 100% brightness is true 100% brightness, the max capability of my backlight.<p>The only difference is that if my screen is at <i>less</i> than 100% brightness, the HDR content can be <i>brighter</i> than the rest of the screen because it has the headroom.<p>Does that make sense?')
