One of my new colleagues on the PM team is a very nice Indian girl and she always says &quot;do the needful&quot; in JIRA tickets and in general email communication. Before she joined the team about 2 months ago I never once in my life heard anyone in America say &quot;do the needful&quot;. I am American and have lived here my entire life. I always thought the saying was slightly funny and almost &quot;cute&quot; in that no native American English speaker ever describes tasks to be done as being &quot;needful&quot;.<p>Where did that saying come from in India?')
