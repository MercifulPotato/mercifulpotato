They are going to tank so hard stock wise<p>Their stock is insanely overvalued, no argument there. But they have one of the largest installed and fastest growing DC charging networks, software that doesn&#x27;t suck, and the most capable and fastest improving driver assist system enabled by a proprietary custom ASIC.
