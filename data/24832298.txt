Being able to buy tickets and send them to my printer from my phone was awesome... having to save&#x2F;share links and go to my desktop to print something, less so. I know I can often show a code on my phone, but there are times and places where wifi and mobile connections aren&#x27;t reliable.<p>I generally just print to a PDF on my phone (or download them directly that way, if that&#x27;s an option). That way, I can get them scanned even if I don&#x27;t have internet. That said, I did use to worry about my phone running out of battery or something, but at this point I haven&#x27;t had my phone run out of battery while I&#x27;m out for several years now, so it isn&#x27;t much of a factor for me.')
