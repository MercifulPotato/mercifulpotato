I agree with Gruber - Apple shouldn’t be policing discussion of their rules.<p>2. Your comment is not the same as Sagaarjha’s.<p>I have clearly explained why, and you have chosen to ignore the points I made, and attack me personally.<p>3. I can understand why Apple is motivated to police certain comments, and I believe the motivations are based on real problems they want to avoid in good faith.<p>4. Despite believing #3  I also believe #1.  Just because they are acting in good faith on real problems, doesn’t mean I think they are doing the right thing.<p>5. I believe we should choose open OS’s and there <i>should</i> be a possibly mandated requirement to be able to install alternate OS’s on Apple decides (and anything else in a wide similar class).<p>Not one thing I have said in this thread defends Apple’s actions at all.<p>I don’t find that it helps us to understand what is going on if we simply portray them as a nasty bully without considering their motivations.<p>If this is representative of ‘unbearable bias’, then so be it.')
