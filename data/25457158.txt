The reason for this according to Mats, is because institutional and structural flaws in our geriatric care system. These flaws made it impossible to prepare and manage the pandemic. In addition to these flaws, Mats also says that counter measures set in place during the year was either too late or too little. Furthermore, Mats says very clearly and explicitly that the responsibility of the institutional and structural flaws in our geriatric care is shared between the government, administrative authorities (gov. agencies), counties and private sector. Even so, the current government (and previous governments) has been well aware of the flaws and the utmost responsibility lies with them.<p>I believe more could have been done, but solely blaming our prime minister is just irrational. For example, the local government in the three biggest regions, Skåne Stockholm and Västra Götaland, made the decision to cut down on the items in their pandemic storage area[3]. Guess what happened when nurses and doctors were asking for more supplies.<p>There are of course other instances where politicians prioritized money over health, which had a negative impact on people&#x27;s lives, which covid-19 only made worse.<p>Also, it&#x27;s my opinion that people in Sweden have largely ignored the restrictions. I base this on the fact that walking to the store to buy food, I&#x27;m the only one wearing a mask and trying to keep a distance. Friends and colleagues report the same. The fact that IKEA (where I live) was packed with people suggest that people don&#x27;t care.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.regeringen.se&#x2F;pressmeddelanden&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;mats-melin-leder-coronakommissionen&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.regeringen.se&#x2F;pressmeddelanden&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;mats-meli...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svt.se&#x2F;nyheter&#x2F;inrikes&#x2F;coronakommissionen-misslyckats-att-skydda-sveriges-aldre" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svt.se&#x2F;nyheter&#x2F;inrikes&#x2F;coronakommissionen-missly...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sverigesradio.se&#x2F;sida&#x2F;artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=7431812" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sverigesradio.se&#x2F;sida&#x2F;artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;arti...</a>')
