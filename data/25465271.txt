I don&#x27;t know how this can be done in user space. You could try creating memory mapped buffers with OpenGL or Metal, with certain arguments you could get an uncached mapping.<p>Another option is looking at ARM instructions for memory barriers and cache flushes. ARM&#x27;s selection of instructions for dealing with caches is much richer than x86&#x27;s.')
