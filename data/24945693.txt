Task parallelism is tailor-made for that kind of problem.<p>Using a dedicated thread, on the other hand, gives you some raw material you can use to solve that problem, but leaves you to handle all the messy details on your own. And doing it the easy way - one short-lived thread for every thing you need to do in the background - is expensive, while doing it the correct way and implementing a thread pool is essentially just committing to Greenspunning your own personal task parallelism library.')
