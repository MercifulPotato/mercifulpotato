If you don&#x27;t have any working or long-terms storage, this is impossible. Developing new insights will depend on internalizing at least some amount of information.<p>The googling to complete some small task (e.g. what was the second parameter&#x27;s type?) -- I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d really consider that thinking, per se. It is definitely something that contributes to our general cognitive load, and the ubiquity of search surely is a welcome aid, as you suggest; there really are too many unimportant things to keep in our heads.')
