I&#x27;m a programmer in my mid 30s. I love computers and programming but modern office life has become unbearable for me.<p>I can’t stand the ego trips, wars of attrition, power struggles, insecurities and of course the wrong system of incentives that pits people against each other.\nMost of the time I feel either extremely frustrated and or angry.<p>I tried accepting that there a things I can’t control and adopt a more stoic approach to it all but it doesn’t seem like I&#x27;m succeeding.<p>A lot of people feel this way part of the time but are able to cope. I believe I&#x27;m just more susceptible than the average person. I&#x27;ve tried different companies of different scales but it doesn’t seem to make much of a difference.<p>Some of you might suggest I am depressed and I wouldn’t exclude the possibility but I know depression well and I don’t believe it’s the case. I very content, even happy with everything in my life except work.<p>I did experience serious mental health problems in my 20s and even though I have been stable and functioning for a long time, it’s still there, more or less buried but who knows for how long.<p>I have some network but not enough that I can just abandon the comfort of my salary. I have a family that depends on me and the pressure to provide is there (at least in me).<p>I know some of you escaped the rat race and there are wise people in here. What can I do?')
