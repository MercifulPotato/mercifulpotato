And yes, by Gödel, this self-hating theory is consistent if F itself is—which means that it has a model (involving “nonstandard integers,” formal artifacts that effectively promise a proof of F’s inconsistency without ever actually delivering it). But this self-hating theory can’t be sound: I mean, just look at it! It’s either unsound because F is consistent, or else it’s unsound because F is inconsistent.<p>I’m not following. What does “unsound” mean here? How can a theory be consistent but unsound?')
