I have a few developer friends who are devout catholics. They are good developer and great people, never had any problems. Most importantly, they never ever publicize or evangelize their religion.<p>On the other hand, I have a coworker who never stop talking about religion to the point where no one wants to work with him and management will never fire him. He basically was a team of one who gets random tasks assigned just to keep him from talking to other people.<p>The point is, if someone who shouts religion or politics or anything that&#x27;s divisive at the top of their lunges, I wouldn&#x27;t touch them with a 10 foot pole.')
