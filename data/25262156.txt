There were other power structures (feudal, religious, etc) that were not colored by caste, and competed with caste to triangulate people.<p>The British Raj took calculated steps to centralize, formalize, and entrench the caste system, shaping it into a form that is recognizable today, where it is strictly tied to opportunity and wealth.<p>It’s worth noting that is a common pattern of colonialism: to divide the colonized people against themselves along arbitrary, existing lines and elevate an arbitrary group, aligning the interest of that group with the interests of the colonizers. It’s a timeless and tragic human story.<p>I’ve only started researching this subject, so if anybody would like to correct or qualify anything I’ve said, I welcome it.')
