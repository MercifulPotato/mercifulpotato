As techdirt said at the time in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20120917&#x2F;17393320412&#x2F;us-government-ups-felony-count-jstoraaron-swartz-case-four-to-thirteen.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20120917&#x2F;17393320412&#x2F;us-go...</a>, the theoretical amount that he could have been put away for was 50+ years with a fine of up to $4 million.<p>That&#x27;s the lifetime that I was talking about.<p>The fact that they were seeking a far lesser conviction, didn&#x27;t stop them from throwing around those figures.  And I&#x27;m sure that Aaron Swartz had to think about those numbers.<p>Incidentally Aaron Swartz wasn&#x27;t even the first programmer to commit suicide while being prosecuted by a team including Stephen Heymann.  That dubious honor goes to Jonathan James in 2008.<p>All of this notwithstanding, the important point is this.  For most of US history, plea bargains were illegal.  The way that they now railroad people into pleading guilty en masse demonstrates that they should still be illegal.  And the fact that our plea bargaining system is so lopsided means that the right to a fair trial is more theory than practice.<p>As a double check on that, consider <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;innocenceproject.org&#x2F;bad-drug-test-leads-to-wrongful-convictions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;innocenceproject.org&#x2F;bad-drug-test-leads-to-wrongful...</a>.  Widely used roadside drug tests <i>that are inadmissable in court</i> have been found in practice to be wrong more than 1&#x2F;3 of the time.  And yet, 90% of people charged wind up accepting the plea bargain.<p>The state literally has no evidence that they can present in court.  And knows that a lot of those people are actually innocent.  But they all get railroaded.<p>Welcome to justice, American style.')
