Not to claim better worse, but I can think of some differences from a teaching perspective:<p>1. BASIC was typically either built-in, or accessible via a single command from the disks that came with the computer. Beginners often get lost trying to install Python. If three beginners independently google &quot;install Python&quot; and follow the first blog that comes up, they will get three mutually incompatible installations.<p>2. The BASIC interpreters were self contained -- you learned a small number of keywords, and everything else had to be composed from them. Python is huge, and some of its keywords are conceptually brutal for beginners. And that&#x27;s before you introduce even a few of the familiar packages.<p>3. Look at the official list of Python keywords. Half of them describe concepts that are brutal for beginners.<p>I&#x27;m not saying progress is a bad thing. The Python ecosystem can be bigger today because code is so easy to transport. It needs to be bigger because more complex programs need that stuff to have a chance of working. But teaching Python involves a dilemma that didn&#x27;t really have to be considered for BASIC: What small subset of this thing do we try to teach?<p>We end up with a subset that looks like BASIC, and we simply tell them how to install it so they have a reliable starting point.')
