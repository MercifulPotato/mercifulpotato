Especially when these measures come with no real risks.<p>It&#x27;s true that they didn&#x27;t know with 100% certainty, and China&#x27;s misinformation about human to human spread in the beginning and not allowing the CDC team in early to investigate certainly didn&#x27;t help either. Maybe these experts, including Dr Fauci, the CDC, and WHO, just made what turned out to be very bad judgement calls and they honestly thought that masks wouldn&#x27;t prevent the spread of the disease. But by far the likeliest explanation in my mind is that these institutions knowingly lied to the public in an attempt to manipulate people into not buying masks, and I still find that to be absolutely unconscionable.')
