But when I did, it just didn&#x27;t fit my workflow that well. For example, I&#x27;m used to pressing command+space and getting system-wide search for all files and apps. This is basically the default behavior on gnome, I just needed to remap the shortcut. I also often move desktops and the &quot;activities&quot; view makes that really simple.')
