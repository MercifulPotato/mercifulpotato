Specially in terms of running multi-regional services, and the challenges that come with that.<p>We run several applications on Kubernetes using AWS (combined &gt;2k req&#x2F;s at peak time), and that was a big challenge for me from which I learned a lot. Specially when you&#x27;re on-call, and one faulty node brings down the entire cluster, that fails over to another region and repeat :)')
