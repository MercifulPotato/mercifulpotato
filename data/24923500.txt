Item(by='outworlder', descendants=None, kids=[24925575], score=None, time=1603915456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24921051, text='&gt; we need some sort of poll test to make sure people are educated on issues before voting<p>In principle, that&#x27;s a great idea. I mean, we do have to take driving tests before we are allowed to operate dangerous machinery. We should be required to take tests before we are allowed to affect the lives of millions of people.<p>You can have a similar argument for parenthood. Require classes before people are allowed to bring another human into their care. Nurses have to, why not parents?<p>The problem with that is that these tests&#x2F;lectures are defined by other humans. This shifts an enormous amount of power into the hands of a few. Next thing you know, you now have a handpicked elite eligible to vote. The US has historically used this mechanism for segregation.<p>Having universal suffrage (which is not yet very universal in a few countries, US included) at least allows the average to smooth out outliers. It does create perverse incentives towards not allowing the population to get TOO literate, otherwise they will be educated enough to see through all the BS.<p>Collectively, we need to focus on improving education for everyone and fighting disinformation. World War 3 has already begun - except it&#x27;s using words, not weapons.')
