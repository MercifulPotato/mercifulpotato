The question is what to do when that becomes unwieldy. And I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that kinda-sorta-programming that tries to incrementally extend stuff like static config languages - but only slightly - doesn&#x27;t work well and is a bad idea. It&#x27;s inconvenient; it results in many of the same issues as a full programming language, and it&#x27;s often really inconsistent in its expressiveness - as in, for any given application thereof you&#x27;re likely to run into limitations.<p>I think it&#x27;s wise to try and skip as many of those intermediate stages as possible. Of course; that&#x27;s not a clear-cut solution strategy either; because what&#x27;s &quot;as possible&quot;?  Exactly how high up the language chain do you need to go; conversely which language (and environment) features are too powerful, rendering the language difficult to contain?')
