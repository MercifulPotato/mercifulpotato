Humanity is not interested in efficiency for the sake of reducing footprint. Humanity is only interested in more. If anything, fridges using more electricity means less electricity wasted (assuming refrigeration is essential and not a waste).<p>This pattern seems to be everywhere. Cheaper electricity: more electricity used. Bigger roads: more miles travelled. More efficient engines: bigger, more powerful cars. Plastic recycling: more plastic used. I challenge you to find any improvement in efficiency which has led to a reduced footprint.')
