The overall consequences for Li-ion batteries are expected to be less because of the much smaller amounts of flammable solvent released and burning in a catastrophic failure situation.&quot;</i><p>Ref: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Plug-in_electric_vehicle_fire_incidents" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Plug-in_electric_vehicle_fire_...</a><p>I&#x27;m not saying batteries are safer than liquid fuels, by the way, because <i>both</i> are <i>much</i> safer than hydrogen.')
