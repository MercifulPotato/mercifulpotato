MSFT says that about everything they release and users are still often left with the feeling that they are guinea pigs testing a very unfinished product.<p>There is <i>some</i> truth to this but when it comes to the core .NET stuff that is pretty solid. However .NET core before version 2.0 was mess.<p>&gt; Reading this makes me wonder who is still using Visual Studio. That IDE is so bad it&#x27;s beyond believe.<p>That is your opinion man. Personally I really like VS.<p>&gt; Why the hell do Windows developers need to install an entire new IDE in order to use the latest version of the .NET runtime? It&#x27;s ridiculous beyond belief.<p>They aren&#x27;t installing a whole IDE. It is an update to the existing VS 2019 version. The newest version of the IDE (which is 16.8) has support .NET 5.0. The vast majority of people that are using .NET core are using the latest Visual Studio 2019 already and this is a minor update (it takes maybe 10-20 minutes to install, so run the updater make a coffee and time you come back you should be good to go).<p>&gt; Really shows that Visual Studio Code is the future. All you have to do is install the latest runtime and update the plugin so it shows you suggestions for all the latest language features. No need to install a new version of Visual Studio Code itself.<p>VS code and other alternative .NET IDEs doesn&#x27;t support many of the things that are typically used around the .NET world e.g. SQL database projects don&#x27;t work in Rider or VS Code (I just tried it with Rider) and I suspect that a lot of the tooling around that doesn&#x27;t work. There probably a load of other stuff (that I don&#x27;t use) that doesn&#x27;t work either.<p>It really depends what you are doing.<p>&gt; This might cause confusion. .NET 5 is basically .NET Core 3.2 but has been renamed to .NET 5 so that .NET Framework 4.x users can finally get convinced to move to .NET Core. They just dropped the Core to make it look more appealing to them, but it&#x27;s still .NET Core.<p>I know a lot of people that don&#x27;t work with Microsoft tech think we are all dumb but we aren&#x27;t all that dumb. Moving projects from .NET Fullfat to .NET Core maybe a large undertaking (depending on the project) depending on how the project is strutured and what tech it uses.')
