It&#x27;s a great flow. git-revert becomes a Ctrl-Z on steroids. I don&#x27;t what to clutter up the &quot;official&quot; history, with all these tiny changes, many of which don&#x27;t even compile. That breaks git-bissect and all kinds of other flows.<p>So the only option is to squash commits. But there&#x27;s something deeply uncomfortable and unsettling about permanently re-writing history. Plus, it&#x27;s nice to have a history of those working commits as an artifact. If I&#x27;m trying to unpack the reason that I did something 9 months ago, then seeing a replay of the code changes is super-useful.')
