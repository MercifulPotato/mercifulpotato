We use it for some things. But not writing SQL is easier than writing SQL. Our data is small enough to fit in memory. Having all the data in memory and just accessible is easier than doing SQL + network round trips to get anything.<p>ORMs: consider yourself lucky. They try to make SQL easy by auto-generating terrible SQL.<p>Testing latency: we want to run many unit tests very quickly without high start-up cost. Launching MySQL&#x2F;PostgreSQL docker containers and running tests against Real Databases is slower than we&#x27;d like.<p>Dependencies: Docker and those MySQL or PostgreSQL servers in containers.')
