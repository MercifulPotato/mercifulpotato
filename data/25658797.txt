The advice is clear, precise and honest.<p>This is the opposite of what you get from new hires&#x2F;juniors: they tend to focus on which stacks matter, what to learn, how to develop, deploy and maintain. Not much real advice on the behavioral side, to the point that people often take trainings for behavioral interviews and memorize “leadership principles” and other nonsense.')
