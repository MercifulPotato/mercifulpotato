Nobody does things for &quot;no reason.&quot;  It&#x27;s more that sometimes we don&#x27;t understand the motivation.  With alcoholics (and drug addicts in general), my guess as to the reason is that it feels good, or otherwise does something for them.  I&#x27;ve been told one&#x27;s first time doing heroin or smoking crack is pure heaven.  People who quit generally do so because it causes secondary problems for them.  And, that makes sense to me, because why quit something that feels good, but doesn&#x27;t cause any other problems?<p>Most of this is pure speculation and extrapolation from my own experience.  I had a short period of time when I was drinking excessively to deal with work stress.  Once I noticed, I was able to stop, because I knew it would cause me problems later on.  Luckily, I never suffered any health effects or legal issues from it, mostly because it was only about a 2-3 week period when I would drink every day after work.')
