Item(by='schmappel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608136884, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441867, text='&gt; I purchased a lifetime subscription (limited promo offer) with mxroute.com.<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, note that &#x27;lifetime&#x27; refers to the lifetime of the company, not the customer. Which underscores the risk of buying lifetime subscriptions.<p>And as much as I like the idea of avoiding recurring costs (I have a &#x27;lifetime&#x27; Plex pass), it seems to me that these can&#x27;t be sustainable for the company on the long term.')
