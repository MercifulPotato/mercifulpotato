Item(by='shagie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611844737, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941000, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve noticed there was a strong push around 2016-2018 to recommend newbie programmers NOT to go to Stackoverflow, but instead to ask the questions straight in the Github issues. Turns out, the problem was low quality questions all along, and that just converted an issue that StackOverflow had solved long ago into burnout for open source developers on Github.<p>I would contend that Stack Overflow hasn&#x27;t solved it.  The &quot;close poor questions&quot; and &quot;why are there so many people who don&#x27;t search first?&quot;<p>As users felt that their questions weren&#x27;t answered as promptly enough on SO or that closing their questions was equivalent to gatekeeping.  This lead many of the people frustrated with not getting support type questions answered on Stack Overflow to go to other places to ask those support type questions.  As the tooling around GitHub issues as support has been poor (and the number of people asking questions far outstrips the number of people offering support), this is leading to burnout.<p>This is very much a &quot;push it over there&quot; problem.  There&#x27;s been a good bit of history of companies and libraries trying to make Stack Overflow their support site ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;search?q=reach+out+is%3Aq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;search?q=reach+out+is%3Aq</a> )<p>&gt; Github needs to step up their game and give authors more powerful tools, there&#x27;s so many entitled developers out there that will come and demand changes. It might make new devs feel less welcome, but the balance is tipped way too much to allow anyone to create massive spam for projects right now.<p>Absolutely - though that only delays the problem until the entitled developers overwhelm that tooling.')
