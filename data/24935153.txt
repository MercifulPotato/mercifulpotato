As far as I can tell it&#x27;s their first go at it. Previously they&#x27;ve run events for female founders.<p>If you get in you&#x27;ll supposedly get access to assistance from Apple engineers. I don&#x27;t know how extensive that access will actually be, but I&#x27;m dying to find out. Here&#x27;s my application. Wish me luck :)')
