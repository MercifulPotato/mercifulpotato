I used to hang around a lot more gaming community subreddits but I think somewhere along the lines the content shifted towards more crappy karma farming memes and other shit posts as opposed to more discussion based posts.<p>I barely visit &#x2F;r&#x2F;all anymore because most things you find there are just not enjoyable or good. There are still some smaller and sometimes even larger communities on there that are good at managing a nice balance between posts but they become more and more rare to find.')
