I highly recommend it.<p>I haven&#x27;t read Red Star, so can&#x27;t totally compare. But Vabagonds is also about &quot;different society on Mars what does it have to teach Earth&quot;, also by someone from an (ostensibly) communist society... but from a 21st century author of course, and  Vagabonds is not propaganda for a particular singular vision, but more philosophical investigation of alternatives and variations and what can be changed and what ends up the same anyway, social as well as personal.')
