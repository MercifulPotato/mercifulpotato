Why can’t Apple have the freedom to say that they want to build and sell a walled garden, take it or leave it, and let consumers decide if they want it?<p>The whole notion of what qualifies as a quasi-pc is an incredibly slippery slope. Game consoles would qualify as that and given how the lifetime profitably is made up in game sales, having third party app stores would potentially be ruinous for Sony&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;Nintendo. The incentive to spend a lot on hardware innovation disappears when the profits are dried up. Legislation based on business practice just gets to the point of being asinine. Should Apple be forced to sell hardware at a loss or near cost in order to have the privilege of having a walled garden?<p>The user freedom angle here is that people want their walled garden. Personally, I’m happy with the payment security it provides and a decent guarantee of privacy. I’m not sure you realizing that you’re asking for that to be taken away from me and many others who like it how it is.')
