As a co-founder, I originally developed the technology  to do data science at my previous employer, Jump Trading (top quant trading firm like Citadel and Jane Street). As we built it into Conducto, we realized how good it was for our own CI&#x2F;CD and switched course to target that first. Main distinguishing features:<p>* CI&#x2F;CD in Python, not YAML: simple and powerful way to define CI&#x2F;CD pipelines that is understood by IDEs<p>* Trees not DAGs: DAGs are messy. If you&#x27;ve ever traced a node&#x27;s dependencies in a medium-sized CircleCI project (speaking from experience here) you know how frustrating it is to search through a 2000-line YAML file. Trees help your pipelines stay simple as you grow, and they&#x27;re much more useful to look at.<p>* Free mode that doesn&#x27;t suck: Run pipelines on your laptop for free, forever, for you and as many teammates as you want. When you need more scale you can run hundreds of tasks simultaneously in the Conducto cloud.<p>We&#x27;re launching today, and I&#x27;d like to invite you all to check it out. I want feedback as much as I want users, so please look at it and let me know what you think.')
