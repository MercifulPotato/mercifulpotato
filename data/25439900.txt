I can&#x27;t do it when I&#x27;m looking at code that&#x27;s dark-themed if I normally work with that code light-themed.  In that case I have to read the code line by line.  It&#x27;s actually a strange feeling.<p>Some of my environments are dark themed for certain languages&#x2F;environments so it&#x27;s not the dark-theme itself that throws me off but something about the unexpected visual difference.')
