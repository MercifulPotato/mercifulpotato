Item(by='dmurray', descendants=None, kids=[25517494], score=None, time=1608729580, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25516933, text='The SEC decision seems a little harsh on Robinhood. If RH had executed all of its customers orders on the public exchanges, instead of routing any to brokers, it would be in the clear (and a lot of people would be saying how great it was that RH didn&#x27;t take payment for order flow). Directed orders are absolutely fine.<p>But because they chose to shop around for better prices than they could have achieved with directed orders, they had an obligation to pass on more of that price improvement to the customer. How much more? It&#x27;s not clear. Seems like the SEC is hinting at &quot;roughly as much as everyone else does&quot; - brokers shouldn&#x27;t be allowed a business model that subsidises low trading fees with high PFOF.<p>Other brokers subsidise their low or zero trading fees by collecting interest on their customers&#x27; cash balances. This only works when the balances are relatively large. The SEC&#x27;s approach arguably encourages transparency, but I don&#x27;t find either business model particularly transparent - the bigger effect is to discourage brokers targeting smaller clients.')
