Combined with the constant bombardment of stories about the tiny percentage of cases where someone is actually violent and the results are predictable.<p>Frankly, i&#x27;m of the opinion that the vast majority of cops shouldn&#x27;t be carrying lethal weapons into the average traffic stop or whatever other activity is basically 100% safe outside of infinitesimal number of cases which go violent. After all, by pulling over, the person has basically already yielded to their authority.')
