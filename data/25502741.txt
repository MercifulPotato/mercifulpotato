A function is an abstraction layer. Maybe this is just me being unintentionally obtuse because I’ve worked so long in environments where functions or collections&#x2F;modules of functions are the primary organizing principle, but when I encounter “premature abstraction” arguments I don’t generally understand them to mean “sure take those three repetitions of the same logic and write a function, but think really hard about writing a module&#x2F;namespace&#x2F;package&#x2F;class&#x2F;etc”. Am I misunderstanding this?')
