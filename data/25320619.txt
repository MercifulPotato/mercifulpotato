Item(by='danielam', descendants=None, kids=[25320883], score=None, time=1607223322, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320373, text='&gt; It&#x27;s best to start with epistemology, epistemology is the foundation for all works in philosophy, which an understanding of is necessary for not only a good rigor but to know what is possible to know, so you don&#x27;t your waste time.<p>I could not disagree more with this position. This is a common view in philosophy Descartes onward, but it is untenable because to know what can be known presumes knowing what is to be known first. Similar attitudes exist with respect to methodology. Method always follows knowledge of the real. Otherwise, how could you know which method to use? Before you decide to use a hammer, you must first know you have a nail and a couple of planks to assemble. The style of philosophizing that Descartes initiated is ultimately the death knell of philosophy and frankly all knowledge.<p>Epistemology is always done reflexively. We can only examine what knowledge is after we&#x27;ve come to know something. Metaphysics is really the best place to start and on which everything else depends.')
