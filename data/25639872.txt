Item(by='gapan', descendants=None, kids=[25645893], score=None, time=1609803851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25632007, text='&gt; There is no word &quot;gyro&quot; in Greek.<p>Greek here. Yes, there is: γύρω. Means &quot;around&quot;. Same root as the word &quot;γύρος&quot; (noun).<p>&gt; In Greece there are several pronunciations, including &quot;zhee-rohs&quot;, &quot;gee-ros&quot;, and &quot;yee-rohs&quot;, though the latter is preferred.<p>I&#x27;d say not only the preferred, but also the standard one. Others may be used in local dialects. I&#x27;ve never heard of &quot;gee-ros&quot; (with the &quot;g&quot; pronounced either as in &quot;google&quot; or as the &quot;j&quot; in &quot;jive&quot;), by you may hear &quot;zhee-ros&quot; from people in Crete with a heavy Cretan pronunciation.<p>&gt; the last syllable includes a long O and an S, roughly rhyming with &quot;dose&quot;.<p>No, I&#x27;d say it rhymes with the &quot;os&quot; in MS-DOS.')
