I only got into listening to audiobooks last year when I started walking a lot more (due to Covid-19 restrictions). My local public library had a deal with Bolinda where library members could rent audiobooks at no cost. The catch is that (due to artificial scarcity), the user usually has to wait a couple of months before the title they&#x27;re interested in becomes available. It turned out that <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone</i> was immediately available so after listening to that, I continued with the rest of the series. When I became too impatient to wait for the next title to become available, I was able to purchase non-DRM MP3 files from JK Rowling&#x27;s own site, Pottermore.')
