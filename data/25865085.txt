So this is great in an environment where you control the servers, and some day it&#x27;ll be pretty great for almost everybody, but today e.g. you can&#x27;t use FIDO for GitHub. Whereas the older methods did not have this dependency.<p>On the other hand, one really nice thing is that FIDO lets you force employees to actually use organisation mandated security if that&#x27;s appropriate. There&#x27;s no way to force the remote SSH client not to store that RSA private key unencrypted, for example, even if it is company policy to use a 16 character passphrase; but if you issue every employee a Yubikey (picking one famous brand) the FIDO authentication step can <i>insist</i> that a genuine Yubikey was used, that the Yubikey says a PIN was entered and user presence confirmed. The OpenSSH design passes the digitally signed assurance from the Yubikey to the remote server for assessment, so you can&#x27;t just comment out a few lines of SSH client code to bypass it.<p>Should you actually do that? Probably not, but it&#x27;s an option you didn&#x27;t have before. Certainly if your key people already swear they obey a policy requiring this there&#x27;s no harm in enforcing it, is there?')
