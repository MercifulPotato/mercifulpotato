These things are possible, but they require immediate responses and prioritizing efforts becomes impossible.  You simply <i>must deal with these instructions right now</i>.<p>That&#x27;s possible in human terms, with physical workspaces, but it drives people crazy and is practically impossible.  If you view clutter and disorganization as a time bank, or time buffer, you can make judicious deposits and withdrawals that suit you and your environment.<p>[1] Yes, you can run a display with no framebuffer - it is called &quot;racing the beam&quot; and is described in a wonderful book about the Atari VCS titled _Racing the Beam_.')
