Is that the definitive VAT system?  I&#x27;ve not really been following EU legislation for the last few years.<p>The thing that concerns me with the biofuels directive is it&#x27;s requirement for 5% of petrol to be made up of biofuel.  As the cheapest source of this is palm oil, we then end up contributing to the destruction of habitats in Indonesia in order to grow palm oil to burn in our cars.  The EU does recognise this and I&#x27;m sure I read that come 2030, that will be disallowed, but then they will likely need to use Soy or some other oil that will cause even more destruction.<p>I don&#x27;t have any sources for this to hand and I may well have some of this information incorrect.  It&#x27;s been about five years since I researched much of this.')
