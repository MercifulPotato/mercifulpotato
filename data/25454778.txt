HEPA is only useful when you can only pass the air through the filter once, like in hospitals.  A home air filter can push the air through the filter several times, so an MERV8 is just as good as a HEPA and lasts longer.<p>I used a DIY filter to remove wildfire smoke from my apartment.  It&#x27;s just a 12&quot;x12&quot; MERV8 filter taped to the front of a small fan.  It worked well.  I periodically opened my windows to exchange the stuffy air with fresh+smokey air.  After closing the windows, the filter took about 30 minutes to remove all of the smoke inside.')
