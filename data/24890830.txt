Perry[0] (I recommend reading the trial transcripts, they clearly show the ethical bankruptcy of Prop 8).<p>Even better, Obergfell v. Hodges[1] made marriage equality the law in the entire US in 2015.  Better late than never.<p>While I strenuously disagree with the position you held (still hold?) around marriage equality and find such a stance to be illiberal and downright nasty, I also believe that your right to hold that position as a private citizen <i>should</i> be tolerated in a free society.<p>What&#x27;s more, I don&#x27;t believe that your opinions (and actions related to them) as a private citizen should be reason to hound you out of your professional position, unless you used your position to impose those opinions on the workplace you managed.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that some people hold opinions about freedom of thought and the exercise of the political franchise that are as odious as your opinions about marriage equality.<p>And it&#x27;s even worse that such people executed on their illiberal, reactionary ideas to force you from your position.<p>A free society <i>must</i> tolerate unpopular and illiberal ideas, or it&#x27;s not a free society.  Which is why I have decried your ouster from Mozilla in this thread.<p>That said, I believe <i>your</i> ideas about marriage equality are illiberal, anti-democratic and just plain nasty.  But they are your ideas, and in a free society, you are entitled to them.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Perry_v._Schwarzenegger" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Perry_v._Schwarzenegger</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Obergefell_v._Hodges" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Obergefell_v._Hodges</a>')
