I&#x27;ve had many cats who go outdoors and only one really paid any attention to birds at all. They seem to be much more interested in rodents like shrews and voles. This is only my personal experience though, but I really would love to see further study on this, since I have bird feeders and a ton of birds in my yard. I&#x27;m also curious how it might be different in urban vs suburban and rural situations.')
