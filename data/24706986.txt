What if code were inherently less copyrightable when it is more structural and boilerplate-filled? That could be a great thing, but Google themselves might be surprised at how little of their proprietary code qualifies for copyright under this standard.<p>For example, would Google&#x27;s protobuf schemata still be copyrightable? They&#x27;re needed for interoperability, after all. Would Google&#x27;s client-side code for Youtube and Google Docs still be copyrightable? It&#x27;s delivered in textual form to the end-user. Would Android&#x27;s interface code be copyrightable? Probably not, by <i>exactly</i> the same argument that Google has been making before the courts!<p>If Google wins, then not only does Oracle lose, but the institution of copyright might also lose, which is an exciting proposition.')
