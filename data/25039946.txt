Phones with it may need to have &quot;windows&quot; to let the signal make it through the phone case to the antenna.<p>So it basically works outdoors in very busy cities where it&#x27;s worth it to put an antenna every few hundred feet: Most Americans will never actually benefit from it. It won&#x27;t work in their houses or anywhere not very dense urban.<p>Some Verizon stores actually put a mmWave antenna physically inside the showroom so you can see the performance... but it won&#x27;t work when you step out the door.')
