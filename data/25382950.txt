Like the stuff where the rich actually go bankrupt when their businesses fail, or where bankers go to jail for defrauding their customers? Believe it or not when a business goes bust often the jobs don’t disappear, you just get new owners (which sometimes, though rarely can be the employees themselves), and the rich get poorer.<p>I’m not on the left but I agree with the left that right now it’s capitalism for you and socialism for he rich. But that’s because of government intervention, and bailouts, and keeping the status quo in place.<p>That’s why the rich keep getting richer. It’s with government help and regulations.<p>More government, and more taxes will only make it worse. You can’t make something better with more of a bad thing.')
