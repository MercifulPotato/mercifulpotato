You need a particle collider to get free Higgs bosons; you can obtain free electrons by rubbing a balloon on your head.  And electrons are the Swiss Army knife of technology, they are important in every chemical reaction and every electric device.  Higgs bosons will likely never have a practical use.<p>But-<p>I still think we should keep doing particle physics, for a while longer.  We have built up a huge global community of physicists and engineers who do particle physics, and without a way for them to conduct experiments there won’t be any jobs for those people to do, and in 2 generations all that expertise will be gone.  The <i>praxis</i> will be gone.  After all, that’s what technology really is; it isn’t a set of books on a shelf, it’s networks of people, with skills and connections to each other, who can get things done.  Let’s make sure we don’t pull the plug early.')
