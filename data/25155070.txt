Item(by='ashtonkem', descendants=None, kids=[25155183], score=None, time=1605824442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25153831, text='&gt; Apple knows that a user with a complaint isn’t necessarily going to stop buying iPhones.<p>Nonsense. People switch to android all the time. Apple’s sales depend wholly on continuing to meet the needs of their customers and providing perceived value. If they fell behind Android in perceived value, or stopped producing what their paying customers want they would lose money. Relatively high switching costs dampens this a bit, but there’s no magic that keeps Apple customers buying apple products.<p>&gt; I don’t see why a “customer” who is paying in ad impressions is any less of a “customer” than one who is paying in cash.<p>A “customer” who pays in ad impressions is, quite literally, not a customer. They’re a user, at best. The customer is the person who pays the business for a good or service, which in this case is the ad buyer. Google will try to make you happy insofar as it helps them get more money from their paying customers, but the moment there’s a conflict between between the needs of their users and the needs of their customers, the paying customers will always win.<p>Put more brutally, your relationship with Google has more in common with a cow’s relationship with Nike than a shoe owner’s relationship with Nike. Your attention is the product, as much as the cow’s leather is. Just as we don’t confuse good animal husbandry with a genuine interest in the cow’s long term well being, don’t confuse Google offering features &amp; products as an interest in your productivity and&#x2F;or happiness.')
