That&#x27;s currently not possible with Linux for personal computing.<p>I don&#x27;t have any ill will towards Linux, I use it myself at work and home. But I&#x27;m not buying my parents a System76 machine for Christmas because I know the OS is unusable for them while the machines themselves are not well priced or spec&#x27;d for their needs.<p>The closest thing I could buy is a Chromebook, which fits the needs of a kid in school certainly but is a bit weak and ill supported for what they use a computer for.<p>So if I do get either of them a new computer, it&#x27;s going to be a Windows or Mac. Linux options for them don&#x27;t exist. There&#x27;s no way to &quot;reward linux integration&quot; even if I wanted to, it&#x27;s just not realistic.')
