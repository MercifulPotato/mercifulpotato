Eventually we had FB&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Snap et al starting offices here and having massive presences which led to present day. If only the weather wasn&#x27;t what it is, I think we would have reached this ~20 yrs ago.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it is going to be Austin &#x2F; Boulder - but once any of those cities build two equally good employment opportunities, it is going to be a real contender. This is what makes TSLA &#x2F; Oracle move significant: till now what were outposts are becoming real hubs.')
