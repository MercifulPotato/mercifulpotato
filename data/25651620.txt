Unfortunately for Boudin, time didn’t stop on April 30. I doubt he still wants to brag about his city’s crime statistics.<p>&gt; Compared to the prior year, homicides increased 32%, burglaries 49%, and motor vehicle thefts 35% in 2020 according to SFPD statistics.<p>Seems Chesa was speaking of overall crime rate. From the dashboard linked, SF overall crime rate is down 24.5% in 2020, compared to 2019.')
