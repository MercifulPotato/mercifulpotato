I honestly believed in the technical value of it and saw it as a better alternative to Typescript.<p>At the time, the waters were muddy enough with Reason, Bucklescript and OCaml but you could explain it away. The rebrand and change of syntax that came with Rescript was the end of the line for me. Issues like async await have gone unaddressed for years and instead the community is caught up on syntaxes and compilation targets.<p>I turned to Clojurescript since. It solved most of it&#x27;s problems years ago and its functional enough that I don&#x27;t miss the static types. The large standard library also avoids the questions around whether you should use Belt or Tablecloth or any of the other &quot;standard&quot; libraries.')
