It&#x27;s blatantly obvious to anyone who grew up with Asian friends that Asian immigrant cultures, in general, place an enormous emphasis on academic achievement.  My Asian friends had a hell of a lot less fun and free time at home than I did. That work was reflected in higher grades.  It&#x27;s not Asian students&#x27; fault that mainstream white and black culture in the US is less suited to institutional performance.<p>It&#x27;s like if you had purple-striped people who all spent their after-school time at the shooting range and then wondered why the army is full of purple-striped people.')
