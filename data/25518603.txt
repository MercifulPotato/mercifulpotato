This is the biggest killer argument even though a)-d) arguments might seem fancier at first. Sooo many devs just can&#x27;t ever relate to this, because yes - reactgasm is a strong emotion. But you have to think about others. Devs can survive jquery. Marketer can not survive react.<p>So You just stick to css+html+vanilla js+web components(svelte or stencils or whatever). That is based on my 8+ years working as a marketer&#x2F;product owner building billion-grade ecommerce projects.<p>As you have not spent too much time on elaborating your points but throwing out strong opinion to the wild, I will do more or less the same.<p>Happy to discuss in comments though :)')
