If I were to use automation and dynamically adjust parameters during playback and noise littered my tracks I&#x27;d agree with Paul: if I couldn&#x27;t hear that it would be a terrible idea for me to mix the tracks myself!<p>That said, I did find a couple of spots where I forgot to crossfade the edges of punch in&#x2F;out points, so there are quiet but audible clicks.  Oh well.  That&#x27;s what happens when you mix audio with the headphones slightly off to be able to hear if the baby is sleeping poorly next door... :)<p>The point was to have some creative fun and have it quickly.  That&#x27;s what it was, so I&#x27;m happy.')
