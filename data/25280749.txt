It doesn&#x27;t necessarilly define them entirely, but yes it does reflect them.<p>It&#x27;s not that you&#x27;re not a &quot;true Scotsman&quot; necessarily if you say, care about linux primarily in other roles than desktops. You can be perfectly sincere in that, and it&#x27;s valuable even if it only goes that far. But it does mean you are in a different class from people who actually do abjure the convenience of proprietary software wherever possible, and today &quot;possible&quot; absolutely includes ordinary office work and even presentation media creation.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly ok to be so compromised. Everyone doesn&#x27;t have to be Stallman.<p>It&#x27;s equally perfectly fair to observe that these people are not in that class, when such class does exist and other people do actually live the life.<p>You can&#x27;t have it both ways that&#x27;s all. If you want to preach a certain gospel to capitalise on the virtue signal, without actually living that gospel and not actually posessing that virtue, it&#x27;s completely fair to be called out for it.')
