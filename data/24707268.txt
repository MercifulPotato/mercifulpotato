I donâ€™t follow this closely) that hard shots into the side netting either low to the ground or high up are unstoppable. The goalkeeper cannot reach the high corners, and will not fall fast enough to catch low shots, if the shot is fast enough.<p>Mid-high shots close to the side of the goal are catchable, if the goalkeeper guesses (possibly with over 50% chance, if he knows the player or can tell from his approach) the direction of the shot.<p>Problem of course, is maintaining accuracy while shooting hard under pressure. Many players seem to be able to do that nowadays (most of the time)')
