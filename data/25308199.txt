Gamblers at the roulette table also perceive trends where in fact there is only random variance.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that this is only half of the complaints that you see on message boards about this game. The other half, or maybe the majority, is people saying, &quot;I just want to be able to get high and use off-meta weapons and not lose to sweats (i.e. people who are trying) all night.&quot; This type of complaint is fundamentally a request to be matched against lower skilled players, and has nothing to do with the swinginess of matchmaking.')
