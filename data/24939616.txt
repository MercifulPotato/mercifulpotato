You should convert to linear light, interpolate, then convert back to sRGB with the original gamma curve.<p>Practically nobody does this.<p>Even Adobe PhotoShop has this feature <i>off by default</i> which is just insane.<p>Just as with geospatial mappings, there are further nuances to imaging colour spaces. E.g.: Most colour spaces are designed to match some phosphor or LED colour, and do not match the human eye&#x27;s response curves. So almost any &quot;maths&quot; you perform on almost any colour space, <i>even in linear light</i> will introduce colour shifts or other artefacts. E.g.: changing intensity, upscaling, downscaling, blending, etc...<p>A much better colour space would be to use something like ICtCp, which is designed to match the response of the human eye, so that the &quot;coordinate system&quot; would map better to the actual responses of the rods and cones: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ICtCp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ICtCp</a><p>Note how the map of the colours is <i>smooth</i>, because it allocates &quot;coordinate vector bits&quot; to perceptual colours <i>evenly</i>.<p>This is one of the key features of Dolby Vision: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;professional.dolby.com&#x2F;siteassets&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;ictcp_dolbywhitepaper_v071.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;professional.dolby.com&#x2F;siteassets&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;ictcp_dolbywh...</a><p>(Dolby is just about the only organisation that gets this stuff even vaguely right.)<p>All of the above issues can turn up in simple Long&#x2F;Lat coordinates. There&#x27;s always some idiot that ignores the fact that the coordinate density changes with location, or that the cells aren&#x27;t even rectangles near the poles, or that interpolation is not trivial, etc...')
