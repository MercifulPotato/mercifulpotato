I remembered I changed my power supply in anticipation for Nvidias then newest GTX series. But only to learn that a 1050Ti only had a 75W max draw so the new fancy 1kW PSU was completely unnecessary. Also to put into perspective, my Mac mini has a 30W max draw. 30W!!! It’s ridiculous how little energy it draws.')
