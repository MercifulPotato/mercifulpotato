For decades the South west has been depleting all of it&#x27;s aquifers, so wells are getting deeper and with more salt and other mineral intrusions. This is all tied to the global warming. The great lakes are getting wetter, so major canal works to direct some of the great lakes excess to the southern and western water table is the solution. Now the excess water drains unused into the Atlantic ocean - flooding many US&#x2F;Canada riverine communities.')
