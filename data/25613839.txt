It&#x27;s literally a program that is designed to do one thing, but will change a million things in order to do that one thing. It&#x27;s Configuration Management for Infrastructure. Yet so many people have this idea that it&#x27;s something else, like it&#x27;s supposedly simpler or more effective.<p>Saying <i>I want an S3 bucket named &quot;foo&quot;</i> is the same as<p><pre><code>  aws s3 list-buckets | grep &quot;foo&quot; || aws s3 create-bucket --bucket &quot;foo&quot;\n</code></pre>\nDid I need a big fat declarative infrastructure system to make that? No. But people want more complexity and features, and they want to make it <i>look</i> simple. So they write big fat applications and libraries to do that. The idea that there&#x27;s some inherently superior difference of &quot;declarative programming&quot; over &quot;regular programming&quot; is giving people the idea that wrapping everything up in interfaces somehow removes the complexity, or somehow ends up in a better program.')
