As far as I can tell, their second car was the M30, followed by the J30. Those were different (size) classes, so, historically, they&#x27;ve always used different letters to designate different models. While the QX4 (SUV) came out in, what, the late 90s, and ALSO began with a Q, it&#x27;s never been a historical convention to just name all of their vehicles with a Q. There were only 2 &quot;Q&quot; vehicles, and one was actually a &quot;QX&quot;.<p>I suppose you can call the Q superfluous, and then point to BMW if you want another company that just names cars by number, but at least there&#x27;s a well-understood history and progression between the 3 series and the 5 series and the 7 series, but I have no idea what makes a Q60 (big number!) a sporty coupe that used to be a G35&#x2F;G37 and now the QX30 is a small SUV-like-thing, that&#x27;s, I guess, the size of older G35s but that means the Q60 somehow jumped 3 places in the tens column for no apparent reason.')
