What kind of self care must I do so I don&#x27;t feel like shit, and I have a sheet that I use to keep track of what needs to happen. The best part about this is that I get that sweet-sweet dopamine hit from checking a box.<p>The list of things per day: daily chore, morning meds, morning supplements, stretches, breathwork, squats, treadmill miles, chest exercises, dumb bells, kettle bells, fasting until (noon, 2pm, 4pm, 6pm), brush teeth at 6pm, resume fasting at (8pm, 10pm, midnight), did I poop, how many bottles of water did I drink, did I adher to the scheduled diet, take evening supplements, evening breathwork, am I heading to bed before 12:30am, and what was my weight before bed.<p>Such a system (which I am continuing to refine) helps me, a highly randomizing person, get my shit together so I&#x27;m losing weight and feeling pretty good.<p>So, I&#x27;m not sure what you mean when you say habits don&#x27;t work.<p>I think the key is finding the discipline style to ensure we live well considering our environment is way too lax and permissive of unhealthy behaviors.')
