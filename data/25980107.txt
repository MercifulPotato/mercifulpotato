All users are very used to doing what other platforms would call side loading. And all apps on windows have developed their own methods for receiving updates.<p>The Microsoft store for windows is pretty sad. Not because the interface sucks, at least not more so than google or apple ones, but because there isn&#x27;t a real incentive for developers or users to use it.<p>Searching for a ssh client on the windows store shows ZERO free options, and all of them look worse than PuTTY. They are in the windows store strictly for visibility; which is a good use of an app store. But without the major players who don&#x27;t need the limited visibility of that store, they users won&#x27;t think to look there for their needs as well.<p>If Microsoft rebranded their app store the Github app store, Or made some easy pipeline for github actions to publish to their store; there would be a fair amount of people yelling &quot;Embrace, Extend, Extinguish&quot; as well as fearing that microsoft is using the good will of GitHub to get to a similar world of the closed gardens of the others.<p>Lastly, Microsoft has not done so well in the mobile phone markets. Creating an android store similar to F-Droid would be a hard sell and limited appeal. Google very likely won&#x27;t let you install the windows app store from the google app store. Apple will never allow a competitor on their platform _at all_ unless legally required.<p>I don&#x27;t see how a GitHub app store could succeed.')
