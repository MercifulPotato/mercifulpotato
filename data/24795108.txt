Twitter&#x2F;FB though use an algorithmic feed mechanism to reorder the posts which makes sense. I think they should be transparent about how they generate the feed, but I don&#x27;t think you can hold them accountable for the content of a post someone made just because it got reordered to the top by an algorithm.')
