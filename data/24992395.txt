Porting code from OCaml to F# sounds about as painful as moving from Python 2 to 3[1], which while painful, is waaay better than a total re-write. F# has much better libraries and ecosystem (because it is built on .NET). Their frustration was with the libraries and ecosystem of OCaml, not its syntax[2]. So, if they switch to F#, much of their core logic remains syntactically the same, and simply needs reworking (rather than rewriting). They also have to retool&#x2F;call .NET libraries instead of C&#x2F;OCaml ones, of course, but this is really the point of the move anyway.<p>So: better libraries for what they&#x27;re doing, not a total rewrite (just a re-work), preserve the overall codebase&#x27;s structure, less disruption. It just makes good business sense to me.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4239121&#x2F;code-compatibility-between-ocaml-and-f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4239121&#x2F;code-compatibili...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;leaving-ocaml&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;leaving-ocaml&#x2F;</a>')
