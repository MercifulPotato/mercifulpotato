Out of desperation, I applied to a PHP shop, with my only qualification being that I knew Perl, a cousin of PHP. Embarrassingly, I had to admit this in the interview, and even though they let me finish the interview in Perl, I wasn&#x27;t optimistic.<p>A week later, I got a call back that the job was mine. There was a big learning curve, but I picked up PHP well enough to rise up to a leadership position on the dev team. When I was promoted, I learned that when I originally applied, the only other person that applied for the position was a guy who brought a guitar with him hoping that would sell them on the fact that he was a great culture fit. They said if anyone had applied that actually knew PHP, they would have gotten the job by default.<p>I was lucky that no one who knew PHP applied to the job when I did, but it was my hard work that kept me there.<p>Later in the thread you state &quot;Being born in a free country with a working brain and body is most of what you need&quot;. This is the luck of winning genetic, social, and geographical lotteries.')
