You would either need to insulate the whole structure making it all look &#x27;fatter&#x27; and over engineered or you would need to control interfaces between outside and inside structure carefully to be sure that you are not transferring major moment loads near thermal boundaries so that you don&#x27;t have huge structural elements crossing thermal boundaries. Where you can&#x27;t avoid this, a typical strategy is to insulate along a beam or column until the length of steel and or concrete structure has the equivalent U-Value to the surrounding typical construction, whilst taking care to ensure that its all sealed up to prevent vapour migrating through the insulation and condensing on the cold structure thereby creating corrosion problems later.')
