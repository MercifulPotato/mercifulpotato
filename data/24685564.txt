I agree it&#x27;s not all black and white. But one important thing to take into account is salary. I earn now twice as much. I&#x27;m not materialistic but it makes a big difference. It&#x27;s something I didn&#x27;t care about when I chose to work in academia but I&#x27;m increasingly worried about future pensions, health system and social safety net in my country. It seems to go downward and my salary as a professor wasn&#x27;t enough for me to plan adequately.')
