Combined with the basic service package (around 1500~2000 AUD covering 5 years with tricky T&amp;Cs), the car would certainly start to have all sort of problems once reaching the 5 year old mark.<p>1M Coupe is hell of a car, I admit that I regret not buying one when I had the change (for A$65k - today it still worth that much, even more...). However, 1M Coupe in its stock form is way too firm for Sydney road condition (the manual will also be a pain getting stuck on traffic - if it&#x27;s a weekend fun car, no prob at all), I felt a bit neck &#x2F; back discomfort after 30 mins driving my ex-colleagues car, let alone the ride quality (passenger PoV), interior does not live up to its hype either (manual seat adjustment sucks). I am happy that I got the OG F87 M2 with all options as standard that I care (prefer OG M2&#x27;s look in LLB and its interior - still poor for an entry &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;M car at that price).<p>Z3 M is a classic (unfortunately not available in AUDM), worth keeping. E86 Z4 M coupe was on my list when hunting for my next toy car (still A$52k+ now), love the S54B32 engine.')
