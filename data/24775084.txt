Those trash cans that often have solar cell wings and some satellite dishes. They fly way up in the sky.<p>Gravity pulls you down to earth. It gives you weight. Without gravity everything on earth would start hovering and flying around like on the space station. Things in space near earth also get pulled towards earth.<p>Orbit is if you throw something so very fast that it doesn&#x27;t fall back to earth but instead moves on a circle around earth like if you have a stone on a string and spin it.<p>On the moon you can throw a stone very far. On the moon there is no atmosphere that slows it down. If you throw the stone harder and harder it will fly very far until it gets dragged down by the moons gravity. Maybe use a cannon to throw it very fast it will fly past the horizon. If you have just the right velocity it will fly all the way around the moon and hit you in the back of your head.<p>---<p>I think this topic is something that can be explained very well to kids. Also many kids are fascinated by rockets and space. The explanations and visualizations may not always be 100% accurate but I think they do the job.')
