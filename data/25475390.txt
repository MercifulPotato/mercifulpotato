Moderna&#x27;s lower bound was below 70% with a single dose, and Pfizer&#x27;s is below 30%.  That&#x27;s not to say that a single does is definitely not effective, just that there&#x27;s a lot more uncertainty, and so the bounds are much looser.  We also don&#x27;t know whether giving a second dose a few months later rather than a few weeks later would work as well.<p>Depending on supply forecasts, it might be worth running a new trial to get a better handle on the efficacy of a single dose, but going that route now would definitely be a gamble.  Especially since we&#x27;re formulating this single dose hypothesis after having run the experiment and seen the results, which is always a dangerous approach.<p>Still, the data do seem to suggest that it&#x27;s very plausible that a single dose would be sufficient.  If things get bad enough, or supply is low enough, maybe that&#x27;s a gamble worth taking.')
