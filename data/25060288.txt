Things like this have little by little destroyed all of my enthusiasm for technology. I want to be a carpenter now.<p>When I was a kid, I watched with wonder and delight at all the amazing things we were doing and inventing. We were poor so I didn&#x27;t get much tech, but I always marveled at it. I saved up for ages to buy one of those personal organizers that were all the rage in the mid 90&#x27;s. I saw myself as part of a world working together to build a brighter future for all of us, and I think I wasn&#x27;t alone in that.<p>It is true that the seeds of many issues we face today were already firmly planted in those days and that it was unrealistic. But there is value in dreams because dreams tell us who we want to be and give us the engine to get there.<p>Today, I couldn&#x27;t care less about tech, actively see it as a negative influence on human life, and understand the Amish and Luddites alot better.<p>I&#x27;m currently planning to build a farm out in the middle of nowhere and then Apple can have its fiefdom, Google can own everyone&#x27;s data and control what people think, they all can tell people what they&#x27;re allowed to say as our new overlords and I just won&#x27;t care at all.')
