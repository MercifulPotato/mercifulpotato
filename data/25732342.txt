They have every legal and moral right to do so. Rembember that freedom of association is also a thing.<p>At the same time, I recognize that sufficently powerful corporations are practically just another form of government. Does it really make practical difference to you if a government says &quot;you can&#x27;t say that&quot;, vs a monopolist&#x2F;trust&#x2F;cartel saying the same thing?<p>But that only points out the fact that, for example, Facebook should not exist in its current form. That fact that that it is basically the only significant player in its niche points to a spectacular market failure, one likely compounded by unlawful monopolistic practices by Facebook.<p>There should instead be multiple viable competing services in such spaces. If it takes alienating decent sized chunks of the population to eventually get a viable competitor, then so be it. And no Parler is certainly not that viable competitor. But if Facebook&#x27;s actions piss of enough people who are not extremists, then a true competitor might actually start to emerge.<p>The same applies to Apple&#x2F;Amazon&#x2F;Google.<p>---<p>After thought:<p>Seriously who is the #2 competitor to Facebook&#x27;s main service? There really does not seem to be any significant competitor in the English speaking world. While on the other hand, Amazon for example has fairly clear competitors for most of its products, at least in the US. Walmart&#x2F;EBay competes with the shopping, GCP&#x2F;Azure compete with AWS, YouTube Gaming competes with Twitch, multiple streaming services compete with the video and music offerings, etc. Apple likewise has competitors for pretty much all of their offerings. Even Google has competition on most of their products.')
