A few teams stuck with the five speed, but most have dropped to three or four speeds.<p>The Formula E cars still need gearboxes because there isn&#x27;t a single gear ratio that can provide optimal acceleration between 0 and 175mph with an 18,000 RPM redline.  The massive powerband of the motors means that they don&#x27;t benefit from as many gears as piston engines do, but there is still a benefit to having more than one gear.<p>The next generation cars will go dual-motor, presumably each with different final drive ratios: a shorter gear on the front motor for low-speed power, and a taller rear end gear for top speed, but this is speculation on my part.')
