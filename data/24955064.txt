He wasn’t a bad actor by any means but nothing resonates with me, all known his movies are commercial stints and I couldn’t see any depth to his acting other than the known Sean Connery type we’re familiar with. Actors that weight heavier on my scale are for example  Rutger Hauer or Jeremy Irons or even the recently cancelled Kevin Spacey. Sean Connery was the posterboy for that genre and didn’t go beyond that. I liked his look though and he seemed to get sexier and sexier as he got older but that’s about it')
