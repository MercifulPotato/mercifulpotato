Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=[25679802], score=None, time=1610058064, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670782, text='&gt; I assume you trust what Trump says as he’s the biggest supporter of the election fraud<p>No further than I can throw him, he&#x27;s ridiculous.<p>&gt; So when he says there’s election fraud, I don’t believe him.<p>Thats fair. What are your priors on election fraud <i>in general</i>? Do you think it happens or nah?<p>&gt; I think another problem is it’s very hard to disprove a negative.<p>I agree, the system is not set up in order to demonstrate election integrity. Everything is on the basis of trust. So we get this scenario where things look like fraud, but can&#x27;t be proven to be fraudulent because no one is trying to prevent or catch fraud, and then when people have reasonable suspicions because of this, people say &quot;this is normal&quot; and &quot;you can&#x27;t prove fraud happened&quot; but when you point out things that suggest fraud may have occurred, there&#x27;s no way to disprove that.<p>&gt; It’s unknowable, and therefore comes down to who you trust.<p>Well that&#x27;s kind of the point, I don&#x27;t trust people I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t trust people to be honest when no one is looking. I don&#x27;t trust vote fraudsters to be honest about their behavior. And I think its foolish to expect that they would be.<p>&gt; If you look up Trump’s factual inaccuracies so far, unless you already have, then you’ll have a clearer picture on which to base your trust.<p>This doesn&#x27;t rely on trump&#x27;s trustworthiness (or lack thereof), but publicly available evidence and the public record.')
