Organizations want statistics and usage data. People want to be able to connect from anywhere, even when far from home.<p>Saving bandwidth is useful, but I see no future for de-centralized control. The control connection is cheap and allows a lot of things that would be hard with decentralized control -- health monitoring, staged rollouts, instance security updates. You can see this trend even today -- there are all service meshes like Tailscale, BeyondCorp-like distributed systems, hey, even Google Wifi -- which have central control and distributed data.<p>So even if something strange emerges, once it starts taking up non-trivial resources, it will be logged by central server, detected (by humans) as a bug, and killed with a routine firmware update.')
