This is based on my experience living across the street from a 7&#x2F;11 eating primarily processed prepackaged foods, whatever hot garbage wrapped in plastic they had under the heat lamp multiple times a day for a month.<p>Now I mostly eat spinach, lentils, organic granola, yams, brown rice, occasional fish. Cognition is better, sleep is better, energy is higher. I don&#x27;t personally believe the body can get used to processed foods, I think it&#x27;s much more likely that one might simply forget what it felt like to eat a normal diet and feel regular all the time.')
