WSB is...something, but there is actually a rationale behind going long GME. If you think that the new CEO, known for turning dead retail into profitable online content and e-commerce businesses (as I understand it), is going to turn GME around, then buying $12 Apr 21 calls for thirteen cents or whatever it was makes sense absent any notion of a short squeeze or market manipulation. That it was one of the most shorted stocks and there was an obvious opportunity for a short squeeze, and that this seems to all be multiplied by HFT, is quite the force multiplier.<p>It’s not like this is some random event that could happen to any position. There seem to be a number of factors in play, but it’s not random, and it’s not because a meme got popular.')
