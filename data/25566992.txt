People in general don&#x27;t believe that.<p>Everyone recognizes that there&#x27;s tons of great work being done that&#x27;s not commercial, or even commercially-related.<p>This is not a &#x27;deep insight&#x27; of a modern ideal either - people have been very active in their communities since the dawn of time and very well aware of the difference between paid and unpaid work - though admittedly, not always &#x27;fully appreciated&#x27;.<p>&quot;It is less self-evident that I should pick only one computer program to work on based on the needs of my boss, and then do it for 40 hours a week between the hours of 9am to 5:30pm with an hour for lunch. &quot;<p>??? Again, it should be &#x27;fairly evident&#x27; because that you are getting paid, is a measure of the value you are creating for a lot of people.<p>It&#x27;s not &#x27;the needs of your boss&#x27;, it&#x27;s the &#x27;needs of the client that your boss is communicating to you&#x27;. It&#x27;s your bosses job to intelligently make sense of those needs and to divide up the work responsibly.<p>Your &#x27;interest work&#x27; is probably more like &#x27;art&#x27; - it may have some function, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s useful to anyone at all. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with doing something useless, and always some &#x27;good&#x27; in doing something speculative that may prove to be worthwhile ... but &#x27;payment&#x27; is usually a decent measure that the work being done is valuable for someone else.<p>When you serve a coffee or clean a toilet in the cafe you&#x27;re definitely creating some value.<p>When you work for a company that helps the coffee shop do their accounting ... again, value creation.')
