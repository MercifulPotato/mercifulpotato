About 90% of the population are the losers in that game and they damn well know it. When humans get excluded like that, they often resent those who got the better deal and will work to nullify their advantage. With science, you can&#x27;t really say &quot;oh, that doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;, so about the only realistic option is to not care about it, or proudly proclaim you don&#x27;t know much about it, hence the behavior the author has witnessed. If society would even out the system, I would bet much of the impetus for this anti-science backlash would disappear.')
