The study I linked found evidence that it is significantly helpful in the early stages, preventing most hospitalizations from occurring <i>in the first place</i>. There is nothing inherently contradictory between those two propositions.<p>This seems not much different from, e.g., Theraflu. You wouldn&#x27;t call that ineffective, would you?')
