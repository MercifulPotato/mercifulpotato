I would further argue that in the manufacturing world, when it comes to hands on work, tool and die guys are near the very top.<p>Yet at the same time, you talk about cutting the minimum wage.  Tool and die makers (of any sort) aren&#x27;t going to be working for minimum wage.<p>While I don&#x27;t disagree with the importance of American manufacturing, I think your prescription is wrong.  We don&#x27;t need lower wages, we need better education, more apprenticeships, more buy in from industry to spend money on training their employees.  Because sooner than people think, China will have labor cost parity with the US, and we&#x27;ll find that labor cost isn&#x27;t solely the reason they are a manufacturing power house.')
