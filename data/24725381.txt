You could argue that judging someone on the basis of extracurriculars is discrimination in favor of people with wealthy parents.<p>But, there is no current law, on the books, that explicitly says that discrimination in favor of wealthy people is illegal.<p>Instead, the law prevents discrimination &quot;on the ground of race, color, or national origin&quot;.<p>And furthermore, I do not believe that that there has been significant court ruling saying that discrimination in favor of wealthy people, would be equivalent to discrimination on the grounds of &quot;Race, color, or nation origin&quot;, if you are going to make that argument.')
