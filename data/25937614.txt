I have never used Discord.<p>If you think that a company has a monopoly on your social life, that&#x27;s on you. There are lots of chat services There&#x27;s even <i>gasp</i> email, and <i>double gasp</i> group texts.<p>The problem here isn&#x27;t that we need a new decentralized system, the problem is that people are too lazy to use the decentralization we have today.')
