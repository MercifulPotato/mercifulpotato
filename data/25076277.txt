In April 2018, the motto was removed from the code of conduct&#x27;s preface and retained in its last sentence.[6]<p>I know saying Google removed Don&#x27;t Be Evil is something of a trope, but the truth is a little more complicated. And, of course, the presence or absence of this phrase has no necessary bearing on the degree to which they are perceived as evil or not!')
