You gather points for healthy actions you take, e.g walk&#x2F;run a certain number of times&#x2F;distance per month (sync your tracker), you stop smoking (proof of buying nicotine substitutes&#x2F;doctor’a order), you take a yearly checkup at the doc (doctor’s order&#x2F;medical results)... and you get coupons at Amazon, sport gear shops, get reimbursed an Apple Watch. The rebate on Garmin devices comes with no strings attached though.<p>It’s an option to the health insurance contract, so in a way they already have much more data than whatever would be provided (since they process far more sensitive medical data for reimbursement), but as I said  it’s also structurally a subsidiary.')
