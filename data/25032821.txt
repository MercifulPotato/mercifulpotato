I thought we had it bad in Scotland, but this sounds worse.<p>In Scotland there are quite a few places where the council use a different tenement flat numbering scheme from the post office. Edinburgh council for example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edinburgh.gov.uk&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;file&#x2F;24357&#x2F;statutory-addressing-charter#:~:text=Edinburgh%20has%20two%20main%20flat,e.g.%20Flat%201%2C%20Flat%202.&amp;text=For%20the%20traditional%20tenement%20numbering,form%201F1%2C%201F2%2C%20etc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edinburgh.gov.uk&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;file&#x2F;24357&#x2F;statutory-...</a>.<p>&gt; It is recognised that Edinburgh has a unique character which also translates into the flat numbering systems used.\n&gt; Edinburgh has two main flat numbering systems in operation; the traditional tenement numbering system e.g.\n&gt; GF1,1F1 and the modern flat numbering conventions e.g. Flat 1, Flat 2. Where development takes place within\n&gt; properties with the traditional tenement numbering, this numbering system will be retained. New development will\n&gt; be allocated the modern flat numbering convention.\n&gt; Properties in common stairs must be allocated a main street number. Numbers are then allocated internally to each\n&gt; flat for example, Flat 1, Flat 2. For the traditional tenement numbering system, flats are allocated numbers in the form\n&gt; 1F1, 1F2, etc. 1F1 should be interpreted as 1st Floor, Flat 1.\n&gt; The rotation of the internal numbers follows the rotation of the staircase, with the highest number being located at\n&gt; the door furthest from the last riser on the stair.<p>But the post office (by default) uses a simple numbering scheme, which is the de facto standard even though the &quot;legal&quot; address is the one set by the council. Absolute nightmare.')
