It has limitations everywhere. I think people have conflated three problems - 1) Tech monopoly on the internet and 2) Whether free speech is absolute and 3) Does free speech apply to tech companies. In a vacuum, there are different solutions for each. For example, you would break up tech monopoly, but that has nothing to do with free speech. But rather because it prevents competition. For free speech and its applicability, it is ok to legislate and define what it is, like Germany does. But I don&#x27;t really hear a call for that')
