She loves it, though I made a ton of tweaks here and there to make it easier for her to use (specifically a ton of website launchers on her desktop). She got lost in regards to how to use her computer back in the XP&gt;8 transition so it was great to be able to bring her back to that style of desktop and have the system be easier to fix than Windows 8 or 10.')
