Who&#x27;d be responsible for traditional government responsibilities in that case? (such as police, firefighters, water&#x2F;sewage, garbage collection, etc.) I don&#x27;t think unions can take on any of those tasks in any meaningful sense (e.g. do you get 5 firefighter corps from different unions to come to the same fire in an apartment complex?)')
