They&#x27;re not endangered, they are aggressive predators, and Scotland&#x27;s ecology isn&#x27;t obviously in need of them. The fact that they were common half a millennium ago when the ecosystem was very different doesn&#x27;t seem particularly relevant.<p>So if this is just for tourism and&#x2F;or as a vanity project and there are no solid ecological or scientific reasons, I&#x27;m not seeing a convincing justification for this.')
