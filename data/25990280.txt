I&#x27;d like to see some more documentation and a &#x27;get started&#x27; kind of tutorial to make this pretty abstract concept understandable. Looking around the project pages doesn&#x27;t give me much incentive to start using it yet.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a &#x27;Solid for dummies&#x27; kind of approach in the documentation, things are quite technical still. Some easy to understand examples would be nice!')
