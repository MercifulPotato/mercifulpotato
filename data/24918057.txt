Not in the same sense as prescriptions (e.g. Postel&#x27;s maxim, &quot;be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you send&quot;), where you could argue whether or not it&#x27;s a good principle in general or in specific cases. But from my standpoint as someone using sarcasm to point out the absurdity of something, someone taking me at face value <i>is</i> a problem.')
