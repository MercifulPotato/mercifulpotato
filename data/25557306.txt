And I am too lazy to switch to Google or Duck Duck Go. So I sometimes use Bing.<p>I wanted to find the fastest way to make a pizza, but before I could type all that Bing autosuggested with &quot;fastest way to suicide&quot;<p>Am I the only one who finds this highly worrying? If I just think about Nudge Theory [1] from behavioral economics, then autosuggesting such matters seems like it could lead to more self harm.<p>I hope it&#x27;s simply my own filter bubble, and that Bing&#x27;s algorithms are simply suggesting it to me. But I doubt it.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nudge_theory')
