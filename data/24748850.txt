The US does <i>not</i> govern the entirety of the domain space.  Nations have full control over their own ccTLDs, and many (e.g. China and India) absolutely do fully exert that control by censoring outright domains they don&#x27;t agree with.  And there are plenty of other gTLDs that are not run out of the US either, e.g. Radix is a Dubai-based company that runs .site, .online, .store, .space, .fun, .website, .tech, and more, Minds + Machines is a British VI-based company that runs .vip, .work, .fit, .london, and more, etc.<p>All of these enforcement actions against Iran were able to happen because the registries and&#x2F;or registrars in question are US-based companies.  Of course governments are able to enforce their laws on companies based on their own soil, but that&#x27;s also all the US is able to do without the cooperation of other countries.')
