The content was 90% image and 10% text and was extremely annoying to read.<p>It was also inconsistent from other content, as unlike the other &quot;non-story&quot; items, I could not change preferences (ie ignore the content from a site or ignore the topic).  The same set of stories showed up for a week before I just turned the whole feature off.')
