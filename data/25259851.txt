Even given an isolated bike infrastructure with no interaction between bikes and cars, if you hit a rock or a pedestrian or another cyclist and fall, you are going to sustain some type of injury. It takes a pretty major collision to sustain an injury in a modern automobile.<p>There don&#x27;t appear to be great statistics on bicycle deaths per mile and by cause but what I found is in line with my contention. &quot;Cyclists are either 3.4x or 11.5x as likely to die as motorists, per passenger mile.&quot; And that&#x27;s only fatalities, not injuries.<p>And over 80% of cycling crashes are falls, running into fixed objects, or running into another cyclist. Collision with a moving motor vehicle is only about 11%.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bicycleuniverse.com&#x2F;bicycle-safety-almanac&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bicycleuniverse.com&#x2F;bicycle-safety-almanac&#x2F;</a>')
