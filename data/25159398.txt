I&#x27;ve just been always had a lot of ideas I wanted to execute on, so whenever I thought &quot;I wish X existed&quot; I just learnt how to make it myself. That&#x27;s how I got into web development specifically, at high school I wanted to have a better way to organize my homework and events so I built a collaborative task manager with many features (tags, Gantt chart with tasks starting when another ended, shared tasks between other students via teams, different priority assigned to tasks, choosing to see tasks only within a specific timeframe...), all without any prior knowledge of PHP or Javascript. I just watched a lot of tutorials and read through guides and I built it in a few months.')
