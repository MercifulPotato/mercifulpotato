In my stints in energy and banking, I was basically handed a platform and told to run with it - maintain it, expand its functions, work directly with stakeholders, and just do what is needed. The leadership trusted me to handle it, and consulted me on enterprise-wide tech strategies. When a big project came up where I could not handle it on my own, we&#x27;d get support from a project manager, and get some contract help... but it was support, not micro-management.<p>That also gave me control of most of the other points in the article. My team had a collection of people, each basically &quot;owned&quot; one tech stack in the enterprise, and we could run things how we wished.<p>To contrast that, it is modern SaaS companies that I&#x27;ve seen leadership pigeonhole devs onto specific Jira boards, micromanage everything in the name of doing &quot;proper&quot; Scrum, and tell people to stay in their lane.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve just hit the exceptions... the points in the article are absolutely valid differences between companies, I just don&#x27;t think they correlate with SV vs. traditional organizations as much as the author thinks they do.')
