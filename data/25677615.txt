That&#x27;s not going to be captured by any numbers, especially not in a single number nationwide for a place as big as the US.<p>CPI measures something, and perhaps it&#x27;s useful for economists or policymakers, but it has been useless as a predictor for how much income I will need to keep up with expenses in day to day life.')
