Item(by='matthberg', descendants=None, kids=[25437608, 25438052, 25436890, 25435645, 25435711], score=None, time=1608068184, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25415515, text='U+FE0E is really interesting, it forces monochrome emoji usage on the immediately preceded emoji (like a skin tone modifier or any other modifier). I have previously run into the issue of the play-pause characters (U+25B6, U+23F8) being inconsistently replaced with their color versions when I was trying to use them in a UI. It looks like this is a great guarantee that that won&#x27;t happen.<p>Also is it seems hacker news automatically removes emoji, maybe this modifier would allow them to keep them (in b&#x2F;w form) and still maintain the polished appearance.')
