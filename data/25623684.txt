There are some things that are obviously less complex than others. Some things that are obviously more complex than others. And then a lot of gray area.<p>In my experience there is at least a faction of developers, myself among them that have a disdain for &quot;design patterns thinking.&quot; Which I would describe as: spending a lot of focus learning various design patterns, then while coding actively looking for places where those patterns could be put to use.<p>In my opinion this is an anti-pattern similar to overuse of abstraction in simple cases before an abstraction adds to the understanding of the code itself, rather than makes the code more complex.<p>I&#x27;ve seen lists of common design patterns dozens of times, and occasionally recognize several of them as useful examples of things I&#x27;ve actually done in the past or my colleagues have done in the past. But it seems to me &quot;learning design patterns&quot; as an end is encouraging the destructive side of design patterns where you learn something and eagerly look for a use for it.')
