But that is not really a reasonable solution to anything. Going down that route, you might as well not use a phone or a computer at all, and be perfectly protected.<p>People WANT to use software, and the software they want to use will never be available as pure, audited FLOSS. Instead, we need to have ways to let user use software from less trusted sources while still working hard to protect them from it.<p>Apple does this. They put in tons of effort to give you a way to run untrusted software while retaining some amount of trust that it can&#x27;t go too far in endangering you.<p>I find it massively frustrating that these FLOSS projects will not do the same. They will just not even try to protect you.')
