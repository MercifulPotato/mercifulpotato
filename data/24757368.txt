I&#x27;d just be happy if my government had a clear policy on their goal. Do they want to reduce infections or do they want to prevent overwhelming emergency services?<p>Obviously my knowledge on facts is very limitted, I simply don&#x27;t have time for that, but the news still report lots of capacity in hospitals.')
