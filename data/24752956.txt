Because that was what my original comment was about.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re going to have to provide some clarification there, like, all the nuclear waste generated in the history of nuclear power in the United States in the last hundred years? The GAO says the nation has produced 80,000 metric tons to this day. [1] This is in line with Yucca Mountain&#x27;s capacity.<p>It is a bit <i>more</i> than Yucca Mountain&#x27;s capacity as per its  own FAQ: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yuccamountain.org&#x2F;faq.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yuccamountain.org&#x2F;faq.htm</a><p>&gt; Consider that was generated since 1958 when Shippingport opened.<p>So? It still needs to go somewhere.<p>&gt; The government believes that 2000T of waste are generated per year at this stage, meaning Yucca Mountain would be able to house 40 years of new waste.<p>Except it&#x27;s already more than filled by existing waste. And except that&#x27;s at the current level of nuclear power usage which people here are saying should be massively expanded.<p>&gt; At one site.<p>Which is the <i>only</i> site the USA&#x27;s 50 states have been able to agree to establish. Wait, no: the state that actually contains it has <i>not</i> agreed: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ag.nv.gov&#x2F;Hot_Topics&#x2F;Issue&#x2F;Yucca&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ag.nv.gov&#x2F;Hot_Topics&#x2F;Issue&#x2F;Yucca&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; Did the magnitude 7 earthquake near yucca mountain compromise the structural integrity of the proposed storage site? Because if not, then your point is moot.<p>That is <i>not</i> how you do risk assessment for a storage site for waste that will be hazardous for thousands of years, my dude.')
