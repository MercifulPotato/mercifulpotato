Humans are never fully rational, and that irrationality is certainly a relevant element.<p>&gt; employment is very sticky<p>Of course it is. Teaching an employee on your systems&#x2F;way of working costs money and is an element in the decision of whether or not to hire an employee. This decision affects demand and therefore price&#x2F;wages.')
