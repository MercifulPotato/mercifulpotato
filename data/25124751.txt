I get that HTTPS might be overkill for some situations, but it&#x27;s not difficult to use and every client device supports it. If you came up with your own signature-but-no-encryption protocol (maybe something similar to DKIM, actually?), nobody would support it. Even if they did, I&#x27;m sure that some people would use it when HTTPS is a better solution, just because they don&#x27;t understand the tradeoffs.<p>A standardized overkill solution that covers most use cases is probably better than n+1 standards with different tradeoffs.')
