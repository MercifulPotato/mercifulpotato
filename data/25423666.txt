There must be <i>at most</i> three members of any political party. There aren&#x27;t required to be at least two of one party, and nothing in the law requires members of either major party. In practice, it&#x27;s always 3-2 with either D or R being 3 and the other 2, but that&#x27;s practice, not law.<p>It could be 2 Republican Party, 2 Libertarian Party, 1 Constitution Party, under the law.<p>Of course, if a President nominated toward that pattern, even if they had a friendly Senate to confirm them, they&#x27;d need a majority strong enough to be able to hold together without defections on other legislation, because the breach of convention would be punished mercilessly by even the least ideologically opposed members of the opposite major party.')
