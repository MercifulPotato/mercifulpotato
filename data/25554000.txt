Unless something has changed recently, having multiple accounts is permitted by the TOS, as is creating throwaway accounts, as long as all of the accounts abide by the TOS.<p>One of the main reasons for doing this is to separate posting by different subject areas. Maybe you&#x27;re fine with being loose with your personal details on the local subreddit but when you&#x27;re commenting on a subreddit about being an abuse survivor, you don&#x27;t want those posts associated with your other account(s). It&#x27;s fairly common for people on Reddit who get angry about a post to go digging through a person&#x27;s posting history to find something unrelated to hurt them with or to try to discover the poster&#x27;s personal identity.')
