The bar has continued to lower throughout history. To advance this point, you would need to establish a demarcation point where &quot;this time is different&quot;.<p>Above you suggest that credentialed gatekeepers somehow did a better job of protecting the public from misinformation which results in dangerous violence. A cursory examination of history debunks this.<p>The Pulitzer prize (a coveted credential) is named for the originator of &quot;yellow journalism&quot;. Half truths, mistruths and outright fabrications have always been with us. Look no further than the media&#x27;s uncritical promotion of Iraqi WMD as a prelude to war. Experts were trotted out to tell us that Saddam had yellow cake etc. Hans Blix was silenced.<p>If communication can be equated to violence, then the sources of record trumpeting false justifications for war must be the most dangerous and violent of them all. Yet, these are the gatekeepers you suggest are more responsible and accountable. There has been no accountability for this propaganda. Many would suggest that the same methods continue today.<p>Youtube&#x27;s censorship is a natural continuation of establishment gatekeeping. A cynic might even suggest that gatekeeping is the purpose of walled gardens.<p>More of the same, this time is not different. It fits perfectly with historical precedent.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yellow_journalism#Hearst_in_San_Francisco,_Pulitzer_in_New_York" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yellow_journalism#Hearst_in_Sa...</a><p>The appeal to experts and technocracy is a separate error worthy of another discussion.')
