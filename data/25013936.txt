Because they collected everyones id-cards&#x2F;drivers licenses etc in the gate on their way in and then dropped them into a box - unsorted.<p>This meant for everyone that wanted to leave they had to sift through the box.<p>Now my colleague asked them at one point why they didn&#x27;t sort the id cards as they received them and got a scolding to the tune of &quot;can&#x27;t you see how busy we are already? Now imagine if we had to sort the cards as well!&quot;.<p>The next time he was there however it had sunk in and leaving was as fast (or faster) than arriving.')
