You fail to consider that it really is possible for people to have different values and needs than you and honestly and coherently conclude that working at one of these companies is a good idea for them.<p>For the record, I also disagree with a lot of what was written in your post as straight of <i>factually wrong</i>. My manager&#x27;s manager&#x27;s manager&#x27;s manager does know my name, for example. I do work that I choose almost entirely, my work has direct and meaningful impact on a problem I personally care about a lot (my friends and family care a lot too), and I&#x27;ve been able to be one of the primary voices involved in pushing an entire org of hundreds to change a major strategic approach over the last several years. I&#x27;ve never been asked to sign a non-compete.<p>There are problems with major companies. They aren&#x27;t for everybody. That&#x27;s fine. But telling people that they are just <i>blind</i> for disagreeing with you is just awful.')
