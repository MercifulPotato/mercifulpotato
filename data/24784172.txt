No inner descriptions like a cool tech would do. I get that ShowHN is always about bragging something but in this case it&#x27;s just a pretty woman there showing pictures of her wearing earrings that have tech inside.<p>The difference between a pure ad and a cool showing is that the first one shows the entire face of the woman to trigger psychological buying - a technique that works on both sexes. A cool bragging would&#x27;ve shown only the ear, no pretty face.<p>Hence, it&#x27;s a shameless ad, that should not be atop of HN.')
