Item(by='whimsicalism', descendants=None, kids=[25734378], score=None, time=1610384411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25731561, text='&gt; I&#x27;d say I agree with the points in the article over the non-contextual, anonyomous, blanket statement that the crime bill brought (&quot;caused&quot;) mass incarceration of Black Americans.<p>Perhaps it is not an appropriately nuanced claim - I would be curious if there is equal enforcement of the &quot;contextual&quot; clarity  of claims made in all political memes though. My guess is no, and it is also a <i>quite common</i> view among academics that the crime bill is a large link in the story behind mass incarceration.<p>I haven&#x27;t, for instance, seen fact-checking of memes about Russia &quot;stealing&quot; the election or Donald Trump being a servant of Putin, despite those claims being potentially &quot;non-contextual.&quot;<p>You may agree with the points. But does that make it beyond the pale of discussion and must be &quot;fact-checked&quot; away?<p>e: Rather than downvotes, I would be curious what others&#x27; thoughts are here.')
