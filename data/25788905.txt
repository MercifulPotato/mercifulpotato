Item(by='solatic', descendants=None, kids=[25789253, 25790793], score=None, time=1610704245, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25788514, text='&gt; most people don&#x27;t realize that they are paying for digital content and free social services anyway, albeit indirectly, since the ad spendings are included in the prices of consumer products<p>That&#x27;s a zero-sum argument that&#x27;s a bit disingenuous. If you make widgets, and it costs you $5 to make a widget, you can sell 10 of them at $20&#x2F;pop to the consumer for a total profit of 10 * (20-5) = $150. If you spend $100 on advertising, but that advertising helps you sell to 100 consumers, then you can sell them instead for $10&#x2F;pop and make 100 * (10-5) - 100 = $400 profit, so you make more profit AND cut the price in half, so everyone wins.<p>The problem is that advertising is so unfocused that it has both littered the public space and been unable to prove, in many or most cases, that it actually succeeds in its goal of improving both profits and reducing prices.')
