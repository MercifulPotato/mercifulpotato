These terms are meant to, and always will be, necessarily ambiguous; and that is how these terms work best.<p>AI currently cannot 100% give you a track without drums even if you check the &#x27;no drums&#x27; box (because along the way one track with drums was put in the no drums box).<p>Incidentally I&#x27;ve used various searchers (now referred to as) AI for years to try and find tracks requested by clients, it remains somewhat helpful though unable to compete with a human first listening to the human making the request.<p>AI is improving, but it is going to be beyond our lifetime before it replaces communication, human to human, eye to eye.<p>Until AI knows what it means to be human, so it shall remain.')
