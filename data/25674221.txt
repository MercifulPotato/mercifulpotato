There were protesters who broke in to state chambers to disrupt a vote on abortion rights iirc. There&#x27;s also been the same on gun rights votes too. I can&#x27;t find a link because any search for &quot;protest&quot; turns up yesterday&#x27;s events.<p>Everyone wants to use words like coup or insurrection as outrage bait and more clicks and views.
