Obviously some of these things are unacceptable and others are subtle enough to be acceptable.<p>It&#x27;d be like saying that all car driving should be banned because high speed driving is extremely risky. Of course that makes no sense, because there&#x27;s a huge difference between driving 100mph in a neighborhood and just doing 25mph, and it&#x27;s also the reason we have speed limits, which draw a line in the sand, past which we say &quot;this is unacceptable.&quot;')
