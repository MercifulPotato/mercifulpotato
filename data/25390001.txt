Good luck hiring an engineer with advanced compiler courses knowing any of this<p>Honestly, I have no idea why you would want any of those. Can you explain in a few sentences?<p>I written a parser before and it was faster than everything I used that does the same thing or similar. And I haven&#x27;t had any professional or teachers teach me parsing<p>I once wrote a json parser in .NET. It was faster than literally everything I tried but I already know it can&#x27;t touch simdjson and I haven&#x27;t compared it to the new dotnet parser but I imagine they do it faster. I&#x27;m actually confused how people write such shitty parsers when I barely know what I&#x27;m doing. Like are they using a link list or revisiting characters multiple times to parse? (I think two visits is acceptable. One to find the end of a number and another pass to convert the number to value although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not hard to do one pass)')
