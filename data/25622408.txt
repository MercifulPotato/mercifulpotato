It targets mainly various mobile Linux distros but works perfectly fine on desktop as well and is available in flatpak form.<p>Like this all navigation and mapping can share the same data set and no potentially sensitive location related metadata is leaked to a remote server other than what data packs have been initially downloaded.<p>Also the community run infrastructure just needs to be able to store and store and distribute the ~150 GB of data packs covering Earth but does not need to have any extensive compute and memory requirements to handle lots expensive of individual API queries.')
