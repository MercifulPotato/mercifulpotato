(Indeed: witness the &quot;modern&quot; web.)<p>I get that something more enterprisey-feeling with more knobs for programming in the large is more agreeable to the assembly-line programmer in large IT shops, but if you want your browser apps to act nice you&#x27;ll have to suck it up and program natively without the overhead of a framework.')
