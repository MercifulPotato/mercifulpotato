To maintain the integrity of both copies, you then need a layer of events and&#x2F;or listeners on top of that, with a complex and dynamic control flow.<p>Retained mode optimizes for display throughput, which matters a few decades ago. Immediate mode is better for latency and consistency, which are much more important now.')
