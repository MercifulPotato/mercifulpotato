It&#x27;s possible that the shots were taken roughly at the same time and location, minutes a few seconds, depending on whether the photographer had to swap lenses. That said, it&#x27;s not a very useful example when it comes to demonstrating the effect, and the framing with the rows of trees converging make it even worse.<p>There&#x27;s a link higher in the discussion[0] I think better demonstrates how differences in perspective and the distance between subject and background can distort how we perceive an image than photos taken in the same spot. There are two photos of the same socially-distanced line, one taken with a telephoto lens looking down the line and another that was taken with a wider lens from the side.<p>The change in camera position makes the difference incredibly obvious, even more so than two photos shot from the same location.<p>What&#x27;s unfortunate is that the first photo in the link, with the people&#x27;s faces laid out across the frame diagonally, is the more aesthetically pleasing photo and also the more likely one for a photojournalist to shoot. It showcases more of the people present, highlights the emotions at play amongst the people in line, places them in a vibrant and moving city context, and pulls the viewer&#x27;s eye along a specific path. Ask a photojournalist, and it&#x27;s basically the framing that comes to mind when they think &quot;people standing in line on a sidewalk.&quot; And there&#x27;s no question which of the two an editor would choose in pre-pandemic times.<p>But given the social distancing taking place in the line, it&#x27;s also <i>significantly</i> less faithful to the actual moment being captured. And that goes against everything an ethical photojournalist strives for.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyheder.tv2.dk&#x2F;samfund&#x2F;2020-04-26-hvor-taet-er-folk-paa-hinanden-disse-billeder-er-taget-samtidig-men-viser-to" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyheder.tv2.dk&#x2F;samfund&#x2F;2020-04-26-hvor-taet-er-folk-...</a>')
