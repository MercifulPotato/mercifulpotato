Stripe did one thing exceedingly well, at an understandable price and took minutes to integrate with.<p>I could sell Stripe to my developer friends (and did, a lot!) in a single sentence: &quot;You can add credit card charging to your site in about 15 minutes for 2.9% + 30Â¢ per transaction.&quot;  I can&#x27;t do that anymore.  Stripe is no longer a single-sentence sell.<p>Stripe still does good work. But the air is getting murkier. I&#x27;ll point to some objective changes, but mostly Stripe is just starting to <i>feel</i> different.<p>- Several years ago, when I saw announcements that Stripe started supporting ACH payments (and later international payments), I thought, &quot;Great! This is Stripe! I&#x27;ll just be able to flick a switch and turn those on.&quot;  Not so. I understand that it&#x27;s complicated from their end.  It&#x27;s just not the same &quot;Stripe is so easy&quot; experience.  &quot;Stripe is supposed to abstract away the complexity, not expose it to me.&quot;<p>- The pricing page is a big sign of the added complexity.  There used to just be one or two numbers on that page [1].  Compare that with the current pricing page [2]<p>My suggestion to you, pc: Start a little company within Stripe to disrupt Stripe (i.e. re-simplify) in the same way Stripe disrupted the industry 10 years ago. Or keep getting bigger and become just as complex as the things Stripe replaced.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20111216054911&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;pricing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20111216054911&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.co...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;pricing#pricing-details" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;pricing#pricing-details</a>')
