So you lose appreciation for the various flavors of foods.<p>Thus if you pair soda with other foods, those foods need flavor enhancers (lots of salt, fat, etc) to compete for recognition on your palate&#x27;s sensory neurons.<p>Since I cyclically try to do this elimination, I get routinely reminded of this as I try to cycle out soda and excess sugar.<p>It&#x27;s strangely similar to the difference between commuting by bicycle and commuting by car, with the car mirroring sugar: a rush of power and convenience that appeals to your id, but all your natural surroundings drowned out inside a car cabin with the radio blasting. Not just visual and sensory separation from your surroundings, social separation.<p>It&#x27;s one of the major insights I had into the nature of America. Car entitlement is everywhere.<p>Anyway, I still drink way too much soda. At least now I have transitioned to 1&#x2F;3 regular 2&#x2F;3s diet.')
