It isn&#x27;t AGPL-compatible, so nobody could release an AGPL fork, and then companies wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it unless they distributed your code to other people, rather than just using it themselves, with the former being way less common than the latter. And most companies are okay with GPLv2 since they use Linux.')
