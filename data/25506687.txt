There&#x27;s the ABS and stability systems, torque vectoring systems, lane keeping&#x2F;driving automation, the infotainment system, and more. Sure they&#x27;re not made to the 5nm level at the moment, but supply chain wise a 15nm part is about the same as a 5nm part when it comes to making the silicon. This is especially true when you&#x27;re needing them to be more resilient temperature-wise and have other restrictions needed in the automotive space.<p>I drive a 2017 Santa Fe. Its a pretty basic car tech-wise compared to many others on the market these days. There&#x27;s still the computerized ABS and traction control system taking samples thousands of times a second and making split second decisions on how to handle the car. There are radar sensors tracking the distance to vehicles around me, that data is being fed to computer systems for automatic cruise control and alert aids. The car features lane keeping features which is based off computer vision systems to track the lines on the road. The transmission system is computerized, being more like a computer controlled manual transmission rather than a traditional automatic. The infotainment system is obviously driven by some kind of computer and contains WiFi, LTE, Bluetooth, GNSS, satellite, AM, FM, and digital FM radio systems along with cameras and radar sensors.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m forgetting some additional computerized systems on this list. So honestly there are <i>several</i> iPhones worth of computer systems on this list, all with more extreme hardening requirements to expect a longer deployed lifetime than an iPhone and all of which need to reliably talk to each other in some kind of fashion.')
