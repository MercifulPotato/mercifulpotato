RDAs are only a rough starting point (when there is an RDA) as we understand more about individual genetics, food environment, etc. Why is all of medicine just invasive procedures and pharma? I&#x27;m not convinced that we somehow just need to sit and wait for some future time before we can jnvest and safely make use of markers over ones life to improve behaviors and health outcomes (for the benefit of an individual and others with similar medical characteristics).<p>Theres room to debate the degree and depth that we would utilize labs and other measures, but a complete non-starter mentality just leaves health outcomes to blind fate and promotes development of complex conditions much more difficult to unwind.')
