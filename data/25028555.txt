The Council of Ministers, however, often disregards these recommendations because, as a rule, the priority for these ministers seems to protect jobs in the short term, not to maintain sustainability. As a consequence, the annual catch agreed to by the Council of Ministers is generally around 48 per cent more than the scientistsâ€™ recommended figure. The fact that 88 per cent of European fish stocks, measured against maximum sustainable yield (MSY), are overexploited is due in part to these excessively high catch quotas.&quot;</i><p>From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;worldoceanreview.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;wor-1&#x2F;fisheries&#x2F;fisheries-management&#x2F;a-negative-example-eu-fisheries-management&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;worldoceanreview.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;wor-1&#x2F;fisheries&#x2F;fisheries-ma...</a>')
