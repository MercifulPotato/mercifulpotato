I love certain things because they simply last forever and do what they are supposed to.  For example about 18 years ago I bought 2 HP12c calculators when I started working in finance (One for work, one for home).  Not only have they not broken, but I can&#x27;t tell you the battery life because they are both still on their original batteries.  Now old hands tell me the new modern 12cs (like mine) aren&#x27;t a patch on the original and the old ones from the 80s had even better battery life than that.')
