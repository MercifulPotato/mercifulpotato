There is a rule of law and democratically legitimized institutions to enforce it, protected by a system of checks and balances, and it&#x27;s the place of these institutions to make such decisions in accordance with the law.<p>This time a lot of people will think the ban hit the right person in Trump. But next time it might be somebody less clearly (to us) deserving of such a ban (like a &quot;traitor&quot; Snowden or a &quot;commie&quot; Sanders). What, for example, if social media had been around in the Jim Crow era and the &quot;rulers&quot; of social media had decided that the civil rights movement was to be silenced? Or that &quot;traditional marriage&quot; is an institution that needs protection from &quot;gay marriage&quot;?')
