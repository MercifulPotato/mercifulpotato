So I&#x27;d like to think I have a pretty favorable opinion the types of things leetcode tests -- algorithms, data structures, big-O and big-theta, etc.  They are incredibly important.<p>But these topics are very, very far from being everything important.  I would put them under soft skills, especially in cross-collaboration and working with non-engineering groups.  And I would put them under having the type of knowledge and experience in approach that, especially combined with the above soft skills, allow us to push the direction of the company forward.<p>As a dumb example off the top of my head:  It&#x27;s great if you know how to average a batch of numbers efficiently.  It&#x27;s better if you know how to do such in a streaming fashion, and recognize that we can use that within our architecture to materialize savings.  And, it&#x27;s best if you can convince the business that there&#x27;s no need to calculate the average because we can do streaming estimates for any quartile.')
