That&#x27;s a fact!  Go read it here!&quot;<p>When presented with &quot;well, he also later said &#x27;wear a mask&#x27; - which is also a fact&quot;... I would get &quot;fake news&quot; or &quot;he flip flops and therefore can&#x27;t be trusted&quot;.  When pointed out they were still &#x27;trusting&#x27; the &quot;don&#x27;t wear a mask&quot; fact... things usually ended there, with some profanity thrown my way.<p>When more information was presented, it was almost always countered with &quot;that&#x27;s just your opinion&quot;.  Or... &quot;I don&#x27;t trust CNN&quot;, etc.  At some point a switch flips with many people and &quot;facts&quot; only count when they match your internal belief system.')
