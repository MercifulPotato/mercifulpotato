The difference she notes is that the newspapers carefully choose what they publish in order to avoid harm--for example, they don&#x27;t publish the names of government informants even if those names are contained in the materials they obtain, since that would put the lives of those informants at risk. Wikileaks did not do that with the information obtained from Manning; they just released it all. The judge quotes the newspapers themselves condemning Wikileaks for doing that.')
