Unsurprisingly, he&#x27;s had a rough ride during these last several months.<p>He&#x27;s a great communicator with perfect English and a polite and friendly manner.  He&#x27;s detailed oriented and can make things happen.  But his thing was live events and now they just aren&#x27;t happening.<p>Does anyone here wish they had an expert communicator to help onboard new users or to be a front line for troubleshooting issues?')
