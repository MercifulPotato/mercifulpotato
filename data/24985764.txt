Brother has sold laser printers under $100 for many years now -- they&#x27;re reliable and last seemingly forever, and toner is cheap.<p>Why any average consumer buys inkjets anymore is a mystery to me.<p>If you need to print documents for personal or basic business use, a B&amp;W laser printer is the way to go. If you need fancier printouts of slides or product info to hand out to clients, a color laser printer is the way to go.<p>And if you need to print photos, order them online from a professional photo printing service.<p>I don&#x27;t actually understand who the market for home inkjet printers is anymore.<p>(Inkjets have their place for certain niche uses like larger-format photography printing, but that&#x27;s not really the &quot;home&quot; market anymore, more a professional or at minimum prosumer market.)')
