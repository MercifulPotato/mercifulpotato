It must seem like it does not respect your wishes, or would not if your tried it more.<p>Okay so...<p>The config is actually located in hidden file, here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;c9fe&#x2F;22120&#x2F;blob&#x2F;8b6cc758f14d34f564fd3a8383c0683501895603&#x2F;args.js#L10" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;c9fe&#x2F;22120&#x2F;blob&#x2F;8b6cc758f14d34f564fd3a838...</a><p><pre><code>    const pref_file = path.resolve(os.homedir(), &#x27;.22120.config.json&#x27;);\n\n</code></pre>\nAnd the port is fully configurable here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;c9fe&#x2F;22120&#x2F;blob&#x2F;8b6cc758f14d34f564fd3a8383c0683501895603&#x2F;args.js#L5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;c9fe&#x2F;22120&#x2F;blob&#x2F;8b6cc758f14d34f564fd3a838...</a><p><pre><code>  const server_port = process.env.PORT || process.argv[2] || 22120;\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t agree with you about the name. And I get if you&#x27;re saying you feel the name should not be linked to a port number, but i also don&#x27;t agree.<p>I guess i can explain my thinking, but I&#x27;m not sure if they will help you understand or like it. Basically I like the name and I did consider changing it a few times but it just stuck for a number of reasons. And I can&#x27;t remember exactly now but the port number might have come after the name. I think it&#x27;s a good idea and cool if you have the server running on the same board that the name is but at the same time I know you might have something else running on that port so that&#x27;s why I made it configurable. I guess she might also want to run more than one copy... But I&#x27;m pretty sure that we can&#x27;t open two chrome windows with different debugging ports using the same user data directory.<p>Anyway, that might be more info than you want or care for, and it might not help, but hopefully you have a clearer picture at least. I get if you still don&#x27;t like it, but i just feel sorry for you that you didn&#x27;t have a good experience of this. I did not design it to annoy you.')
