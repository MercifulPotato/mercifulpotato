Curevac, another German company located pretty close to BioNTech, is also working on  a similar vaccine which can be cooled in normal fridges, so is easier to roll out. They supposedly are only a few months behind. \nThe -80c storage should be no showstopper for all densely populated regions and these are where the vaccine is most urgently needed. Over time, there will be easier to handle alternatives or we just build more deep-freezers.')
