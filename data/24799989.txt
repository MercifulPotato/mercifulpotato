If I&#x27;m labeling how wood fits together on a laser cut, I&#x27;ll take it. If I&#x27;m making educational resources, quality almost doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>If I could have a 1980-era printhead I could control, I could do a lot with it.<p>And if we had that, quality would improve with time. Look how many years it took 3d printers to be useful for anything practical. I expect if we started even with 1980-era inkjet quality, we&#x27;d get to nice in 5-10 years.')
