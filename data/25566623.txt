I would have spent another few hours without your help. If I may make a suggestion, those steps you described should be performed out of the box when I launch the instance with a larger volume size to begin with. And the docs should mention what you wrote above in case someone resizes their volume after the fact. As far as I saw, the docs do already contain instructions for Linux and Windows. Would save others like me, many of whom I suspect will run into this same issue, a lot of time if it gave the macOS instructions you wrote as well.')
