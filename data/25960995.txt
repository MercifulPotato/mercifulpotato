I already had a bunch of DOGE from 2014 mining (really just for fun) but if I didn&#x27;t, and I wanted to trade, I would probably buy (or use what I have) BTC from Coinbase or similar, then move it over to a platform like Kraken&#x2F;Binance.us, then trade on the DOGE&#x2F;BTC pair.<p>Binance will let you trade the DOGE&#x2F;USD pair, you just can&#x27;t cash out without going through KYC-type stuff (or trade back to BTC&#x2F;other and transfer wherever).')
