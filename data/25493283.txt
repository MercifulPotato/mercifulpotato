Same way great person &lt;&gt; ideal spouse for everybody.<p>Great hackers tend to stand alone. If you are master at something it also means everybody or almost everybody has less knowledge than you and this puts you in a kinda precarious situation. You can either slow down for the rest (ie. be ideal &quot;team player&quot;) or do work at your own pace (ie. be a &quot;great hacker&quot; or &quot;10x developer&quot;). Or advance to management role...<p>Great hackers tend to require a lot of organization to support them. Somebody needs to do the dirty work that the &quot;great hacker&quot; does not care to complete because he has already set his eyes on another idea. And there tends to be a lot of dirty work...<p>Or they don&#x27;t require any organization to support them at all. But then they don&#x27;t scale and are limited by their own (sometimes considerable) output.<p>This is also why you can&#x27;t have a team full of rock stars and why these experiments tend to fail spectacularly. Either they assume other rockstars in their team are there to do their laundry or they just never cooperate at all and want to solve the problem on their own.<p>&quot;Great hackers&quot; who can do both are worth their weight in diamonds but they are extremely rare.<p>Ideally, if you are great hacker, you want to figure out what kind of person you are and what kind of environment suits your style of work.<p>Likewise, if you are manager, you need to understand &quot;great hackers&quot; are not replaceable cogs and you always need to put more effort into setting up framework with which to extract value from them than with other members of your team.')
