Item(by='awillen', descendants=None, kids=[25563020], score=None, time=1609187626, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562811, text='Ghosting people is bad form, too.<p>&quot;all it does is make people walk on egg shells in the future&quot; - well that depends a lot on how it&#x27;s done. Here, we&#x27;re presented with a behavior by recruiters that is very rude, and on top of that, incredibly easy to solve. You can literally have an email template ready to go to reject people, so we&#x27;re talking under 30 seconds per person to avoid ghosting. If you shame them about ghosting, given the presence of such an easy solution, they just won&#x27;t do it. This isn&#x27;t shaming someone for some vague belief they have about something, it&#x27;s a very specific behavior.<p>Blameless post-mortems are a poor comparison. You&#x27;re talking about the failure of a system that is contributed to and designed by a group of people who are continuously working together. Ghosting a candidate is one person doing something rude. Apples and oranges.<p>Your solution is not useful at all for internal recruiters - you just don&#x27;t develop relationships with them, because the nature of their job is a one shot thing with each candidate. As for agencies and external recruiters, I should not have to develop a collegial relationship with them to get them to act with basic politeness. That&#x27;s ridiculous. If they reach out to me to try to make money by placing me into a position, they should behave politely. If they don&#x27;t, there&#x27;s no reason they shouldn&#x27;t be shamed, so that people can work with other recruiters who do behave properly.')
