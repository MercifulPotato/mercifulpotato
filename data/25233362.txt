Their unstated job (and reputations) are as whitewashing firms. You hire them to ensure there is &quot;no evidence&quot; of anything done wrong. The primary purpose is to create a credible defense in lawsuits but PR purposes are also common. Firms that find problems suddenly see their business dry up because most companies don&#x27;t want this kind of honest evaluation (it just creates a problem and potentially exposes you to liability).<p>Without access to information about the firm doing the work, the report, or the underlying data it is impossible to know if a real investigation was done or not.')
