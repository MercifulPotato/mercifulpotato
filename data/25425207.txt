I feel like I&#x27;m basically rooting for a sports team. Someone can show me &quot;proof&quot; that their set up is better, and I&#x27;m still going to root for my home teams.<p>With that being said, I wish we would  collectively as the tech community be less focused on branding and software and more so on the working conditions throughout the supply chains that end up on our desks. Who cares if you have a pc&#x2F;bsd&#x2F;mac&#x2F;linux&#x2F;solaris&#x2F;android&#x2F;iphone set up if the pieces that go into it hurt other human beings and the environment.')
