Item(by='marcuswebb', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1602784351, title='Ask HN: Which animation framework is most performant for high volume?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I have a request to have a few hundred, perhaps even a thousand, dom elements all exist in a state of perpetual motion &amp; I&#x27;m trying to decide which animation framework to use without just benchmarking them all myself. Part of me thinks I should just write something bespoke to this use case in native but figured I&#x27;d ask since surely someone has done this before.<p>FYI all the reviews &#x2F; comparisons seem focused on the utility of animation frameworks for general web animation so do not really vet them for scaling to the level I mention here.<p>Bonus points if it works with native dom elements instead of a canvas element.<p>More bonus points if it is built in such a way that anything happening outside the currently viewable browser viewport isn&#x27;t affecting performance.')
