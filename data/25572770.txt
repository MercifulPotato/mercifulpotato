Also without the full contents and methodology, we can&#x27;t acty evaluate the study very well.<p>Thise leaves bias from confirmation of existing beliefs along with more anecdotal evidence not directly connected to videogames, such as decreasing crime rates over the period of time that videogames have become more violent. However relying on that correlation alone is a <i>post hoc ergo proper hoc</i> fallacy.<p>In short, we simply don&#x27;t know enough about the study to overcome comment with substance, at the same time that the study corresponds to conclusions based on similar research. I&#x27;m hesitant to declare &quot;confirmation bias&quot; though when it does ostensibly confirm other research, though it&#x27;s not really a replication, so I&#x27;d withhold final judgement.')
