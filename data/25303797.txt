In recent years, there are developers there who are extremely polished at these style of interviews, which makes them seem very impressive, <i>but don&#x27;t know anything else</i>. The minute you step outside what they&#x27;ve been practicing for, the fa√ßade of ability crumbles. Increasingly, I suspect these interviews are overfitting for people whose only skill is that they spend all their time practicing for these interviews. In my current hiring process, we&#x27;ve needed to do things to weed these people out because quite a few have been getting through the FAANG filter.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at FAANG and gotten offers from the rest, but I can&#x27;t view leetcode as anything but a hazing ritual at this point.')
