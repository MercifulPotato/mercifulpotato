The fact that you somehow think that someone _no longer_ locking you out of their bootloader is now considered open just shows how far we&#x27;ve gone off the rails.<p>By that definition 99.99% of devices are open because you can just swap out the rom. All you need to do is figure out the pin and wiring and the serial protocols involved in communicating. My ducky keyboard is NOT open even though I replaced the firmware with my own.<p>What kind of insane logic is that?<p>And the fact that you and the other person here keeps conflating ANY documentation about ANY part of the hardware as contributing to Linux is even more ridiculous.')
