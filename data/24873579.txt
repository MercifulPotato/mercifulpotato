I&#x27;ve always felt that the Node community, and the wider JavaScript community alongside it, has always been open to and embracing of constructive criticism, whether or not it&#x27;s regarding the language itself (TC39, codemods &#x2F; babel transformers, TypeScript, and any language that targets (Node)JS&#x27;s ecosystem), established frameworks and libraries (underscore -&gt; lodash, moment.js -&gt; luxon), package management (pnpm, yarn), or even governance (the io.js fork, which was later on merged back into Node) and module systems (es modules, commonjs, et cetera).<p>Ryan&#x27;s original criticisms regarding Node were totally valid, but most of them weren&#x27;t really easily addressable without significant breakage or a long migration strategy, which potentially could&#x27;ve caused a _lot_ of issues and unclarity for many years.')
