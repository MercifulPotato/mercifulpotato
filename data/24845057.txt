We already have medicaid if you make less than about $1400&#x2F;mo it is free.  I have purchased health insurance coverage through the state exchange and that is where the real fun begins.<p>Here you basically have to ask your insurer if they will pay for damn near everything and record the interaction ID otherwise you&#x27;re getting a supprise bill which are supposedly banned.<p>Had to deal with this in the last week it is infuriating wasting so much time on hold or navigating through a phone tree.<p>We should really be making a yellow vest style movement against this just and burn the whole healthcare system down. Unless you work for a select few companies or have the medicaid it&#x27;s a nightmare to deal with.<p>Also the problem is we don&#x27;t give a damn about preventative care and nutrition so you end up with a majority overweight&#x2F;obese population that you could have prevented with a fraction of the cost in preventative care.')
