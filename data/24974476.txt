Extending the language to second order language (although this is not quite standard terminology) is a whole new ball of wax since the concept of a model changes as well. You can introduce a quantifier over &#x27;unique&#x27; reals but this is a rather hollow extension since the nature of that quantifier remains just as vague. I also fail to see why the uniqueness of reals is so important. Using second order language you would have to forcefully &#x2F;\n&#x27;declare&#x27; every such object.')
