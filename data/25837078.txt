Everyone here agrees that the people responsible for murdering the police officer ought to be held criminally accountable <i>for murder</i> but not <i>for treason</i>. But this was almost certainly a small number of people and its reprehensible to hold the entire mob responsible, and certainly not <i>for treason</i>. We don&#x27;t hold every BLM protester accountable for the BLM riots and we don&#x27;t hold every BLM rioter accountable for the murders that took place during the riots, and we should hold the same standard here.<p>Elsewhere you remarked that 1 murder constitutes a larger proportion than the BLM murders, but of course you can&#x27;t extrapolate anything from a sample of 1.<p>&gt; People really need to stop equating BLM with what happened on 1&#x2F;6. Not all violence is created equal. 1&#x2F;6 was much more egregious.<p>They aren&#x27;t the same, but they&#x27;re not so different that we can justify glorifying violence for one and exaggerating it for the other.<p>FWIW, I personally think the Capitol Hill riots were worse in the sense that they were incited by a sitting President and that the security was concerningly inadequate. The President should be held responsible for insurrection, there should be accountability among the police as well (although I don&#x27;t know enough to venture into details about what kind or degree of accountability), but the rank and file rioters are only guilty of rioting, trespassing, etc (those who assaulted need to be held accountable for assault, those who murdered for murder, those who planted bombs for planting bombs, etc). But this isn&#x27;t &quot;a coup&quot; nor were the rioters &quot;traitors&quot;. They were misled into believing their candidate lost the election and they were angry, but I can&#x27;t imagine they seriously expected to break into the capitol and forcibly reinstate Trump (apart perhaps for the mentally ill).<p>So yes, the Capitol Hill riots were worse, but not so much that the BLM rioters (including those who assaulted people or killed people) deserve to escape justice nor that the media should be forgiven for their incitement and later apologetics of the violence. Nor does it merit exaggerating the violence on Capitol Hill.')
