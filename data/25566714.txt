My first few years in the industry, I made double digit percentage increases by changing jobs. The next few years were more like 5-6% to change jobs. Nowadays, I don&#x27;t expect any increase at all--you max out and every company you look at coincidentally offers about the same amount. Unless you go into management or are lucky enough to get one of those one-in-a-thousand nosebleed FAANG offers, you&#x27;re plateaued around 10-15 years into your career.')
