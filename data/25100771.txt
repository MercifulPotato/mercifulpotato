Item(by='arthur-st', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605444495, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25096710, text='2019 laptop sales are 9.3% of laptop sales for years 2010-2019 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;272595&#x2F;global-shipments-forecast-for-tablets-laptops-and-desktop-pcs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;272595&#x2F;global-shipments-...</a>). The phrase &quot;Faster than 98% of PC laptops&quot; in itself is very general, an it&#x27;s fair to assume that it&#x27;s e.g. all laptops currently in use, or ever made - in part since this is a sales pitch, rather than a technical specification item. If we add 1990-2009 laptops to the statistic above, the share of purportedly modern laptops will just shrink, and substantially at that.<p>Then you have to add on top of that the consideration of what are the laptops people are actually buying and using. I can assure you that neither enterprise clients nor everyone outside of select, relatively spoiled, group people concentrated in just a few areas are regularly buying top of the line workstation or gaming laptops.<p>The parent is very much right, amongst techies there&#x27;s an unhealthy tendency for self-righteous adjudication of the narrative or context.')
