Item(by='shakezula', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610665302, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783812, text='&gt; you specify the far right<p>Because they were the ones who outright rejected masks? It&#x27;s not like this is a bias being cast on them unfairly, the right has rejected masks on a basis of personal freedom (whether you agree with that take or not) and have been extremely vocal about it.<p>That being said, Democrats and leftists are people too - they&#x27;re fallible. This pandemic has taught me that humans are far more social than I think most people realize, that we get bored incredibly quickly, and that we will normalize anything and live around it. Masks have become commonplace, and pretty much all content &amp; media produced in 2020 will be immediately recognizable by the masks everyone is wearing.<p>Interestingly enough, I have seen pretty much 100% mask adherence in teenagers. I live by a high school and see them walk by all wearing masks even after school.<p>&gt; Mayor adler of austin got extended family together, had a wedding, then took a private jet to cabo where he recorded a video encouraging austinites to stay home.<p>Yeah, the rich don&#x27;t give a shit about the rules and guidelines, but what&#x27;s new? Not following extreme quarantine protocols is probably very low on my list of criticisms for that mayor.<p>&gt; They say the right thing, but are doing something different.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed the same thing with my liberal friends, but I have to remember that they&#x27;re at least trying. They wear masks when they&#x27;re hanging out and not eating, they&#x27;re more aware of hand-washing, they don&#x27;t share drinks, etc... You can&#x27;t just look at the one thing they&#x27;re doing to cling to a sense of normalcy. I wouldn&#x27;t hold a right wing person to any more stringent of a standard, either. My problem with it has been the right&#x27;s general rejection of any type of public safety measures.<p>I&#x27;ve been in an extreme quarantine because I live with an immuno-compromised person, but I have to remember that different people have different risk tolerances, and that at this point it&#x27;s hardly the fault of people going to restaurants and that it was mostly our governments complete lack of action that lead to us being on this path.<p>Honestly, I just wish that it had never been politicized in the first place so that we didn&#x27;t have to have silly conversations about political leanings of people given only how they respond to a pandemic. I guess I can&#x27;t even talk about that without recognizing that our President is the one who politicized it, so :shrug:')
