It&#x27;s a joking reference to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. The more you try to measure one property of the system, the less you can know about some other related property. They&#x27;re usually race conditions or memory corruption where the instrumentation disrupts the timing or order of operations just enough to make the bug go away.')
