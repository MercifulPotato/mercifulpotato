Your best chance to snap up a grant is to come with a project of marginal improvement that produces one or two papers in a reliable timeframe.<p>Marginal improvements have their indisputable value, but they mostly appeal to risk-averse people; whoever wants to work on something really outlandish, must rely on other sources of financing, often private. After all, there is a risk of utter failure = not producing even that one paper that is, these days, a basic unit of wealth in the Publish-or-Perish world. Or of a delay that breaks the original time plan.')
