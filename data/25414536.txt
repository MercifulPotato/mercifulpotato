As I understand it, they have a laptop or the contents thereof, and are conducting an investigation.<p>If that investigation warrants charging Hunter Biden with any crimes, he can be tried by a jury of his peers and, if convicted, punished appropriately.<p>Adherence to the law isn&#x27;t (or at least shouldn&#x27;t be) a partisan issue, nor have I made any statement to that effect.<p>If you believe you have uncovered some relevant evidence, I suggest you take it to the authorities for further investigation.<p>Thank you for sharing your point of view.')
