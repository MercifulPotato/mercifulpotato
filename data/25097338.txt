It takes an additional hour of time for long meals, mostly just sitting browsing through my phone, or 15-20 minutes for short meals, again browsing through my phone. I don&#x27;t like the tipping system, feeling pressured to order drinks, or the whole credit card payment ritual. I hope you&#x27;re right and that we see delivery-focused restaurants in low cost areas with sustainable packaging, so we can enjoy higher-end food at home besides pizza and chinese.')
