AMP 2.0?<p>But I also think this one will be killed in a few years. A big point with stories is to have you publish them to the friends _who care_ in a network. A social network.<p>A user googling to get to a website isn&#x27;t the same kind of user. That&#x27;s not the user who wants to engage with you on a more personal level: that user would instead befriend you on Instagram. The googling user is likely rather after information, contact details or the like.<p>So I think Google will be a victim of the &quot;distanced&quot; users of theirs here. Google has users googling things with a purpose, whether it&#x27;s a recipe, a review or to shop things. They aren&#x27;t looking for feeds there -- they already have (too?) many ways to get that. They want distilled information. You know, what Google&#x27;s search engine is designed to get. What they built their brand on: finding information fast.<p>I think people are moving away from the &quot;generic web&quot; to engage on a personal level, not towards it, because a smartphone&#x27;s social network app is more intimate. But sure, if the price is right, I guess some might adopt this, if not only as sort of a SEO tool. But I think the value as a product won&#x27;t even be on the same chart as what stories provide social networks.<p>Personally, I think stories are a terrible format to engage with users in the way Google aims for here, actually trying to take this format seriously and not just memes and simple ad hoc stuff.
