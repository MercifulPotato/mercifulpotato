Item(by='LockAndLol', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602941783, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24808479, text='&gt; After this long, I must say, anyone using Linux on a laptop has Stockholm syndrome.<p>Once again, using absolutes to try and make a point seem stronger. No, it&#x27;s not &quot;anyone&quot;. Sure, yeah, sometimes setting it up is hella annoying when your WiFi doesn&#x27;t work out of the box (one laptop 8 years ago and one this year), printers won&#x27;t connect (OpenSuse is terrible with network printers unlike Ubuntu), NVIDIA decides to stay dicks, and some media keys on your keyboard don&#x27;t work, but those are all driver issues. Once those are out of the way, it also &quot;just works&quot; TM.<p>The amount of time I spent having to hunt down driver files for Windows XP and Windows 7, defrag the HD, clean up the windows registry, find a crack or freeware alternative for every little thing out there, or try to find out why something crashed and have absolutely no logs available, was inordinately high. I don&#x27;t miss it one bit.<p>Sure, the community isn&#x27;t the greatest and support is not always easy to find (or existent), but I dare say when things go wrong on linux at least you have logs and paste something into a search engine. When something crashes on Windows, most of the time you&#x27;re shit outta luck - at least that how it was back in the day. It would be really surprising to me to see GUI apps on windows being runnable from the terminal and output something you can search for to debug. Hell, on Linux you can often even download the debug symbols, run the whole things in `gdb` or `strace`.<p>Your experience is yours and it&#x27;s easy to find similar experiences and opinions, but it&#x27;d be great if you strayed away from absolutes like &quot;anybody&quot; or &quot;everybody&quot;. Your experience isn&#x27;t universal.')
