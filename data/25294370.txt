Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=[25294547], score=None, time=1607027562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25291823, text='There are many examples of Stripe leaning left, in terms of who they are deplatforming. They tend to take action whenever facing activist pressure from random people&#x2F;organizations on Twitter like the &quot;Sleeping Giants&quot; group. From a quick Google search, here is an example I turned up, where Stripe discussed deplatforming Gab with activists directly - those activists then demanded Stripe change their TOS, and threatened to leak all their emails discussing Gab with them: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.breitbart.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;left-wing-deplatform-hate-threatens-payment-processor-stripe-over-terms-of-service&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.breitbart.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;left-wing-deplatfo...</a>. The same article notes a couple other examples of people banned from Stripe towards the end.<p>I should also note, that I don&#x27;t actually use Gab and don&#x27;t follow these particular conservatives that Stripe kicked off their platform. However, I think free speech is a fundamentally important principle to uphold, particularly at the base layers of society. Payment processing is in reality a function that should just be a public utility (and therefore subject to constitutional free speech protection). When a cabal of banks and other payment systems (PayPal, Stripe) can be targeted&#x2F;pressured to deplatform someone, and even act in coordination (as Visa&#x2F;MasterCard have many times), the victims of their action effectively lose their right to free speech for all practical purposes.<p>This opaque, arbitrary process of judging who is allowed and not allowed on their platform also raises questions as to whether Stripe can be trusted as a stable foundation to build a business on. For example, if I am a business owner and I make donations to Republican candidates, will I now have to think about whether Stripe will suddenly block me? And with Stripe moving from service customers to enabling customers of their customers, does their political judgment also extend to indirect customers? I don&#x27;t want to lend more platform power to PayPal 2.0 - Stripe needs to get away from political activism and come out in support of being hands-off except for what the law minimally requires.<p>&gt; Your throwaway account is also very chickenshit-esque<p>Regarding my account...I am not sure why that is relevant. The name has &#x27;throwaway&#x27; in it but this is my only account.')
