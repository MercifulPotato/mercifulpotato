Every application would also need to run all its code inside a linux VM. So that means:<p>- Dedicated RAM for all your docker apps (which you have to partition manually)<p>- Slow startup time for the first docker app you run each time you reboot, as it boots the linux VM.<p>- All syscalls run through the VM&#x27;s emulation layer, which is way slower than native<p>- No access to the system&#x27;s native UI toolkits. (Docker apps can&#x27;t dynamically link to cocoa for obvious reasons.) We can probably work around this by wasting a huge amount of developer time making a networked bridge or something silly but ??<p>- No easy way to load and save files (the VM doesn&#x27;t have filesystem access)<p>- All the other downsides of docker - like it gobbling up all your disk space with images that are no longer used<p>- Lower battery life, because the host can&#x27;t easily sleep the VM&#x27;s scheduler. The CPU can&#x27;t enter low power state when nothing&#x27;s running.<p>Please don&#x27;t do this. We already have a special kind of container for &quot;self contained program on disk&quot;. Its called a statically linked executable. They work great. They&#x27;re fast, small, have access to everything the host system provides. You can SHA them if you want and you can easily host them yourself using a static web server. My computer&#x27;s responsiveness is more important to me than your shiny docker shaped toy.')
