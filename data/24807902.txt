None ever DDoSed. I surmise getting DDoSed is as rare as getting hit by lightning.<p>You can protect web apps against smaller attacks easily by just doing a SPA on a CDN and verifying tokens on your load balancer. If you use SHA token verification (signature based JWT verification is slow) your load balancers can probably reject traffic at line rate.<p>Run a pile of servers behind 40 gig interfaces and a DDoS attack will be the data center&#x27;s problem. You&#x27;ll saturate their line before your service goes down. Combine that with DNS or JS client side load balancing and multiple data centers will go down before your app does.')
