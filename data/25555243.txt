Get into FAANG and you&#x27;re good for life. Combined FAANG (say 10 biggest tech companies) is over 5 trillion dollars, more than a lot of countries&#x27; GDPs with sovereignty.<p>I suspect in year 2100, we will have no small businesses but giant monolith corporations that will drive everything from content censorship to citizen governance through proxies, everyone&#x27;s savings are going to be in their stocks which keep increasing at an ever increasing pace. Traditional currencies have been devalued and replaced by corporate-owned coins. Neuralink will ensure utter dominance of a few. Abstract things we consider today are commodicized and traded.<p>Future kind of sucks to be honest. We&#x27;re past golden prime years.
