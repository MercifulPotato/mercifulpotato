Is it wise to basically become dependent on a large competitor for such an integral component of your next generation products? What if Google decides to give up maintenance of Flutter to the community and use an internal, better fork? I guess it&#x27;s the same thing with Microsoft using Chromium to implement Edge and how we&#x27;re converging towards a complete Google monopoly.<p>I was an early adopter and proponent of Flutter but that&#x27;s just not the case anymore. The ecosystem has become inundated by what you might get if you forced copulation between the JS and Android ecosystems. There&#x27;s a ton of low-substance spam articles, excessive usage of libraries reminiscent of NPM-madness, and just a general obnoxious colorful-emoji-fueled atmosphere. I don&#x27;t want to be misinterpreted: there are plenty of good Flutter developers and the core engineering team is certainly brilliant. But they&#x27;re largely overshadowed by a community who continues to drive a good technology into being associated with bloat, poor security, and puerility.')
