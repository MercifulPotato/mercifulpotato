I actually developed the love in high school when I took the AP Computer Science classes, those were by far my favorite.<p>I&#x27;ve been flirting with the idea of getting a teaching degree and becoming a HS Computer Science teacher but don&#x27;t know anybody whose made the transition from industry to education.<p>Can anybody shed some light on their transition experience or any research to that end that you can share with me? Thanks!')
