Item(by='mbeex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612008589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25967914, text='&gt; but the differences between individual VGA cards were too big.<p>Buyed the programming manual for the ET4000 GPU (&gt;100DM for this manual alone, a lot for a student from the eastern part of Germany at this time), opcodes and all. I liked the possibility to easily mix Assembler with Pascal in Turbo Pascal. Machine code for graphics, FPU, interrupt programming, the higher language for anything else.<p>After that, I learned C from the Open Source Fractint. So, the transition wasn&#x27;t that painful after TP&#x27;s decline.<p>And anything was so snappy in Turbo Pascals text mode windowing system (as with Norton Commander too).')
