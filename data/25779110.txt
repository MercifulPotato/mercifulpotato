Item(by='Viliam1234', descendants=None, kids=[25781862], score=None, time=1610644805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776784, text='He plays a little trick by saying &quot;ultimately it should be the users themselves who decide what is acceptable or not&quot;. This has two meanings, somewhat contradictory.<p>The straightforward meaning is that ultimately I decide what is acceptable or not for me, and you decide what is acceptable or not for you. We can, and likely will, have a different opinion on different things.<p>But the following talk of &quot;governance&quot; and &quot;democratic control&quot; suggest that the one who ultimately decides are not users as individuals, but rather some kind of process that would be called democratic in some sense. Ultimately, someone else will make the decision for you... but you can participate in the process, if you wish... but if your opinions are too unusual, you will probably lose anyway... and then the rest of us will smugly congratulate ourselves for giving you the chance.<p>&gt; Democracy and majoritarianism are (in general) quite different things.<p>Sure, a minority can have rights as long as it is popular, rich, well organized, able to make coalitions with other minorities, or too unimportant to attract anyone&#x27;s attention. But that still means living under the potential threat. I don&#x27;t see a reason why online communities would have to be built like this, if instead you could create a separate little virtual universe for everyone who wished to be left alone... and then invent good tools for navigating these universes, to make it convenient, from user perspective, to create their places, to invite and be invited, and to exlude those who don&#x27;t follow the local rules (who in turn can create their own places and compete for popularity).')
