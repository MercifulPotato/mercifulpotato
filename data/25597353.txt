That is also hounding people out of science.<p>Science is better served when such papers are published, and then are debunked using scientific standards of inquiry.<p>Proving those views wrong is much more powerful than censoring them -- anytime someone puts forward those views we can now say &quot;nope, that&#x27;s been debunked, here is an article that proves it wrong.&quot;<p>Censorship creates a chilling effect on science in general. People will be afraid to do gender or IQ studies. Some of those studies might end up with results that are true, but not politically popular at the time.<p>We should not forget that scientific orthodoxy was racist not that long ago. If scientific journals had been censored in the early 1900s, for example, anti-racist papers would have been suppressed. Today is no different -- many of our current scientific views are likely to be disproved 100 years from now, but only if we allow contrary views to be published.')
