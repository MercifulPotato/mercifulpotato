The point is, would it be harmful to functioning democracy and people&#x27;s freedom of thought to &quot;promote factual voices&quot;.<p>By all means argue against doing so, and be concerned that it would result in long-term censorship effects but:<p>I&#x27;ve tried to make the argument that the <i>absence</i> of &quot;promote factual voices&quot; <i>also</i> results in long-term censorship (the way you are meaning it), because we get a de facto biased spread of opinions anyway as a result of social media dynamics and all the dodgy actors in them.<p>There&#x27;s newsfeed algorithms, advertising, optimising for hits and clicks and engagement, nefarious actors, paid shills, all sorts of things.  And though I&#x27;m loathe to say it, a lot of low-quality trolling and thoughtless opinions which get amplified easily.  But even without all those, social media has system dynamics which must inevitably result in <i>something</i> that governs the consensus towards an allowed range of ideas versus ideas which are discouraged.<p>I think we have no choice on that.  The only choice is which <i>kind</i> of systemic bias shall we opt for.<p>I favour whatever structures lead to certain <i>types of thinking</i> (not the same as particular opinions): higher quality debate, eduction, knowledge and wisdom in society (which sounds like healthier democracy to me), as represented by a broad spectrum of people, open to all, and designed to protect diversity of thought while promoting quality of thought.  I&#x27;m avoiding saying what leads to that, because I honestly don&#x27;t know the answer, only that &quot;don&#x27;t promote anything&quot; is not necessarily the answer or unbiased, especially when there&#x27;s plenty of other dodgy promotion going on behind the scenes already.')
