This is why I think showing as a society doing things the right way counts.<p>This is the foundation of the unwritten societal contract: if you go by the rules everything will turn out well for you. If you break the rules, act egoistic etc, you might end up in a bad place.<p>This is why stuff like coruption, worker exploitation, tax evasion etc is worse than just stealing the people&#x27;s money â€” it is also undermining the trust into that unwritten societal contract.<p>This contract is of course fiction Which means that believing into it is either optimistic or naive depending on your country. But if it breaks down thing will only get much worse')
