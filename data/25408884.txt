Item(by='cgriswald', descendants=None, kids=[25418318], score=None, time=1607884686, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406293, text='&gt; I think there is a genuine need for escaping echo chambers but every attempt is usually aimed just showing the opposite side&#x2F;narrative.<p>I think the idea that there only exists a single spectrum sorted into sides is itself a sort of meta echo chamber shared by people in echo chambers even as they disagree about everything else. In modern politics, even the idea that the opposed party holds <i>opposite</i> views (versus just opposed) is a meta echo chamber idea. In many left&#x2F;right topics, the disagreement isn&#x27;t &#x27;pro&#x2F;anti&#x27;, but often more fundamental.<p>Some examples: While conservatives might be anti-abortion, liberals aren&#x27;t <i>pro</i> abortion, they&#x27;re pro-<i>choice</i> and that&#x27;s not just a rhetorical device. While liberals are anti-racism and see conservatives as pro-racism, a conservative rejects the idea out of hand because of a difference in definitions. A third, more nuanced view might even see the average conservative as <i>non</i>-racist (as opposed to anti-racist) which many would still argue is not enough, but it&#x27;s not &#x27;the opposite&#x27; at all.<p>I don&#x27;t think recommendations need to necessarily go to the extremes, but I don&#x27;t think &#x27;a shade to the left&#x27; is enough either, because without understanding the fundamental differences, you have a you-can&#x27;t-get-there-from-here problem.')
