The action on the standard unit basis vectors can be read out by looking at the columns. (A matrix times the ith standard basis vector is just the ith column.) Since the transform is linear, all the other points in space are carried along with the action as well. This is the &quot;linear map&quot; viewpoint of a rotation matrix.<p>I show an example here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biro.ai&#x2F;we-learned-the-wrong-way-to-matrix-multiply&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biro.ai&#x2F;we-learned-the-wrong-way-to-matrix-multiply&#x2F;</a> where this viewpoint lets you instantly see what a rotation matrix does by looking at the columns.')
