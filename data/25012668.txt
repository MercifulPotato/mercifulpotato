Are either of them the most important thing in the average business code? Sure devs always like to get things faster just because they can, but in most business settings whether its java, .net, php, etc it really doesn&#x27;t matter it will be just fine for the speed (considering its probably database calls, etc that are the bottleneck).<p>I would argue its more about code readability and maintainability than speed. Can I take a java developer and have him&#x2F;her look at some Go code and know what&#x27;s going on? For the most part I would say yes.')
