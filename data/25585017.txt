I mean that we use calendar dates for laws that are tied to seasonal attributes. As a simple example, dates are set in law as a beginning and end date for when you are allowed to use studded snow tires (eg 10&#x2F;15 - 4&#x2F;15). Now you would have to go back through all that legislation for every date in law to see if it would need to be subjected to a shifting scheme. Stuff like tax day might not need to change, but school years would need to adjust every year, because the main purpose of it set the way they are is for agriculture labor on family farms (although that is a shrinking concern).')
