Whether that is in relation to a topic, or inadvertently in terms of your perceived ability to teach it.<p>You may think that &quot;apologising&quot; on behalf of a technology (or yourself) might attract sympathy and establish rapport, but typically it backfires and achieves the opposite.<p>To make the example concrete, if you start the lecture with &quot;why NaN sucks&quot; in order to get students to sympathise and appreciate that you&#x27;re showing them the pitfalls, is more than likely going to backfire and create a general feeling of resentment along the lines of &quot;why are we even using it, why am I wasting my time here&quot;. Not to mention the risk of &quot;great, I&#x27;m paying $Xk&#x2F;y so that some random disgruntled guy can teach me hacks to circumvent shitty technology&quot;.<p>There are much better ways to approach this subject (linguistically), which would make it far more interesting and scientifically engaging.<p>Note, I&#x27;m not saying this person is &quot;teaching it wrong&quot; - it sounds like they&#x27;ve put a lot of thought in their work. But generally one should aim to refrain from &#x27;negative&#x27; language. You could do exactly the same syllabus with positive, non-apologetic language.')
