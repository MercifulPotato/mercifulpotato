The Italian styles with minimal cheese are a disappointment to me. Many are able to get the crust and sauce perfect, which is no small feat, and then it feels like they just gave up with the cheese.<p>Pizza in NYC usually not only has great crust and sauce, but it also has plenty of cheese. They don&#x27;t &quot;overload&quot; it like many places outside the area. (I am purposely separating &quot;Pizza in NYC&quot; from &quot;NYC Style&quot; because people around the US suck at emulating it).')
