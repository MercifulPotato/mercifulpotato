This gives great use-cases when it comes to human perception, as we can filter out or correct small mistakes and reject big ones. But when used as input to a machine, even the smallest mistake can have huge consequences. Admittedly, this nonlinearity also applies when human beings &quot;talk&quot; to machines, but the input to and output of a single human being will always be constrained, whereas a machine could output billions of programs per day. I don&#x27;t think it would be wise to follow that route before we have computational models that can cope with the many small and few big mistakes an &quot;AI&quot; would make.')
