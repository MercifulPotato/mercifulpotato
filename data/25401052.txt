In the Hyltenstam and Abrahamsson literature, they are able to find quite a few learners whose speech is indistinguishable from that of native speakers. They then run a battery of more strict tests (syntax&#x2F;knowledge tests IIRC) against these learners that reveal slight differences.<p>However, (2) is certainly false. It&#x27;s somewhat rare to find an adult learner who truly sounds like a native speaker. That, however, isn&#x27;t evidence in favor of a strict critical period&#x2F;maturational effects hypothesis, since there can be many reasons for failure.<p>My intuition is that there is much less support for a strict critical period hypothesis these days. Most people now talk about a &#x27;sensitive period&#x27;, which reflects that there are a broad range of factors that favor successful acquisition in children but that adults have decreased sensitivity to.')
