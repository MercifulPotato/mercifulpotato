I was amazed at how much recovery hurt, and I can&#x27;t take opioids (too many physical and mental side effects).<p>I ended up smoking a ton of weed. It really helped <i></i>so much<i></i>.<p>The funny part was going from an occasional recreational smoker to using it medicinally. At first I was like, it&#x27;s 7 in the morning, I don&#x27;t want to get stoned, this sucks. But it worked at managing pain. I was not in pain and I could rest; I could rest so I could heal.<p>End result was anger and frustration at our stupid drug laws, mostly. But also, my shoulder works again, and I know how to manage pain, if anything happens again.')
