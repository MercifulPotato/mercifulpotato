From my experience, these big companies lack the diligence on ROAS. Maybe it&#x27;s the lack of ownership, whereas for smaller companies, usually the CEO&#x2F;COO&#x2F;Founder(s) on top of their spending and other performance metrics.  I see much less of a waste on the ad spend when it comes to customer acquisition.<p>For example, I had a company that was spending a million dollars a month, they are a big brand, a tech company, their team kept on asking why the spend wasn&#x27;t up even when their CAC was way over their target. The team wanted to keep the spend up to meet their metrics at any cost, in reality for every customer they were acquiring they were losing 50% on ROAS.')
