Obviously, the number of <i>true</i> elites is limited by the actual amount of elite input taken by society&#x27;s institutions (in the same way the number of rocks on top of a pile is limited by the surface area).<p>When you measure an &quot;elite overproduction&quot;, what must be happening is that one noisy signal (metric) of eliteness (e.g. Harvard degrees) is showing a much higher false positive rate than true positive rate, as determined by comparison with a more sensitive (but often useless) metric, in this case &quot;actually being elite&quot; (working for USG or <i>The Atlantic</i>). When you have this problem in any <i>other</i> field, you switch to a different metric!<p>In other words, when Turchin says &quot;elite overproduction&quot;, he is implicitly trusting the very metric he is criticizing. Of course trusting academia as a kingmaker is not a surprising stance for... an academic, but we are not and plow on. If you reframe the question, you instead see &quot;inability to identify elites&quot;, that is, a decrease in the <i>signal-to-noise ratio</i> of the metrics used to identify people who are trustworthy.<p>In this framing, it is less surprising that this &quot;elite overproduction&quot; viz. &quot;qualification debasement&quot; is happening at the same time as a general decline in the public trust of institutions! After all, isn&#x27;t it <i>rational</i> to stop trusting a noisy metric? We could of course spend many paragraphs picking over the nitty-gritty mechanisms by which these increasingly noisy signals eventually produce mistrust, but what we want is the crow&#x27;s perspective [1]. There is also the question of whether &quot;trustworthy&quot; should have anything to do with &quot;elite&quot;, but it does usually have some connection to social achievements.<p>What bothers me is that I personally can&#x27;t really recommend my own method of trust-but-verify to most people: I have a pretty good command of mathematics, and I determine who to trust, in many cases, by checking their math. This is an odd privilege: for example, a brief glance at Trump supporters sharing graphical claims of voter fraud is enough for me to immediately detect lying-with-statistics, but for someone without a graduate degree in a mathematical science it may not be so easy.<p>1: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chaosbook.org&#x2F;FieldTheory&#x2F;01-Intro.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A33%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C0%2C0%2C0%5D" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chaosbook.org&#x2F;FieldTheory&#x2F;01-Intro.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%2...</a>')
