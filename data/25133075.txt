This tells me that the betters have no idea what they&#x27;re doing. While Trump was leading in swing states, most metropolitan areas only counted a small fraction of ballots, so the early votes had very little statistical value.<p>Also, there are often tiny arbitrages where buying &quot;no&quot; for Biden would cost a few cents less than buying &quot;yes&quot; for Trump. In theory, you can make a guaranteed 1% return on betting no for both Trump and Biden, and it was as high as 5%. You can&#x27;t take advantage of this arb due to fees on predictit, but you&#x27;d think rational investors would at least try to keep this even.')
