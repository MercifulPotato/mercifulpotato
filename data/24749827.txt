The Wisconsin city that I live in has temperatures that are both 15 F hotter and colder than typical northern European cities. And we commute roughly twice as far because our cities are more spread out.<p>I&#x27;m fortunate that I don&#x27;t sweat very much, my commute is only 4 miles each way, and I can tailor my schedule around the weather. So I start out early before the sun has cleared the trees, and ride slowly. As a result I&#x27;m not particularly sweaty when I arrive at work. Also, I have a casual-dress job with no public interaction.<p>I live on a street that happens to be a preferred route for cyclists commuting to and from the downtown area. So I see a lot of people on bikes. Most of the commuters are in fact just wearing normal street clothes. I don&#x27;t even own any cycling-specific clothing.')
