In her email, she carelessly demanded names of those who reported her, that can be interpreted as extortion, and Jeff didn&#x27;t miss the opportunity to call her out. Her offer to resign was another mistake: she would be fired anyways, but for a different reason and with more paperwork. Now if she takes this to a court, she would have to tell the judge what she needed the names for.')
