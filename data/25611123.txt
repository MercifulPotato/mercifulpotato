We&#x27;ve settled on the design of the jet engine through math and engineering. The shape of it is designed and not arbitrary. On the other hand, the syntax of a programming language is entirely arbitrary, settled upon by whoever wrote the tool using whatever convention struck them at the time. Programming languages weren&#x27;t designed and come upon through linguistical theory or psychology over what might be the best way to structure this stuff or anything like that. It wasn&#x27;t rooted in empirical evidence like the jet engine is. It was a programmer at AT&amp;T deciding that grep seemed like a pretty cool acronym 50 years ago, and we are still teaching kids how to use grep today for no reason other than this arbitrary syntax now being the status quo due to everyone in the business having already taken the time to learn it. Not because it&#x27;s good or we have some evidence that this is a decent syntax, only that we are lazy and entrenched.')
