This is simply an economic reason in a capitalist framework, not anything out of malice.<p>Based on the fact that they issued statements saying that people should petition government to raise the minimum wage, I think that if all the larger corporations were subject to unionization of workers, they would not have an issue with it. When everyone is on equal competitive ground, Amazon can win against the likes of WalMart and others.')
