Unsurprisingly trying to co-opt widely used terms tends to be ambiguous and confusing (cf. crypto &lt;-&gt; cryptography, cryptocurrency, and those are at least related). Perhaps the only exception in this group is &quot;data lens&quot;, which works as a compound [1]. Guess what optics software does? No ETL, that&#x27;s for sure. Optics patterns? Uh-oh. Optics development? Nuh-uh. Optics data? Turns out there are multiple companies with that name, and they&#x27;re not doing ETL. Optics library? Image libraries of lenses (the kind you can touch). Optics computing? Sorry, that&#x27;s a synonym of optical computing. Optics design? That&#x27;s the engineering of optical systems. Optics scheme? Guess what arrangements of lenses are called... Optics programming? Aha, now the topic at hand actually manages to be in the majority of the results - barely, since four out of ten are still about that other thing humans have been at for a couple hundred years. Optics &lt;programming language here&gt;? Things for doing optical computations and simulations.<p>[1] Also follows the rule of &quot;if you&#x27;re going to name something after a common word, maybe give it a qualifier not usually used with that word to make it unique and easy to find&quot;. Examples: sphinx (doc, search), click (cli), pyramid (web framework), pacman (linux), language (programming).')
