I just lost patience with the various ways I was forced to keep a part of my brain devoted to work at all times, with the focus on &quot;move fast&quot; over quality, with the dizzying array of bad choices in languages, idioms, and configuration&#x2F;deployment methods, with the endless ego wars, etc. Note that <i>none</i> of these had much to do with the work of writing software itself; they were all aspects of doing it <i>with other people</i> and even more specifically for profit. After having worked at a dozen jobs and even more projects, I knew that switching again would seem better for about a year and then descend into the same grind, which I was disinclined to do when I didn&#x27;t really need to. So I left.<p>To be fair, while I do think the tech industry has some problems (which I&#x27;ve expounded on elsewhere), a lot of my misery was self-inflicted. I might have been able to put up with a lot if I were the kind of person who uses influence to cherry-pick the most enjoyable tasks, but I&#x27;m the kind of person who takes the most important unclaimed tasks - which are often unclaimed because they&#x27;re unpleasant. I&#x27;m proud of that, but it&#x27;s not conducive to happiness. Failure to find that balance is mostly my own fault.<p>So my advice to anyone reading the OP (or my own first paragraph) and thinking along the same lines is: spend some time figuring out what kind of role or specialty within tech would actually <i>make you happy</i> and work toward it ... or toward a comfortable exit if that&#x27;s your conclusion. Chasing dollars (especially FAANG&#x2F;VC dollars) might work out almost by accident, or you might end up damaging yourself. Just drifting along, doing what everyone else does or says you should do, will <i>not</i> cut it.')
