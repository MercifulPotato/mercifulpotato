The government gave itself some emergency powers back in March, but these lapsed after I think 6 weeks and weren&#x27;t renewed.<p>The interesting question is why they didn&#x27;t renew the emergency powers. They arguably weren&#x27;t constitutional in the first place, but the only real challenge to them came from the conspiracy theorists &#x2F;anti-vaxxers who got laughed out of court on about a hundred technicalities.')
