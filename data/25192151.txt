First and foremost, violence that is not in self-defense. So that covers wars, genocide, mass conscription, and taxation. Basically the modern state in general. But that is real life I&#x27;m talking about, which has nothing to do with what goes on within the confines of a video game. I&#x27;ll go back to the original quote:<p>&quot;For your actions in Panzer General will also lead to the deaths of millions, at only one more degree of remove at best.&quot;<p>Your actions, or the actions of anyone else in Panzer General will not lead to a single death, let alone millions. It makes no difference to anyone else but the person who is playing the game. If you enjoy playing the game, then great, have at it. If playing as a German General makes you uncomfortable then that&#x27;s fine too. I really don&#x27;t see any ethical issue here at all.')
