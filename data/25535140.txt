Historically speaking, the Mac mini’s computing power has been a bottleneck for electronic music designers on Broadway. In a perfect world, we’d all like to use the best-sounding sample libraries for our work, but that was never feasible with the Mac mini. Thus, the compromise was always to reduce sound quality to fit within the Mac mini’s compute constraints.<p>What is the complexity with sample libraries? Until now I thought they were just big collections of categorised MP3s, and surely Mac Minis can handle those. I guess I&#x27;m missing something.')
