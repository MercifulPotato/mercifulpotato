Sweden&#x27;s population density is a fraction of Italy&#x27;s and Spain&#x27;s, and even Sweden&#x27;s largest urban centers are dwarfed by Italy and Spain&#x27;s.<p>I mean, to start off Spain has arguably a better national health service than Sweden, and Spain&#x27;s services were quickly overwhelmed by the epidemic that the country was forced to mobilize their armed forces to respond to it.<p>Spain&#x27;s daily death count reached around a thousand deaths per day after the mitigating effects of the first lockdown kicked in. Sweden hasn&#x27;t even experienced a death count that&#x27;s equivalent of a single week of Spain&#x27;s .<p>The reason why Sweden&#x27;s strategy consists of letting covid19 spread like wildfire is based on the fact that in Sweden&#x27;s case it&#x27;s peculiarities serve as spread retardant.')
