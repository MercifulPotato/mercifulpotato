It&#x27;s unclear how one would have figured that was occurring. Or that there was an special AIC (apple interrupt controller) that needed talking to, and how to talk to it. It feels like there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;reverse engineer some Apple kernel bits&quot; that&#x27;s potentially being elided over.<p>Edit: or alternately, some debug interface that isn&#x27;t being mentioned (swd&#x2F;jtag&#x2F;itm).')
