Paul Revere&#x27;s engraving was fiction and portrayed them as murdering the colonists in cold blood, which planted the seeds of the American Revolution.<p>As far as the barrier to mass communication being lower, perhaps, but mass communication was more prominent in the 18th century than you might think.
