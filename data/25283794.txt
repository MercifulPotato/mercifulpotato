I&#x27;ve seen peer-reviewed publications on Facebook and Twitter, hidden behind &quot;misinformation&quot; flags. Questioning orthodox views (even with well-sourced, rational scientific arguments) is enough to get you banned or blocked on the major social media platforms.<p>We&#x27;re in a dark place that I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever see in my lifetime. If you cannot question science, <i>it isn&#x27;t science.</i>')
