Anything above 50kph and the air noise make it impossible to hear. Motorcycles are invisible because a lot people don&#x27;t take driving seriously and don&#x27;t check their mirrors&#x2F;blind spots.<p>The only time I got into an accident was at a red light. I was stopped in front of a car, which was also stopped. The light went green and the car rear ended me, this was mid day, 100% visibility, my bike was bright red, you can&#x27;t fix stupid.')
