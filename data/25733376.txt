Should we take those of the Internet? There are lunatics out there that will believe anything they read whether it is couched as fiction or not.<p>Our right to say and read what we want cannot be determined by the lowest common denominator of what is &#x27;acceptable&#x27;. That is how you arrive at an authoritarian monoculture, fast.<p>The only correct response to disgusting speech is good speech used to tear it down. Both sides here, (I am not a part of either) have dug in so deep that they essentially live in two different realities or dimensions. When perception and the interpretation of the world differs so much between two groups there eventually becomes a point where they cannot coexist. This is where we are headed if we don&#x27;t start trying to find common ground instead of the current environment of complete, unquestioned intolerance of the other.<p>Self examination is what the world needs right now.')
