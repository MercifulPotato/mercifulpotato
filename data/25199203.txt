One of the most common is membrane separation, where C02 is selectively allowed to pass through in a relatively high-pressure, C02-rich source such as a literal smokestack.  Others are vaguely analogous to the chemical C02 scrubbers you might find in a submarine or in spacecraft.<p>At present, it&#x27;s mostly from high density sources that are producing C02. Membrane separation has been around for quite awhile, and works well for that case.  It&#x27;s largely impractical for capturing C02 directly from the air, though.<p>Direct air capture is the hard part.  The &quot;chemical scrubber&quot; approach is being widely tested, but it&#x27;s hard to make the whole thing carbon negative.  It&#x27;s a tractable problem, but not an easy one.')
