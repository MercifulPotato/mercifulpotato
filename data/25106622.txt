Old dog says Nvidia GPU with 8+GB of RAM and thousands of cores is powerful. New trick says M1 with max 8 cores and ??? amount of RAM is more powerful??? My head hurts trying to come up with how. Where is the magic happening that makes 6K+ video run in real time in Resolve, when an Intel CPU with multiple GPUs needs a good wind at its back going downhill. Of the many hand wavy demo details left out, what kind of video are they using? MP4 video, RAW videos, ProRes, etc? Is Resolve running in realtime just playing back the video but immediately chokes when you apply a single node with light grade applied? The M1 release videos and too PR speak for me')
