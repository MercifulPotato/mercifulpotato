It&#x27;s possible to educate a small number of your users (and to a some extent, you should try - for example your post here is a small step in that direction!), but that work is even lower-reward than answering those half-baked reports.<p>To deal with low-effort, good-faith user reports, in COTS scenario, you&#x27;d hire a support&#x2F;TAC person (a team, eventually). For a popular&#x2F;accessible FOSS project, it is possible to have something similar on a volunteer basis:<p>- set up IRC channel&#x2F;slack&#x2F;forum&#x2F;mailing list for that;<p>- display a prominent banner asking to &quot;please try support forum first&quot; on your bug submission page;<p>- encourage people who want to contribute, but are not quite acing your codebase (yet), to hang around in the forum, help others.')
