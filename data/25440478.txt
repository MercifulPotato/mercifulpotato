A person who spends a lot of time alone, and is ok with that, is not lonely.</i><p>Not entirely though. Part of it can be self-dellusion, and the persons can still feel worse off for being alone even if introverted, but not consciously be able to process it. Humans are social animals, introversion can be part of a development issue (like being on the spectrum).')
