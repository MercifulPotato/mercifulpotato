However my point was not to blame the US or take a position on virtue of the blocking of tiktok.  Instead, want to point out a distinction: the US was the original proponent of the open web that most of the west would then follow.<p>China never hid its intentions to control information to its wishes.<p>China can do whatever it wants , but ultimately it is the US that sets the tone for the web. Arguably China did fire the first shot, and deserve to be condemned by it, but until recently most western countries would stand by the open web principle.  I think the US (rightly) has said, we won&#x27;t tolerate abuse any longer.<p>Ergo, this has given cover to other countries to question the wisdom of the open web.  Its no longer the communist &#x2F; authoritarian govts that can tap into this.<p>In other words, the web fragments when free countries decide its acceptable to block back the communists &#x2F; dictators. I refrain from saying whether it is a wise move, I only posit that it looks inevitable at this point.<p>I can&#x27;t edit my original post, but I think this would be more fitting:  &quot;USA fires back with the first shot among free western democracies&quot;.')
