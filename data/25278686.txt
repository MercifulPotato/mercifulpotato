But it&#x27;s still the right thing to do.<p>No it really is not.  but I also do not want to diverge in a debate over healthcare policy and how government run healthcare is not the Utopia people like you make it out to be, nor how many of the advancement in care the world enjoys is funded by the US Health system (which is one of the reason the US health system is so expensive) and if the US does go to be Government Run Single Payer we will see a HUGE decline is health care advancement worldwide<p>&gt;&gt;A hand-in-hat existence has absolutely nothing to do with freedom, if anything it&#x27;s its opposite.<p>This is factually incorrect and ignorant of how these economic regulation actually impact the poor. Most of the time it causes business to fold, and the bottom rungs of the economic ladder to be removed,  limiting options and forcing an ever increasing number of people in to poverty and into the welfare state.  Which is then use ironically to justify more regulation which causes yet more people in the poverty and the welfare state,  this cycle repeats over and over, and over again<p>Government regulations have NEVER lifted anyone out of poverty,  free market capitalism does not, and only free market capitalism')
