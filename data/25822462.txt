And those seem to be very heat-sensitive. At home many LED lamps die as well, presumably because our lamps are somewhat flat on the ceiling and enclosed, which gives the heat nowhere to escape. Those where the air circulation is better and the bulb is in the open air the live a lot longer, to the point that I didn&#x27;t have to replace some of them so far.')
