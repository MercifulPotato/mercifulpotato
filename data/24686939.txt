When that happens I always squash my commit afterwards once the code is in a usable state.<p>The alternative is making bisecting harder which is not something that I want. I want every commit to compile and be testable individually. That definitely doesn&#x27;t mean that I think it&#x27;s a good idea to have &quot;gargantuan&quot; commits.<p>An ideal commit should contain a single, atomic change to the codebase. Not more, but also not less.')
