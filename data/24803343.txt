I had a similar experience of needing to stop when I was younger and was practicing with no teacher in my early 20s, it became overwhelming.<p>I picked it back up about a decade later and found some texts really helpful that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone working at a meditation practice:<p>- &quot;The Other Shore&quot; by Thich Nhat Hanh<p>- &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#x27;s Mind&quot; by ShunryÅ« Suzuki<p>- &quot;Zen Training&quot; by Katsuki Sekida<p>There are of course tons of others, but better to start with fewer than an overwhelming collection of things when getting situated.<p>Also, yeah, the sinuses thing is weird and was also surprising when I started noticing it!<p>Edit: Also, a physical yoga asana practice really brought me a whole lot deeper into my meditation practice. Find a teacher you connect with. Typically yoga studios that have &quot;Mysore&quot; or &quot;Hatha&quot; practices on their schedules will be teaching something that isn&#x27;t just calisthenics.
