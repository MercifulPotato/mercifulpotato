We need more of this in the world.)<p>I see a few important aspects to touch on here...I&#x27;m personally towards the right of the political spectrum, and would probably identify as Libertarian.  First, you&#x27;re generalizing the entire right-wing ideology from a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; starting point. Most right-wing ideology isn&#x27;t based around impacts from &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, it&#x27;s mostly based around believing that the left&#x27;s agenda is bad for America in the long-term. Adding up all the &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; won&#x27;t give you the &quot;sum&quot; of what defines the right&#x27;s beliefs...it could more reliably be defined as &quot;subtracting&quot; the future negative outcomes of left-wing policies. Second, most &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; by nature aren&#x27;t fleshed out and therefore don&#x27;t have clear-cut epistemological foundations. That&#x27;s not to say they aren&#x27;t possibly true in at least some form. It was once a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; to say the Earth was round. <i>Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence</i>. That&#x27;s not to say some things aren&#x27;t completely outrageous, but it&#x27;s much more dangerous to say <i>every</i> &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is fake than the opposite, which is the media&#x27;s&#x2F;left&#x27;s current approach. Third, you&#x27;re over-distilling the term &quot;think for myself&#x2F;yourself&quot;. This doesn&#x27;t literally mean go out and find every single fact yourself, it means diversify your source of news outside of the 3-4 media conglomerates (which are owned by a handful of individuals). Fourth, you seem to skip over the entire aspect of why the parent commenter mentions &quot;think for yourself&quot;. It&#x27;s not only the sweeping censorship that&#x27;s an issue, it&#x27;s also the non-reporting or shadow-banning of any topics that go against the left-wing narrative.<p>Hopefully this adds a little perspective.')
