One thing to note is that the treadwear of these modern tires is higher <i>while still</i> providing better stopping distance when compared to the old &#x27;50-&#x27;60s tires mentioned. Of course there are other factors such as anti-lock brakes, tread design, and other vehicle traits that can decrease the distance. Still, the material component does provide longer life and better performance than in the past.<p>Also, I have owned high performance 200 treadwear tires. The millimeters you are talking about can be meters at highway speeds. You are looking at a return in safety that increases substantially with speed. Roughly, your stopping distance quadruples when you double speed. So 30 feet at 30 mph turns into 120 feet at 60 mph (depending on a ton of factors, including tires). So some people who drive at highway speeds such as 80 mph may prefer the extra safety of performance tires which could shorten their stopping distances by 20 feet.')
