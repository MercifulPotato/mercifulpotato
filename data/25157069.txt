Item(by='sliken', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605842901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142676, text='30 years ago, kids had hobbies, there&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t much to compete.  Legos, collecting stamps&#x2F;baseball cards, catching bugs, building models, photography, racing home build cars, sports, even things like just reading the encyclopedia, etc.  Even libraries weren&#x27;t that well stocked, I think I read every sci-fi book at my local library.<p>Now there&#x27;s literally billions being spent on &quot;free&quot; games, &quot;free video&quot;, &quot;free&quot; social sites, etc and trying every video, audio, vibration, trick in the book to make them more addicting.  It&#x27;s a trap, it encourages vanity, consumerism, poor body image, etc.  I think the best thing you can do for kids these days is make sure they have a healthy amount of time offline.')
