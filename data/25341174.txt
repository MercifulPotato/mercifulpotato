People soon realized paper disturbs the flavor profile of beverages and took that as an opportunity to shape and craft the profiles to their liking given the inevitable. There&#x27;s all kinds of sustainably grown hemp and bamboo paper straws that add some real interesting notes and aftertastes to a beverage that can actually be paired to illuminate and compliment the natural flavors of the many things we enjoy drinking. There&#x27;s a new art in it, it&#x27;s the proverbial lemons to lemonade moment and people are capitalizing on it as long as the once beloved plastic straws remain regulated out of the picture. This is actually how progress happens if you think about it.')
