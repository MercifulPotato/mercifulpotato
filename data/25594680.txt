Item(by='zamadatix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609435400, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594424, text='I think <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25593536" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25593536</a> from the larger comment chain said it pretty well. I also just commented something that may be relevant to these thoughts as well <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25594659" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25594659</a>. The child comment by pickpuck is also quite informative.<p>The tl;dr is it&#x27;s not about there being a way it could have been accessible it&#x27;s that there was no out of the box answer that both did what the project needed and what was needed to have the button be accessible. If you are here to point out there is a way it could have been done well of course, so could everything else on every backlog of every open source project but things get taken off of the backlog by people planning work and putting the time in to do them not by people mentioning there are easy ways it could be done hence why this wasn&#x27;t done (and also why this&#x2F;any piece of software isn&#x27;t perfect as everyone would like).')
