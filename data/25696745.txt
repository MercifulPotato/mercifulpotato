For example, I designed something (low volume) at the start of 2020 with a precision gyroscope that was easily available with over a hundred in stock each at Digikey, Mouser, Avnet etc. and when it came to starting building them around October&#x2F;November, nobody had any parts of any of the variants in stock and the lead time said 22 weeks...<p>Although looking now for that part at least the shortage seems to be easing - there are about a dozen showing up as available across a few places on Octopart and the lead time seems to have dropped back to eight weeks.')
