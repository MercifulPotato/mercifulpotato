Here&#x27;s the bit that mentions it.<p>&gt; Ideologically, it&#x27;s pretty simple: I don&#x27;t believe that ideas can be meaningfully owned as property. That is, I see property as a means to non-violently resolve conflict over scarce resources. But ideas are not scarce, and thus, to me, they are not property and thus should not be treated as property. This is a fundamental assumption on which all intellectual property rests, and so, I reject it from first principles.<p>As I see it, there&#x27;s some transitive logic being invalidly applied here. The post also says it&#x27;s from a viewpoint of practicality. I consider the AGPL style licences are being used for practical goals.')
