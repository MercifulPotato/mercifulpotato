I&#x27;ve specifically witnessed more than one instance of absolutely treasonous behavior by police - threatening to hurt people and make up charges. It&#x27;s counterproductive to think that only &#x27;the left&#x27; is against bad police - nobody wants to pay people to ruin the system.<p>However, those people probably don&#x27;t think that the police &quot;committed acts of brutality against <i>protestors</i>&quot;, they likely see the videos of BLM peacefully protesting and police standing by, and Antifa committing arson and attacking police and police fighting back. (Portland, Chicago, Kenosha) And they think that fighting and arresting rioters is exactly what they pay police for.<p>&gt; their enablers being too ignorant or too hateful to recognize the stupidity of the action and how 2020 has set them back decades in getting people to trust them.<p>You were talking about BLM here? Because &quot;Breona&quot; is just as fake as Jussie Smollet&#x27;s story, and Jacob Blake would have been shot if he was white, etc. Watch the videos of woke white people in Portland shouting racist slurs at black cops to show how much they care about black people in general.')
