We are building a new operating environment that breaks down barriers between apps and gives back privacy and data ownership to users.<p>Anytype runs locally and exchanges data directly in a peer-to-peer way without exposing it to intermediaries even when users work across devices and with each other. Because of this, Anytype is free without storage and upload limits. We plan to open-source it with the public release.<p>This is our early demo and I’d like to get feedback on what we are building, so we can incorporate it into Anytype. Also, if you have any questions, I’d love to answer them.')
