If you have specific requirements, you will maintain those requirements. But, the goal is to push aside weaknesses that don&#x27;t matter (such as nerves during an interview, or lack of truly unrelated knowledge).<p>Instead, the goal should be to ensure _qualified_ candidates can demonstrate the strengths they have in meeting your requirements.<p>So basically, there are two pieces to looking for strengths:<p>1.
