I agree a message like &quot;You got this!&quot; may not always be well received, especially by people suffering from a deep depression. Most of them are more neutral, or at least they seem so to me, like &quot;May you be happy&quot; for example.<p>For people who are not feeling particularly depressed in the moment where they see one of these badges, I believe it could have an uplifting, positive effect. A small one, probably, but that&#x27;s good enough for me.<p>Ultimately, I can&#x27;t control how people react to these, but I am careful about curating the messages and I do intend for them to express genuine kindness.<p>I also agree that this is not a cure-all. No such claim was made, in fact. I do think we could use more kindness at core levels of society, as you say.')
