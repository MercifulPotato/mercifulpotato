These procrastination habits are then worsened by the fact that I am, like many HN users, more efficient at using my computer than I am at using my phone.<p>I&#x27;ve learned to be okay with dicking around on my phone, but with some caveats:<p>* All notifications are turned off. No exceptions.<p>* Phone is only turned on when I&#x27;m home alone and not working or doing some focused activity.\n   - Exception to this rule is that I can use my phone for its actual utility outside the house (e.g., phone calls, maps).<p>Rather than banning distraction altogether, I accept that it&#x27;s inevitable and dedicate my phone to it. I find that this strikes a balance where I can spend quality time alone while still allowing for the occasional indulgence.')
