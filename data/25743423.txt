Even if our brains were able to solve the halting problem, they would still not escape the Incompleteness theorems.<p>And note that it is not that hard, at least in principle, to construct a system that can detect its own incompleteness.<p>As far as we know today, the most likely theory is that our brains are Turing-equivalent computers. There is no other known model of computation, and no scientific argument that would show our vrains&#x2F;thought processes can&#x27;t be computers\n(that is not to say we have proven either of these, they are just the most likely statements, like P!=NP).')
