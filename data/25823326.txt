Just not within the parameters of how we&#x27;ve defined family and parenthood.<p>There&#x27;s a reason societies used collective parenting for centuries and only recently with the push towards individualism that has stopped. There&#x27;s still collective parenting in places of the world that don&#x27;t have that same desire of individualism.<p>We&#x27;ve built our society and economy around the idea of 2 parents and some children. This is an arbitrary decision we&#x27;ve made and it wasn&#x27;t how we came to this point. A push for accepting multi-node families would help nudge us in the right direction. Just changing the tax law to support and provide the same benefits to a union of multiple parents would be extremely useful.<p>We&#x27;ve codefied a single way of living. Maybe we should change that and allow for more dynamic family structures.')
