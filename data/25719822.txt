Vacation, sabbatical, or quit. If you can&#x27;t afford to quit, take any other reasonable job that only requires your attention while at work. Maybe use vacation as emergency time off, and figure out how to quit.<p>Use the first part of your break to decompress. Use the second part of your break to decide whether to stay in your current career, or change it somewhat, or do something completely different.<p>But it&#x27;s not your job to be miserable, and there are many things to do that are not miserable. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether that misery comes from within you or from outside.<p>We&#x27;re all volunteers.')
