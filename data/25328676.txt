What is the relevant is a single driving force that can deliver a coordinated response to Apple as a sinlge, inseparable package and not a shoebox of DIY parts. And the trouble is that the PC industry does not have such one.<p>Back in the 80s, it was IBM being the PC product company with a single product vision and being the trend setter (PC was hardware and software in one package designed to the make the most of each other), and the last failed attempt by IBM to lead the industry was the introduction of the microchannel architecture that no one wanted to licence due to high royalties. After that IBM gave up and became just another PC vendor. This is why we have the PC world as it has been for the last 30+ years (democracy) vs Apple (benevolent dictatorship).<p>Different players (Intel&#x2F;AMD, Microsoft etc) have different stakes in the same game (or hold multiple pieces of the same puzzle â€“ depending how one pleases to see it), and they may (or may not) have a busines incentive to play nicely with each other. One potential solution could be completely opening up the x86 architecture and giving everyone equal rights to the IP pool so the situation such as that one of the microchannel arch royalties does not come up again (i.e. Apple business units does not have to licence technology components from ot to each other). But then, again, a single driving force would still be required to deliver a single product. Perhaps, a new contender could then emerge.<p>And an interesting thought excercise is that one of the PC market deciding that it does not need a disruption, and it will remain content with the status quo and just soldier on. Which is not entirely implausible, either.')
