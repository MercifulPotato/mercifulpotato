And I can&#x27;t understand why FB - a much wealthier corporation - can&#x27;t fix numerous problems with its Messenger app. Sometimes the messages don&#x27;t sync correctly, sometimes voice messages don&#x27;t play, sometimes images are not loaded in high quality, the search sucks, removing a single message requires 3 taps!, etc. etc. None of these happened in tg for me, and yet, I don&#x27;t know why more people aren&#x27;t using it.<p>Given the open-source nature of tg, I would imagine someone would put together a Messenger client based on tg source code. I guess that would solve many problems with FB&#x27;s own messenger.')
