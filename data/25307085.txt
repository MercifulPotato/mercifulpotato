You can&#x27;t just analyze the payout in isolation; you have to analyze its sum total effects. Turns out, the payment wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Google has said as much and won&#x27;t be doing it again in the future.<p>&gt; If the general developer public thinks that Android was acquired for too little, then we will all be reluctant to sell our projects to Google. That&#x27;s the whole point.<p>I&#x27;m still not understanding the point here.  If you agree to sell your company for price $X, it doesn&#x27;t matter who you&#x27;re selling to; you&#x27;ve sold for that amount.  If you think you should get more than $X, then don&#x27;t sell to Google, or anyone else for that matter, for only $X.  If you want less up front but more money over time as part of an incentive structure, then negotiate for that as part of the acquisition (which Andy Rubin did do and was paid out for).  All of this is independent from a severance payout fully 15 years after the acquisition.')
