If anyone can give some answers to my questions I&#x27;ll be very grateful<p>- My understanding is, that the initial distribution of Nano was the only time new coins will be generated. Is that correct?<p>- I can&#x27;t find any information on protection mechanisms against voting monopolies. If a few representatives accumulate enough Nano, they could simply start voting against transactions that removes money from their voters. It makes me concerned that the &quot;freedom&quot; will only exist as long as the wealth equality is high. Have I missed something here?')
