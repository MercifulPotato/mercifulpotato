But it doesn&#x27;t help the content appear more &quot;real&quot; or &quot;better&quot; or &quot;HDR-like&quot;. Therefore, HDR is simply &quot;the ability to discern between different levels of color.&quot; And if you try to measure exactly how many levels of color a human can discern, the answer is no more than the 256^3 available via 8-bit RGB.<p>The precise claim: if you have two screens next to each other, one 8-bit RGB and one 10-bit RGB, and both screens are color calibrated &#x2F; brightness calibrated identically, and the viewing conditions are identical for both screens, then if you blindfold someone and put them in front of a random screen, they will be unable to say &quot;Ah, this is the 10-bit RGB screen!&quot; more than random chance.')
