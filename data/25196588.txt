In clang and gcc it&#x27;s the sanitizers (ubsan, asan, tsan and msan) while in MSVC it&#x27;s RTC and SDL.<p>These build modes catch the vast majority of undefined behavior, and with relatively low performance overhead. If you&#x27;re not running your tests with sanitizers enabled, you&#x27;re missing out on a nearly free way to locate and eliminate an entire class of bugs.')
