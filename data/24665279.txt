And the company will pocket the remaining $460k, to be paid out to the owners as profits.<p>It&#x27;s because of this that I try to work as little as possible, preferably remotely. I claim to the company that I work 8 hours, in reality I work between 4 to 6 hours, and if I&#x27;m really quick, simply 2 hours (happens rarely).<p>That&#x27;s how I keep my &quot;profit&quot;, and if I meet expectations it&#x27;s good enough for me. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be happy once they find out.')
