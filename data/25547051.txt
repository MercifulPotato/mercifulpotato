That left no room for the Bosch rain&#x2F;light&#x2F;humidity sensor, so they put developed their own light&#x2F;humidity sensor, but still didn&#x27;t have enough room for rain sensing hardware. The solution was left up to the autopilot team since it was assumed (wrongly) that sensing rain using a camera was easier than using specific optical sensors designed for the task.<p>Source: I worked on the replacement TH sensor.')
