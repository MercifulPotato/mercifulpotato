Wayland defines integer scaling only and then compositors scale 2x content down to 1.5x or whatever it is you want. This means that if you have an app that&#x27;s capable of drawing at arbitrary scale you are still forced to draw at 2x and then be scaled down by the compositor. This is needlessly blurry and a performance penalty. Text can be drawn at arbitrary scale but is blurry because of this. Browsers can render at any resolution but have substantial performace penalties because of this (2x at common fractional scales). Anything that renders images also gets needless downscales because of this with both quality and performance penalties. It&#x27;s a baffling decision to not do this client side and hopefully will be fixed with the evolution of the protocol.')
