Item(by='ericd', descendants=None, kids=[25048355], score=None, time=1605027216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25046427, text='This is a commonly repeated trope, I guess it&#x27;s to inoculate people from being &quot;suckered in&quot;, but it hasn&#x27;t been true from what I&#x27;ve seen, having lots of friends involved startups. Even &quot;failing&quot; startups frequently get acquihired for non-trivial amounts per person, and since the point of that is to get the people, those amounts typically go to retaining the people. And many of the people I&#x27;ve known have done really well by employee equity, a couple with multiple 7 figure payoffs, some with instant retirement amounts, a couple with serious maybe-I-buy-a-jet megawealth.<p>It&#x27;s not guaranteed like a FAANG salary (which actually isn&#x27;t completely, the past few years have seen great stock appreciation), usually it takes a few rolls of the dice, but it&#x27;s just not accurate to describe it as a definite 0. Startup selection ability pays a serious role here, I&#x27;ve seen people whose picks I shake my head at consistently, and some people who can home in on successful ones like heatseeking missiles. If you&#x27;re the type to take the story of a business person about lofty valuations and prospects at face value, though, you&#x27;re probably going to have a bad time and end up bitter and talking about how bad a deal startups are on the internet.')
