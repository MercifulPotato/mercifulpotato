As the price goes down, the retail investor gets shorter (higher chance his put finishes in the money), whereas the dealer gets longer.<p>In general, retail investors don&#x27;t hedge, whereas dealers do. As the stock price goes down, the dealer needs to sell stock to hedge and avoid getting net long the stock. Thus a gamma squeeze tends to exacerbate rather than mollify volatility.')
