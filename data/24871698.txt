This doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Of course you should put a scarf over your nose. At those temperatures , exposed skin freezes very quickly so you need to cover all your skin or you&#x27;ll get frostbite.<p>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with a scarf freezing stiff like you describe. They build up ice crystals of course, but they don&#x27;t interfere with air flow and are easily broken.<p>The biggest problem I expect from wearing a mask in the winter is that they&#x27;ll get damp quickly because the cold temperatures, and perhaps having a scarf over top, will prevent moisture from evaporating.')
