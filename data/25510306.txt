It&#x27;s absolutely a bluff on the part of the interviewer, and they know it.<p>What they&#x27;ll do is sit you down after the &quot;results&quot; come in and say: &quot;hey, we both know you weren&#x27;t 100% truthful during the test, the results clearly indicate you lied during key parts of the interview. Is there anything you&#x27;d like to tell us?&quot;<p>I cannot stress enough that the actual results of what the polygraph say are not factored in whatsoever.')
