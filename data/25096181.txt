What would you say to someone who said they were going to give up plastic straws but gave in and still used them once a week for example?  There&#x27;s certain cases where strong disapproval is more valid and you can&#x27;t blame lack of self control so much.<p>I&#x27;d argue giving people too much of a break doesn&#x27;t help either.<p>I think a big part about why people can&#x27;t give up meat is that they&#x27;re surrounded by people telling them it&#x27;s okay. There&#x27;s people that know meat is bad for climate change  and know killing animals is wrong but won&#x27;t reduce their meat eating because they see people around them are complacent too.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to see some evidence that promoting the &quot;baby steps&quot; approach is the right one because it could easily be making it worse.')
