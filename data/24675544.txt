America is a liberal democracy seeking world peace.</i><p>A democracy still has the full capacity to do the worst damage to foreign countries for their national interests. We know that all the way back to the Athenian Democracy. It&#x27;s &quot;democracy at home, fuck the others to advance our well-being abroad&quot;.<p>The US had bombed, invaded, toppled governments, supported dictatorships, etc. countries all over the world, not sure where it got the moral upper hand.<p>Heck, using the name &quot;HenryKissinger&quot; as if it&#x27;s a good thing, says it all. If it&#x27;s irony, then, well, you already know my point.<p>&gt;<i>For the record, I have a college degree, I&#x27;m in my late twenties, I was raised in a liberal household, I&#x27;m a liberal, I have no religious beliefs, and I&#x27;m voting for Joe Biden.</i><p>Which means squat. Democrats have been as bad, if not worse, offenders as Republicans when it comes to foreign wars and furthering US interests.')
