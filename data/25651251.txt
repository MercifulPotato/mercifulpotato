Dams require a reservoir, which takes land out of use and changes the flow dynamics of a river. It can interrupt wildlife patterns both up and downstream. It introduces some risks of dam failure, and decommissioning a dam requires careful management of built up sediment. Flooded organic matter anaerobically produces methane.<p>It also requires significant space and particular configurations (must be on a river, must be in a hilly or mountainous area, etc.) It also isn&#x27;t necessarily scalable -- how many more dams can we build?<p>You can build a crane and blocks or drill a big hole in lots and lots of places.<p>So yes, pumped hydro is better than fossil fuels. But also it&#x27;s not something we can consider to be the ultimate solution to the issue of storage. By all means, let&#x27;s use it (and we do use it today), but not stop there.')
