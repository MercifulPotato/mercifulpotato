Docker has never and will never run on a Mac natively. The way it works on Intel-based Macs is through the xhyve&#x2F;hyperkit hypervisor, i.e. it virtualises Linux. That&#x27;s the only way it can work. It&#x27;s also why you can limit how many CPU cores and RAM Docker can use, since you&#x27;re just giving the underlying virtual machine those limits through the Docker settings app. And it&#x27;s just a memory hog. It will eat RAM up to the amount you specify rather than dynamically allocating and deallocating as per the requirements of each running container like on Linux.<p>It shocks me that so many people want to run Docker on a platform it was never built for. The suggestion above is not bizzare, it&#x27;s a normal use case: run Docker on Linux like it&#x27;s meant to be run.<p>Docker for Mac has had performance issues for years, especially related to file I&#x2F;O. The common suggestion is to use NFS to get around those, which is just ridiculous when you think about it.
