These things helped me:\n- Stay dressed for “work.” Basically, I don’t change into my pajamas until I’m done studying. Even in covid times, I usually have work clothes I wear during the day. Maybe not a button down, but definitely not something as comfy as my lounge clothes. \n- Have a ridiculously low bar for getting started. For me, something like “I will watch 2 minutes of lecture,” is low enough that it feels trivial. 90% of the time, I finish up what I’d normally plan. There are some days where just making that low bar feels exhausting, but the fact I did it helps me keep momentum for the next day. Forgive yourself if the low bar is all you achieve some days. Other days, you’ll be on top of the world.\n- Being exhausted a lot is touted as normal in our culture. This is how you know you’re “adulting good.” Don’t buy in to it and figure out if there may be an underlying cause. Maybe you drink caffeine too late. Maybe you need to go to bed earlier. I personally found out I was iron deficient and getting some more iron in my diet was like getting a new lease on life. I had assumed I was okay because being tired and needing coffee is so prevalent. I bet a lot of people are like me and not realize something is off, so I just want to mention it.')
