It&#x27;s actually quite similar to CSRF prevention. On the site itself, display a random nonce to the user for confirmation then send an request for authentication to the authenticator with said nonce which the user can confirm. The battle.net authenticator does this.<p>For added protection, you can prompt the user to select which nonce is correct to force them to verify it is correct. The Microsoft authenticator does this sometimes.<p>The downside of this approach is that it requires a constant connection between the second factor the service. It also relies on the fact that the service authenticates itself via TLS or some other means, though that is a relatively minor issue.')
