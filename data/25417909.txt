We&#x27;re divided into three sections, one for clinical work, one for research, and one for education. I always tell people that I&#x27;m pretty content being in research (which is less sexy than clinical), because if I screw something up, some PI&#x27;s project takes ten months and one week instead of ten months. In clinical, if you screw something up, somebody dies! I just don&#x27;t think I could handle that level of stress.')
