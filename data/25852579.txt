The symptoms are black screen for a second, then the OS resets the hardware, restarts the driver, and resumes rendering of the desktop. Observed quite a few times working on advanced GPU stuff, especially compute shaders.<p>When I mine cryptocurrency while playing games, I appear to sometimes run out of GPU memory (Both Task Manager and MSI Afterburner let me monitor usage) and I have experienced this reset.  It&#x27;s surprisingly graceful, even when a game is running, though NVIDIA Broadcast often doesn&#x27;t like it and needs to be restarted, and I will sometimes see lingering graphical glitches in the game until I restart, but it&#x27;s not game breaking.<p>You can also trigger a GPU reset manually with CTRL-WIN-SHIFT-B.')
