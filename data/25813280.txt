I was trying to write a shader recently (not an OpenGL guy) to add the Fresnel term to an otherwise snells-law shader. It&#x27;s easy to find the math, but hard to find a simple implemnentation. I&#x27;d like the full basic model with that and a roughness term with a proper reflectance function (Schlick should be fine) but again, it&#x27;s hard to find code for what should be a common 50 line shader.')
