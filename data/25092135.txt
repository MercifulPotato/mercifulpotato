You can take anything he says and turn it around, say the exact opposite, and it would also make you nod your head. For instance &quot;Important things rarely have one cause.&quot; Or you could say &quot;Important things usually have one cause.&quot; The pandemic has one cause, the virus. Or &quot;People believe what they want to believe&quot; is literally a tautology. Or &quot;progress requires optimism and pessimism&quot; could be turned into &quot;progress requires blind optimism&quot; which would be equally true. Finally, I don&#x27;t think Morgen Housel exists. Look at his photo, it&#x27;s obviously generated by an AI, as are his tripe-filled posts.')
