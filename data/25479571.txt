That&#x27;s dead on.<p>I disagree a little bit, because I don&#x27;t think they should be praised for acknowledging their mistake and correcting it: I think that&#x27;s the minimum expectation we should have for journalists. I agree that it&#x27;s a sign of integrity (professional integrity, specifically) to own your errors, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly courageous to do it; more that the opposite would be cowardly.')
