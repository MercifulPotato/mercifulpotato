Trump may lose this election due to his personality and inability to work with other people and take advice but many of us really respect him calling out the trade deficit and import tax disparities with our trading partners as a solution to part of the underemployment problem. There was a point in history when we were happy to trade with the developing world at a loss in order to raise their standard of living, but now that most of those countries are capable of being self sufficient we should no longer import foreign manufactured goods tax free, we should block those imports or tax them to the point it makes sense for these companies to open factories in the US.')
