In the vast majority of cases the script kiddies find out about the vulnerability when the patch is released. Then some bad guy has to write the script to target it, and distribute that and&#x2F;or scale it. All a site owner has to do to win, is patch faster than that.</i><p>Again you’re over estimating the average IT team’s ability to keep on top of WP patches. And again I have to reiterate my point about the advantages of a good WAF (web application firewall).<p>I’m not making a theoretical argument here. I’ve seen and have had to fix numerous sites from companies with competent developers and sys admins but who were simply unlucky enough not to notice that one RCE vulnerability in time.<p>&gt; <i>I’m sure you saw a lot of CMS installations that got hacked. I’m also sure that most them were because of either poor patch discipline, or misconfiguration, or both.</i><p>Neither actually. Just busy teams in medium sized business having a plethora of projects and too little time to manage everything with the same degree of love that your larger companies or start ups do when they have a dedicated team working in a single product.<p>Remember the appeal of WP for many is that it is “plug and play” so it often gets installed in organisations as a way of reducing the burden on existing developers and&#x2F;or sysadmins. A strategy that makes complete sense on paper but can back fire spectacularly.<p>Let’s also remember that WP also appeals to the hobbyists too. You can’t accuse them of being incompetent sysadmins because they never set out to be technical. Instead they were sold on how easy WP is to install and manage.<p>Again this is why I keep discussing WAFs. Using them is non-obvious but it does reduce the burden on whatever individual or team manage WP.<p>&gt; <i>But even then a popular CMS may have an advantage: it’s a lot easier to find professional help for a popular CMS than for a niche or custom one.</i><p>Oh i agree. Choosing an established CMS isn’t a bad decision as there are plenty of benefits in doing so.<p>&gt; <i>Honestly, running any software at all is going be a nightmare for a lot of people. Hence the success of products like Squarespace and Wix; now they don’t have to.</i><p>This I agree with too.')
