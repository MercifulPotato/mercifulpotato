Are there any open&#x2F;important bugs or is it just because of e.g. a low usage of the language itself on the Gentoo distro, or maybe because the specs of the language are still changing, etc...?<p>I think that e.g. Rust more or less as old as Julia, but Rust on Gentoo is marked as being stable since a long time... .')
