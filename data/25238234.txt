So they were only fabricating intel chips, that&#x27;s not nearly as big of a business as TSMC.  So basically, TSMC can keep their last 3+ gens of fabs open and making product, while intel couldn&#x27;t really reap any benefit from keeping old process nodes open.<p>AMD made a good call selling off global foundries when it was apparent they couldnt keep up with Intel even.<p>I think the really rough issue here is what happens if China does try to take Taiwan (and this is not unrealistic as China has been more aggressive towards them recently).<p>TSMC is now a strategic asset for the USA.  We&#x27;ve been attempting to get them to build a fab in the states for exactly this reason.')
