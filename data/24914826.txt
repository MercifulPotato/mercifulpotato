No-code seems to reject a lot of those learnings, for better or worse.<p>When I was a kid we had Microsoft front page, a no-code solution that allowed you to create a web page. A few years into college my brother-in-law started making money writing web pages in plain CSS and HTML and a little jQuery. I asked him why he could make money when I could make the web page in front page. he said it was much as easier to change the web page over time when it was written in code than changing the auto-generated garbage HTML that front page produced. No code, then, stood up poorly over time back then and I doubt it will today except as a way to make standard parts out of modular pieces of software, sort of like Unix did back in the &#x27;80s with its modular command line tools.')
