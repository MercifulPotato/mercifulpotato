What you might not know -- and what I only learned about a year ago -- is that there was an effort within Apple&#x27;s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) to make more of the whole system (and programming generally) &quot;Hypercard-like&quot; called SK8 [1]. It seems like it was received with confused stares from the more traditional developers in the company. And, as with much of the really interesting ATG work, it was tossed out eventually.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SK8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SK8</a>')
