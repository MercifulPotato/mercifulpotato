Item(by='wpietri', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609944959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25655588, text='You are confusing &quot;really guilty&quot; with &quot;really knows&quot;.<p>The whole theory behind paying CEOs their current absurd salaries is that they are 5-D chess geniuses, responsible for the value created by up to millions of people doing actual work.<p>How can a CEO be in control enough to deserve all of the profits but so out of control that they deserve none of the blame?<p>The practical outcome is that high-level executives create plausible deniability. In your story, they issue edicts like &quot;our chemical disposal bill is too high! Fix it!&quot; or just &quot;Our per-store costs are too high!&quot; and ride roughshod over objections. &quot;Don&#x27;t bring me problems! Solve them!&quot; The pressure rolls downhill. People trying to do the right thing get yelled at or fired; people doing the wrong thing skate on by, because the metrics look better. So everybody learns to do what the CEO implicitly wants: cutting corners to increase profits.<p>If the CEOs don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s the natural outcome of their behavior then they&#x27;re negligent or criminally incompetent. If they do, they&#x27;re just criminals. But they have plenty of money to create enough deniability that they can walk away. Possibly using some lower subordinate as a scapegoat, when he was just responding to incentives that the CEO set up.<p>In my view, whether or not a CEO has direct knowledge of a direct crime is irrelevant. At the CEO level, they don&#x27;t have direct knowledge of anything, but they have power over everything. It&#x27;s not clear to me positions like that should exist, but as long as they do exist, they should be responsible for the whole system that they have so eagerly taken charge of. Ignorance cannot be an excuse.')
