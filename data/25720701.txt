People have always sought out information channels that reinforce their own views. Twitter&#x2F;FB&#x2F;Youtube were already infamous for presenting entirely different streams of content to left and right wing audiences. When they were less popular it was Fox vs MSNBC&#x2F;CNN etc. and before that the newspaper you read.<p>The issue we&#x27;re seeing now is that people are being attacked by a torrent of information. You&#x27;re much more likely to be radicalised if every 5 minutes you get a tweet notification about the latest &quot;deep state paedophilia ring&quot;; compared to receiving a monthly newsletter that can be analysed and picked apart in the interim period.')
