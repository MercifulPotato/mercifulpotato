Most hardware synths have one-knob-per-function on a UI the size of a large panel. You can mould the sound in a tactile way.<p>With a VST, everything goes through a mouse. And you&#x27;ll probably spend some of your time getting distracted by moving windows around to show&#x2F;hide other VSTs.<p>It&#x27;s a much more cerebral experience.<p>My biggest problem with software is that it&#x27;s so limited. VSTs and DAWs ape hardware studios far too literally.<p>I&#x27;d like to be able to connect anything to anything - including VST internals to the internals in other VSTs. And add some generative&#x2F;programmed elements. But most DAWs either don&#x27;t allow that at all, or they only allow it with severe limitations.')
