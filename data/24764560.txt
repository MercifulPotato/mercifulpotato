The more restrictive licenses like GPL 2 or AGPL, I think Google either flat out denied or you had to do a lot more work to get permission.<p>Personally, I consider that a feature rather than a bug. There&#x27;s a list of these licenses [1] and I make sure my software uses one of those on the list.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.google&#x2F;docs&#x2F;thirdparty&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;#banned" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.google&#x2F;docs&#x2F;thirdparty&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;#banned</a>')
