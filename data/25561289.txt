I am in Europe (Czechia), paying $3500 <i>monthly</i> while making $100k yearly <i>before taxes and healthcare&#x2F;social insurance deductions</i> (over 48% of my income in total, and that&#x27;s still low for Europe).<p>Healthcare in the US is relatively expensive for poorer people. That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s not expensive in absolute terms. It&#x27;s cheap for a programmer, any programmer in Europe (except Switzerland) is paying way more.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on the quality of care here, because you can&#x27;t just compare costs 1:1... It&#x27;s extremely bad. Even the worst options in the US are miles ahead. The healthcare providers here will treat you like the worst scum of earth.<p>That&#x27;s from personal experience. I&#x27;ll be moving to the US soon - healthcare is one of the big reasons.')
