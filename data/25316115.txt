Just like how you can take your code with ease from one solution to the next by cloning.<p>Itâ€™s the same idea that we already use for our code but applied to all the other bits that are necessary for maintaining projects.<p>There are some pretty obvious problems with actually implementing this, however. One of which comes down to getting all the existing code hosting solutions to agree on a standard. As they could simply create ancillary standards to differentiate thenselves. Not to mention all the work involved in implementing this when most people are accepting of what we have now (until it bites them somehow).')
