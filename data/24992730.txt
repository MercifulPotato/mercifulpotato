I live in the suburbs in the Midwest. I work in tech. My company builds open source technology used by millions of developers around the world. My neighbors work at leading health care technology companies or startups.<p>We did all of this on our own. In fact, many of us here in tech have scars from being discounted outright by SV investors simply based on location. Show some respect and humility for what we&#x27;ve built here on our own, without your seemingly necessary support, or you&#x27;ll find this movement backfire.')
