I was wondering if it would be revisited. I certainly understand that lack of confidence, though I think I&#x27;d worried more about the false negative: something <i>should</i> be available to the client, but for whatever reason the compiler couldn&#x27;t identify it. That said, I think tooling could go a long way to address the false positive. For example, in Next.js dev mode, there&#x27;s an indicator that says whether a page can be statically rendered. If there were tools that said &quot;we&#x27;ve automatically marked this component for the client bundle&quot; and allowed the dev to manually opt out if they&#x27;re sure the component shouldn&#x27;t be sent to the client, it&#x27;s still nice to have for the non-pathological case.<p>Anyway, thanks for filling in more detail!')
