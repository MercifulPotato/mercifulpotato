The topology is teapot-esque. The texture composed of coral-like appendages. Sorry if this is overly semantic, I just happen to be in a deep dive in Shape Analysis at the moment ;)<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; DALLÂ·E appears to relate the shape of a half avocado to the back of the chair, and the pit of the avocado to the cushion.<p>That could be human bias recognizing features the generator yields implicitly. Most of the images appear as &quot;masking&quot; or &quot;decal&quot; operations. Rather than a full style transfer. In other words the expected outcome of &quot;soap dispenser in the shape of hibiscus&quot; would resemble a true hybridized design. Like an haute couture bottle of eau du toilette made to resemble rose petals.<p>The name DALL-E is terrific though!')
