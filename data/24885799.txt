You want to read a lot and you don&#x27;t want to pay for something like Kindle Unlimited, but you&#x27;re also unwilling to pirate your books. Is there a big user base for that? A single collection download is smaller than a video game and can contain nearly every notable work ever written in a given genre. If you download that, find an author you like, and purchase new releases from them you&#x27;re contributing more than someone who only reads public domain literature.')
