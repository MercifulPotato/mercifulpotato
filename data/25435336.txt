You&#x27;d think there would be lot&#x27;s of best practice we could follow from the wonderful world of politics, but it turns out that isn&#x27;t a thing in the &#x27;real world&#x27;.\nIf we achieve our ambitions in a few years we will have 10% of the EU population, and even more in the US (103.7 million US citizens own shares through collective investments). \nRather than waiting for problems to arise we are looking to get ahead of this curve.\nWe have a number of things going for us, 1. we are not reliant on advertising revenues 2. we will know who everyone is (free speech doesn&#x27;t have to equal anonymous speech) and 3. we have so many examples of how not to do this.\nWe ;ook forward to the constructive criticism we will undoubtedly get from groups like hacker news. \nAny upfront thoughts would be much appreciated.')
