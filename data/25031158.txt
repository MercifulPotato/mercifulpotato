In fact, users may not think location services have been disabled if apps are still able to show their location after the fact.<p>Do you happen to know if the location look-up (probably for nearby hotspots) is anonymized or not? I can imagine this would be an issue if your specific query can be tied to a specific device. Obviously this isn&#x27;t an issue if you have Find my iPhone enabled since you consent to Apple having your location anyways.')
