Rocket explodes, no big deal, we expected that, the next one is ready.<p>NASA is not like that, they are more conservative, spend a lot of time and money making sure things work the first time, so when they don&#x27;t, then it is a problem.<p>This, BTW, is one thing that killed Armadillo Aerospace.<p>&gt; Carmack said another mistake the company made was not to go into series production, making several versions of the STIG rockets simultaneously so that the loss of a single vehicle would not be as traumatic. “That was our critical mistake in the last few years, because we should have been able to put more of these together,” he said.<p>It is not that NASA doesn&#x27;t have the right to fail, but in their case, it is a major setback, and it is a bit disappointing considering how much SLS went overboard.')
