I have one, since it&#x27;s just a little script but there is a very good reason that &quot;stream of consciousness writing&quot; isn&#x27;t how we do ... anything.<p>I&#x27;m very curious to see how this can be used but I&#x27;m not immediately convinced, you generate commit comments while you write code, documentation is a completely separate thing.<p>A stream of comments on the <i>why</i> of some parts of code, for people who screencasted the development, would be useful. You could reorganize that stuff and get a really nice set of data about the reasons for code evolution.<p>That&#x27;s not user facing documentation however, and providing design docs as documention, especially as stream of consciousness design comments seems like it might not be what people expect or want.')
