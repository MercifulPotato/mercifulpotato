Certain circles say that the affluent are causation for capital markets operating efficiently. More specifically, that the purchasing power of the affluent are the source or &quot;spring&quot; from which economic activity is generated. It&#x27;s just not true.<p>Economic activity is generated by the act of expenditure. The act is a threshold behavior relative to the an economic agent&#x27;s ratio of liquid assets to fixed costs. &quot;Hey, the rich spend a lot of the cash and pump the economy!&quot;. &quot;Hey, conversely, the debt to income ratio of Bob will always disincentivize him against market participation!&quot;.<p>Back to your point. The financial system favors the wealthy because it&#x27;s capitalism. Capital is power and power is influence. That influence has systemically skewed political and financial institutions to favor those with aggregations of wealth. This is also true in free enterprise markets where consolidation is a natural result of the economic cycle and economies of scale.<p>But, I wholeheartedly disagree with posing personal wealth inequality as a core driver of economic inequality in the US. I honestly see this as a symptom of vast market consolidation occurring since the 1950&#x27;s. Bigger business structures eliminate structural redundancies in a market which can reduce costs for the consumer. But, the side effect is income hierarchies are stratified and flattened at a market level creating economic caste systems. And, being a vibrant and faithful patron of the free market system becomes a lot harder for normal guys like Bob.')
