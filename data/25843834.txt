But CCP is the <i>only</i> party that actually advances the interests of Chinese civilization. All the other parties only care about destroying CCP, no matter the negative consequences to Chinese society. Also, half of the reasons people use to oppose the CCP, are either false, or based on twisted half-truths. When I see such unwarranted attacks, how can I not help but feel defensive? It&#x27;s my and my relatives&#x27; future that&#x27;s at stake.<p>I don&#x27;t need everyone to become CCP fans. I&#x27;d already be happy if people can see CCP in a more realistic, nuanced manner, rather than a cartoon villain.<p>&gt; However, I have a very strong distaste for the CCP and really would like to see them dismantled. For this reason, I doubt I will ever visit China, simply because I&#x27;ve been very publicly vocal in this position.<p>This reminds me of myself more than 10 years ago. Back then I had been indoctrinated by western media and western views of China for 15 years. China is bad, China is communism, China kills people, Mao killed millions, one child policy bad, etc. When at the airport and police stations I saw government workers with those typical hats on, an alarm bell goes off in my head: OMG communism!!!!<p>But years later, I got married to my Chinese wife. I started having more interactions with Chinese people. I started researching Chinese recent history. I started researching Chinese society. I started talking to westerners actually living in China.<p>And I found out that a lot of the stuff people here say about the CCP are twisted half-truths, either deliberately or based on misunderstandings due to different culture and values. The Chinese police, rather than brutal enforces, and actually very friendly, don&#x27;t carry guns, and it&#x27;s very common for people to quarrel with the police without suffering consequences. Try that in some western countries.')
