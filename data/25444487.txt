What tries to pass for &quot;legit&#x2F;mainstream&quot; these days is plain old propaganda.  Thedonald.win itself exists because the original group, r&#x2F;The_Donald, was censored and  banned from reddit on the excuse that they were inciting violence against the police.   This, of course, happened just before inciting violence against the police was considered cool.  If you want to know what that other side thinks (supposing you are on the other&#x27;s other side), go to thedonald.win.')
