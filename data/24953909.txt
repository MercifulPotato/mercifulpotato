Item(by='Arnavion', descendants=None, kids=[24954859, 24956489], score=None, time=1604168625, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24953457, text='The video doesn&#x27;t show that part of the textbook. I found some pages from the series but they&#x27;re pretty innocuous. [1]<p>But it&#x27;s probably accurate. It&#x27;s not a history textbook but a literature textbook for primary school students. It was probably meant to be used in Hindi classes. So this kind of bullshit would fly under the guise of &quot;it&#x27;s just a story&quot;.

The first few pages are just a preface talking about how the book has collected tales to bolster moral values and duties in the reader. Then there are a bunch of contents pages.<p>The third contents page does match the two short scenes from the video that show the titles of the stories - &quot;8. Nirlobh adarsh jivan&quot; and &quot;17. Parishram ka koi vikalp nahin&quot; (though the latter in the video is titled &quot;Parishram ka vikalp...&quot;, no &quot;koi&quot;).<p>So presumably this is the contents page for Prernadeep 3. I can&#x27;t tell just from the contents page which story might be the one in question, though. The video says it&#x27;s on page 22 but the contents page doesn&#x27;t have page numbers. It might be #36 - &quot;Bahin, ham bhaaratiya hain&quot; &quot;Sister, we are Indian&quot; - or #53 perhaps - &quot;Kya aapne ishvar ko dekha hai?&quot; &quot;Have you ever laid eyes on God&quot; ?<p>The last page has one story and the start of another one (listed in the very first contents page, so preumably from Prernadeep 1 rather than 3), but they&#x27;re pretty innocuous.<p>[2]: The larger context around that story is even more amusing, because it&#x27;s being &quot;told&quot; by Dr Radhakrishnan (President in the 50s and well-known for liking teachers; his birthday is celebrated as &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Day&quot;) to a white person who claims to be very &quot;close to God&quot;.')
