This isn&#x27;t the worst of both worlds; it&#x27;s simply a consequence of refcounting.<p>The same issue occurs in c++ if you&#x27;re sloppy with  shared_ptr.  If you know what you&#x27;re doing, you can break cycles with weak references in either language.  Where Python has diapers, c++ has footguns aplenty.')
