Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=[25492305], score=None, time=1608522970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25490296, text='&gt; Six times is in the same order of magnitude<p>I don&#x27;t think this sentence has any meaning. What is &quot;the same order of magnitude&quot;? By the normal definition (still not great, but at least it&#x27;s well-defined), 6 times x is only in the same order of magnitude as x when x is in the range [0,1.7), and it&#x27;s in the next order of magnitude up when x is in [1.7,10). Even if we adjust that to a log scale, 6x is in the same order of magnitude when x is in the interval [0,0.23] and in the next higher order of magnitude when x is in (0.23, 1).<p>This is not a solid foundation for the idea that &quot;six times is in the same order of magnitude&quot;, even if we think the sentence is interpretable.')
