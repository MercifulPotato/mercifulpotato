In fact, they&#x27;re the only one that can: China. Everyone else will continue on their slow path, more or less adopting everything SpaceX figures out a decade after the fact. The other competition operates permanently by hand-me-downs. China will invest huge sums of money and labor into doing the same thing and the difference between them and eg the Europeans, is the Chinese will and can move with ridiculous speed by comparison. The other competition won&#x27;t adjust their speed, so they&#x27;ll generally continue to lag SpaceX perpetually, whereas China can move at a far greater pace (aerospace, as with a few other big segments like semiconductors, is of course a core logical focus point for China, which means they will catch up no matter the cost; they&#x27;ll borrow from SpaceX better than anyone else and faster than anyone else, right up to the point of copying everything). And to be clear, I don&#x27;t fault China at all for that approach, it will work very well; they can leapfrog everyone not named SpaceX that way.')
