For output into electricity though it doesn&#x27;t matter if Iâ€™m 35lbs heavier than a pro because watts are watts.<p>Regardless it seems to me that these levels of output using a full body motion of a rowing machine would be exceedingly difficult for a one hour period compared to cycling that leaves most of your muscle groups relaxed.')
