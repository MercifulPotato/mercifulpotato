It&#x27;s not the best setup but it&#x27;s based on trying different things. Might be useful for those who are trying to figure out their own setup:<p>=======<p>Just another opinion on the balanced note taking method:<p>I think org-mode solves almost all offline note-taking requirements<p>* org-roam makes it super-easy to link notes<p>* emacs as an editor is as usable as any other editor<p>* Rich media is possible and easy to do in org-mode. Attach a snapshot, embed a video file<p>* Code with documentation is a feature not available in most other note taking methods&#x2F;apps. It&#x27;s possible to run code snippets and add comments, documentation about them in the same space<p>* Latex support is advanced. Inline equations work seamlessly<p>* Search support is advanced<p>Drawbacks:<p>* One of the main drawbacks is that all your notes end up offline. This was a deal-breaker for me. ox-hugo helps in publishing your notes to a (private) static site where it can be searched, viewed but not edited on the fly<p>* Publishing through ox-hugo is separate from maintaining a backup&#x2F;sync of your notes in &#x2F;org&#x2F; format. You&#x27;ll have to do this separately through Dropbox&#x2F;GDrive&#x2F;etc<p>* A backup of your org notes is not usable until you set up your emacs environment and download all your notes')
