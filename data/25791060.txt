Every day there&#x27;s someone who played some game, and has some ideas how to make it better. All he needs is a few programmers and artists to make his vision in reality. Usually the kind of projects he wants to make are big AAA games in whatever is the trending genre at the moment (used to be MMORPG, now it&#x27;s about battle royale). When confronted they often get defensive and don&#x27;t want to accept the reality that such big projects are made by hundreds of people with multimillion budgets, not by few guys working in a basement, no matter how dedicated they are).')
