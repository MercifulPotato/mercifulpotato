Item(by='1996', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607903604, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25411360, text='&gt; &gt; so what&#x27;s going to stop someone coming along and saying &quot;Hey, $X a share, I&#x27;ll liquidate the BTC and hand it back to investors&quot; when BTC has it&#x27;s next dip?<p>&gt; Maybe the fact that he has 72% of the voting rights and can basically do whatever he wants.<p>And even if he didn&#x27;t, this move is the perfect poison pill to prevent an hostile takeover: with the company massively leveraged on BTC, who&#x27;ll be foolish enough to follow someone who&#x27;s basically suggesting to realize the loss on the books? And while hoping this very action doesn&#x27;t tank the company? It&#x27;s an heroic assumption when debts remains to be serviced (ie, clear liquidity issues, that could crash stock price)<p>It could go to the point that not even whatever assets may remain would be enough to distribute anything at all to creditors! (ie, bankrupcy)<p>That IMHO is more concerning to any investor that trading at a discount vs the assets.<p>1980s style corporate raiding is 40 years old, so by now you must expect owner&#x2F;founders to know a thing or two about poison pills!<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s indeed a bold move, but the assets generate cash flow, and with 72% ownership, it strikes me as the RIGHT move IF the owner want to keep some liquidity handy for whatever project, without falling pray to inflation.<p>With 72% he can already can do what the hell he wants. He could distribute this as profit to himself but as a billionaire, does he really needs that cash RIGHT NOW? While we&#x27;re expecting up to 40% inflation when the velocity of money rises back?<p>It&#x27;s simpler to just keep the company coffer filled until a good use comes by - if only because there will be no need to bother with the TLAs like the SEC to issue bonds, and also because while parked, all that remains shielded from most taxes.<p>As a billionaire, it&#x27;s just his form of edging, while also having a lifestyle business.')
