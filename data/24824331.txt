Yes, you generally can&#x27;t fix it, but that&#x27;s because you bought the cheap particle stuff instead of their higher end thing.<p>There are some things that will fall apart (wardrobes, kitchens etc), having participated in a few moves: I assure you that non-ikea stuff from the &#x27;70s will also have issues: panels will have bent, cheap parts will crumble, adjustments that were made to fit it to the original position won&#x27;t work anymore etc.<p>That is, even if you wanted, because the style of a 30 year old wardrobe is likely to not fit anything you will buy in this decade and you&#x27;ll still not want it around.<p>The idea of furniture that lasts a lifetime is dead because of the pace of modern fashion changes, not because you can&#x27;t reuse things, the same way it is for shoes and clothes.')
