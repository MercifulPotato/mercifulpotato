A young scientist might think an elderly aboriginal person foolish because the elder has never heard of a &quot;star&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the elder hasn&#x27;t seen the sun rise every day of their life.<p>My point is that we should not be discounting opinions because someone used the wrong word. We&#x27;re smart enough to read between the lines and see the crux of what is bothering someone. Free speech, as an ideal, doesn&#x27;t have to refer to any law, but to avoid spiraling into pedantry, I would suggest that we all be more descriptive during the course of these conversations.')
