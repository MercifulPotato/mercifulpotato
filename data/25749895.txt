Also, 10g base t tranceivers when used long term can actually damage sfp+ switches and cost wise they make absolutely zero sense.<p>To be frank, in the long run if you plan to make any changes to your setup, buying transceivers from FS.com and fiber cables (even armored fiber) for that matter is about the same price as copper direct attach cables.  Also much easier to cable manage and they can be used with cable lengths from 0.2m to 400m in most cases.<p>I currently use a Cisco Nexus 3064 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;219487215" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;219487215</a><p>It&#x27;s kind of loud but I keep my hardware in a closet and to be honest, enterprise hardware like this makes heat and needs fans for a good reason haha.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a more consumer entry and don&#x27;t care about L3 routing Ubiquiti actually makes one hell of a damn good sfp+ &quot;switch&quot; for the money -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ui.com&#x2F;unifi-switching&#x2F;unifi-switch-16-xg&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ui.com&#x2F;unifi-switching&#x2F;unifi-switch-16-xg&#x2F;</a> and again - cannot recommend FS.com enough for their service and quality products.  Even if it was a little weird that their sales rep immediately added me on LinkedIn?')
