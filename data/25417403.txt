But if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m forced to do at work, 3-4 hours is the most I can do in a single stretch. If I can take a ~1 hour break after that and go to the gym or something, I can do another 3-4 hours. That&#x27;s why WFH has been great for me; I can take a break as needed, and don&#x27;t get bored to tears after a few hours in a cubicle farm.')
