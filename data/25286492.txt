Don&#x27;t assume I&#x27;m ignorant. XD<p>In fact, I&#x27;m Catholic myself, but I don&#x27;t give a shit about what the Pope&#x2F;Church say about homosexuality, abortion, contraception, sex before marriage, etc. I&#x27;m all for women&#x27;s right for self-determination, and I think it would be quite arrogant to assume we <i>know</i> that heterosexual love is the only possible kind of true love according to God.<p>And of course, one shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that the US can have Christian organisations not opposed to IVF. I wrote that in jest.')
