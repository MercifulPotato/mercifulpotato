There&#x27;s plenty to learn about them before getting the job<p>&gt; Additionally, they probably won&#x27;t be effective at getting any legislation passed until they understand how to work with the system.<p>Again, &quot;the system&quot; hinges on authority of the other lawmakers. Lobbies and other non-democratic operators obviously exert a lot of power, but that takes the form of playing sides against each other. Term limits makes all of the legislator factinos played against each other weaker.<p>&gt; Another way to look at it, is how long would it take you to become effective if you switched careers tomorrow?<p>I don&#x27;t think being a politician is unskilled labor! But the skill lies in campaigning and bargaining, not voting. Unlike politician on politician vote struggles, politician on public campaigning <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> out. Maybe this results in voter apathy and therefore blander&#x2F;weaker bills but this is a complex <i>second order</i> effect.<p>I&#x27;m not even trying to defend term limits to you all here, just arguing that these arguments against them are as simplistic as the older arguments for them.<p>&gt; If we assume legislators only need a few weeks or months to get up to speed, then term limits of 6-8 years don&#x27;t matter. If we assume it takes a few years to become effective, then we&#x27;re hobbling our legislators for close to half the maximum time they can be on office.<p>I&#x27;m perfectly willing to say they get more powerful and more skilled over the years. So the big first order effect of term limits is not on the <i>absolute</i> power of the legislature, but the <i>relative</i> power of new vs old politicians.')
