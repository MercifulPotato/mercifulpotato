One benefit from that work was that it helped me grow as a teacher and later as a curriculum designer. But that wasn&#x27;t the whole thing. I made friends from that blog.<p>I also got emails from teachers living all over the world, asking questions and thanking me for the topic. Cambridge University Press contacted me and purchased rights to some of my writing and distributed it far further than I ever could have.<p>Given the assumption that the content really was useful, more people seeing it meant better educational outcomes for many, many young students that I&#x27;ll never meet.<p>The reach of media is a multiplier for its impact.')
