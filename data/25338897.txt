So, they hedge their bets by taking a piece of all of them.<p>The solution will come out of 1 of the following:<p>1. A slow race to making a more and more robust vision system that is eventually good enough to get through regulation. In this case, the earliest to start and one with the most data will win. So, either Waymo or Tesla. By the time others get there, they will have captured the market and made billions.<p>2. Some smaller company has an &#x27;a-ha&#x27; moment. Waiting for an a-ha moment doesn&#x27;t sound like the most prudent investment decision, but the one that finds it will become a billionaire overnight. This change is so important (like Mapreduce) that it will quickly be reverse engineered and one of Google&#x2F;Uber&#x2F;etc. will release a self driving hardware kit + api or come pre-installed in cars like android auto. The solution transforms the vision field with a reach far beyond just cars.')
