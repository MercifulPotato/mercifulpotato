This is also not the best thread to be having it.<p>Since everyone else is just saying &quot;you don&#x27;t get it&quot; without explaining what &quot;it&quot; is, I will provide some brief avenues of exploration. Because they are brief, they will be coarse and imperfect, and aiming to give you directional assistance on the topic.<p>So with that massive preamble because I&#x27;m not seeking to argue, here you go:<p>* Pre-trained models already encode much of this bias and if you don&#x27;t use them you won&#x27;t get very far very fast<p>* Large available datasets also reflect these biases<p>* AI model performance is generally measured against this dataset, further entrenching the bias. If you&#x27;re better on Indian face generation it will give you barely any benefit on most scoring methods<p>* Saying &quot;the outcome is only biased because the data is biased&quot; misses the fact that the performance is on the biased data<p>There&#x27;s a little more to it but I believe that&#x27;s the meat of it. Anyway, not too keen on arguing this. Just sharing because it took me some work to figure out what they were talking about and I wish someone had explained it to me so doing so here.')
