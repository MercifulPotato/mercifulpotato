Declarative and template DSLs are OK for basic things but you quickly bump into their limitations when you want to do advanced configurations. At this point administrators should know how to code so being able to use a normal programming language with IaC modules should be the standard.<p>Amazon&#x27;s CDK for AWS is a step in the right direction. Microsoft&#x27;s new Bicep for Azure misses the mark in my view because it is yet another DSL and not a real programming language.')
