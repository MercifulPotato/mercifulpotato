I own them all, and even assisted the authors at a conference where we invited all those fractal heros then. Benoit&#x27;s book is the very best of these.<p>It inspired me to produce lots of AutoLisp for the algorithmic simplicity of city planning or  architecture. Simple recursive rewriting systems. The problem starts when you need to detect 2d or 3d patterns, and expand them within the steps. This example showed that you only need 1d to create 3d and more. Simply expand the dimensions at the end.')
