Item(by='adamsea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608443556, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25481762, text='&gt; just that math stuff has a certain cavernous quality that is more common in that area than most ...<p>Hahahaha you clearly don’t know how much you don’t know about art, music, philosophy, ummm <i>psychology</i>.<p>Sorry to be a bit mean but come on man .... :).<p>I’m not denying that math isn’t special in certain ways. It is.<p>And you could even make arguments about the mathematical nature of music.<p>But man, to be a serious classical musician or serious jazz musician you have to study and practice <i>your entire life</i> since childhood. Just to have a running.<p>You wanna get good? Achieve mastery and knowledge? Compose work in dialogue with the great work of the past? Would take you years just to get started.<p>Or Picasso. His father? A painter. He was literally born into it.<p>I encourage you to read some good biographies of some artists.<p>Or even a biography on say, Winston Churchill. Or Lincoln. True political &#x2F; leadership skill takes a lifetime of study and acquiring experience.<p>To pick more examples of obviously challenging and cavernous non-math stuff, have you read any Thomas Pynchon, Don deLilo, or David Foster Wallace? Or James Joyce or Samuel Beckett?<p>Or Homer, for gods sakes. Or the Bible, the Koran, the Old Testament, the Tao Te Ching?<p>Allow for <i>creative</i>, rational thought which is <i>less precise</i> but <i>more complex</i> than pure logic or math (ie allow for human fucking language), and you get what is maybe the deepest cavern there is.<p>You underestimate both the time and effort needed to gain a real understanding of literature and art, and, to create it on a high level. And all the fields of human experience which we are unable to completely describe our understanding of via mathematics.<p>As someone else said, math is hard because it is easy. Humanities are easy because they are hard.')
