Man, that 6GHz band looks might tempting for us to use.. I wish we could have that be part of our service.. rather than people switching to wifi, they should just keep using their wireless network all the time at home &#x2F; on the go etc..<p>5. we will &quot;manage&quot; that spectrum better than a bunch of cowboy&#x27;s with their random 6GHz routers they buy on aliexpress<p>While all of that may be true, the important thing here is that many people have limited options (both price wise and option&#x27;s wise) for cellular providers, and similarly for fiber or cable internet. So selling the spectrum to the cellular carriers is basically saying that is who gets to use it, and people are even more dependent upon cellular data because existing 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands don&#x27;t work well enough for people. The end goal world for cellular carriers is that you use them all day everyday. I think most people would judge that having 6GHz be an open band that people can use in multiple ways is pro-consumer. But I personally would say, if the carriers want to use a small portion of that for the same goal where they &quot;manage&quot; it, then why not give them some too and we can see who manages it better. But the idea that the cellular carriers end up getting all of it seems like a disaster for consumers. That is a ton of spectrum, and cellular guys would happily charge you tons of money for it vs. you just buying a router and hooking up to a cheap fiber connection.')
