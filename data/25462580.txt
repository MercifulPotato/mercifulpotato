First there are often multiple sellers for one item on Amazon, to have reviews reflect the shipment or seller experience would kind of invalidate the feedback about the item. To ask Amazon to revamp their entire feedback system is quite an ask and clearly not what first comes to mind from reading the title of this post.<p>Secondly if some users are being encouraged to leave a positive review for money that&#x27;s a morally offensive act by them as well, which no one here seems to be pointing out so far. It&#x27;s not too dissimilar to lying about something and then asserting that someone pays others when they lie and it&#x27;s really their fault. Lying is bad in itself.')
