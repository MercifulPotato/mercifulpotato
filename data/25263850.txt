I think most users than expected paid for the 16GB models, leaving extra inventory of the 8GB modules.  During black Friday&#x2F;Cyber monday I saw several discounts on 8GB M1 systems, but none on the 16GB systems.<p>Hopefully that sends a message to apple to build systems with more memory.  Seems insane to invest in a expensive M1 system (once you add storage, 3 year warranty, etc) and get only 8GB.  Even it works well today, with a useful life of 3-6 years seems likely the extra 8GB will have significant value over the life of the system... even if it&#x27;s just to reduce wear on the storage system.')
