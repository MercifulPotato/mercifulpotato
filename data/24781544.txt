With the recent dropping of external pressure to get up as early or go to bed as late, it&#x27;s not terribly surprising that some people would gravitate towards that; Kids even more so -- their sleep patterns are not quite as well established.<p>It&#x27;s pretty likely they&#x27;re not actually sleeping all those 13 hours.
