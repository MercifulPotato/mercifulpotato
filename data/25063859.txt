It&#x27;s all very very slow. I use Notion very heavily at work, and until March of this year personally. In early 2020 I switched to Roam and I can&#x27;t go back now. Roam is so amazingly fast it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re cheating or something. I wish every app would adopt the way Roam does it. Load everything up front.<p>But, everything is slow these days. Aside from Roam, HN and maybe a handful of native iOS apps, I can&#x27;t really name any app&#x2F;site that I use on daily basis that isn&#x27;t painfully slow.')
