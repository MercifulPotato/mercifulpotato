I think it&#x27;s partly people realizing the difference between MIT&#x2F;BSD and GPL (or even AGPL) licenses. Or the diff between some ideal &quot;how open source works&quot; and what the licenses actually say.<p>This is a good thing. People may realise that the choice of license actually matters.')
