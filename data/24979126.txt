Women&#x27;s mental performance does not drop significantly before, during, or after pregnancy, at least not because of the pregnancy itself.<p>You keep linking me to pop-sci summaries of Hoekzema&#x27;s study to try to support your claim. Please go read Hoekzema&#x27;s paper instead and read it beyond the abstract.<p>Your assumptions about the academic potential of mothers are not only NOT supported by the data, they are also exactly the kind of attitudes that for centuries have forced women to attribute their accomplishments to men in order to be taken seriously.<p>My point is, there&#x27;s a reason that what you are claiming is unpopular, and it&#x27;s not because of some liberal agenda to silence you. It&#x27;s because the facts do not support your claims.')
