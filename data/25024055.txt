These are the exact issues at stake in elections: whether religious protections extend to denying abortion care, whether one polling place per county overwhelmingly favors rural whites, whether racial sensitivity training is itself racist and should therefore be banned from government contracting. These are from the last <i>month</i>. So it&#x27;s fair to assume, with one side for and one side against, that while these issues might resolve themselves they might not to your satisfaction.')
