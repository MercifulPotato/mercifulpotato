It never occurred to me, for instance, to go to gpm.comâ€” likewise, almost nobody made the connection on the site.<p>There was one time that somebody was asking about a gpa calculator or something so I threw one together on my web page.  I don&#x27;t <i>recall</i> telling them that it was available because the conversation would have been over.  I made my calculator so that you could triage your studying- so given some guesses about how much you thought you could increase your grades in your classes, it would tell you where to spend your time.  I can&#x27;t recall if I was banned around this or not, but that was as close as I came to being &quot;spammy.&quot;<p>As I said in the sibling comment, I thought I at least deserved a conversation.')
