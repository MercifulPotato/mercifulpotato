Journalist John Simpson, in a book on journalism, suggested that Rothermere was referring to the violence against Jews and Communists rather than the detention of political prisoners.[47][page needed]<p>&gt; Rothermere and the Mail were also editorially sympathetic to Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists.[48] Rothermere wrote an article titled &quot;Hurrah for the Blackshirts&quot; published in the Daily Mail on 15 January 1934, praising Mosley for his &quot;sound, commonsense, Conservative doctrine&quot;,[49] and pointing out that: &quot;Young men may join the British Union of Fascists by writing to the Headquarters, King&#x27;s Road, Chelsea, London, S.W.&quot;[50]')
