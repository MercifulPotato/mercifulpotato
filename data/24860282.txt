Mine was, to my knowledge, the first web-based graphing calculator that you could click and drag the graph around with the mouse, and zoom with the scroll wheel.<p>- There are lots of new features in web browsers that could make it faster, snappier, and also support 3D graphing, which was a popular feature request<p>- I could base it off React and also release both mobile apps as well as a webapp, since people today seem to prefer native apps to webapps<p>- It looks outdated compared to modern graphing apps available for iOS and Android<p>That said, no motivation to do the above unless I had a guaranteed payout. Making graphing calculators isn&#x27;t what I want to be spending my time on now considering the site is &lt;1% of my income now. Back when I was a grad student, back when it had a lot more users, it was &gt;30% of my total income. If someone gave me 30% of my income now to modernize its UI, I&#x27;d do it.')
