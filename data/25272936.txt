If you make a wish list, try to optimize the list for the gift giver. My brother loves to find the best whatever-it-is for you, so just giving a category optimizes for his gift giving experience. One thing on my list last year was &quot;dice storage&quot;, and he got me a really fun dice bag. He got to surprise me, and I got something wanted and actually still use.<p>My sister is a pleaser, and just wants you to get what you want, so I include links to specific things for her. If she is ever unsure what to get, she can just go straight to one of the linked Amazon pages and just click buy. My list is long enough that even if it&#x27;s exactly what I asked for, I&#x27;m still surprised by what she decided to get for me.')
