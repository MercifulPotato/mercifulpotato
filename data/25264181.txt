Also obviously the dependency on Emacs for a decent editing experience of these files didn&#x27;t help either, even though I always thought for Clojure this was less of an issue (at least back then). With more popular IDEs available by now, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;d be even harder to convince people to contribute in that style...<p>The only practical advice re: community building I can provide is trying to be there for new users, providing answers&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;examples&#x2F;infrastructure, a space to exchange ideas (i.e. our Discord). That&#x27;s especially important if other things like extensive documentation&#x2F;tutorials are still missing. Doing this isn&#x27;t always easy and there&#x27;re periods when I&#x27;ll have to disconnect, but I&#x27;m super grateful that we now are starting to have more people helping out on that front, even though the community is still rather small...<p>Thanks for the notespace link, will it check out asap...')
