Item(by='aborsy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604824004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25022845, text='RSA itself is secure, if your primes are large and random. You should use a decent library like OpenSSH etc.<p>Transition from RSA to ECC has an issue: unlike RSA where you increase the security by keeping the same algorithm but increasing the key length, in ECC there are a zoo of curves. You have heard that parameters in 25519 are secure, but then later you upgrade to another curve with dubious parameters. Each of these curves needs its own cryptanalysis. Now you have to deal with a lot of fragmented algorithms and complexity.<p>Also I kind of believe the difficulty of the factorization problem that has not been solved 2500 years more than the difficulty of the discrete log problem.<p>Most algorithms have limitations. Mentioning the limitations of one algorithm to promote another is not a proper comparison. What if the users pick up one of those NIST curves?')
