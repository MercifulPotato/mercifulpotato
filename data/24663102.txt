Buy financial assets.<p>So in times of stress they buy those assets&#x2F;liabilities, pushing up their prices first through decreasing long term rates (hence buying government bonds) and then with QE infinity, eventually buying the actual same asset&#x2F;liabilities that make up the rich people&#x27;s portfolios.<p>Hence we response to a drastic income shock by...bailing out rich people.<p>Ideally the Fed would just monetize government spending directly to those poor people, but as you can see with Pelosi-McConnell 2020, that stuff needs to go through Congress, which is a partisan mess.')
