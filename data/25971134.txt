Not be able to utilize TCP offload engines is another big disadvante of QUIC - but to be fair, I think we will see QUIC offload engines develop over time just as they did with TCP. Maybe those Intel&#x2F;Altera or AMD&#x2F;Xilinx deals will pay of for datacenter, for exactly those reasons (quick adaption of emerging network protocols by programming offload engines to FPGAs).')
