So says my baker mom, and so says the internet.</i><p>Where baking is done can override volumetric measuring, even with sound, consistent technique. I&#x27;m a professional bread baker working at altitude in a low humidity environment. One cup of flour for me will weigh less than a cup for someone in a high humidity area. Parents and grandparents passing down volumetric recipes in the past were unlikely to experience inconsistent baking&#x2F;cooking outcomes because back in the day succeeding generations were apt to remain in the same geographic area.')
