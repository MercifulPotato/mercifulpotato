Drag&#x2F;drop to move around, but I have to click to open a dialog to mark it as done... There should be a way to drag it to a &#x27;done&#x27; bucket. The list is broken into the four quadrants, but I cannot drag&#x2F;drop in the list to set a specific priority, which would be critical when a tasks is dependent on another. In general, algorithmically prioritizing the list based on position within a quadrant is questionable - matrices like this communicate broader strokes of prioritization, not a opinionated list order.<p>Still, the idea has merit. It just needs some work to move forward.')
