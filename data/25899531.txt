In fact, I&#x27;m against it, and was against it even when the pandemic was raging last year. I agree with you that children have been silent victims of schoolteachers&#x27; refusal to do in-person school. I do, however, strongly support reasonable precautions including masking and physical distancing, which can be achieved with children (not very young children, but certainly 2nd grade and up) with continual reinforcement until it becomes a habit.')
