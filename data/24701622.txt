Item(by='munk-a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602013698, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24700301, text='I hadn&#x27;t seen the index - that&#x27;s neat.<p>In terms of the documentation quality I do agree that it&#x27;s documented but not obviously, you mentioned that it&#x27;s in the &quot;SQL Functions Returning Sets&quot; section however this section isn&#x27;t indicated to by the Array functions and operators page - additionally while, if you know that you&#x27;re dealing with an issue related to SRFs it&#x27;s pretty easy to find - attempting to get at that information via google isn&#x27;t going to get you anything unless you specifically hone in on set returning functions.  I ended up finding that doc page after finding a SO answer that mentioned SRFs while searching for &quot;postgres unnest cartesian product&quot;.<p>The information is in the documentation, but the documentation isn&#x27;t always super good at linking to other relevant portions of the documentation and, honestly, reading the documentation about the feature you need is reasonable, but I don&#x27;t expect most people are reading the full postgres docs before starting to play around with it.  So I don&#x27;t disagree that the information is there, but I do think it is mostly inaccessible due to the structure of the documentation.')
