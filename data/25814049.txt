Item(by='sdenton4', descendants=None, kids=[25815676], score=None, time=1610911979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813528, text='Interesting collection of stats, though I don&#x27;t think the author&#x27;s conclusions are the only possible interpretation. It&#x27;s clear that the family size intentions really have been falling since the 60s, and that actual fertility is a fraction of that, which is unsurprising. The bigger sorry here, I think, is that the intended family size drops from 3.4 kids to 2.0. Possibly what&#x27;s happening is that &#x27;high producers&#x27; now make four kids instead of ten, bringing down the overall averages. Basically, it would be nice to see how the distributions of kids per woman change over the decades... I expect something at least bimodal, with a shrinking tail.<p>(Ed: fixed a couple stats, removed a bad statement about quotients. :P )')
