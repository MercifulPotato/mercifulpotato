Most of it is devoted to saying that energy should be cheaper and that we should use more of it.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine that the higher specific energy consumption and correspondingly higher fuel cost of flying cars is not a problem. For example, American households in the top income decile could quadruple their consumption of gasoline and it wouldn&#x27;t be a financial hardship.<p>So why don&#x27;t high income Americans have flying cars? Why are $100k+ cars from luxury brands still stubbornly earthbound?<p><i>Hall quotes a post on a message board suggesting that even if you had built a flying car and were ready to take to the air, youâ€™d be shot down by the FAA, the mayor, the news media, the insurance company, and your neighbors.</i><p>I can easily imagine some objections from the FAA, insurance company, and neighbors. There&#x27;s nary a word here attempting to rebut them. Nor to explain how cheaper energy would solve any of these problems.<p>It&#x27;s nice to imagine that cheap energy would enable the dreams of science fiction authors circa 1970. In a few cases it would even be true. But probably not in most cases. There are already a few petro-states that have very cheap energy for all citizens. They don&#x27;t have flying cars either.')
