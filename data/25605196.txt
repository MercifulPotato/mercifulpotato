So that severely limits the ecosystem. While you can always go back in the archive and get a bare kernel, I wanted a full system with init, package management, etc.<p>The card is (unsurprisingly) an ISA slot, an Intel EtherExpress 16. I forget exactly where I was with it when last I poked at this earlier this year, but the promising thing is I have it worked in MS-DOS 6.22 without issue. There are some utilities from Intel that I found that write EEPROM on the card to setup its IRQ and all of that, which is how I got it working in DOS.<p>Perhaps I’ll take another swing at it and document more precisely what the issues are and what I’ve tried so far. I wrote up the acquisition, repair, and resuscitation of the machine on a series of posts on my blog under “Project 386” beginning with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justinmiller.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;26&#x2F;project-386-part-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justinmiller.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;26&#x2F;project-386-part-1&#x2F;</a> so I have intentions of adding some more posts.')
