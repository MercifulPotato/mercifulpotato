This doesn&#x27;t seem that exceptional to me. It&#x27;s not like tons and tons of people are buying that high end monitor. I&#x27;m also not sure what 4k 120hz tv you&#x27;re referring to. Do they exist? Hdmi 2.1 isn&#x27;t even done yet is it? How do you get a 4k 120hz signal into such a device? And how am I meant to fit it in my 3ft deep desk?<p>Fwiw I have a 4k 144 monitor that I got for $800-900. I believe I first heard about it on this site actually. 4k is important to me for text and 120hz is important to me for gaming. It&#x27;s nice to have both, and gsync compatibility, all in one device. Well worth a small splurge.')
