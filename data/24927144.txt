I&#x27;d wager that the &quot;self esteem&quot; movement, or more accurately, whatever caused it to gain traction in the American psyche, kicked off the downward spiral to where-we-are-now.<p>In a nutshell, several generations of American children were taught, systematically, to ignore social signals that conflicted with their self-image, and were thus deprived of a very critical part of their childhood: in where they learn to moderate their behavior in order to get along with other people.<p>Self-esteem education was based on the (correct!) observation that people with high self-esteem are healthier and more successful.<p>Given my extensive experience with educators, I am not in any way surprised that the conclusion they reached was that high self-esteem must cause health and success, rather than health and success resulting in high self-esteem. Educators seem to have this anti-Newtonian view on the world, in which reactions cause actions. But I digress.<p>I was subjected to this as a child, and it took something on the order of a decade of living abroad -- mostly in Japan, a country which, lacking any concept of &quot;self&quot;, offers no affordance for &quot;self-esteem&quot; -- to fully realize the sheer horror of what I had been steeped in as a child.<p>As to why this has come to a head since the advent of social media, well, we&#x27;re at the point where an entire generation which socializes primarily through virtual means has come of age.<p>When your social interactions are driven by proximity -- e.g., you are limited to people that physically exist near you -- then you are forced to learn some degree of moderation. Because if you can&#x27;t get along with others, you find yourself rather in deficit of friends.<p>But now, it doesn&#x27;t matter how crazy you are. If you worship Mao or Hitler or Stalin or whatever, there is a community for people like you.<p>No amount of ostracism will remedy this. That worked when your ability to make friendships had real, physical constraints. In the fully-connected schizophrenic hivemind world of 2020, casting people out of your tribe will, at best, only deprive them of a moderating influence.<p>Still not sure where this goes, but I am fairly certain it&#x27;s got at least thirty-one flavors of ugly.')
