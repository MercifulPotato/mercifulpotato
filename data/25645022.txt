At least what I was talking about. Talk to me while I&#x27;m trying to get into the code, is like trying to talk to someone trying to write a book or balance a checkbook or really concentrate on anything at all. Re-casting it as simple cooperation is disengenuous. Sure you want to explain things to a teammate; that&#x27;s entirely missing the point.<p>If I&#x27;m talking, if I&#x27;m listening to you, then I&#x27;m not coding. They are orthogonal activities, at least for me. Want me to &#x27;talk you through&#x27; my design thoughts? Thanks for your time, goodbye.')
