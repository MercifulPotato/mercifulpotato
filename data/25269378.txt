I&#x27;ve never been even near SV (although I am a tech worker, so perhaps in some kind of a bubble), and I can see how there could be rational reasons for implementing automatic reboots. Some people might put of rebooting indefinitely, for instance, and not all of those would be doing it because they know what they&#x27;re doing. If you&#x27;re MS, you have to take into account a lot more than just users who know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>I don&#x27;t like the automatic reboots, and I&#x27;d agree it&#x27;s not a good solution and I probably wouldn&#x27;t have implemented it if I were making the decision, but I don&#x27;t really see how finding reasons for why MS might reasonably want to do it is a SV bubble thing.')
