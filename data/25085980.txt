All these stay at home &quot;orders&quot; and mask &quot;mandates&quot; and they didn&#x27;t mean squat and had little effect because almost nobody was fined or went to jail for violating them.<p>It&#x27;s the easiest thing to enforce, too. In my city alone, a single police officer with two functioning eyes could probably issue hundreds of mask violations a day. It&#x27;s not like you have to search someone or go out of your way to see they aren&#x27;t wearing a mask.')
