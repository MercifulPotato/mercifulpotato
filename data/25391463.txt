In this way, the tax system incentives vertical integration.<p>In the VAT regime, the final price and total tax paid is the same whether or not the business is vertically integrated, and so the tax system doesn’t incentivise one option over the other.<p>The key point is that we first compare two competing business structures under the same tax system, and it turns out the tax rate doesn’t affect the argument so long as it’s positive, and then we compare how those structures relate to each other in different tax systems (where the rates don’t matter because they don’t change the relationship between the structures that both live under the same rate)')
