The binary log is more corruption prone and such corruption has been observed in the wild. It&#x27;s in the wrong direction. Logs should be simple text files and if complex enough queries are warranted then there should be a copy in a competent database. There is no need to implement a database, we have enough of them.<p>2. No software is bug free but now one huge piece of software is such that bugs in it crash the entire system. Only the kernel should be so.<p>3. Speaking of code base size, the more code you run as pid1 the more security holes you have.<p>4. Throwing out decades of knowledge and replacing it shouldn&#x27;t be taken lightly and should be accompanied by world class documentation. No such thing.<p>5. Abusing dbus for IPC is not the best of technical decisions, no wonder they wanted kdbus which of course went nowhere.<p>6. Speaking of, a lot of things went somewhere because Poettering is basically a bully. kdbus went nowhere because bullying Torvalds is impossible. But really, these sorts of questions shouldn&#x27;t be decided on who is more insufferable. These guys wouldn&#x27;t survive contact with a code of conduct and that&#x27;s not a good thing.
