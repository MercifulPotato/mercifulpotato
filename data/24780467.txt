They brought in European designers so the aesthetic is much improved (though I don&#x27;t care for their 2016-2020 grille shapes).<p>They&#x27;ve always struggled with resale value due to early reputational issues, but I&#x27;d say the build quality is now very close to the top 3 Japanese manufacturers. The 10-year powertrain warranty was a low-cost move to regain the market&#x27;s trust -- I doubt very many people cash-in on it (the engineering is excellent nowadays)<p>When I was looking at cars some time ago, an accessories fully-loaded Hyundai was about the same price as a bare-bones Honda or Toyota. The discount rate may have leveled off these days.')
