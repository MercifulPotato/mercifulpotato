However, I do see the Iraq WMD intelligence failure&#x2F;lie (depending on what one believes) cited every single time the US government says anything ever, and while in one sense they certainly deserve that skepticism for decades to come, it also happens in cases that aren&#x27;t really paralleled.<p>During the Cuban missile crisis, US intelligence showed photographs to the world proving the existence of the missile launch pads. During the Mueller investigation, the FBI provided hundreds of pages of concrete evidence to support their claims, which was supported by all other agencies and all of private industry.<p>Prior to the Iraq war, US intelligence showed jack shit; they just told the public &quot;take our word for it: Saddam has WMDs&quot;.<p>If there were a future situation where there was an attempt to justify a country invasion or war, I absolutely would demand the highest possible rigor.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think that can really be compared to trying to extradite and prosecute some criminals accused of ransoming hospitals and other institutions. They&#x27;re not accusing any government of being behind these ransomware attacks and I doubt they will be. The only government believed to have ever done something like that is North Korea&#x27;s, but they&#x27;re kind of a special circumstance and are already technically and pragmatically at war with much of the world in many ways.<p>I think it&#x27;s not really fair to assume a priori that the US government is lying, or that they&#x27;re telling the truth, when they make some accusation. Things have to be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and the concrete evidence they provide needs to be looked at impartially. If there&#x27;s no public evidence besides &quot;trust us&quot;, then I&#x27;d agree that doubt is the correct action.')
