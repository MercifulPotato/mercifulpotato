Sometimes a manufacturer will switch battery types but I&#x27;ve seen this more with real consumer grade products than prosumer&#x2F;pro ones. (Have a couple Black and Decker products I&#x27;ve had to throw out because batteries died and couldn&#x27;t get replacements even online.)<p>But it&#x27;s pretty much a given that anything like a cordless drill will have the batteries give out long before (and even multiple times) before you need to replace the tool itself. Batteries are consumables in any mis- to high-end product with a long lifetime, like it or not. (Same with cameras.)')
