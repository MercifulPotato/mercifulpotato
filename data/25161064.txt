There is no plausible way that there could be something bad: the vaccine breaks down in the way RNA does withing minutes of entering the body. If anything bad happens because of RNA breakdown: you wouldn&#x27;t have been born as RNA is basic to cell biology and breaks down as part of normal processes all the time.<p>The first mRNA vaccine went to phase 1 trials more than 10 years, which means we have a few people walking around who got a mRNA vaccine more than 10 years ago - if they got a side effect it wouldn&#x27;t be noted.  The sample size is of course too small, and it was a different vaccine, but there some long term safety data.<p>Anything is possible. My physics teachers like to point out that all the air in the room can teleport to the moon - but the odds of that are too low to worry about, even on the time frame of the universe.')
