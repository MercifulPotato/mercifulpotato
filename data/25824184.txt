I took a single calc course in HS (which I hardly remember) and have some very limited digital communications knowledge from watching a few videos. I know what I want to eventually build and have a nice SDR, but I don’t know how to use GNU radio. Most of the blocks I see outside some rather specific modulation ones seem to be primitive operations.')
