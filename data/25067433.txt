That behaviour is fine for when I&#x27;m effectively channel surfing, but when I have a specific experience in mind it&#x27;s garbage.<p>I don&#x27;t trust buying DRM-laden content from most retailers because of the stories of accounts being locked or purchases being removed.<p>And then there&#x27;s that I spend enough time traveling in poor-cellular regions...<p>I swear, DRM&#x27;d streaming just simply isn&#x27;t suitable for _cherished_ experiences.')
