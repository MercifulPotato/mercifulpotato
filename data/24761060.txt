For example, Deloitte built a resort hotel near Dallas and branded it &quot;Deloitte University&quot; for the purpose. I know PwC did yearly training in Orlando for new consulting hires that are hired from college campuses. I believe Accenture does something similar in Chicago at the &quot;Q Center&quot; (though only for ~1 month).')
