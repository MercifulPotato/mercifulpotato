I&#x27;m assuming these old newspapers used either their own printing presses, or presses owned by independent printing shops. They used a little common sense and concluded that using printing presses owned by the NY Times was probably not a good long term strategy for a newspaper that wanted to compete against the NY Times.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is, use your own printing presses, and you can&#x27;t be shutdown. Run your own website, on your own server and no one will kick you off their servers. Nothing&#x27;s really changed here, so I don&#x27;t see a free speech issue.')
