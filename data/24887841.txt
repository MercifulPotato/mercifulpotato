So, the various anomalies in the dataset are somewhat interesting, but having weird outliers in the margins is an entirely expected effect. Just because there are not many datapoints. So when you filter for something marginal like Trump winning New Jersey, then the statistical error increases and therefore it is entirely unsurprising that something weird happens. Thankfully, these systems are designed to work with probabilities, and these outliers are weighted down.<p>Additionally, getting worked up about a 3% chance of Biden winning Alabama. I mean, what does a 3% chance even mean for a one off event, compared to a 5% chance or a .3% chance? I know fully well, that it means I should bet $100 if I can get more than $3000 payout, but the trouble is that is only if we bet often enough. (Perhaps often enough on different things.) For a one off thing, the important part is, it is with a very high degree of certainty a loss of $100. So any claims that Bidens chances of winning are too high should be regarded with high suspicion.<p>Also, I listened eralier to Nate Silver&#x27;s <i>model talk</i> [0], where he discusses quite a few problems with low quality polls in some states.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;politics-podcast-national-and-district-level-polls-disagree-about-how-close-the-2020-election-is&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;politics-podcast-nation...</a>')
