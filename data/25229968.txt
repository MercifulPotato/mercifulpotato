Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=[25230011], score=None, time=1606494299, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229754, text='A remark from a web developer on the implementation of this site:<p>On my laptop, scrolling by touch, when I reach the image immediately above the colours section, I can’t easily go any further, because the carousel thingy that takes up most of the screen has schnaffled touch actions, and is only translating them into horizontal scrolling of that component, even if my finger is moving perfectly vertically. This is a bad implementation, because it’s reimplementing something the browser already offers, badly. This is a form of scrolljacking, which is <i>always</i> bad on content sites (I have encountered no exceptions; in apps, there are a very small list of justifiable cases, e.g. maps to turn it into zooming, though it still won’t work perfectly no matter what you do, because the web just doesn’t expose the right primitives). What it should do instead is to make the carousel thing just a normal scrollable container (though still visually hiding the scrollbar), and leave the whole scrolling thing to the browser, with the assistance of CSS snap points if available, or some gentle touchend and similar watching to simulate its effect if it’s not.<p>(Also, clicking on the names of the colours below the carousel is badly broken, doing nothing half the time, and taking you to the wrong slide half of the rest of the time, to say nothing of them having an overly small hit target—the whole row of “Blanc &#x2F; matte finish; black\ndecals” should be the hit target.)')
