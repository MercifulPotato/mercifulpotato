There are many different distributions and combinations of software you can have on any of them. You get what you choose.<p>There are like 7+ different file managers that you can install and use. One of them probably has compress to zip. Some of them are much more powerful than finder in OS X. I use `mc` and I don&#x27;t even need to click. I just select a folder &lt;F2&gt; &lt;Enter&gt;, and the folder is compressed. Two pane file managers are great. I love them ever since MS-DOS times.<p>The fact that I can use bitmap fonts is the major benefit of Linux to me, because I don&#x27;t use hidpi screens. I can have small fonts that don&#x27;t suck to look at, and are perfectly crisp. I like that I have that choice.<p>All of those automatic sync things are an anti-feature to me. I was given an iPhone for webdev testing, and was snapping an odd photo or two with it from time to time, including photos of my ID documents, without realizing that it by default uploaded everything into some stupid cloud. Great, now my state ID is with Apple.<p>A few times I had to use Mac OS for development had me running the other way since then. Why would I search online and download files to drag and drop them around to &quot;install&quot; them, and sometimes click through next next next finish dialogs, like on Windows, when I can just type a list of programs I want installed and they just get downloaded and installed for me with no fuss, and meanwhile I can do something more meaningful? I can install 10 different programs I need for some project in a single command, and it&#x27;s such a time saver.<p>To some people Mac features may be great, to some they suck horribly.')
