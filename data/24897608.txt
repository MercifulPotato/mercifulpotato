Sometimes to understand why things are done the way they are, you just have to build your own version of it. Windows sure has a bunch of interesting architectural properties.<p>Last time ReactOS came up here some folks were concerned about legality too, and I think there even was a salty Microsoft employee ranting about stolen code from the source leaks. I don&#x27;t think ReactOS will ever reach the point of being a viable Windows replacement, so nothing Microsoft needs to be afraid of. I can somewhat see how you&#x27;re personally offended that someone stole your code and doesn&#x27;t credit you (but then again that wouldn&#x27;t be exactly smart in that case). Best case for Microsoft is that ReactOS raises future Microsoft devs for free. Just check the progress every now and then, if someone stands out, hire them.')
