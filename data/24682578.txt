They had basically no public WiFi in the decade that it was booming in similar countries, allegedly because of crazy liability laws. I never dove into it but that&#x27;s what I was told when asking German techies. It should have changed a few years ago but by now mobile data is much more ubiquitous than it was in 2012 or so and while WiFi is an order of magnitude cheaper per gigabyte than mobile data, most people aren&#x27;t power users and don&#x27;t need more than checking their email and so it remains virtually nonexistent. You&#x27;re most likely to find it in foreign companies like McDonald&#x27;s, and of course hotels but that&#x27;s a different type of place. There are also &quot;public hotspots&quot; from Telekom built into old phone booths (yep Germany still has those) but that&#x27;s as expensive as mobile data.')
