It automatically rebars the music so you don&#x27;t have to think about it.<p>My own music-notation editor, Soundslice, doesn&#x27;t automatically rebar, but it has a &quot;we&#x27;re all consenting adults&quot; attitude about note durations <i>within</i> a bar, allowing you to add a lot of notes in a bar and worry about their durations later.')
