While we could replace them easily and it was RAID so there wasn&#x27;t any data loss, I personally would&#x27;ve got fed up of replacing HDDs every couple of months.<p>Also, most of my experience is with rented dedicated servers and they just give me a new one completely so I never really see if they&#x27;re fully scrapped.')
