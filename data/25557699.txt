History lessons are purposefully a mix of history and propaganda.<p>Every nation has a founding myth. Romania&#x27;s is the struggle against adversity, foreign empires and our resilience over millennia. The American one is freedom (the struggle against tyranny) and the American dream. The British one is resistance against adversity on their island, vanquishing European autocrats. Russia&#x27;s is liberation from the steppe nomads and then turning the tides in a rough part of the world.<p>They&#x27;re half lies, half truth in my experience. You know, myths :-)')
