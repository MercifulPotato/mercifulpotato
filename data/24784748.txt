Instant messaging worked great - and at the time, Maxis (where I worked) ran on AOL IM the way people use Slack now. Danger&#x27;s web browser actually worked through a proxy that chopped up pages and served them in a reduced format, which was effective in 2002 but was a liability by 2007. You could even edit your contacts online with full syncing!<p>The Hiptop was popular and &quot;quality of the integration&quot; was better than anything Apple had produced right up until the iPhone. However, by 2007 the data networks had gotten fast enough that the Hiptop&#x27;s web browser was feeling a bit antiquated, and navigating web pages with a scroll wheel was cumbersome. The capacitive touchscreen was a major leapfrog, and coming up with all the UI behaviors to leverage that was a major feat - Apple deserves a lot of credit! But maybe not quite as much credit as the OP suggests.')
