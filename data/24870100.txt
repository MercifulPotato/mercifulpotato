Item(by='sorenjan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603464854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24865820, text='&gt; I switched from Spotify to Youtube Music as a matter of principle after that drama.<p>That&#x27;s funny, since I did the opposite when Google forced me to switch from Google Music to Youtube Music. I have decided to avoid Google services when possible, since they invariably end up unsupported and later killed off and maybe replaced with a worse option.<p>I also want to stay away from services from companies that doesn&#x27;t have that service as their main focus. Google clearly doesn&#x27;t really care about music, but it&#x27;s pretty much all Spotify cares about. Apple isn&#x27;t really a music company, but unlike Google they care about a coherent user experience within their ecosystem. I won&#x27;t buy from Apple for different reasons, but compare Apple Watch and WatchOS, Apple TV and Youtube TV, Apple Music and Youtube Music, and so on. Picking a Google consumer service is almost always a guarantee for worse quality and an uncertain future.<p>For the same reasons I wouldn&#x27;t touch Google Stadia, there&#x27;s other companies with clearer gaming focus and better track record of keeping services available.')
