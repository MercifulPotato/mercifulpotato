If the set of vote totals is now in votes per square mile, then there would likely be a different upper fence. Might be worth the number crunching to figure out what that number is.<p>BTW just to double-check, I&#x27;m assuming that in this given fillOpacity formula, that a fillOpacity &gt; 1 just resolves to 1. So like fillOpacity : min(votesPerSquareMile&#x2F;upperFence, 1).')
