The article where the mother admits to going into fits of rage and punishes the 11 year old child for doing nothing that isn&#x27;t normally tolerated even in this already very strict household? The article where this mother of an 11 year old blames nothing but the phone for the fact that this girl entering into adolescence behaves differently than when she was a child?<p>No, this article was written by a narcissist who can&#x27;t handle her little girl growing up and rather than dealing with it in a healthy way is instead raging against an inanimate object.')
