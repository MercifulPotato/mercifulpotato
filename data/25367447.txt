When Facebook acquired WhatsApp didn&#x27;t it have to get government approval? For example here [1] is an article from Reuters.<p>It seems like &quot;corporate entrapment&quot; to approve a deal and then later sue the company for going through with the deal that you approved. For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m not fan of Facebook (I&#x27;m not employed, don&#x27;t directly own their stock, and in general do use Facebook products) but this seems kind of absurd to me.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-facebook-whatsapp&#x2F;facebook-says-whatsapp-deal-cleared-by-ftc-idUSBREA391VA20140410" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-facebook-whatsapp&#x2F;faceboo...</a>')
