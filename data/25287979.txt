For example, a can of cola has a plastic lining to protect the aluminium from degrading, tetrapak containers are laminates to prevent leakage, counter tops and flatpak furniture tends to be plastic-wrapped chipboard.<p>A lot of these laminates can be replaced, but some are rather harder to. Progressive taxation based on recyclability is an easy win which incentivizes correct packaging (and transport packaging as well) and would be an easier sell.\nAdditional, homogeneous packaging would be taxed less.<p>The branding that goes on the packaging is still open to design, so there&#x27;s room for differentiation there - a necessary component for adoption.<p>Lastly, standardizing recyclability across the state&#x2F;county&#x2F;country would be useful as then tourists etc. can also understand a simple recycling message.')
