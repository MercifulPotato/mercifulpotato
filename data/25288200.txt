It also doesn&#x27;t solve the rogue access point problem because with two devices you can capture a target on one part of the network, MitM it, and forward the traffic to a second device somewhere else on the network where you replicate the target&#x27;s MAC address.<p>Proper access control (enterprise WPA, deployed with valid certificates and correctly provisioned to company devices) would probably solve most issues when it comes to automatic credential stealing through WiFi access points. PNAC also works quite well in that context. The largest challenge in this area would be people using the guest network instead of the office network, but that can be worked around by requiring either access to the internal network or access through a VPN to get to any information that you&#x27;re afraid might leak.<p>Still, if you find a rogue access point, you would probably want to find out where it is so you can analyze and&#x2F;or remove it. One of these tools can be quite handy for that, assuming they&#x27;re cheap and available enough to have just lying around.')
