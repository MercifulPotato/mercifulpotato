Item(by='rstuart4133', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603194740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24829652, text='&gt; But don&#x27;t fool yourself: Crypto mixers are going to end up being subject to effectively the same reporting requirements that banks are.<p>I&#x27;m sort of amazed they didn&#x27;t outlaw mixers ages ago, however<p>&gt; What you want (perfect financial privacy) you can&#x27;t have, sorry. That ship sailed decades ago.<p>Perhaps that&#x27;s true in principle, just as it&#x27;s true to say obtaining (insert illicit drug of choice here) in perfect safety from the law enforcement agencies is not possible.  The USA can only shut down USA mixers.  The only way to deal with mixers operating outside of USA law is to prosecute the USA citizen sending his money to a mixer.  That is orders of magnitude harder because they can&#x27;t know if a newly minted bitcoin address is owned by a mixer, or belongs to a USA citizen.<p>It may not be perfect, but given one of bitcoin&#x27;s niche&#x27;s is a payment system for illegal activities that are already very much imperfect, the protection offers is undoubtedly good enough.')
