Pence later did when Trump didn&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s when things got under control.<p>This could&#x27;ve been prevented if the president (1) didn&#x27;t incite this and (2) didn&#x27;t deny national guard to step-in.<p>So what&#x27;s left is the capitol police facing a mob invited by the president, without backup. And they stated they had two choices, barricade the capitol and prevent entry, or evacuate the people inside.<p>It could&#x27;ve gotten ugly if the people in the capitol got overrun, e.g. Pelosi facing people that think they&#x27;re sent by Q to fight off a satanic coup by Pelosi, but they got evacuated to safety. Apparently capitol police chose to evacuate rather than to barricade, in hindsight that&#x27;s clearly the least risky option to human health. If they break through with nobody inside, that&#x27;s not as bad if they break through anyway with people inside. A bunch of idiots roaming the capitol building isn&#x27;t a threat per se, shameful and sad yes, but not one that should&#x27;ve been met with violent force from a small number of capitol police at the expense of (and risk of not) evacuating the people inside.')
