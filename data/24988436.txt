Scala has always suffered from complexity problems due to libraries. For example, using Http&#x2F;JSON&#x2F;Database libraries have always been a lot harder than they need to be due to a die hard approach to pure FP.<p>Scala 3 looks pretty good, but I just can NOT see myself using Scala again, after having worked with it for 4-5 years at work and on personal projects. I write mostly&#x2F;reasonably FP code without using Cats&#x2F;Category theory. I’ve recently moved all my code from Scala to Kotlin and I’m loving it, found the perfect balance with Kotlin.')
