This was not a randomized, controlled trial, but historical analyses of a natural experiment. In itself, that&#x27;s not a problem: we can learn a lot from natural experiments. But I don&#x27;t think this instance is much of an &quot;experiment.&quot;<p>As I understand it, all of the residents (96 in total) of a particular nursing home receive regular Vitamin D supplementation. Of the total residents, 66 got COVID-19. Among that group, they realized that 57 of them had received their Vitamin D supplementation either within a week of being diagnosed with COVID-19, or one month prior. That is the intervention group. The remaining 9 people are the &quot;comparator&quot; group. They found the intervention group had better survivability.<p>The main three reasons I consider this study weak evidence is that the number of people in the &quot;comparator&quot; group is very small (9!), and they - as far as I can tell - do not explain <i>why</i> these people did not receive their normal Vitamin D supplementation. The &quot;comparator&quot; group is supposed to have had a similar baseline, but there&#x27;s still, to me, a strong possibility of a confounding factor. Finally, there were four total interventions: corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, &quot;dedicated antibiotics&quot; and the observation about Vitamin D. The more things you try, the less surprising it should be that there is a correlation along one of them.')
