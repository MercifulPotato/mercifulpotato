As someone who lived outside of the UK, I have been watching BBC news, documentaries, series and films for over a decade online. The BBC is probably the most wholesome source of mainstream media that I can imagine.\nTo point to the BBC as an argument against nationalization makes a very weak case.<p>Very few media organizations have the kind of international reach as the BBC has. Frankly, that says something about its quality and wholesomeness.\nI&#x27;m not a US citizen but the only reason I ever watch Fox news and CNN is to get a sense of how bad things are going in the US. They&#x27;re more like reality shows than news.')
