RPN logic made complex calculations easier to perform without having to write down intermediate results and re-enter them into the calculator when needed. Friden continued the use of this stack-based method of calculating in its second generation of calculators (an example being the Friden 1162), but for some reason the principle was never patented by Friden.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oldcalculatormuseum.com&#x2F;friden130.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oldcalculatormuseum.com&#x2F;friden130.html</a>')
