If NASDAQ halts trading on an equity, they just prolong the agony of a bad short position. How would Citron have been helped by a delay? Its a loan, the longer its open, the more you pay! So a trading halt is actually counterproductive for short hedge funds, what they really need is the quickest exit possible')
