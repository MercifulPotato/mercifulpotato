It’s a pain to go figure out how to do it for certain accounts, especially if you’re mobile and there’s a decent chance you’ll just forget to do it later. I do not like leaving access tokens around in other people’s databases unless I have to. I understand this would require the service to provide such functionality to the application developer, which I’m sure isn’t always available..')
