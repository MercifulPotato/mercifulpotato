But I could suggest that if we can show that a lot of fundamental changes have come from external shock rather than internal processes, then we might be closer. Further, if the theory of &quot;puncture equilibrium&quot; is true[1], that this would tend to be the case. If we can show that many evolutionary steps involved such external shocks, then we might be closer to this also.<p>The question would be whether external shocks inevitably produce advances or whether such advances are indeed lucky.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Punctuated_equilibrium" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Punctuated_equilibrium</a>')
