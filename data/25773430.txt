Item(by='jabl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610610630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25771554, text='&gt; Remember that as far as the fab goes, performance is just what clock speeds can be hit, and Intel&#x27;s clocks are the highest - they have the fastest transistors. 14nm+++++ is a meme&#x2F;joke, but the actual transistor speed of it is still downright impressive.<p>My understanding is that Intel&#x27;s fast transistors come at a cost of not being particularly dense for the process node they are implemented on. So it&#x27;s a question of design philosophy as well. Intel has fast, but somewhat sparse transistors, they use a lot of hand layout etc. to really optimize their designs so they can clock high.<p>Other players use a different philosophy. Slower, but denser transistors and more automated layout may not clock as high, but the improved density gives you more cores (e.g. AMD vs Intel) and or allows a more &quot;brainiac&quot; core design (wider, deeper ROB, better branch prediction, more cache, etc. like Apple M1), and also gets you a better turnaround time.')
