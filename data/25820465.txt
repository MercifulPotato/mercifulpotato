Thanks for letting me know about Firefox not showing CSS. Seems like I have a SSL certificate issue.<p>Regarding pricing: It&#x27;s $5 dollar&#x2F;3 months for all three services and it gives you 10 accounts. So it&#x27;s actually <i>$2&#x2F;user&#x2F;year</i>. Mind you, this is a &quot;soft launch&quot; pricing (as you could see, plenty of work to be done there) and my idea is to grandfather in the first 100 signups. Once I iron out the most critical bugs, I am working with the idea of charging $1&#x2F;month ($10&#x2F;year) for single users and $6&#x2F;month ($60&#x2F;year) for the 10-user package.')
