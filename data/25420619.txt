It&#x27;s possible that Apple will still be able to scale up even wider, but that wouldn&#x27;t be a necessarily &quot;safe&quot; bet. There&#x27;s nothing obviously on the table for a big uptick in IPC. Apples got a great trajectory and great engineers, of course, but there&#x27;s nothing here where you can point to an existing thing and be like &quot;now as soon as they add that, too, wow!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s &quot;only&quot; running at a peak of around 3.2ghz, though, so there&#x27;s a lot of clear theoretical headroom on that front. But whether or not things like their cache or other subsystems can handle higher frequencies is unknown. But clocking up to ~4.5ghz turbo would be a potentially large gain - at the cost of also a <i>huge</i> uptick in power consumption, though, so Apple may just decline to go that route entirely, at least on their mobile CPUs.')
