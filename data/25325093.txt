One of them, an eight-letter English word followed by .net, expired accidentally due to personnel changeovers. Someone snagged it and apparently used it for a game server for one year, and after it expired again it&#x27;s remained unclaimed since. (I advocated for not worrying about it, since said &quot;future use&quot; has never materialized.)')
