Java fails at it miserably by pretending to be a dynamic language, and I have not seen* Python used in a way in which one usually programs with Lisp - so, keeping the process alive all the time and sending commands to interact with it, like one does with Slime&#x2F;Sly.<p>This has some obvious negative consequences, such as high feedback loop time - in Lisp, the compilation delay is usually imperceptible, especially when compared to running javac or python.<p>The &quot;it&#x27;s high time every one accepted X&quot; is a meaningless comment because it presents an opinion as if it were a fact. Therefore, please accept my downvote.<p>*if such toolkits exist, please point me towards them - I&#x27;ve always wanted to see one in practice.')
