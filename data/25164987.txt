Websites ends up being about the maximal concentration of information into the smallest space akin to a pamphlet rather than an interactive tool.&quot;<p>I find this quite ironic, especially given how unusable most websites are due to third party advertising resources being loaded into them these days. HN users in particular will agree I bet, ad blocking seems prevalent here because of that exact reason.<p>I think Japanese websites are <i>better</i> in this sense because their ad technology is usually &#x27;outdated&#x27; banner ads and internally served sponsorship content. They&#x27;re luckily stuck in the era of static and freshly-baked server-side content.')
