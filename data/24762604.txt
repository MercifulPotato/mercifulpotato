Window shielding would require copper mesh, which is pricier.<p>Start with the cheapest, simplest and most reversible approach and collect data to test assumptions as you learn about your local RF environment. You may also be able to reduce the power level of your WiFi router.  Many cellphones support WiFi calling, which allows the cellular radio to be disabled.<p>Shield installation: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eiwellspring.org&#x2F;shielding.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eiwellspring.org&#x2F;shielding.html</a><p>Skin depth calculator by RF frequency: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.allaboutcircuits.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;skin-depth-calculator&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.allaboutcircuits.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;skin-depth-calculator...</a>')
