Item(by='NamTaf', descendants=None, kids=[25724911], score=None, time=1610341591, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25713858, text='Nifty, but I found the navigation to be a little odd at first. I didn&#x27;t immediately realise the bottom row is always the OP, and so tried to hit my back button to travel back &#x27;up&#x27; from a thread but because it does not load a new page I couldn&#x27;t.<p>It makes sense now that I figured it out (the bottom n rows keep expanding to be the full width, meaning you can always breadcrumb back) but that wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious to me.<p>This is a cool idea though and definitely allows me to see the &#x27;controversial&#x27; threads because they&#x27;re usually the biggest flames :)<p>Does this order left-to-right based on the upvotes that HN itself uses for ordering?')
