It strikes me personally as flimsy reasoning to harp on his writings.<p>If you&#x27;re going to build a business and you hope to make money, you&#x27;re going to have to EXPLOIT inefficiencies in markets, competitors, customers, processes, conventional modes of thinking, and so on. Doesn&#x27;t matter if the business is making you a dollar or a million or a billion.<p>And also, this whole &quot;scandal involving workers or consumers&quot;. YC&#x27;s portfolio has plenty of companies who are making a killing with revenue who haven&#x27;t had to do this.<p>Patrick Collison is a regular poster on here. Go ahead and tell him he&#x27;s exploiting people and he&#x27;s scandalous with workers and consumers. I&#x27;d like to see someone go to one of the successful YC alumni and say directly at them half the shit you people spout out into the nether.<p>As I have mentioned in a comment to the throwaway account in this thread - I sincerely think a lot of commenters on here either have no experience or no ambition in starting a business, never mind getting a healthy revenue stream. Hell, I wonder what the percentage here is who got as far to having to talk to clients.')
