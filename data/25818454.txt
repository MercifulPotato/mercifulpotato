However, to get it into Safari, I need to create a (useless, and empty) Mac app with a specific configuration in Xcode that&#x27;ll allow it to appear in the &quot;extensions&quot; list in Safari. Then I need to deal with all the signing &amp; App Store distribution stuff if I actually want to distribute it.<p>I&#x27;ve shipped an extension like this, and it took me an hour to build (which included testing), and then I hit &quot;archive&quot; and submitted it.<p>The signing pieces &quot;just work&quot; in modern Xcode if you have a developer account associated.')
