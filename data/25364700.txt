Telegram and Viber come readily to mind, and I am certain there are other services that I&#x27;m not aware of, the old fart that I am.<p>Whatsapp was incredibly popular in most of the underdeveloped world, where it became the de facto messaging app because of the low data requirements and ubiquitousness (and probable subsidies via the ISP provider). This was prior to FB buying them. Out of my group of contacts, the Telegram app notified me over the past year that roughly 2 dozen have signed up for it, e.g. That&#x27;s another (albeit anecdotal) sign.<p>I understand the antagonism toward FB&#x2F;Whatsapp&#x2F;Instagram, given the consolidation of social networks within the purview of one entity, but not a single one of those services is a monopoly.<p>Could very well be I don&#x27;t understand the intricacies of the law, and such consolidation is perhaps illegal for the betterment of society, but I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s the case still.
