All of the crimes I mentioned have an element of either intent or fault attached to them.  Coming close to someone, even at speed, without intending to do any harm is not &quot;attempted murder&quot; or assault in any form.  This is fortunate, because to pass a cyclist, one often is forced to come within a few feet of them to accomplish the maneuver.')
