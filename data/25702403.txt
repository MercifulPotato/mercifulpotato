Item(by='mattarm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610213897, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25685667, text='&gt; It still sounds a bit weird to me. If I need something, I will buy it unless I don&#x27;t have cash for it.<p>Yes, and envelopes make it easier for many people to figure out if they have the cash for it.  They let you &quot;spend&quot; the money the instant you get it, in a virtual way, even if you don&#x27;t really need to spend it until later.  This way you know that when it comes time to pay rent&#x2F;mortgage, property tax, etc., you&#x27;re good.<p>I think you are right though: I think the envelope idea is primarily targeted at people on a tight budget, where you really are trading off pros and cons of spending relatively small sums of money, and where the usual question is what gets sacrificed if this or that is purchased.<p>You suggest that in such a situation you&#x27;d look at the root cause of such behavior (e.g. compulsive spending). Often, the &quot;root cause&quot; is simply unawareness of spending patterns, and envelope spending is a useful technique for a lot of people.  It isn&#x27;t a crutch to cover up some sort of underlying personality flaw that has a deeper &quot;root cause&quot; -- It is just a way of tracking earmarked spending.')
