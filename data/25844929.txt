I have currently two instances that run as VMs.<p>One dedicated solely for remote connection to my work. The company insists on software to scan that my PC is &quot;secure&quot;, so I give them a finger with an almost virgin Windows install. Their crap can work only on Windows, so I don&#x27;t actually have any choice.<p>Another is for any application that I use that I absolutely can&#x27;t find replacement for on Linux.<p>I also have separate Linux VMs for suspect software like Zoom that I have to use but I don&#x27;t trust to run on my machine or try to take over my desktop.')
