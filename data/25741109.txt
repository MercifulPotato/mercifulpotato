However, their TOS allows hate speech as long as it&#x27;s not tortious<p>So on Site A a comment spamming nig**r will get you banned, and on Site B it is a-ok as long as it doesn&#x27;t mention anyone&#x27;s name.<p>-<p>Site B should be expected to have more hate speech.<p>Additionally even if Site A gets hate speech, it&#x27;s providers are more likely to give it leeway since it&#x27;s not by design that hate speech appeared.<p>Meanwhile Site B, by the very virtue of it&#x27;s design becomes a lightning rod for hate speech not allowed on Site A, and it is understandable providers are not on board with it.')
