In all these countries, the &quot;dilemma&quot; as presented in the article is simply false: all of them first waited hoping that the measurements wouldn&#x27;t be necessary and introduced them practically as they had no other acceptable choice.<p>The &quot;hard&quot; lockdown first time worked in Italy in the Spring, allowing for very low case count during the Summer there.')
