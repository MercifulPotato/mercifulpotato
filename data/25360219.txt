This is hot, thermal fusion contained by a novel, but very simple to understand set of fields.<p>I&#x27;ve talked to many, physicists and am open to criticism about the design. If I don&#x27;t know the answer to a question I admit it.<p>Since it&#x27;s such a new device, there hasn&#x27;t been any rigorous analysis of it yet, so there is nothing to publish. It&#x27;s a chicken and egg problem.')
