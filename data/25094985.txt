(11,600&#x2F;10k = 1,160 https connections&#x2F;day.  There&#x27;s 1440 minutes&#x2F;day) Of basically calling home every minute and sending not much.<p>Ok calling home every minute...but maybe when idle that&#x27;s not bad for notification updates?<p>We run long do running TLS connections using MQTT, this works for 5-6 figure of units.  And our actual usage when we have good cell coverage is around 25megs&#x2F;mo, including data.  But when you have the qty Google and iOS have....maybe that&#x27;s prohibitive?')
