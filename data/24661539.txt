Basically it started as the accompanying podcast for the Artificial General Intelligence course at MIT, given by Lex. Given that it&#x27;s a podcast for an MIT course, he managed to get a very highly esteemed AI guest list, because who would refuse to give an interview as part of MIT lecture materials? In the beginning it had less to do with Lex as a person I think.<p>With that ex-guest list, he managed to continue after the course as &quot;AI podcast&quot;, now not connected to a specific course. But if you tell people this podcast had X and Y top expert in it, you can get many more top people.<p>Again after some time he rebranded it all under his name as Lex Podcast and is slowly entering culture war territory and is becoming a second Joe Rogan.<p>I guess he used good tactics, but I&#x27;m not sure the initial guests would all agree that their interviews are now part of the Lex-branded podcast.<p>He started tame and uncontroversial, gained &quot;fuck you money&quot; (his phrasing) and is now using it to spread his broader views.<p>Smart, but a little distasteful.')
