I really wonder how these products sell.  The most basic things dont work.  And if they are confused, then for real.  For about 2 years, when Siri happened to misunderstand the command &quot;Call ...&quot; it would answer &quot;OK, calling you&quot; and actually try to call my own number.  This is so weird that it actually feels like someone wrote that piece of code to prank the user.<p>If these things would actually work, I&#x27;d definitely use one regularily.  However, whenever I visit an Alexa owner, I realize after a few interactions that I really couldn&#x27;t be bothered with this stuff.<p>I think the &quot;taxi&quot; problem is still around with Siri.  Put any taxi organisation into your phonebook, and include &quot;taxi&quot; in the name.  You will likely not be able to call it with siri, since it insists to search for taxis in your area.  Its always the same bug.  These things have absolutely no idea about the context.  And some hand-crafted rules go haywire after a while, because apparently nobody reviews them.  When I got my first iPhone (iOS 5) I put in my date of birth during configuration, and promptly noticed that the german speech synthesizers says Nineteenseventynine when I enter 1979.  All aother 4-digit numbers are fine, only 1979 is pronounced english.  So apparently someone put this exception in there for a completely bogus reason, and it stayed there.  It is still there today, after 8 years.')
