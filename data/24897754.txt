Item(by='pjc50', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603728909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24894647, text='&gt; I really disagree with calling any large cultural ideas as &quot;US imports&quot;.<p>Apart from film, pop music, reality television, the Yankees baseball cap, jeans, and a constant stream of news articles about Trump, what have the Americans ever done for us?<p>Compare how many cultural products are American in origin or mention America or American news to how many you get about, say, France or Germany. The influence is _huge_. This is why France has laws requiring a fraction of culture (especially TV and film) to be in French.<p>The UK is certainly polarised, and racist, but <i>in different ways</i> to America. It may be the case that a police murder in Portland starts a riot in Bristol, but it would <i>never</i> be the other way round.<p>When was the last time there was a protest by Americans outside a British embassy over British politics? The US embassy in London practically has a rota for all the different groups that have protested there.')
