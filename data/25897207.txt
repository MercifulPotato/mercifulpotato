As I said, I haven&#x27;t watched the show so I can&#x27;t really appraise the claims properly, but it seems suspect to me.<p>(Incidentally I noticed a similar tendency in myself to think I had policing and Baltimore local politics figured out after watching <i>The Wire</i>.   Did that show really teach me as much as I feel?  Or do I have a false sensation of being informed, steming from my enjoyment of the show?)')
