(Mnuchin was also the speaker of some, in retrospect, appalling secondhand quotes).<p>The article points out that Azar is the director of both the FDA and the CDC, and should have played a more active role in orchestrating their handshakes in February.<p>Misunderstanding and miscommunication between the FDA and CDC were responsible for the absurd delay in widely-available testing, which otherwise should have been available in med-February.<p>Not only was he aware of problems early on, he didn&#x27;t properly communicate them up (to Trump, which contributed to Trump&#x27;s belief that the whole thing would blow over), or manage them down.<p>This is my reading, as a disclaimer, not an explicit statement from the article. I recommend people read it for themselves.')
