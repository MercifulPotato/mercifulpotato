This is about <i>a law suit</i> which has been <i>going on for a few years</i>. The case itself has absolutely nothing to do with recent events. Also, Austria does not have a case law system. Courts don&#x27;t make laws (the <i>constitutional court</i> in Austria can strike down laws, but that&#x27;s about it) and are not bound by previous court decisions. The fact that the supreme court ruled on it just means the decision <i>on this case</i> is final (as far as the Austria judicial branch is concerned).<p>Besides, do you seriously believe a court could act based on something that happened <i>11 days</i> ago? Have you ever dealt with a court?<p>That said, I mostly agree with your ramblings, but that has simply little to no connection to the case and resulting problems discussed in the article.')
