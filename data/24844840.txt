It&#x27;s made it super easy to create internal dashboards and admins actions that we can safely trust nonengineers to use without making an entire website for them.<p>Got a question for the best way to (ab?)use the fact that retool already talks to the db. Say I&#x27;ve got a database that&#x27;s off in some cloud and i&#x27;ve hooked it up to retool.<p>What&#x27;s the best way to use retool as a psql connection, because i&#x27;m too lazy to configure and setup and start psql to do that (say, because I&#x27;d have to start up a google cloud sql proxy and make sure that&#x27;s pointing at the right db, and make sure to use a nonstandard port if i&#x27;ve got a dev container up at the time and and and and...)?<p>Right now I&#x27;ve just got a personal dash that i edit that has an empty table and a query that i can preview, but i feel like there&#x27;s gotta be a better way that doesn&#x27;t involve biting the bullet and spending the time to make the bash commands for psql (or pgadmin) just work.')
