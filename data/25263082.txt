You&#x27;re totally right that Gibson did not foresee this. I think there&#x27;s a difference between Virek&#x27;s near omnipotence, which terrifies Marly, and the modern surveillance state. The idea that someone&#x27;s phone is monitoring their location and browsing habits wouldn&#x27;t surprise someone today.
