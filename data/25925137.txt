Like, our cousins, we take visceral emotional satisfaction in demeaning the other tribe.<p>Todayâ€™s US is just a grand example of this at Internet scale and energized by social media. Welcome to shit throwing and the tearing off of genitals.<p>What you have now are threat displays to keep the losing tribe in its place. People identifying with the winning tribe feel good that there is a lesser party to trample on.<p>Calls for unity happen after a change in power because constant struggle is destructive. After a change in power, lesser chimps (tech) pay fealty to the new alphas (Democratic Congress and Presidency).<p>This whole system works because cooperation within a group allows the group as a whole to compete effectively against other groups. We are organized fractally in this way. To the victor go the spoils.')
