It seems strange from a UK viewpoint: here, many formerly derelict canals and rivers have been restored to navigation over the last 60 years, and work continues.<p>Right now, for example, fish passes are being installed at the locks on the River Severn - the idea of removing the locks entirely would be unthinkable. (Though, in a sign of how attitudes have shifted, the once-popular notion of building more locks to extend navigation further upstream has died a death.)')
