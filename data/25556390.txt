Long term, nope. The best players at MTG have maybe a 60-65% win rate in a professional setting. And that is considered very good. But they can do it consistently. So really the game is about how much better than 50&#x2F;50 you can get. The difference in adding 5-8% to your win rate is an astonishing amount of skill. It’s part of what makes magic fun. Complete novices have a shot. Maybe that rankles some people, but that’s the game :)')
