It&#x27;s the same with doing anything that isn&#x27;t mainstream, such as my decision to use Linux in a workplace where a lot of stuff is Windows-first, and sometimes Windows-only. The best thing the iPhone did to the world was to make web applications more popular, and as long as Safari lags on web standards it pushes websites to not use Chromium-only features and give Firefox users like me a chance.<p>Anyway, a less convoluted setup might be to use the browser version of Teams in a browser where it allows you to screen-share, ie Chromium and not Firefox. IIRC when I tried it a few months ago people on the call said they could only see me broadcasting a black screen, but I know the browser is fine so it had to have been a Teams issue. Maybe it&#x27;s fixed now.<p>Hopefully these applications will catch up soon. As another example, Zoom&#x27;s native Electron application uses a GNOME-specific method of screen-sharing which doesn&#x27;t work in non-GNOME DEs, but I&#x27;ve heard the browser version works fine.')
