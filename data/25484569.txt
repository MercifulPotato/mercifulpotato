Corey Goode mentions &quot;Galactic Super Federation&quot; in his testimony, but also says that it&#x27;s probably different to the &quot;Galactic Federation&quot; mentioned by this guy, which Goode suggests is probably the &quot;ICC&quot; - interplanetary corporate conglomerate. You can see a very brief discussion of this difference in this video discussing the Israeli scientist claims, and hopefully that&#x27;s enough for you to find out more yourself from there if you want.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=c7OwPpc4cLA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=c7OwPpc4cLA</a><p>Basically, I think (tho it&#x27;s probably a bit incorrect)<p>GSF - Genetic-farmer ET races that run genetic experiments on earth with a view to handing over administration of this to humans, have regular meetings (sometimes in a station near Jupiter or Saturn) to resolve disagreements, Goode was an intuitive-empath assistant to human delegations attending these meetings.<p>ICC - companies from Earth that do mining and trade with other civilizations, that emerged out of, and now largely run, a secret space program developed by Earth militaries from back-engineered alien tech, with significant contributions from Nazi scientists, and built and operate bases throughout solar system and beyond.')
