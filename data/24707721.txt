I don&#x27;t care too  look that up), so probably not. It isn&#x27;t clear though, joining ISO generally requires you to license your patents for a &quot;reasonable price&quot; (Reasonably for a big company, tens to thousands of dollars....), but of course IBM didn&#x27;t agree to that back then, so would courts say IBM implicitly agreed to the standards of the day where it was thought not required or not...  Could go either way but I&#x27;d guess IBM would lose such a battle.')
