I&#x27;m not sure a perfect system exists -- it&#x27;s all a series of tradeoffs, and a popular vote system would have its own -- but saying that the 700k people living in Alaska should have the exact same influence as the 40 million people living in California doesn&#x27;t make things any better.<p>Ultimately, a country is made up of people, not political entities.')
