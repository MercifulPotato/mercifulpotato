So if you&#x27;re in the minority in a non-swing state, you know going in that your vote will have no effect on the outcome, it&#x27;s effectively just going to get discarded. If you&#x27;re in the majority, your individual vote still doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power, anything over the 51% is irreverent and effectively discarded.<p>With a popular vote, every single vote counts. No matter how big the majority or how small the minority in a state, every vote still has power. Nobody&#x27;s vote is invalidated by where they happen to live.')
