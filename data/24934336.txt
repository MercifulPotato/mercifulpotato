Not only is there a fee but I think they&#x27;re also inflating prices, and for some restaurants they kept getting the order wrong.<p>Plus the tip goes to their driver, not the restaurant. I mean yeah, props to the driver driving all over getting my food, but I want my guilt money to go to the cooks, who are breathing each other&#x27;s air in a kitchen so I can stress eat, just feeling lucky they still have a job at all.')
