No other debugger can fully freeze your OS while you hunt down that elusive crypto variable that the other developer obfuscated in several DLL&#x27;s in order to hide its true purpose.<p>Man, so much fun was back then.<p>Story time. One of my clients wanted to reverse engineer a trading algorithm and the only option was the nuclear option. Fully disassemble and in-memory hunting this encrypted, split into different DLL&#x27;s function that was holding the entire algorithm. Warned the client that would take as much as half a year and can possibly run up to more than $100k. He accepted saying if it&#x27;s successful then it can gain him millions. So I started the hunt. A few weeks down the road, my client, while we were chatting the usual status and whatnot, dropped the bomb. This algorithm was actually old, as in WinXP era. And I asked &quot;do you have a WinXP variant of this that you&#x27;d be satisfied with if I manage to reverse it?&quot;. And he said he has. I took that one, prepared a WinXP machine with SoftIce in it and job was done 3 days later.<p>The level of control you have with SoftIce, you can&#x27;t achieve it with anything else.')
