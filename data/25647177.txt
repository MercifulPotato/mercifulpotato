See: spotlight on Mac OS X.<p>The problem is that Windows Search just doesn&#x27;t work. I install apps, it can&#x27;t find them unless they have a start menu enry. I save documents, it can&#x27;t find them. It does find plenty of irrelevant websites and spurious results from caches, but it misses files sitting directly in my documents folder. Sometimes it returns a result from a partial name hit but when I accidentally type the next character (correctly!) the hit disappears, and it doesn&#x27;t come back when I remove the offending correct character. It&#x27;s a mess.<p>I used to supplement Windows Search with launchy, but then launchy started bugging out. Now I use keypirinha, which intentionally configures bad defaults to encourage you to learn its config file format. Mega cringe. Once you do, though, it does actually work.')
