This means that it has to be careful not to add stuff that&#x27;s going to become outdated and deprecated cruft that they&#x27;ll have to maintain forever.<p>Rust has already made a mistake of including a channel implementation in stdlib, which ended up being inferior to crossbeam-channel. Now, as you can even see from TFA, there&#x27;s a dilemma whether to use the slower, less flexible one from stdlib, or a crate. If there&#x27;s only a crate, there&#x27;s no dilemma :)')
