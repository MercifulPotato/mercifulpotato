We are going to transform the lives of a billion Indians who don&#x27;t have access to diagnostic services. We use neural networks and computational imaging to generate blood reports and have completed the first prototype. We need people who have worked in image analysis.<p>I&#x27;m a solo founder from IIT Delhi, with an amazing team of IIT Delhi alumni. We also have a distribution network in place, just waiting for the product to materialise.<p>Please do mail at hardik@ashwink.co.in  if interested!')
