The UI is kind of like iPhotos or any other photo viewer except you can split view as many times as you want and views something different in each pane.<p>Here&#x27;s a short clip of 8 videos playing<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nK52DY6sq9U" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nK52DY6sq9U</a><p>or a better video starting from the basic UI, starting videos, zooming them to &quot;cover&quot; mode, and splitting and starting more<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gH9h3XGkFmc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gH9h3XGkFmc</a><p>Here&#x27;s the app<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mopho-v.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mopho-v.org</a><p>You can also open multiple windows so if you have multiple monitors you can easily run one more videos per monitor until your computer can&#x27;t keep up.<p>note: It&#x27;s pretty alpha, several bugs, but I&#x27;ve used it several times a week, living with it&#x27;s bugs, for a couple of years. Not sure I can justify fixing it up as I&#x27;m the only person using it AFAICT but maybe it will give others inspiration. The code I&#x27;m sure is a mess. It was my first React app (a reason to give React a try).<p>It also works pretty good in VR as in on Oculus Rift I open my desktop and manipulate videos and splits with the touch controllers as a mouse. No particular VR support, just saying that most of the features have clickable buttons so it&#x27;s easy to use in VR.<p>A big limit is being Electron it can only play what Chromium plays (mp4, mkv, vp8, vp9). I&#x27;ve been wanting to look info FFMpeg in wasm to add support for other formats, saw the post yesterday someone had done something. I figured it might be too slow and that figuring out how to sync audio might be painful but it&#x27;s still on my magical &quot;someday I might&quot; to do list. Since Chromium already uses ffmpeg it might be easier to just patch Electron to use ffmpeg with all features enabled instead of just the few that ship with Chrome.')
