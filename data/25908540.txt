You state that $500B would vacinate everyone.  Is this in one country or the whole world?  You also state that the remainder of that $500B could ensure no one goes into poverty, even if this was just one country, lets take the USA for example, this is no where near true.  The USA has so far given out Trillions of dollars and it hasn&#x27;t really put a dent in things so no, $500B wouldn&#x27;t ensure everyone in the US stays out of poverty.<p>You then claim that this is the worst job crisis in 90 years, are these hundreds of millions of people in one country or the whole world?  Again the clarification matters.')
