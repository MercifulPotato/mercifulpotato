That means it makes sense to simply wrap the batteries in insulation and use heaters to keep them warm over the winter.  Sure, you use a little power to do that, but you gain back far more performance.<p>For $50 worth of electricity, you can keep something the size of a refrigerator 40 degrees F warmer than the outdoor air all year if you can surround it with an insulating box 2 inches thick.<p>In a car, the volume to surface area ratio is worse, and you can&#x27;t guarantee it won&#x27;t be left in the cold for months without a grid connection, so you need to ensure the chemistry can work cold.')
