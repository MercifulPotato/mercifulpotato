Even if you ignore plants, funghi and animals, then there are still a few billiom humans around that are participating in your market and get damaged by emissions. A fair market needs to contain provisions for compensation of this damage. Just because you can&#x27;t see it right away does not mean it does not exist.<p>Compare it with sewer systems in a city. Many businesses would be much more profitable if they could dump their crap straight onto the street. Municipal cleaning services would need to clean up and everybody pays them. So they&#x27;d be subsidised though this. We don&#x27;t accept this, we have rules against it since it&#x27;s not fair. They have to pay their share, and excessive generation of crap needs to pay accordingly.<p>We don&#x27;t accept this with crap on the street, and we should not accept it with crap in the atmosphere either. It&#x27;s the exact opposite of a free market. It&#x27;s misuse of a common resource.')
