There are only few exceptions. It&#x27;s not that the recommendations are toxic, they are just extremely bad.<p>The algorithm doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to learn what interests me. My suspicion is that this is so because I have a lot of diverging interests that change from month to month. Still, this does not explain why Youtube keeps recommending channels and topics even when I never watch them.')
