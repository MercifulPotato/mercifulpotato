Because I&#x27;m hard up for a good Silk Road read.<p>I slogged through Raoul McLaughlin&#x27;s &quot;The Roman Empire &amp; the Silk Routes&quot; because it&#x27;s online reviews were glowing for silk road history told with decent story telling.  I still found it startlingly dry, it felt like a demonstration of how much research he did rather than a real narrative arc.<p>Tangentially I read half of it aloud to my little kids for bedtime, they loved the crazy names of faraway fantastical sounding places - it&#x27;s about all that really redeemed it experientially.  YMMV, apparently.')
