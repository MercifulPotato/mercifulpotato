My aunt and uncle showed me the 1932 production of &quot;The Mummy,&quot; and it terrified them. They were born in the 40s, and so saw this movie in their teens. (and perhaps even later) I watched it recently, and can&#x27;t even imagine being scared.<p>I&#x27;d like to think that there is both an objective and subjective aspect to this. On the one hand, maybe people just can&#x27;t appreciate the older styles of art. On the other hand, after being exposed to modern violence, cinematography, and suspense, the old techniques truly do pale in comparison, at least in the visceral, emotional sense.')
