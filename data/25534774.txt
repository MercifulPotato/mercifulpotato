This is the reason the case was quickly solved (quickly as in about 5 years)<p>But there are many rapes, that are not reported, or if reported, the victim seldom gets justice because of dragging in courts, etc.<p>And, in any judicial system, solid evidence is required, so rape of a woman in a field, at night, where she might not even remember the faces of her assaulters, might not have enough evidence, apart from circumstantial ones (in cases where the assaulters escaped), leading to no justice to her.')
