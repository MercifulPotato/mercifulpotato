Item(by='xyzzyz', descendants=None, kids=[25426554, 25426394], score=None, time=1607997672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25426040, text='&gt;  The United States, an entity that is legally distinct from its people, was culpable for enabling slavery and segregation. It can be held liable and forced to pay for its part.<p>Ignoring for a while a bunch of practical (though probably solvable to a large degree) problems with this, like on what basis exactly we decide who is paid, and how much are the damages exactly, a more interesting question to me is: what&#x27;s next? Does this settle the claim completely? Do we consider the descendants of slaves, who get this settlement, to be made whole, and any further claims of the descendants of slaves are to be dismissed with prejudice? Are we supposed to no longer give any racial preferences and special treatment (beyond ensuring equal treatment that&#x27;s a right of all American people regardless of their ancestry) to the descendants of slaves, given that any of their claims are settled in full? And finally, what do we do if the settlement does not close the gap completely? Are we then allowed to throw up our hands in the air, and say that the United States has settled its claims, and is not obligated to entertain any new ones beyond ensuring that those of actual unequal treatment are properly litigated?<p>My opinion here is that while settling the liability might look desirable from certain moral point of view, I sincerely doubt that it will bring a long term resolution of the problem attributed to the legacy of slavery. What I expect is that once settlement is paid up, everything about the issue will soon go back to exactly where it has been. This is not an argument against doing such settlement, but rather against high hopes for any positive long lasting change it is purported to bring about.')
