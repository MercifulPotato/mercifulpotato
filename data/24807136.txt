So another way to read the chart is that demand-weighted prices declined most of the time, with occasional spikes. Either way, you can see in the charts the increased supply effect of e.g. fracking being deployed widely in the price response.<p>One could also look back to 2008 to see the impact of increased supply on pricing of e.g. real estate.')
