The wording below enables the state government to detain (or confine in some other way) anyone who refuses to get vaccinated for example, since they could be considered as a group that is “suspected” (whatever that means) to be carrying a disease:<p>&gt; ... MAY ORDER THE REMOVAL AND&#x2F;OR DETENTION OF SUCH A PERSON OR OF A GROUP OF SUCH PERSONS BY ISSUING A SINGLE ORDER,  IDENTIFYING  SUCH  PERSONS  EITHER  BY  NAME  OR  BY  A REASONABLY SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF THE INDIVIDUALS OR GROUP BEING DETAINED. SUCH  PERSON  OR GROUP OF PERSONS SHALL BE DETAINED IN A MEDICAL FACILITY OR OTHER APPROPRIATE  FACILITY  OR PREMISES  DESIGNATED BY THE GOVERNOR ...<p>Section 12 of the bill gets more explicit and notes that apart from detention, you may be ordered to undergo medical procedures like vaccination:<p>&gt;  ... THE  GOVERNOR OR  HIS  OR  HER  DELEGEE  MAY, IN HIS OR HER DISCRETION, ISSUE AND SEEK ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OTHER ORDERS THAT HE OR SHE DETERMINES ARE  NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE  TO  PREVENT DISSEMINATION OR TRANSMISSION OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES OR OTHER ILLNESSES THAT MAY POSE A THREAT TO THE PUBLIC  HEALTH INCLUDING ... TO REQUIRE AN  INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS  BEEN  EXPOSED TO OR INFECTED BY A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE TO COMPLETE AN APPROPRIATE, PRESCRIBED COURSE OF TREATMENT,  PREVENTIVE  MEDICATION  OR VACCINATION ...<p>Bodily autonomy matters. It is a fundamental right and must be upheld across the board.  Safety is the responsibility of the individual. If you’re someone who is scared of viruses and disease, the correct path is for YOU to quarantine yourself indefinitely. It is not appropriate to require others to make changes to their body to suit your risk aversion.')
