USSR did this during Stalin&#x27;s ruling, many others did so as well.<p>There is nothing unique or spectacular here. China is still a dirt poor country with GDP per capita at 15% of that of the US.<p>When they will become closer to developed nations&#x27; economic level, they&#x27;ll need more sophisticated institutions, rule of law, or they would face a middle income trap.<p>For now they can grow by simply utilizing their large factors of production, even dictatorship can do this.')
