It was something that I know a LOT of people actually paid attention to.<p>This is an interesting comment re:communications and the messaging that reaches people. Trump did not recommend injecting bleach. He went on a rambling mostly incoherent recollection of a conversation he had where he was trying to learn what was being done. He was trying to sound smart.\nHis comments were all questions to the med experts. &quot;Is there a way we can do something like that?&quot; &quot;Are we going to check on that?&quot;<p>Yet everyone jumped on it saying he &quot;claims&quot; or &quot;recommended&quot;. And it became &quot;truth&quot; because news articles covering the press conference used phrases like &quot;claims&quot; and &quot;recommended&quot;.<p>&gt; &quot;So I asked Bill a question some of you are thinking of if you&#x27;re into that world, which I find to be pretty interesting. So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous, whether its ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said, that hasn&#x27;t been checked but you&#x27;re gonna test it. And then I said, supposing it brought the light inside the body, which you can either do either through the skin or some other way, and I think you said you&#x27;re gonna test that too, sounds interesting. And I then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute, and is there a way you can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see it (COVID19) gets in the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it&#x27;d be interesting to check that. So you&#x27;re going to have to use medical doctors, but it sounds interesting to me, so we&#x27;ll see. But the whole concept of the light, the way it goes in one minute, that&#x27;s pretty powerful.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=33QdTOyXz3w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=33QdTOyXz3w</a>')
