Any Trump supporter that believes that YouTube is over-moderating is free to create their own website from which they can spawn whatever garbage content they want.<p>Spoiler, though: They won&#x27;t. It turns out the only reason most nutjobs on Facebook&#x2F;YouTube&#x2F;Reddit amounted to anything at all is because they were given a free megaphone and millions of listeners. I&#x27;m not sure why private businesses have to allow such behavior?<p>Until slander and libel get enforced on social media sites, which would solve most of these problems anyway (I think), why does anyone think these websites _have to_ cater to every single subculture? If I were at the helm of any reasonably sized social media company I certainly would not want my site attached with fascist propaganda.')
