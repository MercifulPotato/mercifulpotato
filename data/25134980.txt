I am also really not sure why you are bringing politics into this. I get the analogy but that&#x27;s such an easy way to turn this into a divisive discussion that I think we should leave that there.<p>You are also glossing over the consequences of an extreme response to climate change - an honest discussion talks about the cost as well as the benefits of any action taken.<p>The &quot;all or nothing&quot; approach is likely to get you nothing because in democratic countries when you take actions that result in severe economic consequences, people will just vote in a govt that reverses it. It also sends a signal to all other countries who were considering such action not to do it.<p>It&#x27;s not an easy problem this, and I don&#x27;t pretend to have all the answers, but to me doing SOMETHING that is likely to be acceptable to democratic countries is better than doing nothing and souring the whole thing for ordinary people.')
