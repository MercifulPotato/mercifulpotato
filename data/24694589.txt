I tried it for a week or two and was starting to prefer it over Vim.<p>The problem is that while Kakoune is a very good competitor to Vim the program, I am only rarely in need of a terminal based editor. The vast majority of my time is spent in full fledged IDEs or in Web-based editors, all of whom have Vim plugins so that I can consistently use the same style.<p>It&#x27;s always bummed me out a little bit. I spend the majority of my work days using Vim keys for editing text, and there is an editing style I&#x27;d actually prefer to use but I can&#x27;t because there isn&#x27;t already widespread adoption. There&#x27;s not enough benefit for me to learn it if I can&#x27;t use it everywhere, and switching back and forth with Vim seems extremely difficult.')
