When the issue of Apple&#x27;s anti-competitive behaviour comes up on HN, it is always rebuffed by saying Apple does not have a monopolyâ€”its US share of smartphone market is merely 40%. This is demonstration that you don&#x27;t need a 100% market share to act anti-competitively. Facebook and Google each have less than 30% market share in ad spend in the US.')
