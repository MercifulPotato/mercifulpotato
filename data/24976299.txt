Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604377798, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24974140, text='<i>&gt; in the realm of SOL the only way you can be sure that you&#x27;ve really got &quot;the&quot; standard model and haven&#x27;t mistakenly grabbed another one is if you can confidently state the truth value of every one of a never-ending stream of theorems which cannot be proved using your metatheory</i><p>Let me try to restate this and see if it helps.<p>I say I&#x27;ve specified a second order formal theory that has the standard natural numbers as its unique semantic model. But &quot;the standard natural numbers&quot;, from the standpoint of set theory, is a set, and I can apply set theory operations to it to obtain other sets. For example, I can apply the power set operation. Or I can apply the construction that is used to obtain omega-1 (the first uncountable ordinal). So it&#x27;s not really true that my semantic model &quot;only&quot; includes the standard natural numbers. Unless I simply disallow any set theory operations altogether (which throws away most of the usefulness of the theory), I have to accept that my semantic model includes sets I might not have thought of when I set up my formal theory.<p>So, now that I have recognized that, for example, I can apply two different operations to my set N (the set of standard natural numbers), the power set operation P and the omega-1 construction O, I then have an obvious question: are P(N) and O(N) the same set, or different sets? And if CH is indeed logically independent of my formal theory, then the answer is that there are <i>two</i> semantic models of my formal theory, not one: one model in which P(N) and O(N) are the same set, and another model in which they aren&#x27;t. So I haven&#x27;t fully pinned down a unique semantic model after all.<p>Or, if CH is <i>not</i> independent of my formal theory, then I don&#x27;t know what, exactly, my semantic model is--what sets are in it--until I figure out whether CH holds in my model or not, and that might take a while. And there are actually an infinite number of possible cases where this kind of issue might arise.<p>Is this a fair summary of the issue you have been trying to describe?')
