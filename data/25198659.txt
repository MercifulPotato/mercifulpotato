What matters is their behavior. In most bigger cities, getting around by car stopped being a thing as it is time consuming and not much fun. Places like London, Amsterdam, Paris, etc. outright ban cars from a lot of streets and make it stupidly expensive to park. A weird side effect of that is that a lot of the remaining cars tend to be of the expensive&#x2F;oversized variety.<p>But the reality for most is that people get around by bike and public transport and tend to prefer that to getting stuck in traffic and then having to hunt for parking space.<p>I live in Berlin which is unusually car friendly for a European city because of the German car lobby. You can literally drive up to places like the Alexanderplatz and expect to find a spot to park there (with some difficulty). But even in Berlin, owning a car is not a given for most people that live there. It&#x27;s just not very practical. I&#x27;ve never bothered owning one and probably never will. With what I save on not owning a car, I can easily afford to rent cars or use taxis&#x2F;ubers when I need to; which is not that often actually.<p>Berlin is comparatively unorganized when it comes to protecting bike traffic. Coming from the Netherlands, it feels a bit like a third world country on this front. Infrastructure is poor&#x2F;non existent and Berlin excels at creating safety challenged situations for cyclists where you randomly get to mingle with heavy traffic, deal with delivery vans using the bike lanes as parking areas, etc. Mostly places like Oslo and other bike friendly cities differ from this by separating flows of traffic systematically. Of course compared to the US, Germany is still pretty good.')
