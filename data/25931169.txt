Item(by='Jochim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611769098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926481, text='&gt; The US left appear to be descendeding into full bore anti-conservative hysteria. This is exceptionally dangerous because when the left has taken power in the past with that kind of mentality it ended up in bloodshed on massive scales. That must not happen to America.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t single out any particular faction on this to be honest. The Obama birther movement purportedly started in 2004 and Trump himself peddled the narrative that Obama wasn&#x27;t a US Citizen. There was also the general narrative that Obama was the &quot;Anti-Christ&quot; and a secret Muslim.<p>Now you have a portion of the GOP who believe Democrats and &quot;Hollywood elite&quot; are harvesting children&#x27;s adrenochromes in a massive paedophile ring.<p>Any argument that hysteria is the domain of one party is not based in fact.')
