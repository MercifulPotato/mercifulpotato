A classical system being something big, noisy that can be well approximated by classical mechanics.<p>Simple interaction between two systems doesn&#x27;t cause &quot;collapse&quot; it makes the two systems become entangled. Classical systems are a bit contagious in this sense, anything that gets entangled with them becomes classical.<p>To be a bit more precise, this distinction between classical and quantum is a bit our fault. Everything is quantum at a fundamental level, classical system is one for which we do have not have a precise knowledge of the state of the system, instead we have a coarse representation. This should make more obvious in which way &quot;classicalness&quot; is contagious. Since the knowledge of a part was coarse, the knowledge of the newly entangled system is also necessarily coarse.')
