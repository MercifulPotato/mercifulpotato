Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of: it doesn&#x27;t brand you as ANYTHING, any more than being diabetic or having an allergy does. There is a very good chance that a doctor can help you quickly and easily.<p>And you might feel at times like you don&#x27;t even want to be helped, or that you don&#x27;t deserve help, or that it&#x27;s not worth the bother, but those are all symptoms of your problem, not consequences of it. Your judgement IS impaired. It <i>will</i> go away once you&#x27;re in treatment. You&#x27;ll be amazed at the change.<p>Please, talk to a professional, be very honest with them about how you&#x27;re feeling and about the thoughts you are having. I know it&#x27;s tough to open up and it might seem awkward, and I know it&#x27;s easy to lose sight of it in these times we live in, but I promise you, there <i>are</i> many people out there that <i>really</i> want to help you, not just because it&#x27;s their job, and they are more than able to do it. It <i>will</i> change your life.<p>You will get over this and come out stronger on the other side. You&#x27;ll see. Best wishes, friend.')
