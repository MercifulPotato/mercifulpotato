But this might be easier for you to play with rather than learning another language.<p>OpenMP is just #pragmas on top of your standard C, C++, or Fortran code. So any C &#x2F; C++ &#x2F; Fortran compiler can give this sort of thing a whirl rather easily.<p>---------<p>OpenMP always was a fork-join model #pragma add on to C &#x2F; C++. They eventually realized that their fork-join model works for SIMD, and finally added SIMD explicitly to their specification.')
