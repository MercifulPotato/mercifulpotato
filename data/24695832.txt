Item(by='otikik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601973973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695372, text='When I tried `set inccommand=split` in neovim it would sometimes freeze the editor, even when substituting regular-sized files (several Kb), so I had to deactivate it. Granted that this was some time ago, so it might have been improved with recent versions.<p>To me however multiple selections are not Kakoune&#x27;s strongest point. It&#x27;s the fact that in Kakoune you &quot;first select, then modify&quot;, while in vim you go &quot;action first, then subject&quot;.<p>Putting the subject first allows for a more visual experience in general - in Kakoune you can always &quot;see what&#x27;s going to happen&quot; before it happens, because the object is always highlighted. The multiple cursors thing is just a manifestation of this approach. In Vim the experience is more &quot;opaque&quot; - you type some commands in normal mode and suddenly the text changes. As a result Kak is less prone to &quot;accidental edits&quot; like I get in Vim from time to time.<p>I&#x27;ve heard that some people &quot;abuse&quot; on Vim&#x27;s Visual mode to get over this limitation. But that feels like a kludge to me. And it doesn&#x27;t solve the accidental edits.')
