I suspect the books will be just as bad because the series suffers from the same effect many stories like this suffer from: The writer establishes many interesting threads without knowing where they lead, and then can&#x27;t tie them up and the series falls flat in the end. Happened with Lost, with Heroes and many other series as well.')
