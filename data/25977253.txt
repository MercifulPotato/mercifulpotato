I was reassigned to an old project from 5 years ago with an archaic framework, to refactor all the code to the &quot;new shinny JS framework&quot;. Ironically, I was in the team that built it 5 years ago. It is dreadful. Rinse and repeat.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m doing something wrong when I advocate against projects that need 50,000 files and a 2-minute build when you could just do with HTML&#x2F;CSS, native JavaScript and a simple CRUD backend.')
