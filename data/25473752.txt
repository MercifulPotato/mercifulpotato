And it would be silly, because (1) I don’t see any evidence that the Ninth is particularly copyright maximalist compared to other circuits, and (2) to the extent that it has taken a hard position on copyright claims in certain cases, its often been portrayed as <i>hostile</i> to the music and film industry that is so powerful in the state in so doing.
