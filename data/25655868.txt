No issue, everything is automatic, didn&#x27;t had to pay a single thing and it would even be possible to get unlimited free taxi rides from home to hospital, free public transport, wig, sport... even a tax cut. I&#x27;m really thankful for this.<p>Other part of my income was insured by a private company. They lost my files, claimed I didn&#x27;t fill the forms and after months of fight and involving my employer, they magically found papers I previously sent and paid.<p>Private companies seek profit and would basically do anything to keep your money. You cannot build a good (fair) insurance company with this logic.')
