I made art myself, even special one. I made one of the biggest perler bead art in europe with about 70.000 beads (maybe even the world?). Would I appreciate my artwork? As some kind of skill - yes (having immense duration and boredom), as something that has a special intrinsic variable beside being bigger than other pieces - no.<p>I&#x27;m aware that every skill and talent takes some kind of luck to &quot;make it&quot;. I just say that art lacks any objective qualities and is just based on choices of some elite circle that don&#x27;t even match public opinion.')
