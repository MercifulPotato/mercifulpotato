That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one&#x27;s intellectual curiosity.<p>Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they&#x27;re evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they&#x27;d cover it on TV news, it&#x27;s probably off-topic.')
