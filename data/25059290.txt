You can dispute charges and they take care of fraud, not you. That&#x27;s the beauty of this system. I don&#x27;t understand why we need to honestly care for the people not prudent to the system at hand. If they aren&#x27;t wise enough to realize &quot;there&#x27;s always a catch&quot; then they deserve to be taken advantage of. Plain and simple. These types of people that have never experienced loss in their lives like that clearly have not been out much in general and these types of people really do need to realize that this fabricated utopian way of living has never happened, will never happen, and cannot happen as long as human beings exist.')
