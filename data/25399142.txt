Item(by='enonevets', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607789566, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25388984, text='&gt; that will bring you and your children joy is in a different level<p>This oddly assumes in this example that somehow the Airpods Max don&#x27;t bring a person joy because of the price tag<p>It&#x27;s no different comparing cars or any other items. Option A can do what Option B does but is cheaper. People buy B because they want to. Why would this be any different here.<p>Anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend $550 on headphones don&#x27;t have to.<p>&gt; &quot;I will get these $500 headphones instead of the $300 ones that can do the same thing just because I can afford them&quot;<p>But that isn&#x27;t entirely true. If you want over ear headphones that support Spatial Audio, these are the only option.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Airpods Max being this expensive makes sense. I&#x27;m not saying they are definitively better. But there are differences and regardless, not a good reason to be repulsed about pricing. If you don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t buy it.')
