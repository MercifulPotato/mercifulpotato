Then again, I <i>have</i> said this nicely to people a few times over the years (&quot;hey, cool you&#x27;re interested, but note this is really intended for expert users&quot;), and it&#x27;s about a 50&#x2F;50 toss-up about whether or not you&#x27;ll get insults and an aggressive reply back. One time this guy got so triggered over this that he went to several subs to tell everyone what a horrible person I was just for (nicely!) explaining that they didn&#x27;t really seem to be the intended target audience.<p>Turns out that being a programmer means you&#x27;re obliged to help strangers out on the internet, according to some anyway *shrug*.<p>&gt; I basically just tend to use whatever program gets the job done rather than obsessing over theory&#x2F;purity&#x2F;minimalism<p>That&#x27;s pretty much why I use dwm; I use a hacked-up version and I somehow managed to lose the source code for that 2 years ago (not sure how...) but it&#x27;s okay, because it Just Worksâ„¢. It&#x27;s very stable, never changes, and I never need to look at it or worry that an update will break anything or will move things around (&quot;now where did that button go?!&quot;)<p>For me, suckless is very much a pragmatical thing, not a &quot;minimalist ideological&quot; thing.')
