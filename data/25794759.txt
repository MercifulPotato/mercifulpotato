Signal should probably give its users tips for communicating securely - but that&#x27;s at least one degree separate from &quot;warn users about insecure IMEs&quot;.<p>Additionally, if you&#x27;re already using a chinese phone, why does it matter whether <i>your IME</i> is compromised? Doesn&#x27;t the CCP already have its nose in all of the manufacturers&#x27; OSes already? Maybe Signal should warn about that as well.<p>I&#x27;m all for helping people communicate securely, something Signal should be very interested in, but the hyper focus on IMEs is confusing.')
