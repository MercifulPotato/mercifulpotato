UTF-8 has been defined to encode characters to up to 4 bytes since 2003.\n- Neither the &#x27;utf8&#x27; nor &#x27;utf8mb4&#x27; character sets have any case sensitive collation other than &#x27;utf8_bin&#x27; and &#x27;utf8mb4_bin&#x27;, which sort characters by their numeric codepoint.<p>utf8 being effectively alias of utf8mb3 has cost us so much work its not even funny.')
