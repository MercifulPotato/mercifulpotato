Point well taken.<p>If I had a nice weather-protected path to walk to work (like the underground networks in some major cities), walking would be far preferable to driving.<p>My argument, nay, my observation, is that some type of transition between work and home appears to be vital to my well-being. I suspect that the time component for that transition is just as important.<p>For example: What if I built an office in my garage? That would give me a physically different space, but I&#x27;d be deprived of that transition time to switch mindsets.<p>What I don&#x27;t know is how much time is needed for the same effect. Would a 5 minute walk suffice? Could it be even better? Who knows?')
