Very interesting article.<p>Despite having used various nitrogen-based compounds that go bang in the past (and like many techies, that I find them interesting), I&#x27;m rather glad that I&#x27;ve never been involved with them in a big way professionally.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m a bit timid, but it&#x27;s always seemed to me there&#x27;s always a reasonable probability of an accident, usually when one&#x27;s least expecting it.  I recall some time around the early 1970s a friend of mine who used to go prospecting for gold always having a large box of gelignite in the back of his car and he&#x27;d keep it there even if he hadn&#x27;t been prospecting for some considerable time.  In fact, I recall his stock of it getting so old that it used to get to the sweaty stage (this means it&#x27;s unstable).<p>It used to scare the hell out of me and I&#x27;d keep well away but it never worried him.  Still, it never went bang and he&#x27;s still around.  These days, he&#x27;s a licensed fireworks maker.')
