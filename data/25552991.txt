Those food stands you saw were excavated many years ago with less modern methods. This is the first food stand to be excavated in quite some time and has yeilded new discoveries from the application of new methods. I wouldn&#x27;t expect the new discoveries to be well explained in a short reuters article. I get the idea they were able to make some new analysis of the food and ingredients in the containers. You probably need to be versed in the field and reading archeological journals to really understand the contributions.')
