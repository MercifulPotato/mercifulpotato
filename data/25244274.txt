Even if we survive the local warming period, we&#x27;re just as likely to fall into a brutal ice age right afterwards, of which humanity will not survive unless we very quickly learn how to do planetary-scale geoengineering and terraforming.<p>My problem with the whole &quot;climate change is fake&quot; conspiracy nuts is... why aren&#x27;t they just going for the obvious one that the governments just don&#x27;t care and aren&#x27;t fixing the larger issue? The amount the US government spent on the endless war in Iraq and Afghanistan could have ensured the survival of the human race.<p>A nice big juicy conspiracy right there, and none of them are going for it. Government fucked up? Check. People profited from war? Check. Media is refusing to cover it? Check. Come on, take the fucking bait and run with it.')
