I was going to cancel it but the rep said that I could pay the annual fee of $95 with miles.   I have it to avoid paying bag fees.  Haven&#x27;t traveled with United for more than a year.  I guess I&#x27;ll keep it until the miles run out.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you can do the same with your Delta Amex but FYI.')
