In the world today, that&#x27;s pretty small.<p>I think the endless discussion of a desire for &quot;micropayments&quot; is just another excuse for &quot;We don&#x27;t really want to pay for content and we imagine if you get it down to a penny, that&#x27;s so close to zero, we think it would basically be free.&quot;<p>I imagine if someone solved it, there would be some new complaint (like &quot;Do you know how many articles I click into each week? I am getting charged a penny for every single one! This is killing me!&quot;)<p>The internet doesn&#x27;t like paying writers&#x2F;content producers. The internet loudly objects to every means to pay content producers: ads, content marketing, tip jars, etc. It all gets decried by someone, somewhere for existing at all.<p>People basically think content producers are supposed to be slave labor and then don&#x27;t like it if you put it that way.<p>Edit: to be clear, I think chasing the mythical beast of &quot;If only we had micropayments, then we could pay for content!&quot; is like friends who say &quot;If I won the lottery, I would give you half.&quot; What they really mean us that in theory they would like to do something for you, but in reality they aren&#x27;t going to do anything for you in the here and now and probably would change their mind if they really won.<p>Both <i>winning the lottery</i> and <i>solving the micropayments problem</i> are sufficiently long shot that you probably won&#x27;t have to pay up. It&#x27;s frequently code for &quot;I wish you people could get paid. It&#x27;s sad that writing is slave labor. But I don&#x27;t want to give you my hard earned money.&quot;')
