If you asked them, they say, with absolute conviction, that I&#x27;m nuts. How might that happen? What if they&#x27;re right? What could I have missed?</i><p>After having read books on two sides of various things, I have found that most people don&#x27;t have firm beliefs at all. Their beliefs don&#x27;t even have anything to do with how they live. They have everything to do with what they&#x27;re told will make them look good. So, just because someone says they believe something, I&#x27;m not willing to waste any more of my time on learning how it is justified on an intellectual or logical level (which is what books tend to capture). Even the believers most likely don&#x27;t have any understanding of it themselves or how or why it matters to them. It&#x27;s simply not worth it.')
