However you&#x27;d be surprised how many high end kitchens will use a gas stove because it&#x27;s often a better and more versatile cooking tool, plus natural gas is something America has a lot of and is very cheap compared to the Russian gas that many Europeans have to deal with.<p>Also, the poorest of Americans will use electric ranges almost universally because we can make electric ranges for the same or less than a gas range and the poorest of people live in places that don&#x27;t even get natural gas copper piped through their place. They would just live without it and have electricity only.')
