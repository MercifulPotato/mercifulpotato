We think that&#x27;s pretty depressing. At Brightline, we&#x27;re building an extraordinary behavioral health platform that provides care for the whole family. By combining technology with evidence-based therapy, we think we can do better. This is not the first startup rodeo for many at Brightline, and previous exits by the leadership team include Castlight, Livongo and AllTrails. But we have some tough problems in front of us and we need your help to do this right.<p>Tech stack: Rails + React&#x2F;TypeScript<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hellobrightline.com&#x2F;careers?gh_jid=4220100003" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hellobrightline.com&#x2F;careers?gh_jid=4220100003</a>')
