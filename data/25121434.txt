Don&#x27;t run upgrades just before you need your computer to work. I do upgrades once or twice a week, when I know I have time to fix if anything breaks. Maybe once a year I need to spend a couple of minutes to manually fix a problem, like re-running the updater with a special flag, or deleting a certain file. The steps are usually to be found on the distro&#x27;s home page, announced in the mailung list or posted in a forum dedicated to updating. It&#x27;s really not a big deal.')
