When you &quot;call the hotel&quot; with the number listed, I learned that the representative is actually a Hotels.com rep, not a hotel employee or hotel call-center employee.<p>This matters. In my case, I asked about my corporate discount and they gave me a vague answer about &quot;I dont see anything in the system&quot;, which I guess was technically not a lie, but definitely deceitful. I wised up because I <i>knew</i> we had a corporate discount and asked who I was speaking to. They gave vague answers like &quot;I&#x27;m the call center representative&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m here to help you book with X hotel&quot;.<p>The scam is they are trying to book you at a higher price w&#x2F;o applying any corporate discounts, etc (and probably keeping a booking&#x2F;affiliate fee). This should be illegal.')
