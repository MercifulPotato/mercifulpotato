Currently it&#x27;s an Arduino Mega2560 with custom stuff to talk to the 1-wire sensors (not just bit banged) and the ubiquitous 8 relay board for output.  But the actual thermostat logic is on my main Linux server machine.  Yes, if my server crashes my heat goes down, I&#x27;ll fix that some day, but it never does crash so it&#x27;s run like this for 12 years.  The original setup used owfs for input and output, but it was never completely stable that way.<p>Why? Because my bog standard 7-day programmable thermostat did not have the &quot;turn the heat up in two weeks just before I come back&quot; functionality.  Back in 2008, if internet programmable thermostats even existed, they had the same suckage - only works via proprietary cloud stuff.  Yech.  I just want &quot;turn up the heat&quot;, and I want it my way.  The web interface is a HTML form with a single input box that says &quot;Temperature&quot;.  Programmable thermostat stuff is crontab entries.')
