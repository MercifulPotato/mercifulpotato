They&#x27;re asking why that is, but they&#x27;re also suggesting extending the private dwelling defence to be broader to include all private conversation.<p>&gt; 13018.252 To the extent that the aim is to ensure that the criminal law does not intrude on purely private matters, the exception is poorly targeted. It would include a meeting held in a large private house, for instance, but would exclude a private conversation conducted in an office. Other jurisdictions handle this issue differently. For instance, the Canadian Criminal Code excludes a “private conversation” from the offence of wilful promotion of hatred.')
