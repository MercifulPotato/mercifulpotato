I use a variety of methods for getting the data and aim to obtain the data as quickly, accurately and efficiently as possible.<p>I can also provide Node-React applications and front ends. I believe that I am a consistent fullstack developer who happened to specialize in data scraping and data science but is still able to provide current high quality front end work.')
