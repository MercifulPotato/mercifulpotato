You&#x27;re basing your argument off celebrity net worth which as I wrote above does not convince me.<p>2. My comment is about Nathans attempt to white wash his dark history in the public eye. A point you are refusing to address as you pass off IV as not that bad.<p>3. Comparing IV to old IBM is an insult to inventors everywhere.<p>4. My narrative is that patent trolling steals from everyone and Nathan is a bad man for creating the world&#x27;s largest patent troll. Please don&#x27;t attempt to deflect with tabloid speculation about net worth, it isn&#x27;t relevant even if the tabloid guessed right.')
