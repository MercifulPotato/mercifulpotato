Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25468920], score=None, time=1608308866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25468385, text='&gt;&gt; there are no character classes, just five attributes with related perks.<p>Well, that&#x27;s just not true, it&#x27;s just that your &quot;class&quot; depends heavily on your playstyle. In the same sense Skyrim didn&#x27;t have classes, but your &quot;build&quot; depended on how you played the game. You can play almost entirely stealthily, put all of your points into intelligence and stealth with some hacking added in. You can play as a brute with tonnes of raw strength, punch everything with gorilla arms. Or maybe you want a typical soldier character, with proficiency in ranged weapons. Or a samurai-like character who uses katanas, or maybe mantis blades. All of these playstyles have their distinct perks and yes, you can absolutely role play as any of them.<p>Yes, you don&#x27;t pick &quot;wizzard&#x2F;thief&#x2F;rogue&quot; at the beginning. But that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t classes.')
