At this point your view is not an unpopular one.<p>Microservices have been from the start an organizational tool, with reliability and the ability to scale horizontally to avoid constraints of vertical scaling trailing at second place.<p>The rationale is that the first bottleneck that is hit by a growing organization is developer&#x27;s throughput (i.e., the ability to deploy bugfixes and features without hitting blockers due to multiple teams being affected by a changeset).  After that point, a service has to grow a tad more until reaching a point where the requests bounded to a subset of features justifies peeling them out to independent services.')
