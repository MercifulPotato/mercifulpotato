Gatsby to me is more of an &quot;integration first&quot; minded architecture. That is, Gatsby is a way to unite multiple services, CMS&#x27;s and content sources. But other than using .MD files Gatsby doesn&#x27;t really have the ability to manage content in a true CMS sense. It&#x27;s not like you log into some Gatsby admin panel and add content.')
