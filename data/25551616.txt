Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609082701, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25550596, text='The biggest irony is that this hint contradicts the rest of the article. The author complains about central banks handing out too much money to consumers and doing helicopter money.<p>As far as I know no central bank gives you money to buy consumer goods, they give money to commercial banks who let you borrow money to buy real estate (an investment if you rent it out) or to your startup or existing business so that you can expand faster (also an investment). That&#x27;s the end of the short list of things that the central bank does that had even a tiny chance of directly involving consumers and the vast majority of money does go into capital investments.<p>Finally there is QE where the central banks introduce money into capital markets directly. Again unless you are a retail investor you are not going to transfer that new money into consumer spending. The vast majority of retail investors have a small net worth which means most of the money is going to a minority of wealthy people. Those wealthy people own businesses and would rather earn even more money (capital investment again).<p>So, every time the author complained about the central bank following keynesian politics too much, they didn&#x27;t...<p>If anything, there is too little keynesianism. Inflation is low because money isn&#x27;t reaching consumers at all. Now that we have arrived at inflation we can put another piece of the article in perspective.<p>&gt;Economists of the Austrian school understand, that the boom is the real problem and the economic crisis is the necessary and positive cleansing mechanism.<p>Consumer inflation is a positive cleansing mechanism, it tells you &quot;you have to be at least this productive to break even&quot;. Companies whose returns are below inflation have to close up shop eventually. Why is that? Because there is a shortage of goods or workers and those few precious goods or workers should be used in the most efficient way. Except this isn&#x27;t what is currently happening, there is an overabundance of goods and labor and therefore there is no need for any sort of economic cleansing in the name of efficiency. It&#x27;s the biggest reason why austerity policy in Greece did not work as &quot;advertised&quot;. Their unemployment rate was so high that no job or company could be considered too inefficient. Simply getting people to work is already success.<p>I&#x27;ll take advantage of this to also talk about something unrelated to the article. Some capital owners argue that their wealth should not be taxed on inflation. Well, that would completely go against the idea of the cleansing mechanism and inflation would just be central bank money straight into the pockets of the rich (it already is to a large degree).')
