But I don&#x27;t think such a drastic and destabilizing change is necessary.<p>I&#x27;ve worked around the python linter and it is written in C. The bits in python (especially our custom rules) were horribly slow.<p>Lint is building a tree of the code and going through it recursively. Going through a large tree in pure python is horribly slow, it has to interpret every single line of code again and resolve every variable again, because they could change anytime, the overhead is insane.<p>It&#x27;s the one thing that python cannot do, parsing tree. If python had a JIT it might be doable but currently it isn&#x27;t.')
