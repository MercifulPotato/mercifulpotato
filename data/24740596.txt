It read like a synopsis of a really interesting story, but it was just delivered in the most artless way.</i><p>I wonder if that&#x27;s more a function of the length of contemporary SF novels, which sometimes seem to me to spend an inordinate amount of time doing scene-setting without advancing the plot. Space opera seems particularly prone to this, with blow-by-blow accounts of battles, interspersed with thoughtful analysis of how one side&#x27;s technological superiority vs. the other side&#x27;s numerical superiority affects tactical considerations.<p>And the ham-handed foreshadowing. Ugh. If one side has a competent but arrogant commander with a subordinate who is worried that they might have missed something, or just has a feeling that something isn&#x27;t right... you can be pretty sure that they and their fleet are about to have their asses kicked by... Oh No! A Surprise Plot Twist where the other side reveals a hitherto unknown capability (which is now described in loving technical, tactical, and strategic detail before getting on with describing the battle)! Also, said arrogant commander + worried subordinate have a 50-50 chance of simply being vaporized in the opening salvo with a surprised look on their face (good thing we&#x27;ve never seen them before so aren&#x27;t invested in them as characters). &lt;eyeroll&#x2F;&gt;')
