I don&#x27;t care about trump. I care about monopolistic platforms openly abandoning their neutrality.<p>Imagine a world where the online speech is shaped to the liking of a platform owner. It will logically lead to winning elections and forming government by the side supported by such platform, which will of course stay private to legally censor anti-government speech, which, in turn, will make replacement of said government nearly impossible via elections. If you don&#x27;t see any problems with that, well, I rest my case.')
