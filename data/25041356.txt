Item(by='Retric', descendants=None, kids=[25041770, 25044189], score=None, time=1604965623, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25041303, text='&gt; The Venn diagram of banks where you’d feel safe storing millions of dollars and that would also be willing to help you defraud the US Treasury are exceedingly small. It’s just not practical.<p>You only need 1.  However, the solution isn’t to move money from your account to a bank which then hides what’s going in from the US government.  The solution is to make a terrible investment say buying land from Bob for 10 million only to sell it to Sally for 5 million.  Meanwhile an associate of Bob, Sally, or both moves 4 million to a holding company owned by you.<p>That gets 4 million in a secret account, let’s you offset capital 5 million in capital gains, and pays 1 million for money laundering.<p>Repeat as needed.  Sure, 4 million in a hidden account is less useful day to day, but it’s insurance if you need to flee the country or happened to go bankrupt etc.')
