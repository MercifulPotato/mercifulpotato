I have only one contact in Threema so for all intents and purposes that app icon <i>is</i> her. On most other platforms I also chat disproportionately with a single person and I find it somewhat annoying when someone else contacts me on them, because I expect the Facebook Messenger notification to be that person, the Threema notification to be another and the Instagram notification to be yet another. The biggest wildcard is Whatsapp â€“ could be work, could be my mom.')
