Most Chinese use [...]<p>So, the ask is that Signal (a western company) develop a Chinese keyboard that is better than the vast majority of Chinese keyboards on the market (something Wu says is hard for western companies), and then force all Chinese users to use it, even if they prefer something else? What happens if they develop a bad one?<p>Keyboards aren&#x27;t that special here. Signal opens up links in web browsers and some users install insecure web browser (also more commonly in China than in the US). Signal runs on an operating system and some users install insecure operating systems (also more commonly in China than in the US). There&#x27;s no logical stopping point here until the whole device is Signal.<p>I think it&#x27;s good for Signal to try to do one thing (encrypted communication) well, rather than trying to do everything.')
