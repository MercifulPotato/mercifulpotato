So the &#x27;dictionary&#x27; is a centralized construction. It must be the same for everybody.<p>If our dictionaries vary to much in their definitions then our communication becomes more and more difficult.<p>Maybe dictionary is not the best analogy (this is just an analogy) but I hope I&#x27;m getting my point across with this example.')
