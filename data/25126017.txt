Yet the &#x27;FP doesn&#x27;t scale for distributed systems&#x27; is too broad. MapReduce &#x2F; Flume &#x2F; Spark &#x2F; BigQuery <i>are</i> distributed systems. What he probably meant is one can&#x27;t use pure FP for OLTP at scale. This is again a bit too broad, as most systems benefit from having a FP &#x27;business logic&#x27; core with some mechanisms to integrate with the rest of the world. Often times distributed systems are build of purely functional layers talking RPC with the lower layers. Even Erlang, the canonical example of &#x27;we really meant actors when talking about objects&#x27; is heavily functional in its design.<p>For reference, I use FP as in &#x27;eschew mutable state&#x27;, and not &#x27;let&#x27;s use category theory to solve FizzBuzz using compile-time type metaprogramming&#x27;.')
