And you still don&#x27;t know what the lower layers are doing. And making it runnable requires a developer account, etc.<p>Are we surprised these days that kids (and everyone else) don&#x27;t see &quot;writing an app&quot; as something they can just try?<p>And that the end consequence of <i>that</i> is that they don&#x27;t value the ability to do so?<p>We&#x27;ve engineered our platforms to look like the companies that produced them: highly optimized, but simultaneously bloated and overly complex.')
