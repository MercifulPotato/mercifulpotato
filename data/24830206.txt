Item(by='rleigh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603137101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24829833, text='My understanding is that FreeBSD freezes its kernel ABI for each major release and this enables third-party drivers to be written against it and supported for that major release.  There are out-of-tree graphics drivers in the ports tree making use of this today.  Both AMD and Nvidia drivers from what I can tell.  Other non-graphics drivers as well.<p>A freeze for a couple of years seems like a reasonable compromise to me.  It&#x27;s not forever, but it&#x27;s long enough for third-parties to develop, validate and support a product for.  The closest Linux gets to this is vendor kernels which are both vendor-specific, and highly-custom and badly dated.  This at least gets you something reasonably current and supported to work with.')
