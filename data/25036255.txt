That&#x27;s not a particularly novel opinion of him, and there are a lot of famous people out there like that. After a little bit of reflection, I actually came to realize I&#x27;d probably be the same way, spouting unsolicited opinions and throwaway memes, if I had a massive internet following that considered me a genius. And it makes me a little glad I&#x27;m not famous. I much prefer my obnoxious opinions being tied to a random alias that nobody can be bothered to stalk.')
