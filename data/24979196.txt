But that&#x27;s temporary. Whoever these entities are will eventually realize that this loss in value is not going to be recoverable and they will be forced to dump their fiat eventually. All the stored up CPI inflation will be released in a very short amount of time.<p>You can&#x27;t increase the supply of a currency (or anything else) without it losing value unless the supply of goods can keep up with the supply of currency but that doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case these days. The best you can do is hide the surplus currency from the markets as long as possible. But eventually, something will happen which will force the hidden currency to enter the markets.<p>Also, there is a myth that technology is causing exponential growth in efficiency but the reality of the last 10 years is that everything has been getting more bureaucratic and less efficient (I&#x27;m a software engineer so I&#x27;ve seen this first hand).')
