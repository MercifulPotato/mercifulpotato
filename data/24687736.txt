It also took me a year to build a product... But still no revenue!<p>I built an on-demand remote browser product[0], and safe link opener[1], and I made it open source[2] but paid license and no one paid.<p>I know people are using it because of the binary, npm CLI downloads, and use of the demos, and I had some inbound interest but mainly people who seemed to want to not pay, or were just prospecting tools for future possible features.<p>I think an issue is that these products are mostly for enterprise and big orgs, who mostly want to buy from established brands or connected people. I tried posting on gum-road and using my linked in premium trial to message possible customers, as well as cold email, but I guess this &quot;product&quot; is not meant to be.<p>That&#x27;s OK since I was only releasing it to fund me as a layer of a larger product I&#x27;m building.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browsergap.dosyago.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browsergap.dosyago.com</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isolation.site" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isolation.site</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cris691&#x2F;OuterShell" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cris691&#x2F;OuterShell</a><p>I know this is supposed to be about generating revenue but some others posted without revenue so I thought it&#x27;s OK to share :)')
