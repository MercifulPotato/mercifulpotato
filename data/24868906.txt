The downside for spending those years for some people is much higher than others.<p>A social safety net can de-risk this somewhat, but the US doesn&#x27;t have a meaningful one.<p>So really, the &quot;willingness to be low-status&quot; often just means &quot;coming from a background that&#x27;s high-status enough that being low-status for a few years will not significantly damage their financial prospects&quot;.')
