It&#x27;s almost as fast of a feedback cycle that you would have had working in Lisp at a REPL 30 years ago!<p>Javascript is popular, but in most ways it&#x27;s actually a much worse language than PHP, especially for new learners. The package ecosystem is a pigsty. It only exists because of legacy. I would hate to send some shiny new university grad down the route of learning that stack in depth when eventually, inevitably, it will be pushed out by something that sucks less. As soon as WASM matures to the point where in-browser UI that is NOT javascript&#x2F;DOM powered is feasible on most devices, we&#x27;re going to see a spate of new frameworks, new &#x2F; repurposed languages on the client, etc. and the big advantage of &quot;JS on both frontend and backend&quot; will go away.<p>Can&#x27;t come soon enough.')
