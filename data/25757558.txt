Could you elaborate some? Judging just from your one liner, this sounds like it is ripe for misuse.<p>Dumb examples off the top of my head:<p>- Lets pretend my spouse died in an accident. Everyone is understanding and I&#x27;m afforded whatever time-off I need. While I&#x27;m out, someone quits and my boss asks (they don&#x27;t assume I will say yes) me if I can be in the office a couple hours on Friday to help with an important deployment. I say yes, but an hour in I spontaneously start crying at my desk. This makes it difficult for my neighbor to get their work done. Would I be breaking the no drama policy?<p>- What if instead of spouse&#x27;s death, war erupts in my country-of-origin and I may never be able to return there. A coworker asks what&#x27;s up and instead of saying &quot;nada,&quot; I tell them and it makes them uncomfortable.<p>- What if I was at a rally for $opposite_political_thing and a coworker sees me on the news and asks me about it. I tell them, and contrary to what I think I know about them, they don&#x27;t react well to my response and feel really uncomfortable?<p>Clearly we&#x27;ve got more and less borderline cases, but from the right purview all of the examples could be considered drama. &quot;No drama&quot; feels like the HR equivalent to &quot;your taillight is out.&quot;<p>How does your office decide what is drama? What if you don&#x27;t think it is drama? Is there some type of arbitration? What happens if you win your arbitration case, but that spoils the office?<p>Sorry for all the questions, I&#x27;m genuinely interested.')
