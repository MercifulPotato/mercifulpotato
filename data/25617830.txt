Life changes. All the time. What about your plan for Q2&#x2F;Q3 2020 to finally do that world cruise you had been waiting to do all your life? Riiiiight.<p>Now having some sort of principles you live by and to keep yourself honest maybe write them down somewhere (read The 7 habits of highly successful people), sure. Quarterly goals with OKRs? Sorry that already doesn&#x27;t work at work as no higher up or HR person ever has used them for good if you ask me. Bringing that to my personal life? Lol? &#x27;Increase happiness of my family by 50% in Q1 2021&#x27;? Well duh, I don&#x27;t need OKRs to know Covid sucks and I should try to make the kids life as normal and happy as I can without trying to even measure happiness. I had no personal OKRs ever and I built a tobogganing hill in the front yard (the slope helps) and I&#x27;m working on the skating ring (yes ring, like circles, not hockey rink :)) in the backyard. Yes I was keeping this in my head just fine.')
