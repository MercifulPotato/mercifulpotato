I find the command chaining and assertion queuing to be very unintuitive. (“Do I chain this one or not? Maybe stick it in a callback? No idea!”)<p>It’s been a few months since I’ve touched it, so I’m struggling to give more specific criticisms.<p>I’ve had a really great time using Kent Dodd’s DOM Testing Library [1] for unit tests. The readability and writability of these tests has been fantastic. I wish I could use the exact same API for e2e tests. It looks like they actually do have a Cypress version of the Testing Library [2], but it seems to suffer from the same Cypress-isms that I was just complaining about.<p>Has anyone else had a similar experience? It seems like I’m in the minority opinion. Maybe I’m just bothered because I don’t understand Cypress well.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;testing-library.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;dom-testing-library&#x2F;intro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;testing-library.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;dom-testing-library&#x2F;intro</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;testing-library.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;cypress-testing-library&#x2F;intro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;testing-library.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;cypress-testing-library&#x2F;int...</a>')
