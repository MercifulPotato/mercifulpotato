Item(by='sinker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601844035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24676987, text='Colleges are one of the few structures where the normal relationship between a provider and a customer is inverted such that it would appear that the person paying for the service is under the obligation to perform for the person receiving the payment.<p>To give an example. The student is the customer, paying 30k a semester, yet if they go into the bursar to get some record corrected they are treated as if they are the hindrance in the system by way of long lines and apathetic clerks.<p>Another example: a student comes into class 10 minutes late each day because the class overlaps with his job. The professor or TA reprimands the student for essentially putting their needs first, despite the fact that the student is almost directly paying the professor&#x27;s salary.<p>Another example: student falls asleep in class. Professor stops the class to embarrass the student.<p>In all these cases it&#x27;s as if the professor is paying the student to be apart of the school and the obligation of performance is on the student.<p>In reality, the institutional responsibility of providing value should be on the professor and university. The individual responsibility of performance should be on the student. And yet the roles are the same as if a college were a public school, as if the professor and the school does not have a strong and direct responsibility to their customers&#x2F;patrons. That it were the student&#x27;s responsibility to validate the school and teacher.<p>Schools really are a &quot;unique&quot; form of business. The virus has uncovered what a lot of us knew all along; mainly that they don&#x27;t provide the value even remotely close to what their price tag suggests. They perpetuate because their customers are essentially still children, people being routed in society by society, and have not had the experience of having any real, consequential responsibility in the world. People who don&#x27;t need to perform any cost-benefit analysis because the decision is already made for them and the cost is usually hoisted onto someone else. Otherwise, few sane and independent people would willingly enter into a contract where you pay so much to be treated like an agent-less underling.<p>Like a lot of large organizations, universities exist so that they continue to exist. It&#x27;s foolish to think that they have the interests of individuals in mind.<p>Or so at least that has been my regretful experience excitedly waiting to be spit out of high school to learn the depths of programming in a place that sincerely respects learning, and instead spending 4 years in yet another purgatory to the real world.<p>At least I never have to hear the words again <i>is this going to be on the final?</i>')
