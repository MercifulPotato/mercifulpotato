A jazz blues would also (usually) be characterized by a walking bass and lack of a backbeat on the drums. Thelonious Monk’s “Blue Monk” is an example with pretty standard blues changes.<p>That being said, there are infinite variations of blues chord progressions in the jazz canon. Some great examples are Charles Mingus’s “Goodbye Pork Pie Hat,” and “Nostalgia in Times Square.”<p>Then you have examples that are closer to standard blues but with a few substitutions, like Joe Henderson’s “Isotope.”')
