Item(by='jokethrowaway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609854509, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25645217, text='I agree UK services are ahead of other countries I&#x27;ve experienced but they are still terrible in my experience.\nThat said I know very well some contractors that worked on gov.uk and they&#x27;re top notch. That&#x27;s probably were the technical excellence come from. The bureaucracy and process are the problems.<p>They&#x27;re much worse than any UK private company or UK bank I had to work with.<p>HMRC is terrible, there are tons of error on the payslips, they mess up tax codes all the times, part of the website uses a previous UI and not the cool modern one, several functions need you to call and queue for 1hr or send letters and hope.\nHaving an accountant helps as they have access to a special version of HMRC they can use to do things mere mortals can&#x27;t.<p>Childcare services are embarrassing and require you to have a subaccount in your governments account.\nI&#x27;ve spent 3 months without access because they asked me security questions for the childcare service on HMRC; I provided HMRC security answers and got locked out; the procedure to restore the account involved verifying my identity by providing via email certified copy of various documents. They were extremely slow in replying (sometimes not replying at all), they never returned any copies or originals I sent and they were extremely picky about certifications so I ended up having to send 3-4 certified and original documents.')
