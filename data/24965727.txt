It has reactivity, unidirectional data flow, pristinely pure functions, interceptors, <i>coeffects</i>, conveyor belts, <i>algebraic effects</i>, statechart-friendliness and claims an immaculate hammock conception.<p>Also, this page of documentation calls out effects <i>and</i> coeffects.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;day8.github.io&#x2F;re-frame&#x2F;EffectfulHandlers&#x2F;#effects-and-coeffects" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;day8.github.io&#x2F;re-frame&#x2F;EffectfulHandlers&#x2F;#effects-a...</a><p>I&#x27;m not quite fluent enough in Clojure to follow the examples, but it does look quite cool.')
