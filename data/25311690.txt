Whether or not you believe the 2 week deadline is a hard and fast rule followed 100% of the time, Jeff never made that claim. 1 day is certainly unreasonable.<p>What makes you think they weren&#x27;t given the opportunity? We were told specifically they _were_ given an opportunity to revise, and instead, demanded HR(!?) provide attributed versions of any and all statements made by any colleagues regarding the paper (!??!!?), or they&#x27;d &#x27;work on setting an end date&#x27;<p>I&#x27;m not exactly proud, excited, or anything but pensive about this series of developments, and it&#x27;s _highly_ likely Jeff feels the same way. Everything got too hostile and out of control here for people to be able to work together healthily moving forward, and I&#x27;m skeptical of anything beyond that being anything more than people attaching a narrative to an unfortunate breakdown in a relationship.')
