But there is a difference between valid and consistent&#x2F;backward-compatible. Microsoft goes out of their way to be backward-compatible (but doesn&#x27;t always succeed, of course) and Linus (some guy who wrote some hobby OS, that won&#x27;t be &quot;big or professional like gnu&quot;) is very adamant not to break user space if not strictly necessary and unavoidable.<p>To me, it looks like Apple played fast and loose here, changing the expected behavior of something as fundamental as &quot;open&quot;, without even mentioning it anywhere (and if they didn&#x27;t even notice their changes would affect this behavior, that&#x27;s another problem).<p>A change like this does not just break PostgreSQL, dotnet (and thereby anything running on dotnet), VirtualBox, and whatever else was mentioned by name, it will break almost everything in subtle ways, because almost nobody ever implemented correct EINTR behavior in the context of these APIs.')
