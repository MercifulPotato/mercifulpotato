Lawn mowers didn&#x27;t get more dangerous. The level of danger hasn&#x27;t gotten worse in that one respect. The level of trust might have changed. The acceptance of risk might have changed. I don&#x27;t think that keeping my kid away from the lawn mower in order to protect them makes their life overall better or even safer.<p>Lawn mowers are dangerous.
