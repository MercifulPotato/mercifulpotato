I mean, sure, staff in our agency need to keep it around for some legacy apps that haven&#x27;t yet been migrated or replaced, but its being phased out and we&#x27;re not supporting it beyond making sure that we detect it and put up a banner explaining that its not supported for some of our current (internal and external) apps.')
