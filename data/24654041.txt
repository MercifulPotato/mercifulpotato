Item(by='andrewzah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601574779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24650420, text='The fact that tablature is ancient doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s great for &quot;learning the craft&quot; (in other words, understanding music theory). The age of a notation system is completely irrelevant when deciding what notation system to use, really.<p>Tablature (for guitar&#x2F;bass guitar, anyway) reduces note and rhythm information to merely a fret# on a string. This is perfectly fine for people who just want to play a song. I look at tabs sometimes for a quick reference since it&#x27;s just mentally easier than sheet music.<p>But if you want to start understanding the theory and relationships between those notes and chords to any meaningful degree, you really do need to start using sheet music. &quot;Fret #3 on the E string to Fret #3 on the A string&quot; doesn&#x27;t communicate information like &quot;G -&gt; C&quot; does (like the key center, the tonic, etc). It also doesn&#x27;t limit you to any specific section of the fretboard.<p>Sheet music is really not that hard to learn. If you want to just use tabs, go ahead, but it&#x27;s not elitist to point out that sheet music is basically essential for progression as a musician. Music theory is a fundamental part of that progression, unless you just want to play tablature (or sheet music) robotically.')
