I took CS after high-school for pragmatic reasons.<p>I spent 5 years in school, got several degrees including an MSc in Computer Science. And I have been working professionally as a developer &#x2F; &quot;software engineer&quot; (big air-quotes) for the past 5 years.<p>I&#x27;m in my (very) late 20s and I can&#x27;t imagine doing this for the rest of my life. But the only other path seems to be management right now. And that sounds even worse.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m stuck on this path, and stepping out would mean financial ruin. I&#x27;m based in Europe, so my salary has been pretty modest.<p>Is this a regular 30s-life-crises? Did you have similar doubts at this point of your career&#x2F;life? What did you do?')
