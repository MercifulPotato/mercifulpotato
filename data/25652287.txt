They don&#x27;t want people&#x27;s data made public, either. Rather, they&#x27;re OK with the fact that policy can&#x27;t be made, because they&#x27;re not especially interested in the policy implications.<p>They likely assume that any regulation will be bad by default unless it&#x27;s proven to them -- and won&#x27;t put any effort into reading that proof when offered.<p>Software engineers get used to the notion that things either work or they don&#x27;t. Policy is a much messier process, where you do the best that you can with incomplete information. And software engineers are generally comfortable enough under the status quo that they will set high standards for change -- and aren&#x27;t interested in how that affects anybody not in their immediate circle.')
