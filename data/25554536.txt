For comparison, it looks like installation on a house costs about $2500&#x2F;kw [3].<p>It&#x27;s no short-term thing, but it&#x27;s the kind of thing that I might get to see in my lifetime. And it&#x27;s certainly something that should get engineers excited, even if it&#x27;s just considering what&#x27;s theoretically possible.<p>Also, as the 2nd video notes, though it does send more heat through to earth, it&#x27;s trivial in comparison to greenhouse effects, which are the kind of things this could mitigate, not just by cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions, but by providing enough cheap energy to make carbon capture feasible.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inverse.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;60712-spacex-starship-elon-musk-outlines-cost-for-launches" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inverse.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;60712-spacex-starship-elon-m...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spectrolab.com&#x2F;DataSheets&#x2F;Panel&#x2F;panels.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spectrolab.com&#x2F;DataSheets&#x2F;Panel&#x2F;panels.pdf</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modernize.com&#x2F;solar&#x2F;panel-cost-calculator#:~:text=Solar%20panel%20installation%20costs%20around,%2424%2C552%20in%20total%20installation%20costs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modernize.com&#x2F;solar&#x2F;panel-cost-calculator#:~:text=So...</a>.')
