When most of the personal Overton Windows approximately align on a particular topic, then we have <i>society&#x27;s</i> Overton Window.<p>For example, think about gay marriage.  50 years ago, maybe even 20, 95% of society thought that gay marriage was clearly not acceptable.  That meant that 95% of society agreed with 95% of society&#x27;s personal Overton Windows on the topic, and so we had a clear society-wide Overton Window.<p>Now we have maybe 30% of people who still think that gay marriage is clearly not acceptable.  We also have 40% who think that gay marriage is <i>clearly</i> in bounds.  Of those, maybe half (so 20% of the population) think any doubts about gay marriage are clearly unacceptable.  There is no position which a large majority of society finds acceptable.  (All numbers made up, but I think they&#x27;re in the approximate neighborhood.)<p>The society-wide Overton Window didn&#x27;t move.  It shattered.')
