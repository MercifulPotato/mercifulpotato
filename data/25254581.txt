Anyone remember their originals, that were basically balls of fusion fire, cooked in lard, and came with a defibrillator?<p>There&#x27;s a quote from one of the most significant works of Polish literature (Dziady - Forefathers&#x27; Eve), which goes more or less like this(source: Wikipedia - doesn&#x27;t appear to be taken from the official translation):<p><i>Our nation is like lava. On the top it is hard and hideous, but its internal fire cannot be extinguished even in one hundred years of coldness. So let&#x27;s spit on the crust and go down, to the profundity!</i><p>Replace &quot;nation&quot; with &quot;apple pie&quot; and it makes for an accurate description.')
