Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604495792, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988585, text='I agree with the premise but the fundamental question is whether we can get from the current status quo to a hypothetical sustainable equilibrium without the squeeze of climate change causing a ton of pain along the way and in a manner that is at least kinda sorta ethically tolerable (i.e. genocide and&#x2F;or picking who gets to reproduce are not options on the table).<p>The developing world population growth is peaking soon or looks to be.  But standards of living growth there is exploding so their impact will peak at some unknown point in the future.  The already developed world is staying roughly static in terms of population and environmental impact per person is declining slowly there.  To use a metaphor, it&#x27;s like we&#x27;ve got a half full bucket, are very slowly siphoning out water and are also half way through rapidly pouring in an unknown amount of water.  Will it overflow?  Nobody knows.  It would be prudent to try to remove more water and pour in less though.<p>Edit: Anyone care to tell me why I&#x27;m so wrong?  Is genocide back on the table or are people just annoyed that this is a hard problem with no shovel ready silver bullet?')
