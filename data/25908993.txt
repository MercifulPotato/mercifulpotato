(Moreover this doesn&#x27;t account for the major improvements in new housing stock, such as fire safety, attached garages, swimming pools, high ceilings, central A&#x2F;C, high-capacity electrical circuits, etc.) The median cost of housing has only gone up, because consumers have demanded substantially larger homes.<p>And this ignores the fact that mortgage rates are substantially lower than historical averages. Even accounting for our bigger, nicer homes, the percent of expenitures on shelter has barely budged from 18.7% in 2000 to 19.1% in 2019.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cex&#x2F;2019&#x2F;combined&#x2F;age.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cex&#x2F;2019&#x2F;combined&#x2F;age.pdf</a>\n[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;682549&#x2F;average-price-per-square-foot-in-new-single-family-houses-usa&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;682549&#x2F;average-price-per...</a>\n[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cex&#x2F;2005&#x2F;standard&#x2F;multiyr.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cex&#x2F;2005&#x2F;standard&#x2F;multiyr.pdf</a>')
