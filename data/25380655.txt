I don&#x27;t know off the top of my head that they are consumptive relative to any given metric, but it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that they are, considering how almonds &quot;work&quot; and how much they are produced in CA.<p>Especially since you compared against wine.  Wine can be extremely drought tolerant; there are wine fields in california that are only watered for the first season of growth and the remaining productive years are sustained by waters from the local aquifers (rainfall).')
