If the state forces the families to send their kids to factories, then that&#x27;s a failure of the state. China being China, there&#x27;s no surprise there.<p>Nobody is asking for the people themselves to starve, or blaming those forced to work in factories. Every one here is calling out the Chinese government for enabling such an environment where it&#x27;s either starvation or bust, or Apple for effectively funding that environment. Seems like that&#x27;s a difference you simply can&#x27;t grasp, or you disingenuously don&#x27;t want to.<p>It&#x27;s not a Western mindset btw, it&#x27;s the policy that has been working in a number of countries including most recently Bangladesh and Indonesia.')
