The alternative that has worked a lot better for me, in repos that use Bazel, is Bazel external repositories (using git_repository or http_archive). A more direct replacement that I hear is better is git subtree although I haven&#x27;t used it.<p>Also, you&#x27;re probably already doing this, but make sure you&#x27;re running Git on an SSD! Spinning rust will slow down VCS workloads, which are disk intensive, considerably.')
