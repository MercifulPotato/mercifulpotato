A computer can only do what the apps installed on it let you do, unless you&#x27;re an IT person.<p>The things is that you don&#x27;t need to be an IT person to use applications, as it used to be. So fewer people learn IT skills just so they can play a game or layout a document.<p>I know very little about cars but drive one daily. I can see how other people don&#x27;t bother learning about computers just so they can write up a report for their job or order stuff on Amazon.<p>I like your poetic description of general-purpose computers.
