Taleb has a line about college being the closest thing to a natural social state in the Western world. I think our brains feel comfortable in some sort of regular, persistent social milieu, particularly one formed by close friends&#x2F;family. We expect some sort of tribe to be around us. That doesn&#x27;t mean some of us aren&#x27;t introverts—I definitely am one—but as I get older the absence of my friend group constantly there in the background is really painful.')
