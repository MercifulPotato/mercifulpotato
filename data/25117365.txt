The US, sadly, has none of that.<p>Also, Sweden did have a few restrictions in place. They shut down high schools and universities, and strongly encouraged WFH if possible. Arguably, most of red state US had even looser restrictions than that.<p>HN&#x27;s perspective on lockdowns might be skewed by the fact that most of us here live in places that actually did have a good faith reasonable response to COVID, but it didn&#x27;t really work in the absence of a coordinated nationwide response.')
