I checked near some Apple commuter stations (where they presumably have employees living and actively using the service &#x2F; have access to good data) and noticed it was missing entire parks and roads.<p>The situation on other countries is much worse though. Some countries are missing entire islands. In Mongolia, they don&#x27;t have province (aimag) borders, and some provinces are even missing labels for their capitals! Worse, there&#x27;s sparse recognition of district (sum) labels, but some of them seem to have recognized the sum centers as distinct towns, butchered the transliteration, and then marked them before the aimag capital, as happened with &quot;Hovsgol&quot; (Khövsgöl), Dornogovi.')
