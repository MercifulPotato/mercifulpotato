Over the past months&#x2F;years, I&#x27;ve read many a comment here insisting that whatever Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;etcetera allow or don&#x27;t allow in their platforms is absolutely not censorship[1]... But a significant amount of the comments in this post are saying that this move is &quot;fighting censorship with more censorship&quot;, which is, by itself, tacitly saying that what the social media companies do is indeed censorship.<p>For the record, I don&#x27;t think that twitter or facebook banning&#x2F;blocking whatever they want is censorship[2], legally speaking... And neither is this, for the same reasons.<p>[1]: And some others who don&#x27;t care and go as far as to say that censorship is okay and free speech doesn&#x27;t work, among other things.<p>[2]: Unethical, manipulative, a betrayal of the spirit if not the law of &quot;free speech&quot;? Totally, but still not censorship.')
