I&#x27;ve since switched to Scrivener, mostly for the general convenience it offers and especially the mobile apps and syncing, but there is a lot about that old workflow that I miss. It&#x27;s really convenient to have everything in a single buffer optimized for keyboard-only navigation, and with Pandoc there aren&#x27;t really any concerns around exporting to .docx.<p>I absolutely hate WYSIWYG editing when I&#x27;m writing fiction, because it&#x27;s totally unnecessary and only serves to muddy the waters when it&#x27;s time to export the text, e.g. if some of the devices I was editing on were set to use smart quotes and some weren&#x27;t. The text of a typical novel doesn&#x27;t have much going on besides chapters, sections, and paragraphs, so Markdown really has everything you need, and for fancier formatting (like the side-by-side verse paragraphs in <i>Stand on Zanzibar</i>, just to name one example off the top of my head) I get the feeling that Scrivener isn&#x27;t really flexible enough. There are better tools, like Vellum, and I think traditional rich text editing exists in a sort of uncomfortable middle ground where it offers just enough functionality to get in the way.<p>But obviously installing and using a command-line utility like Pandoc is not something the typical author can really be expected to do, so they&#x27;re stuck using the standard industry-favorite tools that do it all from a GUI.')
