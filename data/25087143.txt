This is not the only framework. Furthermore I think the rights framework does not provide any arguments in its favor, it simply denies rights to animals.<p>Do not focus on rights; I am not arguing for &quot;rights&quot; for animals. Ask yourself about whether pain matters to sentient beings. Whether animals are sentient. And reflect on whether you are able to decrease your financial contribution to a system that abuses animals.<p>The analogy was meant to show that the format of the response is problematic when stated about something we <i>now</i> agree is morally problematic (slavery). I am nudging readers of my comment to reflect whether in 50 years we will consider abusing animals as morally problematic as well (note: I am not arguing about degree of wrongness here).')
