Packages are so outdated and Debian is so unfriendly and clunky. Like a worse Ubuntu.<p>IME, Manjaro&#x2F;Arch unironically provide a better, less buggy experience. Maybe the bugfixes come in faster than the bugs and the devs pay most of their attention to current versions.<p>And more anecdata: I wouldn&#x27;t say scripts to fix your resolution are &quot;common&quot; pains on Linux. (Though crashes on Cinnamon are ;p -- stick to KDE or GNOME if you want polish.) The closest I&#x27;ve come to that lately was having to reset the sound daemon due to a Manjaro bug, but that&#x27;s the only thing in <i>two years</i> I&#x27;ve had to do. Meanwhile, on Windows, the internet dies when I turn my VPN off (the same VPN I use on Linux, at that). And, for that, the scriptable solution&#x27;s more elusive. &quot;Reinstall and pray&quot; is the only way to go.')
