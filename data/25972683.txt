Lightning rarely stricks twice, and unless he has a history of these sorts of moves who knows if he&#x27;ll have a pick like this again.<p>Also, the money would have to be <i>reallly</i> good considering he&#x27;s by-far set for life after this.<p>My biggest concern for him at this point is that he&#x27;ll get dragged in to investigations regarding this. I agree with you that <i>he specifically</i> doesn&#x27;t seem to have done anything wrong. I don&#x27;t think he even ever said &quot;You should do this&quot;, or insinuated that others should; it was just a &quot;This is what I&#x27;m doing and here are my reasons why&quot;.<p>I hope the next couple years of his life aren&#x27;t an absolute shit-show dealing with fallout of being the most &quot;high profile&quot; name (so far).')
