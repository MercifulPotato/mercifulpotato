Item(by='NikolaNovak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607373979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25324952, text='Fair, but I did not read the parent post I replied to as <i>whether</i> hashtagging&#x2F;self-promotion is effective&#x2F;positive or ineffective&#x2F;negative.<p>I read it as: &quot;Assuming hashtagging and self-promotion on LinkedIn was effective, I <i>still</i> would not do it no matter the money&quot;, and that&#x27;s the interpretation I replied to - perhaps erroneously.<p>In a broader discussion - it&#x27;s all about the fit. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a single advice, action, characteristic, attribute, or effort, that won&#x27;t increase your chances with X% of employers&#x2F;recruiters&#x2F;HR and decrease your chances with Y% of employers&#x2F;recruiters&#x2F;HR.<p>[FWIW, I personally have Linked In, it&#x27;s my online resume, but I don&#x27;t interact with platform in any other manner; Self-promoting posts are indeed a turn-off for me personally - but I&#x27;m neither actively seeking a new job nor promoting my business, so it&#x27;d be a bit of dishonest to claim that situational personal preference for a larger truth :]')
