You can think of training a bit like the source code and inference a bit like running the compiled binary. The different frameworks have their own serialization formats for their model weights.<p>If the goal is to do inference using CoreML weights trained in CreateML on non-Apple platforms (eg on a server or android device), converting them to ONNX is a way to do that.<p>You probably won’t be able to pick up training on another framework though.')
