As any therapist will tell you, working through frustrations and integrating negative experiences instead of bottling them up is crucial.<p>This is something I already struggled with prior to COVID, and I&#x27;ve been seeing a therapist for years now for this (and many other) reasons.<p>The thing about bottling things up is that it kind of &quot;works&quot; for awhile. Until it doesn&#x27;t.<p>So we probably haven&#x27;t even started to see the longer term impact this will have over time.')
