If Lyft pays more than Uber, Uber doesn&#x27;t stop IC from accepting Lyft rate instead of Uber.<p>If I as an IC want to charge $100&#x2F;hr for taxi rides, it doesn&#x27;t mean any client has to take me up on that. And a client can have a policy of paying all IC taxi drivers X rate. What&#x27;s wrong with that?')
