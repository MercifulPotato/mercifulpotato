Doubly so for for a drug that the establishment doesn&#x27;t have much experience with, and therefore won&#x27;t necessarily recommend.<p>Our current healthcare system is a disgrace of paternalism and bureaucracy, amounting to a constructive denial of care. If anything many more drugs need to be made available directly over the counter - a consultation with the pharmacist should be enough.<p>I&#x27;ve arrived at these conclusions even with most of the costs being covered by Medicare (family member), good relationships with providers, intelligence&#x2F;bandwidth to understand what they do, and now free telehealth visits. I can&#x27;t even imagine the financial-bureaucratic world of pain for people on private &quot;insurance&quot; (or even worse, without) trying to get care for themselves while the system just milks them.')
