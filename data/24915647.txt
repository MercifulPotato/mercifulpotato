How does anyone know which supplier actually supplied X among Amazon&#x27;s swath of caches?  As a consumer, how do I know that when I buy from one FBA retailer on Amazon, the stock wasn&#x27;t actually sourced by another that&#x27;s also in that program?<p>The lack of transparency, the lack of the consumer (and presumably also retailers) being able to trace these products back to their source of manufacture is the issue.  Keep the records that need to be kept, let tracking figure out if there are customers returning bad items, or fraudulent suppliers, or just a run of bad product that had a given lot code.')
