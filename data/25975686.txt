Several times I said that I felt wonderful and amazing, and that I was not allowed to go looking for this stuff again for at <i>least</i> a year, as I could see how it could get addictive.<p>This was something like fifteen years ago and I still haven’t had any urge to hunt down more. If I need it badly enough I figure it will show up in my life again.<p>(Also it was at a furry con, which I guess is kind of a weird and magical space for most people; it was far from my first one, and there’s a strong component of work to them for me as I’m an artist who spends most of them hanging out behind a table drawing stuff!)')
