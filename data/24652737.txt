Our mission is to help communities rebuild after natural disasters such as the recent wildfires in California, Oregon, and Washington which have unfortunately destroyed thousands of homes.  We primarily build single family homes in Northern &amp; Southern California along with the technology to make the home building process more modern, transparent, affordable, and rapid.  We were founded after the Tubbs Fire [2] which destroyed thousands of homes in Sonoma, Napa, and Lake County, and threatened our CEO&#x27;s home [3], and are deeply connected to the mission.<p>The challenge and opportunity for engineers at Homebound is to build delightful experiences for a range of different types of users -- from homeowners to construction professionals.  We are still a small (&lt;15) engineering team and are looking for key contributors who have both strong skills and also a passion for establishing best practices for our future Homebound teammates.  We are dedicating to building a team based around three principals: community, craftsmanship, and communication.  Finally, we are backed by world-class investors and led by experienced software and construction executives.<p>We&#x27;d love to connect with mission-driven, quality-oriented engineers and engineering managers who err on the side of over-communication.
