It can save you time, because it can prevent lots of unintentional errors over time (e.g. you might not notice when you get an incorrect result after an incremental build).<p>In my opinion, this is a bit similar to languages with static vs dynamic typing.<p>If your current setup works well for you, it makes sense to keep it, though.')
