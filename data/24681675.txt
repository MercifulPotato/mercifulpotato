However, there&#x27;s no reason for the quotes around &quot;incorrect&quot; if you take my quote out of context. I specified that they would be considered incorrect by these native English speakers (if the intended meaning is what is listed here), if not just grammatically incorrect. I&#x27;m not claiming that there exists inherently correct or incorrect grammar.')
