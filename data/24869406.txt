I&#x27;m kind of confused as to why that would be an issue. But happy to hear more about it.<p>&gt; If there&#x27;s a cap on hours, you&#x27;ve now got a competing interest which says there&#x27;s an incentive to NOT work while the market isn&#x27;t surging- because you might cost yourself greater earnings down the line.<p>Ok so then is the cap 8 hours? 10? Is it 7? It seems to me that you&#x27;re inventing more problems to solve a different problem than is worthwhile. You can have more drivers doing less hours, if the economics of it work (and neither of us know whether or not it does, and ironically enough I doubt the State of California does either). The point isn&#x27;t to move goal posts around a set number of hours, the point is to illustrate that is exactly what you&#x27;re advocating for.')
