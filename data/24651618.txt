The color&#x27;s not real, the filled in scratches aren&#x27;t real, and once upon a time a photographer sat and composed the shot in the first place.  It&#x27;s an artist illustration of history.  Which is fine, those are important to have.  But it&#x27;s too easy to forget that it&#x27;s not reality.<p>As the production value of video gets better (in general, not just historical film), people forget the little bit of McLuhan they once half-understood.  And the more time we spending looking at screens, the more we WANT to forget that the pictures on the screen don&#x27;t reflect reality.  For example: go tweet what you really think about the world. About politics, about sex, about all the white lies we tell eachother to keep society functioning.  Don&#x27;t want to? OK, now ask yourself why you treat anything you read as less artificially constrained than what you, a relative nobody, are willing to tweet.')
