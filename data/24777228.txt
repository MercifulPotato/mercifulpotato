The principle is simply that <i>there is an inherent complexity to any construct</i>, and, that <i>the burden of complexity can be shifted to optimal domains</i>.<p>As an analog, consider analysis of harmonic systems. A complex wave form in time-domain, vs the same signal considered in frequency-domain, via Fourier Transforms.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fourier_transform" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fourier_transform</a><p>(So, here, quite a lot of the time-domain complexity is handled by very complex mathematical machinery that supports FT. The new picture in frequency domain is “simple”, but the FT machinery is hardly that. The <i>total</i> system complexity is asserted to be equivalent.)<p>The name of the game with complexity is to shift the burden of complexity to a capability domain that is within one’s reach.')
