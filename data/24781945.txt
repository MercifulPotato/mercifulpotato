Censorship has been going on for years but the blatant covid-powered covert misinformation along with the blatant suppression of competitors might finally turn off enough people away from them. I always though of them as the continuation of reality-show  trash TV , which always had an audience but nowhere near to the proportions it has today (even if it&#x27;s dressed up with makeup and ironed suits). If people learn to finally shut up and listen instead of shouting it will be a good thing for public life. Or they may just realize there&#x27;s no way to agree and everyone goes their own way. Both are better than a fruitless stalemate.<p>(easy with the flagging guys. half the comments here are flagged. You re supposed to flag spam not anything that you wish wasnt there. wishful thinking isnt gonna help your cause)')
