It will be better for you in the long run.  Being fired doesn&#x27;t have major negative connotations like prior generations dealt with, but it also doesn&#x27;t come with great benefits.  Also unemployment can be more difficult if you don&#x27;t have 12 months or prior employment in the state (across all employers).  Check out the state rules if you are seriously thinking of going the &quot;fired&quot; route and understand the benefits.  You most likely will get a tiny percentage of your annual salary and it won&#x27;t be worth it.<p>One point, they are being douche bags in this scenario if the only fact is a company asking for a degree and dropping you because of it.  When I had my consultancy we would occasionally have clients make a stupid demand about degrees and we always found ways around it.  Many times it is a company &quot;vendor manager&quot; going down a checklist and once you challenge it they just skip it.  We even had some government work that dropped it once we challenged it (mostly), in one case they just said we needed people in certain rolls to prove education which those made sense for what they were doing, but none were software&#x2F;data people.  I guess my point saying all that is to say make sure you are seeing&#x2F;hearing the true facts and not just taking someone&#x27;s excuse, cause if you need to improve in some way that is important to know.<p>Good Luck!<p>*edit - removed a word')
