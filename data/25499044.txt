Right now if you use React for SSG in popular frameworks, loads of static content is duplicated in client bundles even though it’s completely useless for the client experience.<p>They cover some of this in the RFC. But I’ll use a site I’m working on as an example. There’s currently very little interactive content on the site, nearly everything is just Markdown content rendered to HTML and styled with CSS. But Next.js doesn’t know it’s static and sends it all <i>again</i> as React (well, Preact for my site) components. This doubles the weight of my pages on the wire, not to mention the performance impact of hydrating that static content.<p>I’ve been looking for weeks for a way to do what Server Components is doing, because while I love JSX for dev, that’s a really awful UX to foist on readers. There’s some prior art (search for Preact partial hydration if you’re interested), but it’s all very complex to set up. Having a first party reference solution will raise the bar significantly.')
