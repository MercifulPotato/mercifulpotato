A problem was identified during an inspection on Dec 10th:<p>&gt; When the pump of the cooling system was stopped, one of the valves was broken. For this reason, the repair work took longer than planned, about two hours. During the prolonged repair work, hot process water was able to enter backwards longer than planned into the filters of the cleaning system of the reactor due to a difference in pressure.<p>&gt; the heated up water dissolved substances from the filter into the reactor water. The substances were activated as they passed through the reactor core. Consequently, the activity levels (radiation levels) of the steam moving through the main steam lines momentarily rose to about 3 to 4 times higher compared with the normal activity level.<p>Elevated radiation levels require an explanation and this clear and timely communication fits the bill. Three Mile Island [2] has taught us that the pipes, pumps, valves, and gauges making up the mundane plumbing in the system can fail and have cascading effects. Kudos to the operator for their transparency.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Olkiluoto_Nuclear_Power_Plant" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Olkiluoto_Nuclear_Power_Plant</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Three_Mile_Island_accident" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Three_Mile_Island_accident</a>')
