We have a severely short supply of vaccines. If we use market allocation, who do you think will end up with all existing supply? The highest bidder! Rich people and institutions will buy this supply for months, to use it on people who are already well protected due to their economic status. First responders, especially in poor neighborhoods, will be lacking access and dying for several months. Moreover, if there is no government mandate for mass production and distribution, price-points may end up in a place where the poorest will never be able to afford the vaccine.')
