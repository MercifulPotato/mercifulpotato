On top of that, Merkel voted against that law in the German parliament (Bundestag)<p>&gt; Accepted a large number of refugees from war-torn Syria<p>Since Syria is closer to Europe than to the US this is not surprising, the US accepts asylum from middle and south America instead.<p>&gt; Cut taxes (Solidaritätszuschlag) for the working class and middle class, while keeping them in place for the upper class<p>Sounds like the tax reform of 2017<p>&gt; If you did one of these things in the US, you would be considered a progressive leftist. Doing all of them would make you a radical. In Germany she is still considered center-right.<p>-&gt; While this is a nice visualization, the author had no idea about US politics and how it contrasts to German politics')
