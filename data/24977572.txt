The difference between cell types is in what sections are functionally expressed (made into proteins that do their work). This is determined by a multitude of factors.<p>Cancer cells typically have mutations, even just single base pair changes, which change the way that genes are expressed in the cell and thereby influence such behavior.<p>The original functions of the B cell aren&#x27;t necessarily needed for other cell types to exhibit similar functions. The base plan is there, it just needs a nudge.')
