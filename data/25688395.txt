Obviously you want to sell your bitcoin, but also postulate that you don&#x27;t have a connection to a real bank (KYC and all that), so you can&#x27;t actually turn your Bitcoins into dollars. So you sell your Bitcoins for Tethers. Then Bitcoin goes down, and eventually you buy them back using Tethers.')
