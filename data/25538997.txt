I know this because I frustratingly have to add !g to queries all the time lately and I’m questioning my choice to default to DDG.<p>That said, I don’t like being tracked. It’s not clear to me if the quality of results I am seeing are due to Google’s tracking or not. (I suppose I could research this but I’ve not done so.)')
