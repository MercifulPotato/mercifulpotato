Would they look at the same topics, e.g. would you get sildenafil from universities, or would they concentrate on &quot;the important problems&quot; and not serve the markets that customers <i>also</i> want?<p>Profit is a very strong incentive, and it also allows customers to have a vote in what gets researched. I&#x27;m not convinced that a more centralized research system delivers at the same level, especially in the long run. It&#x27;s hard to judge, of course, because we can&#x27;t run perfect simulations and e.g. look at the monopolies in telecommunication and compare them with a market in the same time and under similar circumstances, but it suggests that monopolies aren&#x27;t that helpful to R&amp;D. You could argue that the universities would compete, but either funding would be based on output (in which case the universities would just replace the pharma companies), or it wouldn&#x27;t be (in which case they wouldn&#x27;t really compete).<p>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the pharma industry, but I&#x27;m not convinced a system that doesn&#x27;t incentivize research success can deliver the same.')
