But I don’t see much difference in the letter with who she was. She s just saying goodbye and ask for redemption as any catholic would. I don’t agree with the article who tries to focus on her personality and manner. She was wether she liked it out not a ruler, the French did not kill her and the king because of their manners and their personality (the king was a nice guy too) They did because of the course of history and because so many were suffering at the time and a greater effort was asked from them (paying debt &#x2F; while Marie Antoinette kept burning cash)<p>It was awful and bloody and many revolutionary were awful people uneducated and prompt to bloodbath. But it soon inspired so many nations to move towards democracy that sometimes if not always history shows that awful people can build great things (pirates in New York etc..)<p>I remember she hated Lafayette for example to put some USA perspective she must have hated Washington too.<p>Rulers should be judged indeed on victory or defeat this current fashion of looking back at history to say individuals had good or bad personalities is dangerously capable of transforming the worst people into adorable ones.<p>Her story is the story of the Romanov in Russia or the Shah in Iran. People who loved to party and who had great education would be people\nYou would love to hang out with today for sure.<p>But they did so while their own people were on the verge of collapsing... I don’t see a parallel with Hillary neither, if Hillary was burning millions of dollars when her husband was in power and partying all the time in the poorest city with people dying in the street then you would have had Marie Antoinette but Hillary acted as a ruler and worked hard to help her country (wether you like her politics or not)')
