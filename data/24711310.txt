Deciding to ignore advances because it would &quot;unfairly centralize in somethinf other than us&quot; tends to lead to no longer existing and either a subordinate replacing the leader in a coup and moderated because the other see that insisting on charging massed rifle instead of adopting them is a losing strategy or sticking to it and letting reality assert its brutal toll. Knowledge is power can be literal and it not being something you personally can understand is not the same as &quot;nonsense&quot; or &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot;. The benefits of capital investment are real and clear and &quot;banning it&quot; won&#x27;t make things better, just the opposite really.')
