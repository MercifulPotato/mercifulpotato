Humans, weak passwords, and improperly configured ACL are often the common denominator in the majority of recent breaches, not the systems themselves. People get lazy and start overlooking well established protocols that could have prevented these attacks. It&#x27;s hard to do this right unless you hire red teams to perform monthly audits of every possible leakage or attack vector.')
