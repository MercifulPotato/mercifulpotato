The other thing to do, or that I did, was to use a variety of spices and herbs. Most add nothing (or very little) with regard to carbs (certainly not the processed sugars low-carb diets aim to avoid) so don&#x27;t impact the diet overall. And a well-stocked spice cabinet means you can have chicken for a week or even a month and never really have the same meal twice.')
