But that isn&#x27;t the primary reason India is lagging behind China, nor is it entirely because of a lack of free markets.<p>One excellent example would be solar power, India could pool its market capacity, technological ability and finance to have built up a huge ecosystem, but instead it went the route of importing everything, even as it goes about building some of the largest solar projects in the world.<p>The Chinese are wealthy because they would never let go of such a golden opportunity.')
