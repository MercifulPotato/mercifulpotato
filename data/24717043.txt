I love reddit as a way for getting my tech news, but there&#x27;s just so much about the platform that I don&#x27;t like which is becoming harder and harder to avoid. The communities I really enjoy (r&#x2F;cpp, r&#x2F;MachineLearning, r&#x2F;DataScience) are still for the most part wonderful communities and they provide killer feeds that let me stay up to date with everything. But it gets harder and harder to keep the political op-eds at bay, or as the author of this blog mentions, the fruitless arguments that don&#x27;t go anywhere.<p>I think HN has provided me with enough benefit through meeting people on the platform that I&#x27;m keeping it around, but the author makes great points nonetheless.')
