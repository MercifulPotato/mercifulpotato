If telcos were bidding about the same net present value for the one time auction and the rev-share auction, with their revenue projections and revenue came in higher, that&#x27;s going to be better for the government.<p>It&#x27;s also easier to bid higher in rev-share, because you don&#x27;t need to finance that net present value; it&#x27;s just going to be built into the price of service, and your competitors will likely have similar rev-shares (depending on the auction process), so it&#x27;s going to be built into everyone&#x27;s prices.<p>I think there&#x27;s also some value in a stream of payments rather than a one time payment. Although you can exchange one for the other with financial tools, a government may find a stream of payments to it matches well with the stream of payments it&#x27;s making.')
