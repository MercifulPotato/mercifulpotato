After 4 years back to college as an aerospace engineer student.  Graduated and then started the job jumping for 6 years because the jobs were boring.  At age 35 I became a firefighter - paramedic (did PM classes at night - the fire department trained me to be a FF).  About 4 years in to this career I saw a lot of people get injured, mainly with back injuries from repetitive, awkward positions so I decided to get a Master&#x27;s in Computer Science online from DePaul University.  It took me 5 years to complete.  I started working part-time remote as a programmer.<p>When Covid hit I decided that it was time to go and I found a full-time, remote programming job making good money.  I thoroughly enjoy it.  I still think FF-PM is the best job ever but with serious chronic health issues I couldn&#x27;t risk getting sick.  Also a constant sleep schedule is AWESOME!<p>I spent 14 years as FF-PM.  I am now 50 yo.  I don&#x27;t ever plan on retiring because I enjoy working and don&#x27;t really have any hobbies beyond reading and programming.  I do worry about being able to get a job when I&#x27;m older, but I&#x27;ll find something to do.')
