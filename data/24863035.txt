Why should I go to KeePassX or KeePassXC?<p>Their FAQs isn&#x27;t too convicing!<p>&gt; KeePass is a very proven and feature-rich password manager and there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it. However, it is written in C# and therefore requires Microsoft&#x27;s .NET platform. On systems other than Windows, you can run KeePass using the Mono runtime libraries, but you won&#x27;t get the native look and feel which you are used to.\nKeePassXC, on the other hand, is developed in C++ and runs natively on all platforms giving you the best-possible platform integration.')
