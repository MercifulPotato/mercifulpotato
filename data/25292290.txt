It&#x27;s &quot;My Latest Brush with the Corporate Internet: GitHub has My Stolen Code.&quot;<p>If a website, even one like GitHub that posts others&#x27; submissions, had something I felt was mine and I had to go through a complicated process to get them to remove it, an adversarial process no less, I would describe that as a &quot;brush.&quot;<p>If I felt that the process was made more difficult because the other party was a large corporation instead of a small group, and if I felt that there was a movement in the web in that direction, I would think it&#x27;s reasonable to label the party &quot;the corporate Internet.&quot; This kind of metaphor is certainly very common, where a journalist might label a practice by a company like like Facebook or Twitter as being done by &quot;social media&quot; writ large in spite of the fact that neither company is &quot;social media,&quot; per se, but more literally a single entity in the large area that goes by that name.<p>And the statement &quot;GitHub has My Stolen Code&quot; is a very literal bottom-line summary of the source of the writer&#x27;s contention. Its presence in the headline has the redeeming quality of removing the metaphor from the first half of the headline for readers who might want more specifics before they read the article.')
