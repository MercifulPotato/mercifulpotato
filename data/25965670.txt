The former number is confirmed by the FDA, while the latter is a press release (probably accurate, but they might be hiding something while would be used to make them look better).  The J&amp;J vaccine just isn&#x27;t as good.  It is good enough, but not as good.<p>Of course it is possible that the difference is because a vaccine resistant strain is running around now and so J&amp;J got unlucky by not starting their trails as soon.  However right now all the numbers we have say J&amp;J isn&#x27;t as good.  Good enough probably, but not as good.')
