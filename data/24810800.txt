An old version of jquery at that!?”<p>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time mentoring junior developers.<p>They don&#x27;t really care that you or your product are using jQuery. They&#x27;ve been told that using anything but the latest frameworks and technologies is a death sentence for their career. They aren&#x27;t interested in making your money printer go brrr for you. They&#x27;re interested in pivoting to that next higher paying job somewhere else with a resume full of React and ES6 and websockets and other complicated technologies.<p>It&#x27;s a difficult mindset to overcome. I try to emphasize that shipping product is better than simply knowing the right technologies.')
