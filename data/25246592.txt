In reality the perfect patient doesn&#x27;t exist, so if the statistics say that people on your drug experience an adverse outcome at significantly higher rates, it&#x27;s considered a side effect of the drug. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s because the patient skipped a dose. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re also obese, or alcoholic, or a PewDiePie fan. If we let the drug company explain away all of the bad outcomes as inadequate doctors and patients, then like magic, no drug would have side effects. What it comes down to is this: if N people are prescribed the drug, roughly N&#x2F;M people will experience these problems.<p>If advocates of non-drug interventions want them to be taken seriously, the same standard should apply. That goes for everything from meditation to psychotherapy to exercise. If you refuse to acknowledge the risks, why should you be entitled to recognition of the benefits?')
