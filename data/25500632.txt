Item(by='Arnavion', descendants=None, kids=[25500767, 25500759, 25502992, 25501287], score=None, time=1608590959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500027, text='I haven&#x27;t used pwsh in a few years, but does `ConvertTo-Json` still have that terrible `-Depth` parameter that you have to remember to set so that it doesn&#x27;t mangle your JSON? A quick web search indicates that it does.<p>Edit: Yes, it does.<p><pre><code>    &#x27;{ &quot;a&quot;: { &quot;b&quot;: { &quot;c&quot;: { &quot;d&quot;: { &quot;e&quot;: 5 } } } } }&#x27; | ConvertFrom-Json | ConvertTo-Json\n\n    {\n      &quot;a&quot;: {\n        &quot;b&quot;: {\n          &quot;c&quot;: &quot;@{d=}&quot;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSo you have to remember to set `-Depth 100` for every invocation of `ConvertTo-Json`. You also can&#x27;t set it higher because it has a hard-coded limit of 100, so hopefully you never deal with JSON that has more nesting than that.<p>Yeesh. I like PS, but this one commandlet&#x27;s design has always baffled me.')
