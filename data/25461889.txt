Men don&#x27;t get to choose whether to work or not. They can like it or lump it. If you told men they could stay at home all day spending someone else&#x27;s money improving the home, many would jump at the chance. The grass is always greener on the other side.<p>&gt; Women should have always been free to join the workforce<p>They were always free to join the workforce. Just like they are free to join men&#x27;s sporting events etc. The problem is now they are being <i>encouraged</i> to join the workforce. They are being indoctrinated into masculine roles from a very young age, fed through education and into the corporate machine. Then they get to 30, panic and realise they are running out of time to have children but they are trapped in the machine. Women&#x27;s happiness has only decreased.<p>Most women didn&#x27;t want this. Going to work sucks. The only people benefiting from this are the billionaires who are richer and more powerful than ever.')
