It’s truly amazing how much “detail” there is in every day scents.   Can smell food and describe accurately the spices used.  Also I can detect the tiniest amounts used from 20 feet away.  Shocking people that are using it and don’t even smell it.<p>My personal favorite is a woody car smell Hanger in the car caused me to instantly be jealous.  Not of anyone specific, but there is an intense primal feeling of someone after what’s mine.<p>Without migraine I don’t notice any of it.')
