Instead the call the portal to request the user to pick a folder (for projects) or file with a specific ending (the compatible file formats or if folders can be picked can be defined statically for most apps).<p>If the app was started with root privileges, it gets no root privs but the portal transparently translates it&#x27;s IO calls to the actual file.<p>But only that file. So even if the text editor had a CVE, it couldn&#x27;t overwrite arbitrary files, still needs permission from the user by showing them a file picker dialog.<p>And you could still ban certain directories, so even if you started as root, the text editor cannot access &#x2F;etc&#x2F;sudoers and &#x2F;etc&#x2F;passwd, for example.')
