Item(by='robocat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610997707, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25824437, text='&gt; probably near some ivy league schools or something.<p>I understand that feeling.<p>It took me a long time to discover that “intellectual” intelligence is only one small part of being smart. I now have friends that on first appearance (poorly educated, drifters, bimbos, pub drunks etcetera) look stupid but who have genius level skills in areas I am a complete moron (often subconscious or intuitive skills.)<p>I think it was Dunning-Kruger that clued me in - my eyes were open to looking for things in all people that <i>I</i> was unaware of.<p>Four examples where you should be able to name a person with a trait, and where you have shared enough time with them to learn from them:<p>* a room reader - they walk into a room and grok all the people within seconds.<p>* a next-level fashion dresser - it takes real intelligence and intuitiveness, and is an area many intelligent people are dismissive of. I’m not saying you should learn to dress well.<p>* a successful sociopath - this one is hard to find because they blend in. Worth knowing so you can recognise them, and protect yourself and others from their negative qualities.<p>* an intuitive - someone who just seems to solve social puzzles and see things that are “obvious” when they mention it. Humbling. They must be correct (many people say they are intuitive, but are instead Dunning-Kruger victims).<p>The trick is to start encouraging yourself to be fascinated by how others tick. A side-effect is that most people don’t get much attention, so when you have a deep interest in someone, they respond with friendship and caring.<p>Where are you unskilled and unaware of it?')
