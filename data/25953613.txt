At the end of the day, Facebook&#x2F;Discord has the power to ban individual users.  There is no good reason to nuke an entire community if the the mods running said community are being cooperative.  This isn&#x27;t about &quot;hate speech&quot; or &quot;adult sexual exploitation&quot; or whatever the excuse dice end up rolling next time.  This is a knee-jerk reaction from a platform with a ton of power and no incentive to wield it responsibly.')
