So adhering to SOLID principles leaves you with hopefully less of a mess. Usually each interface has each their own nuances, but also how to compose them in scope, processing sequences and time, may introduce complexity, side effects and additional workarounds, or frameworks.<p>Don&#x27;t just adhere to something blindly. Keep it as simple as possible and iterate on designs until they make practical sense. The focus is on concrete implementations and results.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s otherwise all opinion and fashion.<p>One such is that all abstractions comes with costs, and that they are usually just indirections and filters for the real thing. The word itself, is tough to communicate clearly and reason about. Ditto on refactoring, which doesn&#x27;t explain much as well.<p>Concretely, if you minimize dependencies, entanglement and compose a minimal solution well, it is easier to evolve the code later after learning more from practical experience and new ideas. So it&#x27;s often about waiting until the benefits clearly outweighs the costs of abstraction.')
