It is quite a complicated and energy-intensive process (collect the gases, compress&#x2F;liquify&#x2F;make supercritical, transport, convert P&#x2F;V&#x2F;T again, pump it down).<p>I know that the Norwegians (or perhaps various multinationals) have been doing this for decades, capturing CO2 at the source, at the Sleipner giant oil field in the North sea . But that is not a power plant.')
