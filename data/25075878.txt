My extension these days approaches 3000 users across Chrome&#x2F;Firefox, but only a fraction of those visit the donations link and send something. It just makes no sense to pay $99 to maybe get a few donations. I don&#x27;t want to make this a paid extension and then spend time and money on marketing and hope that maybe I will one day break even. I just want the extension to be available to users, that&#x27;s all!<p>Is that too much to ask?')
