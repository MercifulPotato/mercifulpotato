But in Apple Factories, no.<p>Also, the amount of questionable ethics by anyone doing this stuff overseas, and then to take the high road on Parler, seriously? I&#x27;ve always felt they were very hypocritical about this, they should stay mostly out of the &#x27;justice&#x27; campaigning other than in their own direct sphere.')
