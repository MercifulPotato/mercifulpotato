The RIAA can take down the youtube-dl repo and its clones on Github, but there&#x27;s thousands of clones on people&#x27;s local machines.<p>The internet is not centralized. The RIAA cannot say &quot;this should go&quot; and make it magically disappear. There is no single point of failure &#x2F; influence on the internet.<p>Millions of people have the skills to build an easily distributed .zip file with a barebones youtube downloader website. Everybody with an internet connection can set up a webserver that runs it.<p>And the RIAA will have to go after each individual, one at a time.<p>They couldn&#x27;t keep TPB down, at best they managed to annoy it for a little while.')
