Sanctions were imposed upon them and generally, they&#x27;ve been punished by America since and who have made multiple attempts through economic pressure and more direct actions to institute a government that will do what america wants.<p>&gt;Also, this principle of noninterference you seem to advocate is morally bankrupt,<p>Well let&#x27;s look back at some recent history of interference by america. They interfered in the middle east so they could take out the Taliban they trained and armed during the 80&#x27;s and secure oil.pipelines between the middle east and Russia. This was continued into Libya and Syria using another us backed terrorist group, Isis.<p>Let&#x27;s go back a little further to the gulf war where a complete and total fabrication led america to interfere in the middle east.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nayirah_testimony" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nayirah_testimony</a><p>Maybe we can go back to Jamaica in the early 70&#x27;s and discuss how america armed the political party opposed to Jamaican independence and flooded the country with guns turning it into what essentially became a warzone throughout the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s.<p>Maybe Columbia where the cia backed a government that supported their clandestine cocaine operations responsible for the crack epidemic in poor urban america?<p>When has America&#x27;s interference in other countries benefitted anyone other than american corporations and american interests?<p>If america really cared about about dealing with morally bankrupt countries and governments, why do they ally themselves with Saudi Arabia and other countries well known for human rights abuses? Why do they arm and train terrorist groups?')
