Item(by='ohazi', descendants=None, kids=[25414580, 25414045], score=None, time=1607920932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25413282, text='I&#x27;m sharing the display as well.<p>The USB switch electrically disconnects and reconnects any attached USB devices, moving them between a USB port on my desktop and a USB port on my docking station. I have a keyboard and a Logitech receiver connected to this switch. The advantage of doing it this way is that it works on any operating system without any additional software. Things that might not make it through a HID emulation layer (e.g. scroll sensitivity, firmware updates, RGB LED control(?), etc.) just work the way they would if the peripherals were connected directly (because they <i>are</i> connected directly). You could also add other USB devices to the switch if you wanted, like an audio interface, drawing tablet, thumbdrive, etc. (although you&#x27;d want to be careful about unmounting any drives).<p>The video source is set by the monitor. Doing this via the monitor&#x27;s OSD menu works, and also doesn&#x27;t require any software, but is annoying. So the small bit of optional software that I&#x27;ve added is a script that waits for the keyboard to disappear (which happens after I press the button on the USB switch), and then tells the monitor to change input. It saves me four button presses when it works, but I can still perform the switch manually if it doesn&#x27;t.<p>The no-software approach allows this setup to work even if a friend shows up with a TB3 laptop without any special software and wants to work at my desk.')
