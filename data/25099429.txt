And slave states were really the main roadblock to any scheme involving direct popular vote, because then their slave population would effectively not count for the purposes of representation in the executive.<p>All the stuff about electors being a safeguard etc was post hoc rationalization. I&#x27;m not even saying it was in bad faith - the people arguing that EC was a safeguard were doing it sincerely. But that&#x27;s not why the idea got so much support.')
