For example, if my email is abc@example.com, I create a gandi mail account for this address\n - I run fetchmail on my server to fetch mails from gandi\n - I setup a specific email account for relay (eg. postmaster@example.com), and I configure my postfix to relay emails through gandi using this account<p>That way, if my server is unreachable, all emails are delivered to gandi and I can access them through gandi webmail. When everything works fine, most emails (99+% in my experience) go through the primary MX (my server). In case some are delivered to gandi or when my server is back up, fetchmail will just get them back locally.<p>This &#x27;trick&#x27; helped me in numerous occasions, esp. when moving from a location to another, but it should also helped in case my house burns down.<p>The relay part alleviates most delivery issues: I used to have a lot of rejection (ISP MX rejecting residential IPs) or spam classification (gmail I hate you). I no longer does.')
