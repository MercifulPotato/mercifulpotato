I don&#x27;t find any of this persuasive. Google is also preventing me from forming my own opinions about content featuring firearms, hate speech, violent criminal organizations, sales of regulated goods, nudity, and sexual content. I&#x27;m waiting for an argument from you that would be persuasive to someone who thinks it&#x27;s just fine for Google to ban porn from Youtube.')
