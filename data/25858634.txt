You&#x27;d think they don&#x27;t suddenly change from &#x27;.&#x27; to &#x27;,&#x27; as decimal separator. But that&#x27;s what they did. And so did Apple more years ago by the way, even resulting in a calculator that couldn&#x27;t be used anymore with the numeric keypad.<p>Anyway, found a guy working on keyboard layout stuff at Microsoft through LinkedIn as the other support channels were non-responsive. Unfortunately he just confirmed the change if I remember correctly. But at least we knew what was coming.')
