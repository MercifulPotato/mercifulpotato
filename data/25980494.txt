For example, with an FFT you could decode every radio station simultaneously with the same receiver and only log more compute. So if you only want a single high SNR narrowband channel (even tunable) it&#x27;s easier to do in analog, but if you want all 100 possible channels with stereo and&#x2F;or some digital processing to add features or reduce noise... it&#x27;s much better to do digitally. However, doing it with an FPGA&#x2F;DSP would probably be significantly more efficient than a general purpose CPU.')
