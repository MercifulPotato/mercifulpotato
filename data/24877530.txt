Another 40 years worth?<p>EXACTLY!<p>The iPhone is now 14 years old. The iPod lasted 6 years until it got replaced with the iPhone.<p>Apples great advantage used to be that they competed with themselves. It was the Macintosh Team vs. the Rest of Apple for example. The Macintosh was allowed to completely cannibalise all other Machines, the iPhone was allowed to completely canibalise the iPod, the iMac replaced the Cube and was allowed to completely cannibalise most tower macs.<p>They didn&#x27;t create a huge product portfolio trying to balance features so that they all sell equally well, crippling some for the survival of others (e.g. where&#x27;s the iPad Pro with XCode, or a MacBook with LTE). They tried to make the best product that would revolutionise the markets, even if it would kill their other products. Because the Products were front and center, not the profits.<p>If apple was still apple, we wouldn&#x27;t have Macbooks anymore. We&#x27;d all use iPad Pros with proper software and keyboards that can balance them on your laps.<p>We probably wouldn&#x27;t use iPhones either, we&#x27;d simply have Airpods, an appleWatch, and an optional larger screen that you slide into your shirt pocket or your wallet, or carry as a pocket mirror. Doing 90% of interactions through Siri (which is also 8 years old now, ancient by computer standards, still worse than what it used to be, because apple wants to save money on compute).<p>Why would Ive leave if he had the power to shape that future.')
