I think it depends on a lot on the company, where you work, your level of experience, etc.<p>When I&#x27;ve done work for smaller companies, I&#x27;ve often negotiated the terms with little to no issue (literally striking lines&#x2F;paragraphs from the agreement as long as it was reasonable). But if you work for a FAANG, negotiating the legal terms is probably not going to happen unless you are a high level employee with a custom contract since they have a standardized hiring process for thousands of employees.<p>It also depends on your role and level of experience. The more senior you are or the more key the hire, the more you can probably negotiate. If you are a fresh hire from college, then you probably won&#x27;t have any leverage at all.<p>Finally, I think your experience will vary a lot by how tight the market is for hiring someone in your position in that area. I&#x27;ve seen key technical hires in Silicon Valley negotiate all kinds of things if the company really wants to hire them. I&#x27;ve also seen people in roles like Project Managers and Designers be completely shut out of negotiating when the local market wasn&#x27;t as competitive. Finally, I&#x27;ve seen people in less tech-dense cities with less market competition have no negotiating power even if they were senior hires.')
