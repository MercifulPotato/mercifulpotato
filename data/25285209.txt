If you have a cache-friendly HTML page, any modern browser will load individual resources almost as quickly â€” and this way you avoid the concern about clogging the pipe with pushed content which is already cached.<p>I get the appeal, having spent plenty of years fighting old browsers back in the day but we&#x27;re in a much better place now with cheap CDNs and HTTP&#x2F;2. I&#x27;ve yet to see a project where this time wouldn&#x27;t be better spent on, for example, using less JavaScript or tuning image&#x2F;font usage.')
