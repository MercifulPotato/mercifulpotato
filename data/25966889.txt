Item(by='throwaway81523', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611989521, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25961935, text='60% of murder cases result in someone getting arrested.  So we still have to ask: a) how many of those arrests result in a conviction?  b) how many of those convictions are of the right person?  c) and how many murders result in murder cases?<p>A murder case basically starts with police opening a file saying &quot;X has been murdered&quot; and goes on from there.  So if the death looks enough like accident or natural causes or suicide, no murder case is opened and it doesn&#x27;t count as an uncleared murder.<p>Therefore it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the majority of murders (51%, anyway) are unsolved.')
