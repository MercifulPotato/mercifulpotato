Most farming in the West is either intensive mass-production of commodities or sectorial, high-margin goods like wine. For the most part, agricultural subsidies are helping small businesses in sectors where they aren&#x27;t really competitive (mostly by making the taxpayer or the consumer pay the difference, but that&#x27;s another story...). Again, not to say subsidies are wrong per se, but I don&#x27;t follow your reasoning there.<p>&gt; The reason for the farming subsidies is to have internal food production in case a war prevents sufficient food imports<p>???<p>Most Western countries (with the possible exception of the US, I don&#x27;t know) aren&#x27;t agriculturally self-sufficient, nor it is a goal for them to be. In case a war broke out, energy supplies would be a <i>much</i> more pressing concern, especially for Western Europe.')
