Technically this is only nominally government currency since it&#x27;s just bank credit denominated in USD.<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain does around ~100K BTC in volume a day at ~100 BTC in fees and ~1000 BTC mined (since May) which both are effectively costs going to the miners&#x27; electricity.  1.1% vs 1.5% with cash back isn&#x27;t a huge argument for bitcoin.  If transaction fees stay around .1% until the block reward hits .05% then the efficiency argument eventually goes away because miners will be competing on transaction efficiency and not block rewards any more.<p>I like the technology; it&#x27;s cool and the fact that it works at all is amazing.  If overall costs were closer to .1% and speculators were not the primary users it would be revolutionary.')
