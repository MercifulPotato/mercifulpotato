The entry of the US to both WWI and WWII made the decisive result precisely because of enormous American capacity to produce stuff.<p>That said, loss of American production capacity in the last 30 or so years (&quot;the giant sucking sound&quot; of Ross Perot) may really be an early sign of decay. Having digital giants is fine, but they won&#x27;t produce a billion of N95 masks on demand.')
