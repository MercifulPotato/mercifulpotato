You&#x27;re not an investigator, you&#x27;re not sitting on the case files for every story you see. No one is expecting you to have the same standards as a court for what guilty is, but <i>you should still internalize some concept of innocent until proven guilty</i><p>Because the news can, and will, and <i>does</i> paint people as criminals when they did nothing wrong. Now a days literally all it takes is saying &quot;so and so person was arrested for allegedly committing so and so crime&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s it.<p>People don&#x27;t need any more proof than that, and the fact that this entire conversation is happening when the investigation into the materials was almost 2 months ago by an NYPD Counterterrorism unit and the FBI, yet this guy is still walking around is pretty damn strong evidence that nothing more came of it, should be proof.<p>Tour standard of guilty should be <i>much more</i> than a simple news story.<p>A news story mentioning saltpeter and prepper books is nothing. The kind of people who experiment with saltpeter are <i>exactly</i> the kinds of people to read those books out of interest, not some sort of malicious plan to commit crimes.<p>-<p>Also this is an aside but...<p>&gt;  So don&#x27;t tell me that no one thought it was an actual bomb. That doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>That&#x27;s literally the crux of the matter. That&#x27;s literally <i>all that matters</i>. That no one thought it was an actual bomb, and he didn&#x27;t act like it was an actual bomb.<p>If both teachers immediately realized it wasn&#x27;t a bomb, how are you claiming it looked like a bomb?<p>It didn&#x27;t look like a bomb. It looked like an electronic thing splayed out, they asked what it was, he said alarm clock.<p>The second teacher knew it didn&#x27;t look like a bomb, what happened is they presumed that he was <i>trying</i> to make it appear like a bomb. No one thought it was a bomb because it didn&#x27;t look like one.')
