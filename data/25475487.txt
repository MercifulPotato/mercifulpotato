All that makes more noise. The wikipedia seems to suggest (or I infer) that one can&#x27;t merely &quot;just read of&quot; the base pairs in QWERTYUIOP through some super cool process and be done with it. No, I have to split QWERTYUIOP into chunks and replicate the hell out of the resulting chunks which just re-asks my question. I mean how is QWERTYUIOPQWERTYUIOP not a reasonable outcome?<p>I&#x27;m still missing something fundamental. The more chunks there are, the more permutations, combinations there are in possible re-assembly up to all the power sets of base pairs.\nGranted, it may not be possible to make complex simple here. So that thank you for your time and effort.')
