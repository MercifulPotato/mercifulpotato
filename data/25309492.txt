Item(by='zxcvbn4038', descendants=None, kids=[25311101], score=None, time=1607122950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306162, text='NYC stopped enforcing marijuana laws years ago (unless your a minority or on their radar for other things) - you can walk down the street smoking a joint in midtown and nobody will bother you, walk by restaurants where it’s clearly being smoked in bulk and nobody is stopping it, smell it heavy on people’s clothing on the subway and nobody is hindering them.<p>The first thing I notice when traveling abroad, or even to other cities in the US including ones that have legalized marijuana officially, is the lack of marijuana smell. The first few days of the COVID lockdown the air quality in Manhattan was amazing between the lack of traffic and people smoking - imagine Wyoming or Montana except you can smell the ocean - I had never experienced that here before.<p>So on one hand I’m glad they are considering legalization so that the police don’t target people unfairly, but on the other hand I can tell already that people are going to abuse this and mess it up. The politicians are going to start taxing the bejesus out of the stuff to curtail its use, and that is going to push people to cheaper&#x2F;illegal alternatives, and the cycle will repeat itself.')
