This is the kind of critically important stuff in stochastic processing theory that medical-field statistics never seem to care to report on.<p>If it is the former (IID), and let&#x27;s say P_D = 1.0, P_FA = 0.2, it is an extremely easy problem to solve: Just have each student take 3 tests each day, which will reduce the overall P_FA from 0.2 to 0.008. Or 4 tests for 0.0016.<p>If it is the latter, you will only lose 6 students for the whole week; you&#x27;ll have 24 students left on Friday, not 10.')
