Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607734864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25392231, text='&gt; People are rational most of the times, and act based on the well of knowledge they have at the time.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that people are not rational most of the time, but operate on habit and reason by use of heuristics. My evidence for this is that rational thought is costly and in psychology they teach this (that people aren&#x27;t usually rational, merely motivated and economical with their attention).<p>&gt; Human brains are hackable, more so if you can control their inputs. Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, they all found the attack vector.<p>This is a good reason why gatekeeping information is so dangerous.<p>&gt; So democracy and truth are more related to each other than democracy and speech. We tend to think that speech is truth, but it is not, and people over time have voted themselves out into dictatorships over and over.<p>Unfortunately there is no test for truth. However if you control people&#x27;s sources of information you can keep them from figuring out that they have been lied to.<p>How are we to ensure that the gatekeepers of information are honest and wise?')
