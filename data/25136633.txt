Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605707243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25136180, text='Apple has revenues of about $275bln, and a net margin of about 21% company-wide, meaning $58bln.<p>The app store sold about $50bln worth of stuff in 2019, Apple&#x27;s 30% cut would therefore mean $15bln in revenue. If they operated the app store at a least a 70% margin (and really, if they didn&#x27;t, then I&#x27;d be rather surprised), that would mean a good $10bln in net profit from the app store, or 17% of their total net profit.<p>And that&#x27;s still not accounting for the network effect the app store creates, or the business intelligence.<p>It might not be the biggest elephant ever, but it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d call a tiny baby elephant either.')
