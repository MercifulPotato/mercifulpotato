We don&#x27;t recommend disabling this feature on the C: volume.&quot;<p>Microsoft supports APIs which were declared deprecated for decades.<p>However, I totally agree in &quot;Basically nobody is using it&quot; part. It&#x27;s because it was not properly implemented in .Net Framework. And now, when .Net Core is multiplatform, i.e. worst of all worlds, chances it will be implemented are very close to zero. ReFS does not support TxF.<p>Windows has a lot of awesome APIs which are accessible only to C&#x2F;C++ and are not advertised well.')
