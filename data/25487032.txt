And ARM has the advantage of requiring a smaller frontend. Especially when one looks at wider decoders.<p>On the other hand if your ISA is the micro-ops directly then the instructions start to take ridiculous amounts of space. It&#x27;s a balancing act between instruction size (to save instruction cache) and the complexity of decoding them.<p>And it&#x27;s not just about being 1:1. It&#x27;s also about how wide you can go. And variable length encodings simply are fundamentally more hard to parse in parallel fashion. That means a wider unit is harder to achieve, needing more space and power.')
