Presumably docker for Windows could use WSL.<p>WSL2 is also a VM. Docker is in truth Linux-only software, and &quot;Docker&quot; on any other platform is a polished interface for spinning up a Linux VM and running the real version of Docker there.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is such a bad thing. What non-Linux Docker really provides is a nice UI.<p>On my Mac, I switched from doing a lot of development in VMWare Fusion to using docker-machine (set up to still use VMWare under the hood). With docker-machine especially, it&#x27;s quite obvious that I&#x27;m still just using a VM, but it all feels a lot more seamless than when I was running a bunch of commands to start up VMWare, SSH in, and sync my local files.<p>----------<p>â€  I can&#x27;t use Docker Desktop because I insist on running an old version of OS X.')
