Over the past few weeks, all the seniors in my family have accidentally updated and locked (i.e. bricked) their ipads. These tablets are essential to their quality of live. I&#x27;m convinced &lt;deleted expletive&gt; Apple engineers applied dark patterns to accidentally trick people into updating their OS. During covid, this means someone needs to expose the seniors to unbrick their bloody ipads. This should be criminal during a pandemic. Btw, I mean functionally bricked here. None of the seniors in my family remember their passwords or is able to deal with a fresh OS install. &lt;deleted expletive&gt; Sorry .. I needed to rant.')
