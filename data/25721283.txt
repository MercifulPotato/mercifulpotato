Item(by='drusepth', descendants=None, kids=[25721730], score=None, time=1610319975, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721005, text='This sounds super cool.<p>A few questions, if you don&#x27;t mind:<p>1) Do you have any examples of the kinds of &quot;actions&quot; you execute (and what you would write to execute them)? Is the text also in some kind of strict DSL (e.g. @ firstname lastname number to add a contact?)<p>2) How do reminders work? I&#x27;d assume only at-least-next-day ones work well if you only execute&#x2F;set them at EOD. Do you use them more to remind you of daily things in the morning, or do you have your phone ping you throughout the day as specific-time reminders kick in?<p>3. Are you planning on releasing this as an app? Planning on adding any support for people adding their own glyphs&#x2F;actions? (I ask because I&#x27;ve been tempted to do something similar, but moreso for worldbuilding -- where I jot down character&#x2F;location ideas and OCR them into notebook.ai later or similar). Does it work on any notebook, or do you need a special one to anchor for OCR accuracy?')
