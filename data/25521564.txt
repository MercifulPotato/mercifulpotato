It&#x27;s not so hard to make a weak player - you just take suboptimal moves instead of the best moves.  But often these suboptimal moves are bizarre.  A weak human chess player will lose their pieces as they fall prey to forks and skewers and so on - tricks that are hard to see coming for new player.  But they will rarely actively throw a piece away by moving it into danger.  Even a novice human is pretty decent at looking one move ahead.  But to a chess engine, or an MuZero agent, a move that loses the queen immediately and a move that leads to a sequence that loses the queen in five turns are basically equal.  And so an artificially-weak MuZero agent, or an artificially-weak Stockfish agent will tend to make &#x27;mistakes&#x27; that not even a weak human would make.  This makes them a little difficult to learn from.<p>There does exist research on how to make a human-like weak player: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2006.01855" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2006.01855</a><p>The basic idea is to look at weak human games and try to predict when a mistake will be made.  But I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any approach that can do that without access to a corpus of human errors.')
