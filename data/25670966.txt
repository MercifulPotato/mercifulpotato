Because you are so important to them, they will install Signal as a backup&#x2F;secondary app.</i><p>I&#x27;ll be the one friend that&#x27;ll insist on SMS&#x2F;email. Iâ€™ll even offer to use some other supposedly encrypted method like Keybase or Matrix. If that doesn&#x27;t work as a fallback, then I guess we can agree to disagree, and someone else can play the middleperson for us. :)<p>I refuse to use Signal because it doesn&#x27;t offer chat sync, or message preservation if I either lose or have to wipe my phone.')
