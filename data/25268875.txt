Every year, without fail, a local engineering student would show up while I was getting setup and ask if they could test their new &quot;backyard Zamboni&quot; on the rink (e.g. some variation on an upside down propane grill on wheels) and I would watch as they learned the painful lesson that there were not 20 MPH winds in the lab.')
