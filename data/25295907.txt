As mentioned in the post, I hope that the M1 performance and aggressive apple marketing will push premium pc laptop manufactures in adopting the best performance x86 CPUs. And I also hope that AMD will seize the opportunity to get a good chunk of mobile market.<p>Of course, next year laptop models are probably being finished right now, and it could be that intel still found a way to bribe premium manufactures from including AMD in their premium models.<p>In my opinion they&#x27;ll lose marketshare if that happens. But, there are most likely smart people with a lot of more information than me making these decisions.')
