I suppose the challenge here would be to figure out which parts of the audio are the speaker&#x27;s voice and which parts aren&#x27;t, and remove the parts that aren&#x27;t.<p>If the visualization of the audio is such that you can discern speech from other audio, similar to how you can discern the person&#x27;s silhouette and figure out where the background is, then in theory it should be possible using the same technique.<p>I suppose there are probably some pure audio processing techniques that don&#x27;t rely on the visualization as well.')
