Maybe it&#x27;s the Rona driving it, after all so many people have died from it, and the US went to war over 911. Rona is <i>literally</i> exponentially worse as far as the death toll goes, so IDK what is to come but emotions are raw for sure.<p>I have tried to stay out of the discussions, (taken Dang&#x27;s advice and waited for things to cool down) then a hit job story about another platform comes out like this one and tries to politicize Parler. So unfortunately I got sucked into the politics too and foolishly weighed in.')
