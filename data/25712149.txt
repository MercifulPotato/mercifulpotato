Facebook has a lot of Malayalam discussions and literature but they are lost past a few days, and it is very difficult to rediscover this content.<p>Basically we are losing out on quality content once Facebook has decided it is not viable to show a post algorithmically.<p>2. For vernacular languages niche content has largely been reduced to Youtube, but still there are no platforms for discussion on these topics.<p>3. his might sound generic but we often hear about stories of kids chancing on content on the internet and developing a passion for a subject, what are the chances this can happen if you are not English speaking?<p>We can learn from China on this, even though it is a population that is largely shielded from the rest of the world, their adoption of native langauge on the internet have allowed for proliferation of all kinds content to everyone.<p>4. Localisation is the future. Being able to use our own language has allowed a lot of people to explode on the scene and make a living - ask tiktokers.<p>I am not yet done with the features, but a priority for me now is to do translations to Malayalam and get audience coming.')
