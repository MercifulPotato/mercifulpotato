Or aren&#x27;t actually worth doing.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to find a job, as an IC or manager, where I had 8 hours worth of tasks worth completing.<p>Oh, there&#x27;s usually -work- enough for 8 hours, every day, if I want, but it&#x27;s actually a negative effect to try and do so. It means I&#x27;m getting involved in decisions I don&#x27;t have all the context on, am not responsible for, and am not empowered to actually change (and thus just getting frustrated and probably pissing someone off), or I&#x27;m trying to work on something that requires buy in from other people, that hasn&#x27;t been prioritized for them, so is going to die on the vine anyway (and, again, frustrate me and piss them off).')
