Almost all of this value is in the ecosystem around X.<p>You can&#x27;t capture an ecosystem unless you provide that value, <i>plus</i> the activation energy needed to persuade people to change.<p>systemd (as an example of a large, recent, change to the &quot;whole system&quot;) touched end-users far less than X so the pain was felt mainly by distributors and sysadmins.<p>Time and again, software that&#x27;s &quot;better&quot; fails in the market because it doesn&#x27;t provide the things that users need, want or use.<p>Backwards compatibility is usually key when trying to capture a large, long established user base. ...and that means backwards compatibility even (or especially!) with all the &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; stuff. This is one of the things that makes software &quot;products&quot; much harder than software &quot;engineering&quot; (which in turn is &quot;harder&quot; than computer science).<p>Science is how it works. Engineering is getting it to work and productisation is getting people to adopt it.<p>Wayland has to solve problems that end-users actually care about rather than just being better in technical ways.')
