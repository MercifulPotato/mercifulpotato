If it were illegal for companies that collect PII and track users across 3rd party sites to sell ad space on their platforms, all these companies would have to switch to a subscription model like Netflix, shifting the economic incentives to favor user retention rather than advertiser appetites. This means companies <i>lose money</i> when they ban people rather than <i>make money</i> by cutting their losses on viral bandwidth that&#x27;s too toxic to monetize through ads.')
