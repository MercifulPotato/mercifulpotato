For this goal, we don&#x27;t need to worry about cheating at all.<p>The second purpose, however, is as a way to signal other people that the student has been educated. This is what a college degree is: a certification that the person has been educated to a particular standard.<p>For that, we need some way to verify that the person has learned what they were supposed to learn. Tests are a way of doing that, and cheating prevents the ability to measure the success of the education.')
