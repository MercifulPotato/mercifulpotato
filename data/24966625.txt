I can only think of 2 examples, but neither seem like good ones:<p>1- someone holds power of attorney over someone else, and register an account (email account?) in their name. But if there&#x27;s PoA involved, the 2nd person isn&#x27;t (probably ?) able to manage an email account on their own, so this doesn&#x27;t seem a meaningful distinction to worry about. (though if it&#x27;s not an untreatable condition, it&#x27;s possible that they might resume using their email account themselves, I guess)<p>2- the account is created by your ISP when you register, and they &quot;helpfully&quot; choose a username for you. So from this point of view, you didn&#x27;t truly &quot;create the account&quot;')
