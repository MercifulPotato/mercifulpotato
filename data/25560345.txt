The vulnerable groups are exposed and left at the waves of the society.<p>While people were complaining because they had to stay some weeks inside, you have countries where the elder are still in isolation after 9 months, only to finally get the virus to creep in slowly and start to wipe a lot of them. It&#x27;s borderline criminal.<p>It&#x27;s sad, and it makes me worried for when it will be my turn. If we&#x27;re this detached from the problems of old age, we won&#x27;t have a good end.')
