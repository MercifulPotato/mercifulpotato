[its complex and doesn&#x27;t work]<p>Having worked in drug development (and no longer do) I can tell you that everyone in the field knows it sucks and also that you should be (very favorably) astonished that it works at all.<p>Biological systems are so insanely complex that they are barely understood; most medical treatments are attempts to perturb a single variable (of a system with billions of variables) in the hope that it has a big enough positive effect.<p>Insanely complex mRNA vaccines are &quot;trivial&quot; by comparison.<p>When you make a spacecraft as you describe you may have a million moving parts.  Their operating domain is well known, they typically only do one or two things, and they can operate in a system that can be isolated (this is the crew capsule; it operates in a vacuum and gets power from the power module...).  By comparison a human body is many many billions of parts (brain itself is 80 giganeurons) including many that are not even human, all interacting in parallel (those 80 GN brain cells each has a dendritic fan out of around 10^5, plus new means of connection are still being found); all flooding with various signalling (electrical, hormonal, etc) which is the result of object code being extensively modified over 400 million years.<p>And that&#x27;s just for a single organism (which is how we erroneously consider a human being).  Humans are themselves parts of complex interacting extracorpal systems of food, actions, and other environmental factors which cannot be controlled because unlike a piece of metal or a silicon die in a ceramic package we interact with the majority of them.<p>There are a lot of very smart people in computer science but my qualitative impression is that while there a smaller proportion of smart people in the life sciences, the average IQ of those latter group is <i>significantly</i> higher.<p>Even though I still follow the literature, I have a &quot;holy shit how did someone figure that out?&quot; moment several times a week.')
