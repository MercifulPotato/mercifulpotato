By the time it was open sourced it was feature rich, rock solid, reliable.<p>* In hindsight they were naive about the effort it would take to open source Envoy. It takes a lot of work to create a successful open source project. Matt came close to complete and total burnout working what was essentially two jobs: his Lyft job and Envoy.<p>* The success of Envoy has made Lyft far less likely to open source projects because of the huge time commitment it takes.<p>* Most open source projects are a net negative. You&#x27;ll put out more effort than you will be returned in community development. Very few projects become successful enough to justify the effort.<p>* Starting a successful open source company requires the same effort as starting actual company. It requires engineering, PR, marketing, hiring maintainers and contributors, blog posts, build tooling, documentation, talking at conferences, talking at meetupsâ€”all the things that make something successful.<p>* Google&#x27;s adoption helped a lot because they didn&#x27;t just contribute code, they created hype by talking at conferences.<p>via <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;highscalability.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;6&#x2F;stuff-the-internet-says-on-scalability-for-november-6th-2020.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;highscalability.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;6&#x2F;stuff-the-internet...</a>')
