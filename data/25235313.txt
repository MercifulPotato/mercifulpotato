The barrier to entry for doing a ride is much lower, even if I&#x27;m tired I can do a quick 1 hour ride on the eBike. It gets my heartrate up and my blood pumping. If I want I can push my self harder and get more or less of a workout, it is up to me. \n Also, no matter how hot it gets I find I can still do rides on my eBike. So long as I have enough water and am dressed appropriately I can ride in the summer heat.')
