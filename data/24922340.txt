It provides ways to quickly roll dice, shuffle&#x2F;deal cards, etc, but beyond that it&#x27;s mostly just a 3D space with a table for you to play board games in. Grab a rule book, set up the pieces, and get to playing.<p>If you want the software to set up the game for you and automate some of the aspects of playing it, yes, that requires someone to have taken the time to script out those interactions.<p>Some scripted games on the workshop are really impressive. Munchkin and Gloomhaven come to mind as games that have really great user made scripted interactions. The official DLC is pretty quality as well, such as Wingspan or Viticulture.')
