I am sure all those games could run but when I want to play a game I don&#x27;t want to fiddle with config files so I either boot a console or reboot into windows. It&#x27;s been my experience for years that ubuntu&#x2F;Linux isn&#x27;t as versatile and as accommodating as windows regarding gaming but it doesn&#x27;t mean that those games couldn&#x27;t run with a bit of elbow grease (they most likely would but it&#x27;s not pain-free).<p>I always try to stick to Intel IGP because I read (and I suppose it&#x27;s still true) that they have the best support for desktop usage. I don&#x27;t want to fight nvidia or ati drivers, I don&#x27;t even know wwhich&#x27;s the darling of gaming GPU for Linux these days. Been there, done that.')
