Forbidden means precisely that.<p>Back in my old country, before I foolishly immigrated to the land of &quot;the free&quot; (drum drum), political commentary was first turned into satire and then that was embedded in children&#x27;s stories, and you had that interesting phenomena of adults passing around children&#x27;s stories. Good times.<p>All authoritarian system are fundamentally psychological in nature. Brute force is theraputical. The ultimate objective is acceptance of authoritative narrative. The content matter is entirely irrelevant. Recall in 1984, Winston is being asked &quot;how many fingers?&quot; and &quot;what does 2+2 equal?&quot;. Outside of fiction, recall the Church of Rome asserting it&#x27;s authority by modifying commandments. Rationality, authenticity, applicability, or heaven help us, veracity, are not even variables in the equation of Authoritarian Control Over Information and Social Discourse.')
