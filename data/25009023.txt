The ifconfig -&gt; ip transition is at least an improvement. Canonical had every chance to use NetworkManager which is battle-tested, has an extremely polished language bindings, a cli, tui and multiple GUIs, handles complex configurations like a champ, has a nice connection plug-in system to handle all kinds of less common stuff like VPNs, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi sharing, IPoDNS <i>and a plug-in system to support reading configs in other formats (like maybe YAML for instance)</i>. The plug-in ifcfg-rh is the reason why ifcfg scripts all still work.<p>But no, they wrote this entirely non-extensible basically trivial C utility (that&#x27;s not a dig, seriously look at the code, it does almost nothing!) that doesn&#x27;t reduce complexity at all since it&#x27;s the thinnest possible abstraction over its backends and adds yet another layer of things that might fail. But it&#x27;s integrated into cloud-init by default so it&#x27;s easier to just slog though fighting it than to rip it out.')
