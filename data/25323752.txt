Dealing with my ADHD is still a daily struggle and I didn&#x27;t transform into a better person by taking the medicine<p>What it did was to turn my experience of my life from a large overwhelming interconnected problem into small doable issues. It made me able to pick up each of the many broken aspects of my life, fix it, and move on to the next<p>I&#x27;m afraid of the notion, I often hear, where medicine &quot;fixes&quot; something. My ADHD didn&#x27;t go away with the medicine, but it did make me able to take responsibility for my own life and feel confident enough in myself, that I don&#x27;t want to apologize for needing a different environment to be productive<p>The good thing about methylphenidate is that it works quickly (20 minutes or so after taking it), so you know pretty quickly if it&#x27;s a good fit. It wears off after 4-8 hours depending on the formulation, so if you feel worse it&#x27;ll only be for a short period')
