Item(by='joosters', descendants=None, kids=[25569054, 25569611, 25569063], score=None, time=1609244323, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25568986, text='That&#x27;s 10 minutes more than it takes to show off any other collectible: &quot;Here&#x27;s my collection of beanie babies!&quot;, &quot;Look at my lovely Van Gogh painting!&quot;<p>Now, to prove authenticity of an item obviously takes a lot longer - you need art experts to validate your Van Gogh, and some beanie baby specialist to affirm that your toys aren&#x27;t counterfeit, but that&#x27;s besides the point: when you show off a collection, you are doing so to let people view and admire it, not authenticate it.')
