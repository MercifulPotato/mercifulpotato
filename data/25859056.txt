Even when we think about potentially highly advanced aliens, we still assume they&#x27;ll have a psychology similar to ours, and they&#x27;ll just be more advanced technologically (ie. the aliens and ants analogy).<p>Eventually, I did find some cases in Science Fiction, and one in particular stands out as far as I am concerned: the alien entity named Rorschach and the smaller entities named Scramblers, in Firefall, by Peter Watts. If you are a (Hard) SF fan, you must read this one.<p>Another case I would mention off the top of my head would be the Formics, in Scott Orson&#x27;s Card &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; and sequels, but I think the whole idea was left mostly unexplored.<p>If you have other examples, please do mention them!')
