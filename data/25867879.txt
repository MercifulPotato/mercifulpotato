For that intellectual honesty, I appreciate it.<p>However it is also from June 2020 and needs an update. Terrorism is defined as using criminal acts to move political goals forward. Throughout 2020 and even as recently as yesterday (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;inauguration-day-protests-in-portland-seattle-turned-violent-11611260877" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;inauguration-day-protests-in-po...</a>), the political left has been using terrorism to push their social justice agenda on the backs of the George Floyd tragedy. The end goal of groups engaging in such violence (eg antifa, BLM-affiliated groups, socialist groups, etc) has been to leverage this incident (or really any crisis) and use virtuous packaging like “social justice” to ultimately implement ideas like highly redistributive tax schemes. This type of behavior is outside the acceptable norms of how political debate and civil discourse is meant to be carried out in our society. Additionally the amount of economic damage and the number of deaths stemming from left-wing riots throughout 2020 is far greater than right-wing ones, such as the recent Capitol riots.<p>However the calls to curb extremism, and the actions to curb extremist actors and organizations, all seem to only be directed at the right. This double standard prevents the kind of deescalation strategy this article proposes at its conclusion. One side is not going to back down if the other side is given a pass whenever they use dirty tactics to further their cause. The only way out is mutual disarmament and fair (evenly applied) mutual accountability.')
