Creating the site was just<p><pre><code>  pip install pelican; git init . ; pelican-quickstart; vim pelicanconf.py  # to set the theme\n</code></pre>\nThen to publish:<p><pre><code>  pelican . &amp;&amp; git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -m &quot;post title&quot; &amp;&amp; git push\n</code></pre>\n(I have a shortcut for this, of course)<p>But I think you overestimate the time to &quot;setup the CI workflow&quot; actually takes. It&#x27;s just a text file where you put the commands above, so it can run on the server instead of your machine. There&#x27;s no black magic to it.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t have to worry about a build pipeline at all.<p>Of course you do; it&#x27;s just that your build pipeline runs every time someone accesses your site.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not aiming this at you, but in general I&#x27;d love to see how newer engineers would tackle things like deployment if they couldn&#x27;t rely on some SaaS offering.<p>I&#x27;ve done that too. I created a bare git repo on the server, with a post-receive hook that checkouts &quot;master&quot; and runs the static site generator. Then I had Nginx serve the directory.')
