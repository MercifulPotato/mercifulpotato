Item(by='qwerty456127', descendants=None, kids=[25082154], score=None, time=1605275016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25081739, text='&gt; As long as something works like they want it to, most people wont care what platform they use to get it.<p>For almost anything, there are (at least in big cities and in the Internet) many vendors offering nearly the same with nearly the same quality level at nearly the same prices.<p>But I can&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t care whom do I get the same service thing every particular time. I&#x27;m more likely to choose whoever feels more nice and offers even slightly more freedom and flexibility. Once I&#x27;ve chosen a vendor I&#x27;m much more likely to stick with them (and choose them every time I need something else they can offer) as long as I don&#x27;t feel severely dissatisfied.<p>E.g. once I&#x27;ve got a GMail (GMail is and has always been the very best e-mail service anyway, you can hardly be dissatisfied with it) account I would use everything Google if only they didn&#x27;t piss me off politically (with stiff like this particular discussion subject) and scare me by terminating other&#x27;s peoples accounts. But I actually am migrating everything I can away from Google and Gmail because Google seems becoming more and more evil (I even suspect RIAA only attacked ytdl after Google told them to).')
