I would ise it exclusiveley if there was a well functioning instance available. Unfortunately some features (search for files, search social media) didn&#x27;t work on the instances I&#x27;ve tried, and there seems to be some issue with setting it as your default search engine on android. For me it works fine for a few searches, then at a certain point searchong for anything from the browser bar just redirects you to the sites homepage and you have to start over there. Local results are a bit lacking but this is essentially by design and adding a zip code or whatever usually helps.')
