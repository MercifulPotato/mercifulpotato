They had statues and stonework dating from the 2000&#x27;s BC. At the time i was doing stonework, polishing and cutting granite and marble and stuff.<p>The polish and cuts on the statues were as good if not better than some of the stuff we produced with machines and power tools, and it gave me this sense of awe and made me realize people had been doing the same thing i spent every day doing for thousands and thousands of years.')
