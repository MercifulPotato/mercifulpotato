So you set up a pool table (=billiard?) and walk around the room around the same table. Worked quite well, the game (AR &amp; network) could keep up with the relatively low tempo of a turn-based game well enough. But that was mostly interesting because of novelty, not necessarily sticky for long-term repeat play.<p>What prompted me to explore the tech and write the blog post was indeed work on something else than a game.')
