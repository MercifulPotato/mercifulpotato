If a distro has 100k users, only 1 of them has to discover and make a scandal out of it. Projects like Debian take it even further and make a promise that it should be <i>easy</i> to reproduce the builds of their packages.<p>That&#x27;s literally impossible with any closed-source server-side software. You can&#x27;t even inspect the binary as you can with a client.')
