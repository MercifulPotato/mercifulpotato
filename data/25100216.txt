Because using a cli text editor implicitly sets you on this path of learning through the command line.  So you start with cding and lsing around, opening your file in vim, typing gcc or whatever.  In a very frictionless and natural way, pretty soon you’re reading man pages, writing shell scripts and makefiles, etc.<p>In a very real way, the Unix command line environment has you poke around an interactive “boiler room” of your computer, and that type of learning, learning by exploration, is something far different from learning individual tools at a higher level of abstraction.<p>It’s like letting a kid loose into a master’s workshop instead of showing them one tool at a time.  By seeing everything “together” and exploring what the different tools do, the “fog of war” of unknown unknowns clears much faster for a novice, and this provides a MUCH more solid knowledge footing to build on.')
