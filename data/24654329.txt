To a first approximation everyone just says &quot;Well, fuck, guess we&#x27;re going to die.&quot; Thinking about the ways that seemed unrealistic and how I thought it would go instead, Seveneves turned out a lot more like it (though with exciting-story elements injected, and also in Seveneves they&#x27;re starting from maybe a decade ahead of us in space tech). (The Last Policeman is still interesting in other ways.)<p>Egan&#x27;s <i>Diaspora</i> is another good match, with an astrophysical cataclysm instead of a merely planetary one. It happens to a much more advanced future society, though.')
