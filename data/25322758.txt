The only communities I&#x27;ve found for keto affiliate marketers are the groups run by the merchants themselves, so it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re searching for information about which merchants are honest or not. I think the general trend is to try a merchant, monitor how much they pay you, then move on if the dollar amount is too low.')
