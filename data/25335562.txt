There&#x27;s a few edges that occasionally popped up. For example, the wireless keyboard I was using would freeze the game when I tried to change the volume, but that&#x27;s not an issue with the wired one I have. Overall, the experience over a couple hundred hours (oh, quarantine) of play has been overwhelmingly positive. I don&#x27;t have a Windows machine, so if it can&#x27;t be played using Proton, I can&#x27;t play it. Valve are also my low-key heroes.')
