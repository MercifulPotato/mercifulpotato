[1]  You may or may not get a &quot;reward&quot; for backing depending on whether the project is a success.  If you do receive your reward, that&#x27;s the end of your relationship with the company; you have no ongoing financial interest in it (read: no upside).<p>A Reg CF offering is an actual security; you&#x27;re buying shares in a company, just like a VC does in early rounds.  You&#x27;re exposed to the same risks, but you do own a piece of the potential upside.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;terms-of-use#section4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;terms-of-use#section4</a>')
