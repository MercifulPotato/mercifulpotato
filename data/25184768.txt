It helped knowledge transfer of hot new framework from me to the elder ops people and sage unix wisdom from them down to me.\nWe had a &quot;read-only&quot; Friday where deployments were forbidden to help prevent outages over the weekend.\nThe software changed slowly and employee churn was minimal.<p>Now (much later) I&#x27;m elsewhere, expected to do the dev, the ops, the deployment itself, the documentation, training a junior all the while; there are effectively half as many people keeping the ship afloat.<p>The most bizarre part of all is my daily rate is almost 3x what it was then, as the market dictates for such drudgery.  \nRelevant to the article it&#x27;s obviously strategic for me to accept that, but if the rates weren&#x27;t so absurd and you could get a dev and an ops for 0.5x the devops rate each the company would get twice as many man-hours, not to mention the added safety of doubling the system&#x27;s bus factor, cutting workloads in half and vastly improving employee quality of life.\nCompanies offering a devops role for 1.5x a single developer&#x27;s rate 10 years ago to ostensibly save themselves 0.5 of a salary, are now collectively getting 0.333x as much value out of their hires (and then losing them completely when they burn out and being thrust into chaos).')
