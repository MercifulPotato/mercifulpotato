But speech doesn&#x27;t exist in a vacuum, it always has consequences, and very often exists explicitly to enact change or call to action.<p>Do you believe the <i>effect</i> of the spread and adoption of bad ideas is a price we should always be willing to pay?<p>For instance, a political party spreading lies and conspiracy theories about a religious and ethnic minority, or widespread disbelief in the legitimacy of modern science and medicine, or historical revisionism and the denial of genocides and atrocities?<p>It&#x27;s easy enough to argue free speech as an absolute if your model is people giving speeches at Speaker&#x27;s Corner or arguments over philosophical and political abstractions at a coffeeshop, but it seems less cut and dry, pun intended, when the machetes come out.<p>And regarding your point about regulations being abused, yes, <i>all</i> regulations and laws can be abused. But abuse is a known problem and remedies exist for it - such as the lawsuit being filed by the ACLU in the link you posted.')
