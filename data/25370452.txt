It ran pretty flawlessly, though I did have a problem where the game would think I was holding the attack button (heavy attack&#x2F;auto fire) instead of tapping it (light attack&#x2F;single shot). So there I was trying to line up a single headshot and imagine my surprise when I ended up dumping the entire magazine instead. To be fair to Stadia, I don&#x27;t know if this is a Stadia issue or a Cyberpunk issue.<p>Pro tip: I thought my Stadia stream was having issues, turns out that motion blur and lens flare just make the game look like ass. Turn those off and it&#x27;s gorgeous.')
