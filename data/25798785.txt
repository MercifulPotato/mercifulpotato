Yes, he routinely &quot;messes up Brain&#x27;s plans&quot; but that&#x27;s in part because Brain&#x27;s plans are almost always idiotic and Pinky prevents him from doing what he wanted to do, much like as a mom I often interfered with first-born child&#x27;s attempts to climb on the oven door to check out what I was cooking on the stove top and similar shenanigans.<p>I&#x27;m sure that as a toddler my oldest son thought I was an idiot and a meanie face who spent all my time thwarting his brilliant plans. (I know for a fact he read late in part because when I bought some reading program and would go through the exercises with him, he was looking at me and thinking stuff along the lines of &quot;I already told you ten times that is the letter P. How much repetition do you need to remember it? God!&quot;)<p>Edit: I will add that the lyrics to the theme song include the line &quot;One is a genius, the other&#x27;s insane&quot; and fail to specify which is which, leaving room for people to either accept the obvious interpretation that Brain is the genius or to go with the less obvious interpretation that Pinky is the real genius and Brain is merely an insane megalomaniac.<p>See also: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;FanTheories&#x2F;comments&#x2F;11r512&#x2F;pink_and_the_brain_pinky_is_actually_the_genius&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;FanTheories&#x2F;comments&#x2F;11r512&#x2F;pink_an...</a>')
