(non-code)', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I want to better understand the plethora of technologies we use at my current company (I am a senior engineer, but my expertise lies more code-facing). Things like:<p>Redis<p>Rancher<p>Akamai<p>Apigee<p>Istio<p>Kafka<p>GCP<p>PingFederate<p>Among other things.<p>Ideally, I&#x27;d like to set up some sort of &quot;test app&quot; that uses all the above tools, but do it locally on my own (aka, personal project). I have a surface-level understanding of all the above, but again, I want to understand more at a deeper level. Not just be a high-level talker, but someone who has a solid understanding and can help out with actual tasks using the tools.<p>I learn best hands-on, and I&#x27;m just curious is there is any optimal way to go about setting such a project up (maybe there&#x27;s an existing tool? Maybe someone&#x27;s done such an activity before and has ideas?). And potential issues such as free trials or offerings of the above tools (I believe most are free until you hit enterprise level already, though).')
