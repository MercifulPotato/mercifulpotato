In high school, I remember that it wasn&#x27;t &quot;cool&quot; to really excel academically -- but part of that was just a reaction to the fact that academic excellence involves a bunch of bullshit, like being good at test-taking, memorizing irrelevant facts that adults decided were important, etc.<p>Yes, I was a goody-two-shoes who enjoyed getting gold stars from adults. But, my parents also motivated me with sermons threatening the hell of flipping burgers all my life if I didn&#x27;t knock it out of the park. It&#x27;s fucked up to put that much pressure on kids. Some people just don&#x27;t have the ability, so we can&#x27;t pretend that STEM degrees are a panacea. I happened to like science &amp; be good at it, but I&#x27;ve taught&#x2F;tutored enough to know that it&#x27;s not for everyone.<p>Much of the value of a degree is simply as a marker, not as value-added by the process of getting the degree. We&#x27;re seeing an expansion in the number of roles that require degrees, but this may be just as much a consequence of the declining selectivity of a degree, not that the average job is increasingly requiring workers with higher skill levels.  At some point, this becomes detrimental to the overall productivity of society, and for individuals.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that talking about equality of outcome vs equality of opportunity has become a third rail in (neo)liberal circles.<p>&gt;we have a talent deficit in our teaching core. The only way to fix that problem is to make the profession more attractive.<p>Another no-brainer that we should really work on!')
