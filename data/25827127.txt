Adoption is definitely very difficult, especially the kind I did, international adoption of special needs children. My family didn&#x27;t understand, many people in the public don&#x27;t understand, and if they somewhat do they ask why I didn&#x27;t adopt an american child, to me a child is a child.<p>I will say any ounce of love you can give these kids is better than what they have, seriously, the things I&#x27;ve seen.. picture your life from age 1 - 16, tied to a crib, malnourished, not educated, treated like a feral animal weighing under 100 lbs now, and all kinds of spine issues because you were not ever allowed to walk! Or if you are lucky enough to be in a place you can develop a bit, but then you are molested and abused but still have the intellect of a feral animal.<p>Many of these kids don&#x27;t know what bonds of love are, but they can still form even tiny bits of it, and there will be times you think ..why the hell did i do this, but there are times when you think i am so happy i did this, you push through those hard times, get support from friends etc and the life of that kid will be a million times better than the life they would have had.<p>I think people don&#x27;t give themselves enough credit, and somewhere inside i know they could do it, I never thought I could do it. One thing I do know is, if we all sit around questioning what we can&#x27;t do we never will know what we could do and in the meantime children are suffering. I&#x27;m actually internally battling the want to adopt a third child vs being at limit!<p>Oh also adopting is an expensive venture, i went into debts to do this so i recommend to anyone get familiar with the community of adoptive parents and let them help fund raise.<p>But yes overall I think it&#x27;s a huge problem that gets little attention, and once and awhile you will see a super sad advertisement on TV and hear everyone whine about how bad it made them feel and how they shouldn&#x27;t show those kinds of ads. Big disappointment to me when i hear that, I feel like its more rug sweeping under<p>ah well')
