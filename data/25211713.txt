The fact that whatsapp is e2ee is a complete lie.<p>Use Signal for true e2ee, or if you don&#x27;t like it, Telegram. Telegram stores everything in the cloud tho. (they haven&#x27;t disclosed any private messages, and are much more trustworthy than Whatsapp). They just wanted to back up messages without giving it to Google&#x2F;Apple')
