No caching, 239kB transfer. With caching, it&#x27;s only a 3.1kB transfer.<p>Interestingly HN&#x27;s front page is an order of magnitude smaller in uncached transfer size. It does include some JS, but the lower perceived snappiness seems to owe to longer round trip times (for me anyway ~60ms for HN vs ~10ms for dev.l1x.be).')
