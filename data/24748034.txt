As in, ludicrously expensive, compared to other non-nuclear, non-fossil alternatives.<p>The article you point to talks about &quot;firm, low carbon sources&quot;.   This kind of source for this last bit would be something like hydrogen, not nuclear.   A nuclear reactor operating at 10% capacity factor to &quot;fill in&quot; for renewables would be producing power at $1&#x2F;kWh or more, which is uncompetitive vs. hydrogen by a massive margin.')
