I use Bluetooth headphones (Sony) and a Mac keyboard and touchpad, and they genuinely do just work - I don’t get spurious disconnects and everything sounds just fine. I have far more problems with BT on Windows 10 than on Mac - with devices failing to connect after the laptop is turned on and off, etc. Mac supports both AAC and aptX for audio codecs, too - so it works with pretty much any audio gear just fine.<p>It’s not going to feel faster on a single thread - because intel are not really any faster on a single thread. Having six cores is nice though!<p>The rest is all very subjective and it’s fair to have a difference of opinion there, though.')
