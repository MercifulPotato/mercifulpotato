It&#x27;s unused in English and therefore doesn&#x27;t really have a name, but people who have learned Spanish may call it a tilde. If you were studying Greek, you&#x27;d call it a &quot;circumflex&quot;. (Or, if you <i>were</i> Greek, you&#x27;d call it a &quot;perispomene&quot;.)<p>Spelling it as &quot;tilda&quot; just reflects the fact that a reduced vowel in English may be spelled in any number of different ways (and &quot;e&quot; is particularly unlikely); we can assume that superkuh is more familiar with the word orally than in writing.')
