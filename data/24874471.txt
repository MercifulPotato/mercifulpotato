But if abiogenesis were a common event on Earth, life should have formed all around, at distances far too large to immediately consume other proto-life forms. I also find it hard to imagine that, had this been a common event, a single strain of life should have resisted all the way to today.<p>Of course, until we manage to reproduce abiogenesis or find other examples of life, we won&#x27;t know for sure. But I would say the theory with the least amount of assumptions right now is that life only appeared once in Earth&#x27;s history or at least in one single relatively small place.')
