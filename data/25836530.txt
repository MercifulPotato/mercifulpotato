He needs regular users to stay on the platform.  The censorship isn&#x27;t to appease government regulators, it&#x27;s to keep from alienating regular people who don&#x27;t want to be exposed to it.  Deflecting blame to the regulators wouldn&#x27;t stop users from leaving and heading to a platform that did more effective damage control.')
