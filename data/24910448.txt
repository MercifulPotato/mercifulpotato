I&#x27;m only half-joking:<p>MPTCP works just fine on different internet connections, while ECMP assumes everything has the same bandwidth. And the MPTCP gives the reliability of TCP: if one connection is dead, it&#x27;ll detect it and transmit lost packets to the other one. It even supports break-before-make, so you can loose all your internet connections, then get a new one, and it&#x27;ll resume.')
