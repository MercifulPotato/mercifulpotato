I email them about it every year or so to keep it on their radar, but “they have no plans at this time to support ipv6”.<p>So long as the internet keeps working, my isp won’t care. I set up a HE ipv6 bridge, but it adds noticeable latency whenever it’s used, for sites like YouTube and Netflix.<p>I wonder if we need regulation to force the transition. The move to v6 might never complete otherwise.')
