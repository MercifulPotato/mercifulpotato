I can imagine that there will be websites that are actively using the accept parameter to distinguish between “regular visitors” and have their APIs at the same paths (didn’t Reddit do this at some point?), and thus your approach would break in this case.<p>I guess what this is really about is, I hate to say it, but something in the direction of the semantic web, where web servers (and in this case, CloudFlare et al) actually gain a deeper understanding of the content they serve, and a web browser &#x2F; crawler being able to query this content directly.')
