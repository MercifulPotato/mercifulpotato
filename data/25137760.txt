It&#x27;s quite likely and understandable that my friends will throw me under the bus if they see their livelihood in danger, but so far it hasn&#x27;t been the case for measly higher pay. And yet I have depended on the kindness of strangers who had nothing to gain by helping me enough times to acknowledge that it&#x27;s not selfishness what engages human behavior.\nAs always it kinda depends on the framing, you can even say that it&#x27;s on my best interest to act for the common good, so even altruism is selfish, but then you&#x27;ll have a useless definition of altruism.')
