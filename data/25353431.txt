Like, I&#x27;d get it if it was Flash or something (&#x27;cause that definitely has some real accessibility issues, and required a plugin to be installed), but the web platform is HTML, CSS <i>and JS</i>. Why artificially limit yourself to just two? It seems to have become a matter of pride to say &quot;works without JS&quot;, for absolutely no practical reason (it&#x27;s not like removing JS is some silver bullet for accessibility, no-js sites can and do still absolutely have problems with accessibility)')
