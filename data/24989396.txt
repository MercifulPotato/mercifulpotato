I have gnome-terminal with white background and black font, and ox uses its own dark-grey-blueish background with the black font from (I presume) my settings, making the title and the text of the file itself completely unreadable. I&#x27;m glad that there exists a system to customize the settings, but I&#x27;m too lazy to bother, and it should work by default anyway')
