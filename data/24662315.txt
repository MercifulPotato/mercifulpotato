Many applications expect to have this access. This is what it means to have user space applications. Flatpak is not about fixing or changing this.<p>- You&#x27;d expect individual applications might have out of date dependencies. Depending on the application this might be completely fine. This is not a security risk of flatpak but of the application. Developers are responsible for releasing updates, not flatpak.<p>So, works as advertised and intended. If your flatpak install has security bugs, update it. If you use a linux distribution that ships an out of date flatpak with fixed security issues, consider using a different one or update it yourself. If you use flatpak apps from developers that can&#x27;t be bothered to release updates or fix bugs, consider using something else.<p>Basically, flatpak not being a middlemen between you and the application developers kind of is the whole point. They don&#x27;t mention sandboxing on their frontpage, at all. This is not a goal. Instead, providing a cross distribution consistent installation experience is the main goal. They are not trying to be more secure than manually installing packages on your system.<p>So, these are not security bugs as far as I can see. It&#x27;s not a security nightmare. It&#x27;s fine. Actually looks interesting and might give it a try if&#x2F;when I get rid of my mac.')
