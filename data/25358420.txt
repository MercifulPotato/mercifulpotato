And like you say applying a convolution is computationally trivial especially compared to decoding a lossy audio codec and running a Bluetooth stack and antenna, which the headphones are already doing. Offloading this to the device is going to make absolutely no difference to battery life while increasing complexity and unreliability, while also restricting what processing can be done to static convolution with an impulse response. There is no reason to do this on the device.')
