It&#x27;s really sad to see Simple wind down, and it&#x27;s been the best bank I&#x27;ve had the chance to use. Their service has been unmatched compared even to the best local banks in my area. I&#x27;ve been a customer for nearly a decade now - wow. Early on I exchanged emails with Josh and the team not just regarding banking matters, but reporting bugs, design issues, or giving feedback. They were always receptive and I appreciated that they took the time to respond to my messages.<p>They had downtime once and credited my account $50. Simple, I know, but it was a gesture that really set them apart and humanized the company.<p>Thank you for starting Simple. Thank you Josh and the rest of the team at Simple: Shamir, Ian C., Brian M1, Toby, Adam, Rachel, Tom, Dustin, Zac, John, Ryan H., Melissa, Ian E., James, Liene, Collin, Matt S., Daron, Cameron, Eric, Jarred, Chris B., Shane, Dan H., Dan D., Robyn, Ryan D., Will M., Brian M2, Michael M., Chelsea, Kelly, Tristan, Will C., Justin, Steven, Matt W., Chris S., Charlie, Mimi, Orlena, Michael E., Krista, Bar, Jen, Matt H., Jake, Matt M.<p>:&#x27;)<p>PS: Startup marketing tip - Add a call to action at the bottom of your email newsletter that reminds your customers to share their experience with their friends and colleagues.
