It&#x27;s pretty much this narrative in reverse: our election was stolen + invented facts. anybody who believes that the pee tape was real ought to be able to make the logical jump to believing that Biden stole the election because there&#x27;s exactly the same amount of evidence for both.<p>The US has become so incredibly partisan though, that both sides literally experience different realities. The same people that believe the pee tape is real will scream for censorship of Trump&#x27;s lies and vice versa.')
