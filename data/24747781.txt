We are having to do a vendor swap on some document parsing code because one of our clients scanned a dependency and found it could be vulnerable in a context that it would never be exposed to in our application. These types of things make it really risky to go out and build your enterprise on top of someone else&#x27;s idea of a good time.<p>Virtually everything we do is in-house on top of first party platform libraries - i.e. `System.<i>`, `Microsoft.</i>`, etc. We exclusively use SQLite for persistence in order to reduce attack surface. Our deliverables to our customers consist of a single binary package that is signed and traceable all the way through our devops tool chain, which is also developed in-house for this express purpose of tightly enforcing software release processes.<p>This approach is <i>certainly</i> slower than vendoring out everything to the 7 winds, but there are many other advantages. Every developer knows how everything works up and down the entire vertical since its all sitting inside one happy solution just an F12 away. Being able to see a true, enterprise-wide reference count above a particular property or method is like a drug to me at this point. We are definitely over the hill and reaping dividends for building our own stack. It did take 3-4 years though. Most organizations cannot afford to do what we did.')
