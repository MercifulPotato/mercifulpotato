It came out around the same time as the McDLT, which was awesome.<p>(As an aside, one of the things that has always bugged me about McDonald&#x27;s is its menu inconsistency from market to market.  The franchisees have too much power, IMO.  I have to drive a few hundred miles each year to get McRibs because the local franchise owners won&#x27;t carry it.  And McRibs don&#x27;t freeze well.)')
