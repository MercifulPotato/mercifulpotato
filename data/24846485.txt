Item(by='wccrawford', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603277021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24844400, text='I&#x27;ve seen quite a few junior developers that either lack the &quot;inquisitiveness&quot; or that it&#x27;s too weak to overcome even a self-imposed deadline.  They get things &quot;working&quot; but don&#x27;t take time to understand the system first.<p>As senior developer, I have to go in and stop them repeatedly and make them rework it.  Up until now, I&#x27;ve told them <i>why</i> it&#x27;s wrong and that basically does all their thinking for them.  Now I&#x27;m wondering if I need to drag that step out and make them come up with the solution instead.<p>The problem I&#x27;ve been debating lately is how to instill that inquisitiveness in my junior and mid-level devs when they lack it.  (I&#x27;d been saying they don&#x27;t think holistically, but I think inquisitiveness is a good work for a trait that will lead to that.)<p>I&#x27;m thinking maybe I change my code reviews to have some video chat time where I lead them through the problem instead of telling them.')
