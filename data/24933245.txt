Of course they are, like any online community.  Basically every open online forum is vulnerable to vulgar, hateful and abusive content being posted.  The point this sub-thread is referring to, is that CoC&#x27;s are there as:<p>&gt; a way to assure newcomers that your project wasn&#x27;t going to allow racist trolling on the mailing list<p><i>This</i> is what seems a bit funny to me, because I would take it for granted that racist remarks would not be tolerated as a matter of course.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to me that you need a CoC to enforce this.<p>And I would repeat that in my personal experience, having been involved with OSS discussions for over 10 years, I have never personally encountered this.')
