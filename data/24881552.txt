Thank you for the detailed explanation. Do you suggest that I upload these screenshots to Wikipedia directly and indicate that these screenshots are available as fair use?<p>My intention here is to make these screenshots that I took on my computer while playing the game available on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Digger_(video_game)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Digger_(video_game)</a>, so that this Wikipedia article contains a few screenshots of the original 1983 PC booter version of Digger, not just that of the 1998 remastered version.')
