When things are bad once, people react. But if they&#x27;re bad regularly, people just get used to it. Bad is the new normal. And that&#x27;s very hard to change.<p>I think the only times I&#x27;ve seen significant progress had 2 common elements. One is a fucking disaster. Something has to blow up so badly that the grand poobahs feel the pain, and make sure everybody beneath them does too. The other is a bubble of sanity. Maybe it&#x27;s one team that has a few people like you, enough to say, &quot;Well in this team, for this product, we&#x27;re going to do it fucking right.&quot; And then that team has to show that doing it right produces great results, results that prevent the fucking disaster from ever happening again.<p>So for your sake, I hope you either change your organization or change your organization. You deserve better.')
