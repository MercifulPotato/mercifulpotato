Though of course the proportions varies with time, culture, level of development, norms, history, dogma, politics, etc., across the globe.<p>In Chinaâ€™s case where there are thousands of people in positions of substantial authority due to its size, with hundreds joining those ranks every year, it is credible that a few would seek short term advantages over all other considerations. The variability of human nature all but guarantees it. Hopefully the proportion will decline in the future, at the very least the long term self interest of the other folks will be a countervailing force.')
