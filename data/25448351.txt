You&#x27;d need a billion of them to test each America once every three months.<p>&gt;As to the effort&#x2F;expense, you&#x27;d think we&#x27;d be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, no?<p>Only if the resources used were entirely unrelated, which I doubt.  Every public health offical&#x27;s man-hour should be dedicated to setting up vaccination sites. Every medical manufacturing facility should be making vaccine components and accessories.<p>I very much doubt you could set up mass testing of asymptomatic people without making trade offs regarding resources for mass vaccinations.')
