Of course, this will induce some quality loss if encoded to lossy format again. But would effectively be &quot;legal&quot; as the tool would run the youtube&#x27;s &quot;DRM&quot; and be not distinct from normal browser in any way. I guess the headless browser could maybe perhaps just download the stream to disk as well.')
