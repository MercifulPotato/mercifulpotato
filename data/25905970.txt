We’d add a new permitted URL to support a newly integrated site, only to have the extension disable itself for all our customers, most of which wouldn’t even use that new integration.<p>While I understand the reasoning behind such an automated disabling, but it probably could be done better. Like delaying the update (and the disabling part) until the user made a choice.<p>Also very hard to inform users of this issue after it has occurred. Caused us so much trouble. Also a reason we went with the admittedly less safe blanket permission.')
