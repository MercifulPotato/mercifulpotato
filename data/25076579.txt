For example, you can drive someone to suicide using the power of gossip... that could be called toxic feminity, I suppose.<p>And it is more likely to be tolerated at schools than e.g. fighting back against your bully, which is a healthy masculine behavior, but according to &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy makes you exactly as bad as the bully.<p>This is the cultural problem, that we are only allowed to talk about the parts of masculine behavior that are considered bad, and the parts of feminine behavior that are considered good. In reality, both are a mixed bag.')
