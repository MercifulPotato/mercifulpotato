Why should I consider starting at byte-arrays?<p>&gt; there are plenty of perfectly valid Unicode strings for which this question doesn&#x27;t have a meaningful answer.<p>I don&#x27;t get it. Why does the existence of degenerate cases invalidate the usefulness of a Unicode lib? If I want to know how many letters are in a string, I can probably get a useful answer from a Unicode lib. Not for all edge-cases, but I can decide on the trade-offs. If I have a byte-array, I start at a lower level.')
