It leaves you with this exact juxtaposition of seeing the fantastic progress being made with mouse models and seeing the very real suffering on such a large scale.<p>The fact that many experiments are okay on non-human animals but not humans is speciesist.  Still, it’s the line we are all most comfortable with.  I’d rather not have people be experimented on.
