Item(by='ev1', descendants=None, kids=[24654609], score=None, time=1601576436, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24654291, text='&gt; You might have millions of people watching an AI-changed film and think that what they are seeing is more accurate than the original, since it transmits more information (detail, color, etc). But if that additional information is made up, it&#x27;s actually not more accurate, and maybe actually less accurate (i.e. wrong color instead of no color). That nuance is going to be hard for a lot of people to understand.<p>I can confidently say there is a 100% chance that ML&#x2F;AI-invented content (colours, fill-ins during upscaling, textures, etc.) already outperforms genuine historical content in every possible way in terms of outreach. Just look at any &quot;today in history&quot; youtube or twitter channel and compare it to any actual museum or historical society&#x27;s website&#x2F;channel&#x2F;social media. Orders of magnitude difference.<p>On the tweets you see replies commenting about how beautiful and vibrant a [false colour, invented content] image is. Hell, those places will post blatantly totally false content (like.. a comedian) and say it&#x27;s a historical image: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5028121&#x2F;history-twitter-photo&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5028121&#x2F;history-twitter-photo&#x2F;</a><p>They are not there for historical accuracy, or accuracy of any kind, those accounts are 100% purely to farm clicks and likes to spam with later.')
