Every user, despite whether they would use the feature set must be licensed as Ultimate under the current model.<p>I really wish there was some flexibility in how the licensing model works — right now, the all in approach is prohibitive to bringing on new users, as you need to justify the $1,200 upfront cost per user added — not all users &#x2F; projects need to be licensed under the same tier — some user&#x27;s needs are basic and cannot justify the cost of a license.<p>--<p>Some thoughts on how this could be addressed...<p>A) Assign a licence tier to a user (ie: Some users get Ultimate features, others are on premium with limited access to features)<p>B) Assign licenses based on projects — if a project has &quot;Ultimate&quot; features enabled, all users in that project count towards an &quot;Ultimate&quot; seat')
