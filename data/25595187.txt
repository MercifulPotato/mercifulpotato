It&#x27;s not that the legit companies are hiring sleezy companies, but that they have promotional programs that other companies &quot;sign up&quot; and join to be a partner. The partners are really unknown entities and there&#x27;s not much in the way of checking. But then these partners start contributing and getting people signed up. It&#x27;s impossible for the legit companies (if you can really call any major conglomerate a legit company) to know whether those signups were obtained through spammers or what have you. So maybe it&#x27;s these promotional networks that need to be banned.<p>Problem is, almost all of the advertising and lead generation in the world happens through networks like that. Some of it is legit, some is not.<p>So I do think it&#x27;s correct to go after robocalling and make it stop.<p>Now one thing I don&#x27;t agree on is the WAY in which we&#x27;re doing it via tracing or whatever. Instead if I was the FCC I would simply require, starting today, that all calls made in the US must be signed to be completed. I would rather have no phone calls in the US for a month than let this shit go on indefinitely.<p>Something like that would force all carriers to immediately figure out a way to get every phone call signed. Then once we have calls signed, the spammers would lose their right to call pretty much after a few calls are made and reported.<p>I think the current strategy is pretty hand-wavy and doesn&#x27;t have any end in sight.')
