I believe that this is a misunderstanding of how propositional logic works. If the propositions or axioms that you start with are sound, and if you correctly apply all inference rules, then the propositions that you derive will also be sound. &quot;Missing axioms&quot; that you did not use do no matter, regardless of their soundness.')
