Firing someone is not an easy task. Unless it&#x27;s an egregious case (violation of laws&#x2F;policy, sexual assault, etc), firing someone, even someone that literally produces zero work product, can take <i>months</i> or even a year. That&#x27;s a slacker that is going to sit on your payroll, disrupting your teams flow, and eating your budget for months&#x2F;a year while you build your case for firing.<p>Then, even after you fire them (or let&#x27;s even say by some miracle you were able to fire them quickly), it costs <i>a lot</i> of money and time to hire someone new. That&#x27;s yet more time and budget that isn&#x27;t going into your team, and your team is also a person short while you go through the process of hiring and then training.<p>It is leagues and leagues better for &quot;the slacker situation&quot; to not be a problem at all, and it is much less likely to be a problem if prospective slackers aren&#x27;t given the opportunity to slack off at home to begin with.')
