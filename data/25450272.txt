Yeah, games that try to mix the mobility of regular games with VR (e.g. Population One) require you to use the joystick to move, which completely breaks the immersion for me. It just feels like a lesser version of the real deal.<p>Blaston and Superhot on the other hand tie you to the same physical boundaries you&#x27;re actually in and make me feel like I&#x27;m actually in the game. I dodge bullets by stepping aside or crouching. I physically aim to land that headshot.<p>Even though the graphics are simple it feels more realistic since my maneuvers represent what I can actually do with my body in real life.<p>I think the key is to accept that you can never be the John Wick you are in regular games and add some unique mechanics utilizing the restrictions. Superhot has the slow motion which makes you feel like you&#x27;re in the Matrix when pulling off good moves and Blaston has a really cool gun gameplay (having to balance picking up guns, firing, throwing and dodging simultaneously) and the intensity of standing right next to another player trying to shoot you in the face.<p>Blaston has also managed to capture gestures in a great way and there&#x27;s a meta game for greeting (waving, bowing), praising (thumbs up, clapping hands), doing GG (bumping fists with the other player) etc so the other person feels really alive. That&#x27;s something novel I haven&#x27;t experienced before.<p>It&#x27;s 100% a trade-off though with the core gameplay always being inferior due to the limitations. Game developers really need to work around that fact not to end up just making a bleak copy of a &quot;real&quot; game. It&#x27;s also probably a different target audience since it should produce different types of games if done right. Kinect is not a bad comparison but I think the potential of VR is much greater.')
