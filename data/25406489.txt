Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607867044, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25404267, text='This is a serious, non-sarcastic response: honestly, sincerely, in my experience as a HN reader off and on for years, a commenter for 6 months, and occasional author of submitted articles (usually submitted by someone other than me) that have reached #1, violation of the HN guidelines is the <i>norm</i> on HN, and abiding by the guidelines is the exception.<p>I myself have been personally attacked on here, or been interpreted uncharitably, etc., countless times. Mostly with no moderators intervening. In general I have no objection to &quot;policing&quot; the comments, if it is done well, and consistently, but the problem with policing, not just on HN but in general, is the selective, arbitrary enforcement of rules.<p>Just looking at the current case, for example, why was my reply flagged, but the comment I replied to, which you also cited as violating the guidelines, was not flagged?<p>Moreover, IMO this whole submission seems to be a strange time to be pedantic about enforcing the guidelines. After all, the submission itself was flagged as very low quality, and many of the commenters were justifiably complaining about the low quality of the submission and wondering why it was #1. The author is deserving of some rebuke, especially for the &quot;nefariously hides itself from Activity Monitor&quot; bit, which is technically false, indeed impossible. The author should know better, being or having been a Mac software engineer himself.<p>In fairness, HN is no worse off than any other site that allows comments from the general public. HN wants to believe that its comments are higher quality than other sites, but the reality is that it&#x27;s not really true, and it&#x27;s hard to see how that will ever become true. Maybe it was true in the distant past when HN was less trafficked, I don&#x27;t know.')
