Rotating tires and replacing them asymmetrically (for example, after a tire explosion for me) is regular practice. If a small difference in wear disables critical safety systems and engages them in inappropriate circumstances, this can lead to deaths.<p>It seems simple enough to detect that, on a straight road with the steering wheel balanced, one of the wheels makes more rotations on average; then you calibrate the algorithm based on that. Sounds like a bug in this very algorithm, or maybe some hardware defect on your specific vehicle (i.e a sensor) that interferes with it.')
