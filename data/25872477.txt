It was a disease. Modifying Gnome themes. Downloading custom launchers for Android. Tweaking the colors representing my calendars. All with good intentions, mind you. &quot;This green mountain background will calm me down in the morning&quot; etc.<p>At some point, I realised that if I just take a deep breath, slow down, and accept that I can modify <i>myself</i> to align with my tool rather than the other way around, a lot of friction is removed.<p>I set my background on every device to a solid black, and it&#x27;s now three years since I changed them. My trello boards are still blue background. My calendars are whatever the default theme is. It&#x27;s sometimes nice to tweak the tool for your need, but it&#x27;s also sometimes nice to understand that everything doesn&#x27;t need to be a huge annoyance. One can just adapt and move on.')
