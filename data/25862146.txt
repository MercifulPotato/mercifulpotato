As people get high up in the position, the view of the company is shaped by their staff and reports. The VP never hear of the problem simply because no one ever told the VP. VP never asked about it because again no one ever told the VP. That&#x27;s why corporates seem to ask a million surveys and reports because there is no other way to know that information.<p>What if employee surveys were never conducted? The VP would only know about the employee satisfaction issue if everyone left, well beyond the point that it&#x27;s fixable. If you are on the ground, it&#x27;s easy to ask your coworkers for that information. But if you are the VP, that&#x27;s not possible.')
