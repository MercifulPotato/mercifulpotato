You&#x27;ve wrote percentages as an example, how they should be understood? The frequency of altered behavior? But there are tons of different factors altering behavior, as personal so situational factors. They somehow also should be measured.<p>I would be much more skeptical, if they provided measurements outside of ordinal scale of measurement[1]. One can compare two setups on basis less&#x2F;greater, but not to measure them in absolute scale.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Level_of_measurement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Level_of_measurement</a>')
