The entire aerospace industry is government funded because the government has huge amounts of money and offers large contracts to many companies.  By this measure, Palantir and many younger startups are also government funded.  It&#x27;s a meaningless statement.  Bash SpaceX for their work culture and other issues all you want, but their business model is just fine.')
