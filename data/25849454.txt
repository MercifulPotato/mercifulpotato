Even on a single-user device, security issues are not isolated. An infected machine will likely be used for things like spam and DDOS.<p>If you make something available for people to toggle that improves their experience, people are going to take advantage of that even if they don&#x27;t really grasp or decide to ignore the consequences. In the case of updates the improved experience is not being nagged or forced to restart an application or the whole OS. And unfortunately the only way to really gatekeep that control to people who know what they&#x27;re doing is giving it enterprise pricing.')
