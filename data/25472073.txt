He&#x27;s a chess grandmaster who is not mystifying chess, but pointing out how a lifetime of rigorous chess playing has taught him the value of concentration. He acknowledges that the very same thing occurs in people in other disciplines, athletes for example.<p>It&#x27;s not an article about the virtue of nerds but about the combination of attention, flow experience and concentration, in the face of a culture that neglects all three but the latter in particular.<p>And I think he is very right and chess can teach us important lessons here, as can programming, or craftsmanship, or participation in the arts among other things.<p>Particularly important is the point about autonomy. Making concentration and understanding of our own mind through games like chess a priority is liberating. Through things like chess it is possible to move from being distracted by external rewards towards understanding one&#x27;s own cognition the focus of life, without which no genuine thinking is possible.')
