Given the high cost of accessing space and the extreme resource constraints, space is likely to be dominated by multinationals and billionaires.<p>Some forms of feudalism where serfs must pay rent for their land or otherwise starve are technically still a free market, just one where the market power is extremely asymmetric.<p>&quot;Voluntary cooperation&quot; implies options and a liquid competitive market. If your Mars colony is going to die and you ask mine for resources to bail you out, and I condition that on being the supreme emperor of your colony, that rapidly degrades.<p>Further, there is no reason to believe firms won&#x27;t engage in straight up theft and warfare. If you just captured an asteroid that has enough rare earth metals to collapse the prices on Earth and space isn&#x27;t governed by our laws, then many companies would be funding a mercenary army to take that asteroid from you.')
