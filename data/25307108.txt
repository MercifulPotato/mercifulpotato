Yet the consortium that spent billions on the human genome project still got congratulated. What&#x27;s ironic is that when they said they sequenced the human genome they still had as many asterisks to that statement as this broad DeepMind statement has. In fact, the sequencing of the human genome claim was probably more disingenuous than DeepMind because, and this is important, they didn&#x27;t make up this definition - the CASP organizers did. This team just met a pre defined standard as what&#x27;s accepted as &quot;solving of protein folding&quot; and this brilliant team met this challenge.<p>Academics calling this hyperbole should fire every university&#x27;s PR team because the amount of hyperbole they add to every press release about a paper where they &quot;cured&quot; cancer in mice is 10x larger than this.<p>Academia is fundamentally broken; the cracks started appearing in the sixties (read Hammings lecture notes), and have all but metastatasized throughout, especially in biology. We are all dying faster because of this (Google the Alzheimer&#x27;s cabal). Academia is now just bunch of overperforming hacks who are honestly not that good at anything except sitting in circles in NIH grant review panels giving millions to each other while giving &quot;constructive criticism&quot; like this to what is clearly a monumental achievement, because if they don&#x27;t then they reinforced how useless they are together as a group.<p>Going back to this hacky article, of course this is the first step, and there is much to be ironed out. But in the words of Sydney Brenner, a great scientist from a time when actually smart, humble people became professors, &quot;The entry of large numbers of American ... into the field will ensure that all the chemical details ...  will be elucidated.&quot; [1]<p>We are definitely now in a fairly deterministic path towards figuring out protein folding for all practical purposes. The few academics who still have humility and foresight see this. DeepMind is obligated to release enough results and there are still some sane minds left in academia that they will do what they are okay at, which is filling in the details.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nemaplex.ucdavis.edu&#x2F;General&#x2F;Biographies&#x2F;SBrenner.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nemaplex.ucdavis.edu&#x2F;General&#x2F;Biographies&#x2F;SBrenner.htm</a>')
