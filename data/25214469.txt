Decide you want to see it spinning clockwise, then look at it. Now look away, and tell yourself it&#x27;s going to be spinning anti-clockwise, then look at it again.<p>I now that&#x27;s not quite what you wanted, but I imagine you could achieve a similar result by showing a clockwise&#x2F;anticlockwise cue on the image itself.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Spinning_Dancer.gif" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Spinning_Dancer.gif</a>')
