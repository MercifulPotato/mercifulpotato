And even if they did, its still possible to predict them much more frequently than they do occur.<p>&gt; and saying ZeroHedge overpredicts is wrong.<p>Just doing a quick search, ZeroHedge seems to have predicted a recession, counting only predictions with a one year or shorter forward window, literally every year since the end of the of the Great Recession. In many of those years, they made at least one prediction where the window was effectively negative, as they claimed that the US was <i>already in</i> a recession that just wasn&#x27;t yet recognized.<p>So, yes, ZeroHedge <i>significantly</i> overpredicts recessions, as they have predicted not less than 11 of the last 1 recessions.<p>&gt; The normal financial press are reckless in assuming that recessions are not imminent.<p>That&#x27;s a non-sequitur, in any case.<p>&gt; Looking 5+ years into the future to assess the present state is prudent.<p>Sure, but if ZeroHedge was consistently predicting a recession within 5 years, they&#x27;d <i>still</i> be overpredicting by quite a lot (not if this was 1950-1990, but it isn&#x27;t), but they are much, much worse than that.')
