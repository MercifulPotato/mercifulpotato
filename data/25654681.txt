As far as I can tell, the more they dominate a market the <i>lower</i> their prices.<p>Amazon does seem interested in monopolization, but mostly for the ability to squeeze suppliers into even tighter pricing- not turning around on consumers. Moreover, similar arguments were made for years about Wal-Mart and never materialized. Increasing market share seemed to go hand-and-hand with &quot;Everyday Low Prices&quot;.<p>Who knows. Maybe it really is their secret strategy. One day the shoe will drop, and Amazon will start bleeding consumers in the markets they&#x27;ve grown to dominate. Somehow I doubt it though, and so far their behavior gives zero indication of it.')
