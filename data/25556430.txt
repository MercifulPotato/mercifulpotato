I&#x27;d always remembered it wasn&#x27;t a cartoon or live action - but something in between. So it turns out it was the scenes of &#x27;death&#x27; from Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;The Storyteller&quot;. Just something about the creepy face that did it as a kid. Was definitely a strange sensation to connect it all and see the images anew. Humans&#x2F;memories&#x2F;brains are weird.  (The Storyteller, Season 1, Ep 5 - it&#x27;s on Amazon Prime in Canada)')
