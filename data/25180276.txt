I shopped around and purchased a quarantine guitar this year (a fantastic 1990 Alvarez-Yairi DY-90), and Reverb was a much better deal and a better shopping experience. Reverb is a platform, and so they&#x27;re getting everything from individual sellers to small music shops all over the world. I looked at things on Guitar Center&#x27;s site, but they&#x27;re just selling the same factory-built stuff every other major retailer sells.')
