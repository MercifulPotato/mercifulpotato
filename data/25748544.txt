As a Canadian, I don&#x27;t have to worry about my family being harmed by racially motivated violence and discrimination. Especially since some are in demographics who disproportionally experience racially motivated violence.<p>Not everyone in the world idealizes the American tech sector as much as America thinks they do. Personally, I&#x27;m more drawn to the EU tech sector.<p>Finally, Canada&#x27;s tech sector isn&#x27;t worse somehow. Canadians are different, therefore our Canadian sector is going to be different too. Canadian tech companies (&quot;startups&quot; specifically) tend to be more driven by stability than generating the largest valuation possible.
