We&#x27;re just stumbling in the dark trying ideas.<p>I&#x27;m curious if you&#x27;ve actually had a chance to read Ken Thompson&#x27;s compiler virus hack. The Guix bootstrap path from stage0 still doesn&#x27;t solve the problem as at the end of the day all compilers eventually self-host from a previous version. So whatever compiler you&#x27;re using for stage0 can have the virus, inject it into the produced binary, &amp; you&#x27;ll never find it since the virus is in the binary not in the source. Now obviously this is an extreme example and no one actually has any knowledge of whether or not such attacks are practical or have existence proofs beyond a proof of concept.<p>My overall point though is that everything boils down to trust &amp; the question is who you choose to trust &amp; where. Ultimately, we&#x27;re all &quot;careless&quot; on that front as there&#x27;s just too many dimensions to evaluate on. Beyond just basic malware packaged with the code, is the privacy being respected? Are the security practices good enough to withstand attacks? etc etc. Complaining that WhatsApp is slurping a copy of your messages that you are reporting to them &amp; therefore E2E encryption isn&#x27;t valuable is a fallacious &amp; misdirected argument IMHO.')
