Give some examples with some classes and you&#x27;re done. Or give examples of one class and let the neural net generate new ones. Doing away with the abstraction beforehand is an enticing prospect.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to solve a well understood business problem sure but my issue with this is that you pigeonhole yourself and your solution. I&#x27;m much more interested in understanding the model than doing the implementation because that allows you to build on top of what you get out of the box in a framework for example. It&#x27;s like learning React before learning Javascript. It might be a good short term solution but long term it certainly isn&#x27;t.')
