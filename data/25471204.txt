Cyberpunk actually locks you into missions.<p>That mission early on in the game, where you are stuck in a car shooting at other cars, would never be part of a Deus Ex game. Deus Ex always gives players multiple ways to finish a mission, and rewards exploration. Cyberpunk puts you on rails and literally tells you what to do.<p>In DX Mankind Divided you were able to leave certain areas and come back, and achieve objectives in any order you wanted. Almost all of the buildings in the Prague zone were open to entry, and contained realistic NPCs and furniture -- e.g. all of the apartments in an apartment building, all of the shops, train stations, bars, etc. It felt a lot more like a real world than Cyberpunk.<p>Even Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines was more open than Cyberpunk, and that came out at least 16 years ago. It was also pretty broken on release, but even so it felt like more of a real world.')
