I actually use it to play the game remotely from my linux desktop on my mbp via steam link. The desktop is currently using integrated graphic so I can only play indie games at the moment. I&#x27;m still waiting for my new gpu to arrive so I can&#x27;t test any of the AAA game.<p>Funny thing is I sometimes use steam remote play to access my linux desktop since it&#x27;s faster and has very little lag compared to VNC. I simply add nautilus to steam game library so I can launch it remotely via steam link, then press &quot;super&#x2F;âŒ˜&quot; key to access the desktop.')
