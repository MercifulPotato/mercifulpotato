Hydrogen requires 2x as much energy according to anything we know right now. Unless the hydrogen capital expenses have a way of getting cheaper than lithium ion capital expense, then there&#x27;s little chance of this ever happening.<p>So when you say &quot;pretty soon now,&quot; you must mean 2040 at the earliest. There&#x27;s certainly a chance, when you look at the progress of PV solar over the past 40 years, for example, but it is hugely speculative and a long term bet, not a short term one.')
