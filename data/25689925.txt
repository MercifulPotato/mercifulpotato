Slightly expanding the atmosphere causing the mass to be further from the center, slowing down the rotation.<p>The problem is that the atmosphere is so light compared to the rest of the earth that even at the nanosecond level I have doubts you would see this effect.  To affect the rotation of the Earth by whole seconds&#x2F;year you need to be talking about yottatons of rock shifting.')
