Generally you use the frequency that has been legalised for use in the region you operate it in. I wonder if this automatically switches to the suitable frequency based off coordinates (when using a gps’d board) I’m sure it would be trivial to implement. Ah good ole opensource. This really is a great solution, riding around New Zealand the only solution is a SPOT tracker which charges like a wounded bull so I love that this is disrupting this space (and using clever tech - heck might throw one of these on the moto just to use it for security)')
