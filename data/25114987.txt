Literally you buy buy fish on the same terms as Phoenicians and Greeks <i>before the Roman Empire</i>.<p>The livelihoods surrounding most of these trades, and frankly most &#x27;working people&#x27; is extremely common and normative, and could hardly be Romanticized by anyone but a fairly small (but growing) group of people living in modernist bubbles, almost detached from the entire history of &#x27;common culture&#x27;.<p>The writing is nice, but the perspective of the alien observer, an &#x27;outsider&#x27; to what would otherwise be be literally normative life for regular people, is almost a little eerie.')
