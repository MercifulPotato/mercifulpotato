Look at the Sun. You can say that exists. Look at sunlight. You can only say that&#x27;s bright. The sun only exists because everything looks at it and agrees it&#x27;s bright.<p>Build a really good telescope, point it at dark region of space. The telescope emits an energy wave making every atom in it&#x27;s wake see a bright spot at that once dark region. Did humans just create a distant star or galaxy out of nothing? With instruments inside the sun, or matter waves far off in orbit, or coherent control of pair production, or imaging black holes, I think we could make a telescope like that. Does nature do that already, and would that help us live better lives, from targeted medical imaging to microwaving a distant asteroid.')
