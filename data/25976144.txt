I&#x27;ve had my car for 9 years (~120k miles - sat rarely driven for a couple years in the middle). The only maintenance I&#x27;ve had is oil changes (2 or 3 times a year, so $100 estimate seems accurate), brake pads (once or maybe twice? average annual cost maybe $50), engine air filter (like $10, once or twice a year), tires (similar with electric - cheaper for my car with 15&quot; wheels). The only unexpected maintenance was an electric short in the windshield wiper (could happen just as easily to an electric. $100 labour and a $30 part from a scrap yard)')
