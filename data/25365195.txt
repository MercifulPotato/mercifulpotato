Meanwhile, we haven&#x27;t really tried option 1, we are just at the beginning of this censorship of trash information.<p>In general, I find many talking of &quot;freedom&quot; in US history are using it as a shield to ignore sticky issues and allow bad solutions to reign...freedom to own slaves, freedom to expand wherever and kill any natives there, freedom of pollution, freedom of marketing with harmful lies...freedom is an over-used and intellectually lazy concept.')
