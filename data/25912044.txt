Item(by='totalZero', descendants=None, kids=[25912276], score=None, time=1611630963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25911899, text='&gt; most analysts<p>Counterpoint:<p>&quot;Most analysts&quot; are hum-drum Wall Street hacks who cover dozens of companies and don&#x27;t really have a clue about how the lion&#x27;s share of them are run. I remember a few years back there was one analyst who kept talking about how NAND keeps getting cheaper and that&#x27;s hurting memory suppliers...but the analyst&#x27;s metrics didn&#x27;t normalize for advancements in NAND speed nor the maturing of capital investments, so the analyst was basically looking at totally expected price declines over time and interpreting it as for some kind of static commodity while claiming it as a bear thesis.<p>A few of them are really clever and knowledgeable. The rest are chumps.<p>It&#x27;s extremely difficult to judge GME based on regular metrics because their long-term outlook is a function of strategy and their short-term survival is a function of COVID. Sure, the company sells stuff that you can buy online, and sure, they sell it at malls and other places where nobody goes these days, but its stock was over-shorted and this was going to happen sooner or later anyway.<p>Maybe my numbers are off, so correct me if I&#x27;m wrong....At today&#x27;s closing price, GME, which has $6B&#x2F;yr revenue, is worth a sixth of BBY, which has 43B&#x2F;yr revenue.')
