As a result, any attempt to inject the reality of her being completely wrong and rightfully fired immediately solicits downvotes from the resident partisan hacks on HN.  They don&#x27;t get the fact that she made false claims in May about a conspiracy to hide deaths, and has a history of being sensationalist and dishonest.<p>Rebekah Jones reminds me of Alex Jones:<p>Loyal following, every bad thing that happens to her further bolsters her conspiratorial claims, and she grossly exaggerates her own credentials.<p>You&#x27;re not saying she deserved the police raid and neither am I.  We are just trying to point out the reality that she isn&#x27;t some whistleblower hero but that doesn&#x27;t fit the political narrative that the partisan hacks on here have accepted so we will be downvoted into oblivion.<p>The partisan hacks will continue to call her a data scientist when she never even called herself that and is not remotely trained for that because it makes their narrative more powerful.  That&#x27;s what politicization does:\nany statement of fact that counters the narrative will be ignored or rejected or reacted to with hostility.')
