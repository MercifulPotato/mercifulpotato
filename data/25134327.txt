It&#x27;s not necessarily wrong but is it the best fit for everyone?<p>Of course if you are looking at a startup, needing the structured environment is viewed as a weakness, but the successful startup hub itself is a testament to how long a little structure can go.<p>I am someone who thrives in structure. For example, in academia, I&#x27;m not in need of resources, passion for learning, or direction. I simply need an instructor who expects things from me with hard deadlines.<p>For someone like me who reaches out for advice, all these self improvement methods of hustle and driving your own goals are really non-starters. I know I cannot consistently engage in them. From that lens I will always be a failure, although my work under various organizations is highly valued and well compensated.<p>The best way for me is to find the best existing structure who goals are aligned with mine, working within it to achieve maximum mutual value, and reassessing whether this structure is still the best for me, or looking elsewhere.')
