Today I find it frustrating that I need an object first. In my mind, I already know what action I want to do. I know what function I want to call. I start with that and look at what arguments it takes in.<p>OOP programming is frustrating now, because instead of going straight for the function I have to locate the appropriate object first. That is like a big detour.<p>&gt; If you write your code as a bag of data structures and a bag of functions that you pass those ad-hoc data structures to, it is less clear which things play together.<p>Noting suggest you need to write code like that. People who write functional code tend to have a lot of well defined data types. I use well defined data types in Julia. Haskell and OCaml developers use well defined data types. We are not using using dictionaries or something.')
