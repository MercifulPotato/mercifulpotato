I think many are missing the use case. You use your own favorite and highly customizable text editor? Cool! This might not be for you.<p>I think this would be a fantastic text editor for anyone new to the terminal. Provides some syntax highlighting, a nice background, line numbers, tabs, and mostly familiar controls without a ton of setup.<p>I think there are still quite a few improvements Iâ€™d love for it to have, but this might be the thing I recommend to anyone first starting out in the terminal who wants a bit of a nicer editor than nano.')
