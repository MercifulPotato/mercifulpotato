People now effectively expect two things about personal printers:<p>- They&#x27;re cheap<p>- They&#x27;re crap<p>TFA is an example of this mindset. But then if you go to the store expecting to get a piece of shit printer, you&#x27;re clearly going for the cheapest available option. Which means that you get a crap inkjet that you&#x27;ll have to replace in two years, and then you&#x27;ll buy an other crap cheap inkjet.<p>But I agree with both of you: after a few iterations of this cycle I finally decided to know better and bought the cheapest Brother B&amp;W laser printer and it&#x27;s been a joy. It just works.')
