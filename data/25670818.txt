Cass Everitt had been doing some personal work on the iPhone, so he helped me get everything set up for local iPhone development here, which is a lot more tortuous than you would expect from an Apple product.  As usual, my off the cuff estimate of &quot;Two days!&quot; was optimistic, but I did get it done in four, and the game is definitely more pleasant at 8x the frame rate.<p>And I had fun doing it.&quot;')
