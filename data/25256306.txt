People die every day, a lot of them. Sending a check to an American that died and hasn’t been reported upwards to the federal government is not surprising. Sending money to non Americans who are not in America is a bit of a head scratcher. How did that even happen?  I don’t care enough about 34 million dollars to look any further into it but I am curious about who these people are and how they got sent checks by the US government. Did they live here once upon a time and left? That would make sense to me, not dissimilar from the dead not dead people, just stale data and speed was the stated goal so stale data is to be expected.')
