I don&#x27;t see any justification for this claim in the article. There are plenty of ways to implement this feature that don&#x27;t involve permanently throwing out dynamic range on all your SDR panels. I&#x27;m not even convinced from reading this that they aren&#x27;t HDR panels to begin with - the idea of an iPhone having a 9-bit or 10-bit panel in it isn&#x27;t that strange to me, and while that wouldn&#x27;t be enough for like Professional-Grade HDR it&#x27;s enough that you could pair it with dynamic backlight control and convince the average user that it&#x27;s full HDR.<p>Considering Apple controls the whole stack and uses a compositor there&#x27;s nothing stopping them from compositing to a 1010102 or 111110 framebuffer and then feeding that higher-precision color data to the panel and controlling the backlight. Since they control the hardware they can know how bright it will be (in nits) at various levels.')
