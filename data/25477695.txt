That new code or config is being deployed shows these problems (new feature rollouts, migrations, scaled resilience, etc.) are not yet formally solved.  As such, things not known will become known — and usually be revealed in prod.<p>Similarly, in technology systems, there’s no such thing as human error, only uncaught error conditions.<p>Postmortems capture learning, so the conditions can be caught next time.<p>Publishing them shows the engineering organization understands and applies this learning loop.')
