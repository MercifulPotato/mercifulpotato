Granted, beginner-friendly documentation is a bit harder to find, but I was able to set it up for my home network through OpenWRT in a couple of afternoons as well.<p>In the process, by necessity I also learned something about setting up local DNS properly, which in the end has been very beneficial also for IPv4 hobbyist use cases.<p>The comparison with HTTP1 vs. HTTP2 seems a bit unfair â€“ it was never possible to write plain IPv4 packets to the network via Telnet&#x2F;nc.<p>And if you&#x27;re talking about the availability of tooling: Don&#x27;t forget that IPv4 is several decades more mature than IPv6 :)')
