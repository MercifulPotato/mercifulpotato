If they act in sync and decide to stop working the company is screwed.<p>google can very well ignore a union of consumers. The most they can do is stop using the services in sync, and arguably the fact that they&#x27;re trying to organise a consumer union rather than take their business elsewhere is a red flag that they&#x27;ll find it difficult to do so.<p>To put it another way, assuming that the sum of all workers is as important as the sum of all consumers, there are ~150k google employees and ~4.5 billion consumers. since these numbers are several orders of magnitude apart, to have a real effect you&#x27;d need about 10k members of a consumer union to have the equivalent force of a worker union with a single member.')
