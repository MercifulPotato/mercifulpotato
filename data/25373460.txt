Obviously any DOM mutation stuff stuff needs to \nhappen in the frontend when it runs in the browser, but you can absolutely import jquery and use parts of it during server-side compiling or rendering steps in node.<p><pre><code>    import $ from &quot;jquery&quot;\n</code></pre>\n&gt; Deno will never ever do that<p>Why would Deno take such an antagonistic approach to supporting the most common setup that everyone uses with npm? Wouldn&#x27;t it be trivial to just fall back to checking node_modules for named packages? I want to use Deno! This seems like it&#x27;s deliberately making transitions difficult for anyone using npm.')
