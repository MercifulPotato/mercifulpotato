We talk about net neutrality, but shouldn&#x27;t we apply the same standard to hosts like AWS?<p>I think this question conflates &quot;private company exercises right to refuse service&quot; and &quot;private company decides what&#x27;s acceptable speech&quot;. The internet is not truly centralized and no tech giant has a monopoly on speech. There remains plenty of internet real estate to host ideas on that&#x27;s not owned by tech giants. I think it should remain the right of these companies not to do business with organizations they choose not to and that said organization should also have the right to find another provider who will do business with them (or create their own if need be).<p>Is this not basically the same as porn hosting? There are hosts who don&#x27;t want to be associated with it, and there are hosts who have no qualms taking porn money.')
