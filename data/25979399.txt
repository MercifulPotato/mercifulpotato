Thanks for the chuckle.<p>&gt; How did you go about getting the posts taken down&#x2F;made invisible?<p>I made my own legal threats, basically. One site was a ProBoards forum, so I contacted them. I didn&#x27;t pretend to be a lawyer or anything, just told them I&#x27;d get one if needed. I never received any acknowledgement, but the posts did disappear from view. I think they were made private, not deleted. Good enough as far as I was concerned. The other site was kind of a cross between Wikipedia and Quora. In that case I found the site owner and sent a similar email. That time I did get a quite-reasonable response, and the article was taken down.<p>I haven&#x27;t been involved in a lot of legal stuff, on either side, but enough to know how it works and not fear the process. Once someone realizes that you have the resources and determination to drag them into actual court, they tend to think pretty hard about what persisting might cost them - in this case possibly in terms of reputation even more than money. No surprise that he&#x2F;they folded quickly.')
