My internet connection was way too slow to stream videos, even at the lowest quality, so I&#x27;d make a list of videos, download them in the background the entire day and then watch it offline at the end of the day. When I finally discovered youtube-dl, I was relieved that I no longer had to keep maintaining my script... and it supported almost every other video website.<p>Also, I just realized that it can still be downloaded from the official website and updated using --update argument.')
