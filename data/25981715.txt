And, as the reservoir drains dry and the sewage lines start overflowing, the water company cuts supply. And then it turns out that the water company has some vague amorphous relationship with a bottled water company. Do you assume that the water company shut off supply because everyone did something weird and the system was about to stop working, or that they did it to benefit the bottled water company?<p>Like, at some point, &quot;this entity was forced into a position where they had to do the thing, but the thing might have benefited someone they&#x27;re connected to, therefore they must have done it intentionally for reasons of collusion&quot; looks like a pretty flimsy explanation.')
