Take the news, there are generally several episodes per day. Have those hosted by different &quot;factions&quot; and let the viewers make up their minds on who has it right. The same goes for opinion-related programming, divide this over the political spectrum according to the relative representation in the targeted region. There is no need to delve deep into whether the DNC should be represented by those who support &quot;The Squad&quot; or those who follow the more traditional faction, leave that to the parties themselves. I&#x27;d expect those parties to favour voices which they deem to be palatable to the majority of the viewership and as such will tend to shy away from the extremes. The GOP most likely won&#x27;t want to have Trumpists representing them, the DNC probably won&#x27;t go for Squad-supporters.<p>&gt; You seem to have this idea of what a &quot;textbook&quot; conservative&#x2F;liberal is, and I think that sort of binary representation is harmful to political discourse at large.<p>Nope, I have no such illusions. That aside, the way the American republic is set up - with winner-takes-all elections on the national level - does tend to create a dichotomy since voting for &quot;fringe&quot; parties is effectively useless other than to send a signal. This means the choice goes between the GOP and DNC candidates, a binary choice. Some people will vote DNC for some, GOP for other posts but this does not change the fact that the choice is rather limited.<p>There will be debate between the different &quot;parties&quot; and factions on such a station. This is a feature, not a bug. Let them debate out in the open, let them voice their views on developments for anyone who wants to hear or see. It might not be a 100% accurate representation of the political views of the region but it is far better than the propaganda channels which the media is rife with.')
