It&#x27;s not like COVID19 or the flu where it is often transmitted through casual contact. There is simply no reason to delay&#x2F;halt an HIV vaccine for just causing an false positive on a test. As you said, any effective HIV vaccine will likely have this issue so pushing forward is the only option.')
