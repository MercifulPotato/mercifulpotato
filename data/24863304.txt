They were first introduced to game developers widely on consoles (Xbox One and PS4), but also exist in a more limited form as vendor specific extensions in DX11 (and I think OpenGL). Callable shaders (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;win32&#x2F;direct3d12&#x2F;callable-shader" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;win32&#x2F;direct3d12&#x2F;ca...</a>) in DX12 and Vulkan might give you the dynamic dispatch functionality you want.  They are usable in ray generation shaders but I&#x27;m not sure if they can be used in general purpose compute yet.<p>The better or worse comment was more about having a heterogeneous environment vs using a graphics API to dispatch compute. I agree that generally speaking they are the same though, after all it&#x27;s the same hardware.')
