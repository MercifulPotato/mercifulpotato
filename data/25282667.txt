I prefer statically-typed languages w&#x2F; a bit of local inference  (I end up in java usually, but C# got it right) and I consistently see people in my world underestimate the edit&#x2F;reload workflow.  Even a small compilation step is enough to break flow and make development a chore, once you&#x27;ve worked that way.<p>As a side note: java not allowing signature changes and requiring a whole server restart is absolutely awful.  It didn&#x27;t have to be this way: the DCEVM[1] was presented at the 2009 JVM Language Summit[2], by Thomas Wuerthinger.  He patiently demonstrated and explained how his work allowed for hot swap of arbitrary class changes, while the Sun guys sitting in the audience told him that what he was demonstrating was impossible.  We ended up using the DCEVM for a long time, but as of right now I&#x27;m back to restarting my server when I make breaking changes.  It&#x27;s a funny world.<p>¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯<p>[1] - This is a modern fork of the project: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dcevm.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dcevm.github.io&#x2F;</a><p>[2] - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.jvmlangsummit.com&#x2F;Hotswap" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.jvmlangsummit.com&#x2F;Hotswap</a>')
