We got a marketing email from Huggingface recently about their ML-models-as-a-service offering: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;pricing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;pricing</a><p>One of my colleagues asked if it might be better than creating our own infrastructure for that. I ran the numbers for one of our recent jobs, feeding a million tweets to two ML models to see which worked better. That would have cost about $1800 on Huggingface. Using AWS spot instances, it was maybe $25 for us to run ourselves.<p>Of course, we can do it at that price because we are paying for engineers and plan on classifying enormous amounts of text, so it works out for us. Plenty of other people probably should just use Huggingface. But I can&#x27;t help looking at that 70x markup and think, &quot;Fuck me? No, fuck <i>you</i>!&quot;')
