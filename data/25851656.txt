There isn&#x27;t any silver bullet to this for Unity and Unreal and for that reason there will always be at least a small market for editors that have significantly less learning curve.<p>These visual scripting engines are probably eating GameMaker&#x27;s lunch since GML predates a lot of modern alternatives such as aforementioned scripting and JavaScript support in modern engines with more power available to savvy users.')
