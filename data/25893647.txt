However, when you start to get 2 to 3 weeks behind the deadline in the real world there is no escape hatch.<p>Worst case in college, you submit the later assignment, settle for a D, and vow to study hard for the final. In the real world, you manager calls you to his office, asks you why you&#x27;re weeks behind, it&#x27;s going down now in your evaluation. Maybe you&#x27;re in a start up, you loose that crucial client, now you&#x27;re wondering how to pay your expenses as well. You have a family, kids, the stress compounds, pretty soon you&#x27;re a mess at home and at work.<p>And, I&#x27;ve got 12 years of higher education under my belt. When I made the final push for my PhD thesis corrections, I stayed up 4 days straight right before the deadline dotting my &#x27;i&#x27;s and crossing my &#x27;t&#x27;s. 6 years into the &quot;real world&quot;, I often look back on that time as the good ole days.')
