This makes Basic programs tend to spaghetti and unreadable code, especially considering the constant memory constraints of those platforms. I grew up on these systems, and every time I think back on it I wish something like Forth would have taken its place - i.e. something with a clean and scalable pattern for abstraction. Basic, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t <i>do</i> abstractions. It <i>barely</i> has data types and what it calls “functions” are an <i>even more</i> limited form of Python&#x27;s style of lambdas; every subset of code which can actually <i>do</i> something looks like “GOSUB 11600” when you call it. No naming, no abstractions, nothing.<p>(This is in some ways even worse than assembler, which usually has labeled goto’s.)<p>Reportedly, BBC Basic on the BBC Micro <i>has</i> proper named functions!  I believe that basing this project on that Basic would have been vastly more productive and taught people the usefulness of abstracting things as you go, building ever higher abstractions, etc.  But I suspect that the C64 (and its recognizable blue color scheme, which the whole page uses) brings more nostalgia-fueled clicks and shares.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19245814" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19245814</a>')
