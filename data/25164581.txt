The absence of a &quot;superior nature&quot; to which one might have a reason to offer &quot;service and ceremonial rites&quot; does not deny that there are goals that one might strive for. Maximizing one&#x27;s own experienced utility, for instance, requires no assumption of a &quot;superior nature&quot;, nor even a rejection of solipsism, but still provides an end to strive after and motivate action.<p>&gt; Therefore, all atheists have chosen to serve some superior nature, either themselves<p>Serving yourself is not serving a &quot;superior nature&quot;, since &quot;superior&quot; is meaningful only in comparison to something else, and in Cicero&#x27;s statement it is clearly in comparison to the self.')
