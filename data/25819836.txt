I can very quickly scan through the headlines for something that sounds interesting, much quicker than if I had to scroll. Also, and I cannot explain just why, but somehow it&#x27;s easier on my short term memory to have everything in front of me at once.<p>Regarding the colors, I prefer the current ones as I&#x27;m a bright-mode guy.<p>Regarding max-width I think yours is too small, but you may have a point that HN&#x27;s one is too large. I might play around with one that is just a little bit below the current one and see how I feel about it after using it for a while.')
