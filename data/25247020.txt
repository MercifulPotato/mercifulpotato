In our industry - vaccines - most people use Windows laptops to get work done. Execs do use Apple stuff, but they&#x27;re not doing the actual ground-level work, so its probably the same everywhere. Apple hardware is expensive to buy, expensive to maintain, and difficult to service due to its flawed design (everything is soldered, no easy access to components, no third party repair, no access to parts, generates lots of e-waste, etc). The OS also is not capable enough to be easily administered by IT.')
