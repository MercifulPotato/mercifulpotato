Item(by='px43', descendants=None, kids=[25570970, 25570933, 25571962], score=None, time=1609252193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25569419, text='The BOA leak, and several others, got burned by that Daniel Dumbshit guy over some petty personal disputes on how Wikileaks was run. That&#x27;s what the Benedict Cumberbatch movie was all about, told from the perspective of the shithead who wiped all that data.<p>Wikileaks had an image of a Bank of America VP laptop with email discussion about the creation and exploitation of predatory loans, and a complete indifference to the eventual 2008 crash that they knew it would cause.<p>As to the DNC stuff, yeah Assange was probabally used by the Russian intelligence, but it was probabally an easy sell. Hillary really did (maybe jokingly?) call for Assange to be assassinated when she was secretary of state. He had every reason in the world to cut off her ascent to power.<p>If you want a really good look at Assange&#x27;s humanity around the time of all the DNC craziness, Laura Portrias was living with him at the time and filming him all day every day, and turned it into a movie called &quot;Risk&quot;. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt4964772&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt4964772&#x2F;</a>  Very similar vibe to Citizen Four, but with Assange instead of Snowden. Also for some reason it didn&#x27;t get much attention because all sides hating on Assange became super trendy around that time.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, my political alignment is probabally far more liberal than the majority of people on this site, and I&#x27;ve been a Wikileaks supporter since they were just leaking internal fraternity documents.')
