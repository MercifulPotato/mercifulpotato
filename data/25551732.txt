The seizure of Gold was to prevent a further contraction in credit because the dollar was still on a gold standard. I&#x27;m not defending gold confiscations (nor am I in favor of a gold standard) but without this measure the crisis would likely have been even worse. The tariffs were politically motivated (to strengthen American manufacturers - neither Keynesian nor Austrian) and intended to stoke inflation.')
