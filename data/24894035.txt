They&#x27;re just riding on the rhetoric of the last election; people will vote for the candidate which Big Tech doesn&#x27;t want to win.\nSo if it looks like Big Tech hates Trump (I.e. helping Biden), then people will vote for Trump.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m overestimating the intelligence of people who work for Facebook and Twitter?<p>Maybe they&#x27;re not very smart and they think that censoring the Biden story will help Biden.')
