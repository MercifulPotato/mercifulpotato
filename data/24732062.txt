So as long as conventional gas use continues you&#x27;d have zero storage problem for new H2 production until the existing tolerance limit is maxed out. Only switching to anything close to 100% H2 would be a storage&#x2F;distribution problem.<p>Bonus implication: retooling existing infrastructure back to tolerate that old, higher H2 fraction would be considerably (orders of magnitude) easier than building a network for pure H2.<p>I still share your main view, that there tends to be too much hype for H2. E.g. be wary of people who use an imminent &quot;H2 future&quot; as an argument to abandon all other projects. But that doesn&#x27;t negate the value of real-life H2 projects at all: chances are we won&#x27;t satisfy easy H2 use cases any time soon and the things that would make difficult&#x2F;impossible H2 use cases difficult&#x2F;impossible shouldn&#x27;t be used as arguments against production until the easy use cases appear in reach to getting saturated.')
