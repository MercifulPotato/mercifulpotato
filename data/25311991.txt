We expect our fellow tribespeople to cooperate which includes sharing resources to some degree. Billionaires are the equivalent to a tribeman finding a way to get 10,000 fish a day and keeping it all for themselves. It is so far beyond what they can eat that not sharing any of it would be extreme antisocial behavior, and would cause severe consequences, like getting kicked out of the tribe. If another tribesman started speculating &quot;that, hey we are still as well off as before so is he really that bad&quot;, it wouldn&#x27;t be taken as philosophical musing but as defending behavior that hurts the survival of the tribe.')
