This leads to groupthink and no one gets the courage of their conviction.  [sometimes this is good and prevents poor products from get to the customer, but usually when that&#x27;s the case, the team were incompetent and deliberately ignoring prior feedback under the ever-applicable excuse of &quot;you are not the target customer&quot; and could have prevented them if they cared.]<p>(2) when you have a siloed culture, you put the integration job, responsibility, and accountability on the management who coordinate. Therefore you have to be careful who you put in charge and the organization does not scale magically. But once you put the right person in charge, they are accountable and cannot slack off, nor make poor choices forever and expect others underneath them to fix them and expect them to be accountable. The buck stops with the integration point, which is singular.  They have to make clear and concrete decisions, leaving less room for spray and pray or blaming stuff on others.<p>Point #2 has synergies with the way Apple is structured: not P&amp;Ls, rather each person is an expert on some aspect of the product and the editing function and discussion on what to build happens very transparently at the top (evidently through heated discussions mediated by Steve who was not afraid of conflicts [contrast with Google execs.]) One person handles software, another handles hardware, another one silicon, etc. and they fight at the top not through proxy wars at the bottom.  My sense is this aspect is what Steve &quot;signed-off&quot; on, and the rest naturally followed with that plus product secrecy aspirations (for marketing reasons and due to scar tissues from a past era).')
