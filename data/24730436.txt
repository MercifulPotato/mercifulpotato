My home office is a small room in my home, but it has a large window providing natural light and top of the line office furniture including a couch and a really big desk. Most importantly I am the only one that works in this office.<p>Having a setup like this in a company&#x27;s office would remove any incentive I have to work from home. I wonder how many developers want to work from home just to escape the shitshow of open offices.')
