So likely a 12 or 16 core processor, with 4 or 6 of those dedicated to efficiency cores.<p>The M1 supposedly has a 10w TDP (at least in the MBA; it may be speced higher in the MBP13). If that&#x27;s the case, there&#x27;s a ton of power envelope headroom to scale to more cores, given the i9 9980HK in the current MBP16 is speced at 45 watts.<p>I&#x27;m very scared of this architecture once it gets up to Mac Pro levels of power envelope. If it doesn&#x27;t scale, then it doesn&#x27;t scale, but assuming it does this is so far beyond Xeon&#x2F;Zen 3 performance it&#x27;d be unfair to even compare them.<p>This is the effect of focusing first on efficiency, not raw power. Intel and AMD never did this; its why they lost horribly in mobile. Their bread and butter is desktops and servers, where it doesn&#x27;t matter. But, long term, it does; higher efficiency means you can pack more transistors into the same die without melting them. And its far easier to scale a 10 watt chip up to use 50 watts than it is to do the opposite.')
