Instead of paying X million for land and Y million for security to protect a huge swath of rainforest, you only have to pay X&#x2F;50 for land and Y million for security.  Who cares about what percent goes to what, you&#x27;re saving tons of rainforest for even less money.<p>In the extreme you might realize you don&#x27;t even need to buy any land, you&#x27;re just paying for security to protect the rainforest.  Instead of paying 100 billion to own and never visit, you pay 1 billion a year to protect land you don&#x27;t own.  Which... sounds fine to me!')
