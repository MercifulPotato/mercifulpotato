Not to mention the leaps and bounds of flight controllers in the last few years. There seems to increasingly few things that can go wrong with my drone. Bent prop&#x2F;motor shaft; no problem. Missing parts of propellers; you can still fly home. Its aerodynamics, materials and software... and most of those things are off the shelf, just an afterthought for the drone builder and pilot. Its cool to be able to shift focus to flying but agree heavily its a different craft now.')
