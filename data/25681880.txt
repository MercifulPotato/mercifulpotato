Moderators never touched it btw.<p>Since the users mostly aren&#x27;t in contact with each other, I don&#x27;t think anyone was &quot;pushing a message&quot;. It&#x27;s extremely easy to imagine that such things are happening when they aren&#x27;t, especially if you cherry-pick specific examples out of the randomness. Most of what happens is just stochastic.')
