Can you please tell me which are those suburbs with 200k homes outside of Paris? I&#x27;d definitely move there at that price, sounds like a steal.<p>Though I&#x27;m a bit skeptical as 200k is enough for a house in Eastern Europe on the outskirts of Bucharest, but in Austria where I am now and average house outside of Vienna is way over 600K so the Paris suburbs you describe seem suspiciously cheap to me at only 200k since Paris is more expensive than Vienna.<p>What&#x27;s the catch?')
