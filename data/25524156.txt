Suppose I must install WiFi to convince the user the machine it as all useful. Suppose if I fail to get the machine to work, the user will eventually go out and get another Windows 10 machine.<p>In this case the right choice is to install from nonfree. It&#x27;s a compromise, sure, but it&#x27;s clearly less bad than the alternatives and leads to significantly more freedom than the user had before.<p>To not leave room in your philosophy for these cases-- and there are many-- is to create unnecessary rifts among allies. You&#x27;re doing it right now by implying that Debian proponents aren&#x27;t True Scotsman due to the existence of nonfree.')
