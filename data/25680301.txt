The guy  participated in what&#x27;s likely legally somewhere in the neighborhood of insurrection and then he stood there as international media was snapping photos and he didn&#x27;t think to hide his giant nametag...<p>I&#x27;m sure most who ended up inside were just &quot;following the crowd&quot; and didn&#x27;t actually plan to be there or murder anyone so it&#x27;s probably not an &quot;insurrection&quot; in how I would personally define it, (as in, some planned execution of a coordinated intent to seize control of the government), but yeah, probably not the legal waters anyone wants to be swimming in.<p>In the history books, usually a failed coup is followed by either lining the plotters up against the wall without trial and shooting them or a public execution. It&#x27;s no good<p>If I was there I&#x27;d be assuming that there&#x27;d be a whole slew of undisclosed trackers everywhere in that building - RFID readers picking up my credit cards, BTLE and WIFI sniffers picking up my phone, a cell phone interceptor recording my IMEI, facial detection and tracking, etc ... simply dripping in spy devices. I also wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they had some special artillery room with military grade weapons. It seems horrendously dumb to enter that building following a mob.<p>There&#x27;s a fair bit of evidence to support the hypothesis that these weren&#x27;t the brightest people.')
