Despise is the exact word I would use to describe my feelings towards advertising.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d say that most people, if given the choice not to have that in their social interactions[0] would choose control&#x2F;lack of advertising&#x2F;marketing overwhelmingly<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me being older and more cynical but I really don&#x27;t think most people care about control either, at least not in large enough numbers to matter. I&#x27;d be happy to be wrong, of course.<p>&gt; Unless, of course, your paycheck is contingent on such centralized platforms. Is yours?<p>Not at all. But I am building something in this space, with decentralization&#x2F;anonymity as a priority. It is entirely possible for me to be in full support of a move towards decentralized services while accepting the reality that it&#x27;s not important to most people. Pragmatism does not equal defeatism.')
