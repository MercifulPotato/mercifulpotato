There was a projections miss a few quarters ago (very rare for amd), and even then the questions feel more like PR.<p>Semi-Custom is indeed PS5 and Xbox. This increase was expected of course. It&#x27;s lower margins than other segments though.<p>Epyc adoption is indeed slower than I would&#x27;ve liked. But so far it has matched or beat short and long term projections from AMD.<p>Enterprise is weird. AMD has better price and performance? Let&#x27;s buy Intel. Meltdown lowers performance? Let&#x27;s compensate by buying more Intel. Intel is supply constrained? Let&#x27;s complain, and still buy Intel.<p>My guess is Intel is still pressuring OEMs to favor Intel. Cloud providers are increasing adoption though, and there have been a few nice HPC wins.<p>And lets not forget that AMD is selling every chip they can, TSMC production is fully booked.')
