I don’t think we currently have enough stuff. As a techy in the US I make more than most, but there are still many material things that I can’t quite afford&#x2F;have to limit myself. However, if production was 100x what it is now then perhaps I would be able to afford them. Post scarcity is at a production level far greater than current.<p>Also, higher production doesn’t mean higher natural resource consumption —- dematerialization is real. My phone satisfies my needs far more than a landline could but requires far less natural resources.')
