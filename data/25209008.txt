This is relatively much. You wanna lose 1kg? Just train 7h. At 2kg a month you don&#x27;t even need 1h of training a day.<p>Problem is, food can be very calorie dense, two cookies can have as much calories as a whole meal. Also, I read somewhere that there isn&#x27;t really a sane upper limit of calories the body can ingest per day, something around 50k - 60k kcal IIRC.<p>This means, your diet can catch up no problem with any amount of training you do.')
