Say I create a new email account: lAsZlO@inopinatus.com and the mailbox is case sensitive.<p>Next I create a youtube account but as E-Mail address I enter laszlo@inopinatus.com and I am told to click the link in the confirmation E-Mail... that I never receive. Well I do not like youtube anyway so I head over to hackernews and create an account to write this comment. Oh no I can not because I typed my E-Mail address in lowercase again. So now I am wondering if there is some error so I open your homepage, search for the support page and file a bug report, typing my E-Mail address in lowercase into the E-Mail field. I never receive your response telling me to write my E-Mail address in the correct casing. \nI come to the conclusion that my E-Mail account just does not work and create another one at a provider that is case insensitive. OR I figure out&#x2F;am told that the case is important and will never forget it again.<p>So where exactly are services like youtube or hn that ask me for my E-Mail responsible for handling upper&#x2F;lower case correctly?\nThe solution could still be: store both the hash for the canonicalized address and the hash of the exact address of which you know that it worked at some point in time. If the user enters the address later the matches the one but not the other issue a warning that should they not receive the E-Mail to double check their spelling.')
