It is amazing that they could uphold the image as the good guys at the time.<p>And apple sneaking in applications on windows when updating quicktime (if I remember correctly).<p><i>They all suck.</i><p>But it is even worse to do this on their own desktop operating system. It is another level of insanity that I just don&#x27;t accept. And it&#x27;s not like one can throw some money at the problem either, they are just ruining their platform.')
