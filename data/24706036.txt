But it isn&#x27;t a very &quot;useful&quot; belief, in the sense that it&#x27;s a belief with no practical implication.<p>It would imply that God has limitations, which goes against the usual view (at least in abrahamic religions) of god being unlimited by definition. It would also invite the question of where those limitations come from. If that&#x27;s not a practical enough implication, there would also be: dont rely on God for personal attention.')
