The first are your typical shops on the high street (which yes you could park near to but that&#x27;s not really the focus) while the second are in motorway services or in a retail park built around a car park (what Americans would call a &quot;strip mall&quot;). If you&#x27;re a regular user of either one then it&#x27;s quite easy to imagine the other doesn&#x27;t exist but actually they&#x27;re both very common.')
