Item(by='hbogert', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611826596, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25931790, text='&gt; What is “not ok” is the fact that switching to a GPL based license forces projects depending on the code like CrateDB to use a fork since it kills the business model.<p>This is the most important statement, yet they don&#x27;t explain why it kills their business model<p>Also, did I miss something in the SSPL wording? is the consensus really that SSPL equates to GPL? I can see the similarity to GPLv3 in the sense that you have to provide a lot of the environment on which you run the software,but the article just equates SSPL to GPL after the first paragraph, which is a pity imo.<p>&gt; We would never have chosen Elasticsearch in the first place, had it been licensed under the GPL as some of our customers (and many large enterprises do by default) banned GPL licensed software from their application stacks for legal risks<p>You should feel fine using GPLv2 in your business, if your are really opensource company (if there is such a thing.) That&#x27;s really an opinionated statement by someone who doesn&#x27;t even have business, but please comment; why would they care if they&#x27;re the ones making the FOSS plugins and will only see changes going back upstream.')
