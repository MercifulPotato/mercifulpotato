Never. Have you?<p>Yes, (except mandated breaks) although they were all unskilled labor. Working in shipping&#x2F;receiving, a warehouse, fast food (less so, there usually are lulls at certain times), a restaurant. Very little time not spent working.<p>In an office environment, though? Yeah, I&#x27;ve never seen it, except on the rare day when something major breaks and it needs to be resolved asap.')
