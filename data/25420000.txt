Item(by='deeviant', descendants=None, kids=[25420920], score=None, time=1607965878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25415348, text='Average cost of acre of farm land in US: $3160<p>Average cost of a cheap warehouse in US (this is being generous as the cost is likely far higher for a vertical farm) $20 square ft [1]<p>Thus, Land&#x2F;building cost standard farming method: $3160 per acre[2]<p>Land&#x2F;building cost of equivalent vertical farm: $871200 per acre<p>Which is 275x higher. Once again, using warehouse costs is being generous to vertical farms. It&#x27;s likely more than $20&#x2F;sq f to commission a vertical farm.<p>What ever land use benefits of vertical farming are at the very least partially offset by the fact it requires a building, which has it own set of ecological impacts.<p>It&#x27;s very hard for me to imagine any amount of bullet points to make up for 275x+ increased land&#x2F;build cost. But if there was a market, it&#x27;s probably in high end organic stuff for well-to-do people, rather than the a case of then technological wizardry feeding the masses.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=average+construction+cost+per+square+foot+of+warehouse+space" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=average...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=average+cost+of+a+ance+of+farm+land" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=average...</a><p>Note: I used US numbers, but much of the world has a similar ratio, although I&#x27;m sure somebody can find an exception if they looked.')
