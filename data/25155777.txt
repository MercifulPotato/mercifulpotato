I believe there very much should be legal standards and licensing processes for building residential and business structures. I also think that getting things inspected and approved should be a really easy, streamlined, cheap, non-profit process. Hell, I&#x27;ll go one further: I think there should be financial encouragement to bring outdated unsafe facilities up to code, in cases where there isn&#x27;t already such a thing (and there usually is).<p>&quot;The free market shall decide&quot; and &quot;let the buyer beware&quot; are great until you eat a sandwich and find out the ground beef was cut with sawdust, or buy a house with a deck, have a party, and the deck collapses because the previous owner built it wrong.')
