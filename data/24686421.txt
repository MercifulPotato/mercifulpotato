It was also a non-starter when the FastCGI processes were on a different machine for load balancing purposes.<p>It&#x27;s much simpler to use an independent monitoring program to manage your processes than to rely on the web server. Modern init systems can do this for you, or you can use tools like monit. Docker will probably work, too. Node has PM2. PHP has FPM, which can automatically recycle processes on a preconfigured schedule. Not that they need to be recycled, because PHP is very stable these days, but it&#x27;s just a one-liner in a config file if you need it.')
