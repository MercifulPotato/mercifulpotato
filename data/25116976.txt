Just that there are probably bigger issues that impact more revenue that should be worked on first from a purely ROI point of view.<p>If and when this issue has a higher ROI than anything else, it should be worked on. The flow of new issues with higher ROI may prevent that from ever happening.<p>I think every developer can easily name 5+ minor bugs in a product they&#x27;re working on that they know exist and know roughly how to fix, but may never get around to fixing. Or maybe I&#x27;m the weird or unlucky one, but that&#x27;s been true of every production software I&#x27;ve ever worked on.<p>What can be argued strongly, I think, is that ROI calculation should take into account secondary effects such as the app&#x27;s reputation in the country or the appearance of discriminating against a country.')
