In the long-term I&#x27;d like to join a FAANG company, or at least a big, &quot;famous&quot; company.<p>My current impression is that most of these companies have a standardized way to sort through applications, namely coding challenges.<p>I am critical of the current state of the interview process but I actually enjoy doing these small coding challenges if I find some free-time. Therefore, I&#x27;d like to start now and contentiously prepare for the interview to land a FAANG job in the future.<p>Given the high investment of time, how likely is it that the interview process will change anytime soon?')
