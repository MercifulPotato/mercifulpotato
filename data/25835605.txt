Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611075944, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835580, text='&gt; You would be surprised how many third party companies support closed source software product of another company. This is very common in enterprise world. It is also a common way for a vendor to get their foot into an enterprise entrenched with a competitor&#x27;s product.<p>I&#x27;m aware of that, and have even worked with such companies.  However, IMHO it&#x27;s way harder (and less effective) than supporting an open source product.  For instance, it&#x27;s way harder for a 2nd or 3rd party to diagnose and patch a bug if they don&#x27;t have the source.')
