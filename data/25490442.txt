What was the average salary of female porn talent, annually, again? Less than $40,000 if I recall correctly? If even that much? It might have been $35,000.<p>That&#x27;s $17.50 an hour. That&#x27;s a line worker at an injection molding plant making car parts. And that&#x27;s a job that gets you health, dental, vision, life, short-term disability, long-term disability insurance, and a few other perks. That&#x27;s in Arlington, TX. I know that because I have a family member who works there. She also gets every holiday that the corresponding GM assembly plant gets, because after all, why do they need to be at work if GM isn&#x27;t making cars? And this is a job that is so &quot;demanding&quot;, you don&#x27;t even have to submit a resume. You literally just show up, take a drug test, get 2 hours of training in a classroom, get 4 hours of training on the factory floor, and you start the next day. She did.<p>If porn actors and actresses had the wherewithal to actually set up all the necessary shit to run their own studios... they wouldn&#x27;t need to do porn.<p>You have to understand cameras, optics, lighting, video and sound editing, advertising, search engine optimization, website creation, front-end development, back-end development, etc. and so forth.<p>The &quot;whole package&quot; stack for a single person, or even a small group of people, wanting to get into porn, is significant. Anyone who has even a <i>few</i> of the skills I listed above, doesn&#x27;t have to get fucked on camera for money.')
