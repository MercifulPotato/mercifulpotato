And it&#x27;s not even clear how those <i>should</i> work over a network connection.<p>This is not new.  After all, X11 critiques came in for a full chapter in the Unix Haters Handbook and that&#x27;s 25 years old.  Wayland is simply revisiting the same problems as X Server Extensions 30 years later (they aren&#x27;t ubiquitous so nobody uses them so they aren&#x27;t ubiquitous).<p>The problem is that people who use obscure features are <i>VERY</i> vocal about it while people who simply abandon your operating system because accelerated video doesn&#x27;t work reliably are very quiet.<p>Maybe Wayland isn&#x27;t the way forward, but X11 <i>certainly</i> hasn&#x27;t been the way forward for decades.<p>The only advantage I can see is that if Wayland manages to tear out the X11-isms in everybody, what comes after Wayland will have a lot easier time of it.')
