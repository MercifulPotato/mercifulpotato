Breathe and find a way to accept it and move on. Reflect later on how you can do better in the future.<p>XRP was entirely based on compliance and corporate control. It represents the bet that banks will subvert real distributed currencies like Bitcoin. Of course, that strength to control and promote the network made them extra vulnerable to the same regulations they sought to comply with. It’s not surprising to me that they faced devaluation and a SEC investigation. After all, the founders and company held massive quantities of XRP and would promote their holdings through business deals. They made all the decisions and put themselves in the position to be targeted. That’s a security, no doubt about it.<p>In any case you probably know a lot more about the financial system and cryptocurrency and therefore can make better decisions in the future.<p>As for current holdings, no idea but I’d guess there will be a small bounce back of people testing recovery before another drop. I’d try to exit then, personally. But if the money matters very much to you and you were over invested it might be best to play it safe and cut your losses while you can. Exchanges are likely to delist it so they aren’t peddling an unregistered security.')
