Item(by='thu2111', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607613029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25371164, text='The existence of affirmative action is not in any doubt, and it&#x27;s not racist to suppose that some people benefit from it, given that&#x27;s the entire purpose it exists for.<p><i>the company doesn&#x27;t give a rat&#x27;s ass about diversity</i><p>I have no idea how anyone could think that. It&#x27;s famous for being obsessed with diversity to the extent that they publicly fired, slandered and screwed over a guy who wrote an essay saying maybe the company is approaching diversity the wrong way. This is a company in which managers have apologised for using the word &quot;family&quot; because it&#x27;s supposedly offensive to LBGT people, in which they organise competitions which ban men (see Code Jam for Women), in which they fund female-only scholarships, which literally has a website called <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diversity.google&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diversity.google&#x2F;</a>, which puts &quot;Google is committed to advancing racial equity for Black communities&quot; at the top of its developer documentation, which labels businesses in Google Maps if they&#x27;re women or black owned and a million other things that show this is a topic they think about all the time.<p>As for merit, you&#x27;re about a decade behind the times. Google was relaxing hiring standards for women in particular a long time ago. For example they could fail phone screens and be advanced to the next stages anyway, whereas men would just be dropped at that point. You can&#x27;t be so strongly pro-diversity and not have that problem because ultimately the only way to seriously improve in your self-chosen metrics is to hire &#x27;diverse&#x27; people aggressively.')
