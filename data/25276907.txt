The FDA in the US is taking 3 weeks to reviews, about 5-10% of the entire time to develop this is just to schedule this (3rd to last) meeting. All while over a thousand people die per day (so during this waiting period something like 10x the lives of 9&#x2F;11).<p>We just spent 9 months trying to lift the ban on this vaccine. We have the technology to beat pandemics, we only lack the regulatory structure.<p>Vaccines are typically so safe and effective that for high risk populations taking a completely untested vaccine would be expected to (a) be effective and (b) safer than covid. So approving this was maybe the easiest call in medical history, and from first principles could have taken 1 day to approve for high risk groups.<p>We need a regulatory framework for fast approval anyway, if we ever want to have personalized medicine. With mRNA vaccines now in play, we can beat so many things if the regulatory environment lets us.')
