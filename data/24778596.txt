In my free time I did lots of projects like games, arduino based appliances, even freelanced a little bit. Problem is that I do not have any official experience that I can put on my CV and my job is unrelated to tech (employed in medical field).<p>I am interested in switching to tech career, but afraid that it is very unlikely at my age (34). There are many similar questions on HN, stackoverflow and quora but most answers are about <i>learning to code</i> rather than <i>career and bread-winning</i> side of it, so lets want to clear this up now, I code C, C++, Python, JS, Rust, Java and stay in touch with latest trends but have no official qualification to prove this. Decided to switch to coding for mainly for challenge and ability to work from home and spend more time with family, want to hear from field experts.')
