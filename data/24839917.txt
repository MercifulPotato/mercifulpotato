Lots of presentations by big knockers in the company, big time investments and initiatives like our company was going to be the &quot;tech leader&quot; in the space, blah blah blah.<p>Two years on and you can&#x27;t find any mention of it on any of the internal websites, all the PPT&#x27;s and videos have been scrubbed from the NAS drives they were once promoting people to go watch and learn from. All the supposed &quot;partnerships&quot; have been dissolved, or never took off in the first place.<p>Two years later and blockchain is nothing but a memory at the company I work at. Just as fast as it arrived, it disappeared without so much as a trace of it ever existing in the first place.')
