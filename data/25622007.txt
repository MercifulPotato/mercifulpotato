As someone who grew up pre-internet (realistically speaking) my brain learned to live with libraries, paper calendar, tasks lists on pads of paper, etc. Also, not knowing if someone called until I got home (and not having answering machines or, sometimes, not having a phone in the apartment I lived in, or TV).<p>When I got access to the Internet, the idea that I could learn things easily, or have a digital calendar, or write messages just removed so much friction. I was working as a cook but getting back into programming as a hobby at the time (started as a kid with BASIC on Commodore computers then didn&#x27;t have a computer for almost ten years). I first used the K&amp;R book to learn C but the Internet provided access to things outside the scope of the book.<p>Then, working as a programmer a few years later, I told my boss I&#x27;d hit a stretch goal if he got me an iphone to replace my flip phone. I use Android now, it was a different time. :)<p>Once I got that, it was 24&#x2F;7. I&#x27;m finding balance now but it&#x27;s tough. I am concious of my six year old always seeing me and emulating my behavior.')
