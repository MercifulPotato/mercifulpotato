If he lost at trial, he was facing a lifetime in jail.  They were also seeking damages that he had no hope of paying because his finances had already been drained by the legal fight.  A legal fight that was projected to cost over a million dollars more than already spent.<p>Or he could take a plea bargain.  Which would have put him in serious debt, in jail for a few years, and made him a life-long felon.<p>Or he could commit suicide.  Which, of course, he did.<p>In that surprisingly typical example, if his odds of winning were 90%, on average he spends as much time in jail if he chooses to fight.  Which he couldn&#x27;t afford to do.  And you still have to accept that chance of losing your whole life in jail.<p>In that situation, I&#x27;d probably have accepted the plea bargain.  No matter how much I believed myself to be in the right.<p>Given those incentives, it is somewhat surprising that 3% of people do choose to fight.  But then again, that&#x27;s down in the range of the portion of the population with serious mental illnesses.')
