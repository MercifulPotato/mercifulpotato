Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25047054], score=None, time=1605021834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25046529, text='In the past, the incidents of fraudulent voting occurs at roughly 1 vote per 10 million - 1 billion. (Vote-by-mail is at the high end of that range; in-person-vote is at the low end). In modern times--that is, since 2000--I&#x27;m not aware of a <i>single</i> election where fraud was sufficient to change the results of the election, and I&#x27;m including that 2018 North Carolina race in that list [1].<p>To allege that there was sufficient fraud to overturn the results of this election requires fraud to exist at over 1000× the rate it has normally existed. Consequently, the evidence needed to sustain this allegation should be 1000× as prevalent. However, the claimed evidence is no better than it usually is. You get the same, tired complaints about things like out-of-state mail ballots from people who forget that students and military (and indeed the sitting president!) are legal residents of states they do not presently physically reside in.<p>[1] The number of allegedly fraudulent ballots in that race is close to the margin of victory for the Republican candidate, but my guesstimate is that if the fraud hadn&#x27;t happened, then the Republican still would have won, just by a very close margin.')
