He just asked for clarification which you did give in the second paragraph. Give him a break.<p>Yeah asians are victims of racism, but that doesn&#x27;t preclude other races from criticising a statement for being unclear.<p>I would say to the parent parent poster that next time you can ask those questions without directly stating that the comment was: &quot;extremely vague, charged, and lacking in nuance.&quot; Even though I agree that what you said is true, most humans are incapable of ingesting those words in an unbiased way and will likely misinterpret it as an insult. Ironically, the comment itself was &quot;lacking in nuance.&quot;')
