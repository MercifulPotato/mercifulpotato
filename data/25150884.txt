I&#x27;m still really well off, and do make more than the average developer. It&#x27;s just frustrating.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t ever plan on retiring. I&#x27;ll still have to work, I&#x27;ll just have enough to where I can work for myself and in a less demanding type of role. I&#x27;ll probably pick up consulting contracts, and maybe turn that into a business.<p>Edit: About 50% of my investments were building a small business on the side in my early 20s that I sold, and some real estate. This isn&#x27;t all coming from tech job income.')
