One of the reasons I prefer using my laptop&#x2F;desktop is that they are where I can create things. Music (DAW&#x2F;VST ecosystem), code (compilers, editors, etc.), visuals (illustrator&#x2F;photoshop&#x2F;Final Cut). I would like a way to casually create things on my phone rather than consume them. For example, rather than compulsively checking my email or looking at HN, I&#x27;d like to update one of the synths in a song I&#x27;m working on. I&#x27;m open to the idea that desktop workflows will not translate directly to mobile workflows, and that the media I play with might be different (maybe I have to become a connoisseur of TikTok videos?) That&#x27;s fine. I just want to create rather than consume. How can I do this on my mobile device?')
