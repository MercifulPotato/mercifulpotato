To them it&#x27;s about paying a fine for extra kids, and when local govt gets angry forced birth control. People hid kids for a reason.<p>The policy has historically allowed exceptions for ethnic minorities, but looking at news stories they have been physically putting birth control devices in Uyghur women without consent too. The state perfected its art of surveillance by testing on minorities; it&#x27;s no surprise they also perfected some other human rights violations from experience with Han people.<p>(There are cheap condom programs, but the entire country just doesn&#x27;t talk about sex. You get few safe sex talks, and all these stuff end up as balloons for kids and hairbands. Combined oral contraceptives are cheap and OTC, but the culture is heavily against &quot;unnecessary use of western medicine&quot;, especially for the cheap ethinylestradiol&#x2F;levonostrogel kind because &quot;cheap means bad&quot;. So you end up with good women&#x27;s bodily autonomy on paper and terrible execution, even without the violations.)')
