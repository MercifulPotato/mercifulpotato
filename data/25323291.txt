He then saw all the mainstream programming languages implement OOP and exclaimed &quot;I don&#x27;t recognize any of these as OOP.&quot; Even though it was exactly the same OOP he envisioned, but in such a different context he couldn&#x27;t see his idea. And the same thing will happen to monads too: Simon Peyton Jones will enter a code bootcamp and see a new programming language with monads and exclaim &quot;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re programming in but these aren&#x27;t monads.&quot; And the same thing will happen to Bayesian convolutional neural networks, Word2Vec, and Gradient Descent if machine learning is your style.')
