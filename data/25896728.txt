What I mean is that it is not a system cost. This assumes the existence of dispatchable low carbon energy at large scale without acknowledging this cost. You can&#x27;t meaningfully talk about $&#x2F;kWh with solar in the context of deep decarbonization without talking about the cost of dispatchable duplicate backup capacity. Costs and success today are riding on the back of a huge and high carbon dispatchable grid.')
