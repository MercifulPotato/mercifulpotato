I&#x27;ve since lived in Palo Alto and SF, and I&#x27;m staying in SF for the long haul. There aren&#x27;t many things that are truly unique to any one city or region, but the reasons why I loved Palo Alto and currently love SF include: \n1. the intelligent, interesting, generally well-mannered, and equally laid-back and hardworking people.\n2. the weather (heat and humidity are hell to me) - I&#x27;m a runner and a cyclist and I love being able to do those things every day of the year in comfort.\n3. beautiful nature in my backyard - Golden Gate Park, the Presidio, Mt. Tam, the Berkeley hills, Ocean Beach, day trips to Sonoma, weekend trips to Tahoe, weekend trips to Big Sur, proximity to Yosemite.\n4. the walkability of my neighborhood (I live in a nice neighborhood with clean streets and rarely encounter any homelessness - I&#x27;ve still never actually seen a needle anywhere). My favorite sushi restaurant is one block away, 5 craft coffee shops within 3 blocks, Whole Foods within walking distance, multiple restaurants (all of these I have in mind are still open).\n5. Biden&#x2F;Harris flags and bumper stickers everywhere - maybe I enjoy an echo chamber but after spending considerable time in the Southeast, I love being in a solid blue city.')
