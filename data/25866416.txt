I switched from LastPass to BitWarden and this Dead Man&#x27;s switch was the only thing I found missing.  I actually kept my LastPass active just to provide instructions on how to get into my BitWarden in case of an emergency. I&#x27;m still not clear if both the granter and grantee need to be premium&#x2F;paid subscribers or not. Hopefully I can grant emergency access to someone without a paid subscription... I guess I&#x27;ll find out when I dig into it over the weekend.')
