My experience over 10 years as an engineer is that Leetcode and whiteboard coding aren&#x27;t good indicators of future performance of candidates.<p>I&#x27;m building a system that will automatically sin up a github project with a pull-request to review, or an issue to fix. Further test-types are planned but I will launch with these two. No matter the skill level of an IC engineer, they will need to carry out effective code reviews and fix bugs. I think that the PR test will be good for senior candidates while the bug fix test will be good for junior - mid-level engineers.<p>I have a basic landing page where interested people can sign up to be notified when it&#x27;s ready: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devscreen.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devscreen.io&#x2F;</a><p>Let me know what you think! The goal of this is to improve the candidate experience and make better hiring decisions.<p>Edit: quick thanks to u&#x2F;dvt for starting this thread. It was a fun read!')
