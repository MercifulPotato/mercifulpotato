From their perspective, they would rather try to kill or stifle all cryptos than allow illegal activity to be done within that market without an ability to seize assets or trace funds.<p>Right now they have total control over traditional non-cash monetary transaction - and the US gov&#x27;t specifically has a long reach into the <i>global</i> economy to enforce things like OFAC and sanctions.<p>Cryptocurrency openly defies that power base by design (censorship resistance).  There is fundamentally no solution here where the two will play nicely together.<p>Cryptos will simmer in the background as the section of the global economy they facilitate grows (black market transactions), and erode the western financial power base.  It&#x27;s mostly limited today by the lack of scalability in the coin networks.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s a future where innovation in scalability allows for a single crypto to reign supreme globally and eliminate all national currencies in our lifetime.<p>It would be a monumental shift of power, which will undoubtedly involve a great deal of political&#x2F;technological struggle and civil chaos.')
