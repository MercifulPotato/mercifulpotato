People blocking a number because they don&#x27;t want to hear from it is another story. While some people are demanding the right to speak, most defenders aren&#x27;t demanding the right to be heard, those people are demanding the right to hear something.<p>Yes, the company may be facilitating communication is doesn&#x27;t approve of, but it isn&#x27;t amplifying it. The amplification with social media occurs because people that want to hear the message tell other people that want to hear the message about it and it is so easy to go out and hear the message. Telephone companies helped facilitate organization of all kinds of odious things, but rarely is it suggested that the phone companies should deny access.<p>Censorship is equivalent to the censor telling people, &quot;Because we don&#x27;t like the message, we won&#x27;t let you hear this message.&quot;<p>The debate is on how necessary social media is to our communications and how reasonable it is to deny  access.
