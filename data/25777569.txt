Please don&#x27;t spread false information, whatever your politics. Parler had very similar terms of service to other content companies prohibiting illegal, violent, or copyrighted content. They also paid a team of content moderators to adjudicate flagged posts. They worked happily with their reps at Apple, Google, and AWS right up until the Friday Night Massacre. They were a small company experiencing massive user growth because if Twitter policies during the past year and especially the past months. There was not a peep about their content until from their reps until 1&#x2F;6. Was it the riot or the senate flipping? My intel may be false, but my understanding is that they successfully cleared their backlog of flagged tickets before the deadline, working like hell to save their company, for nothing. The fix was in. This was a hit. We should all be very alarmed by this.')
