I feel like this is trying to satirise something that exists in the author&#x27;s imagination but doesn&#x27;t exist in the real world beyond adolescent first-time founders&#x27; early misfires, from which important lessons are quickly learned.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be satirising something that actually needs to be satirised, as there is not a significant number of startups in the real world actually operating like this. A startup that operates like this wouldn&#x27;t (barring a major mistake) get funding from YC or any other competent investor.<p>The Silicon Valley sitcom is funny and successful because it satirises stuff that really does happen in the startup&#x2F;tech&#x2F;VC world (I know, I lived through much of it myself), but it noticeably doesn&#x27;t stereotype founders as utterly clueless and hapless the way this piece does.<p>With the sitcom, anyone who knows the startup world can point to real-world people&#x2F;events on which the people&#x2F;events in the sitcom are based. I don&#x27;t think you can say that about this post. It&#x27;s hard for me to believe the writer of this really knows any significant number of real-world startups.')
