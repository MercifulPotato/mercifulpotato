For the first 2 billion years of the history of Earth, life was unicellular.  The only type of cell in existence was prokaryote.  The atmosphere contained no oxygen.<p>Then there was 1 billion years of history in which Earth&#x27;s atmosphere changed.  At the end of that billion years, two main differences were apparent.  Firstly, the atmosphere was comprised of 21% oxygen.  Secondly, life on Earth was comprised of two different types of cells - prokaryotes, and eukaryotes.<p>Eukaryotic cells are 100 times larger than prokaryotes.  Unlike prokaryotes, they form multi-cellular organisms.  Everything you see around you with your eyes, and every living thing you ever watched David Attenborough talk about on TV are comprised of Eukaryotic cells.<p>Endosymbiosis is the explanation of how Eukaryotic life came to exist.')
