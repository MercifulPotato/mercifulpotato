They were simply stating that the post was informational and that they weren&#x27;t offering any commentary on the situation, just giving facts.<p>I mean, sure a physicist can be wrong, but if they are giving facts as are currently accepted by the community or even as they know them, it isn&#x27;t an emotional statement of whether they agree. It is just that: Facts as we know them, to the best of our ability and not giving the commentary with it.')
