If in reality, there&#x27;s one white ball and nine black - then your math is still right, but your model is wrong.<p>If you do experiments with the wrong model (assuming 50&#x2F;50, getting samples from 1&#x2F;10) - your best conclusion would be the model is wrong.<p>But for many settings, you&#x27;d end up declaring your container or the hand used to pull out balls has magical powers. (and to borrow from Douglas Adams go on to prove that black is white, and get killed in the next zebra crossing).')
