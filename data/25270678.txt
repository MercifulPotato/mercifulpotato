Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=[25293086], score=None, time=1606860584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25269118, text='That&#x27;s nice in theory, but falls apart as Trump supporters seem blind to Trump&#x27;s own shameless corruption. &quot;Drain the swamp&quot; and &quot;fake news&quot; are valid critiques for sure, but Trump has merely channeled these frustrations to gain support and cover for carrying out his own graft. You can&#x27;t get more blatant than stealing PPE from hospitals to redistribute it through your own company while taking a healthy cut.<p>As a libertarian I had been intrigued by the meme that Trump hasn&#x27;t started a new war, but this article puts that in the best context I&#x27;ve seen. He was happy to continue meddling in other countries and committing acts of war against Iran, just nothing strategic or long term. This fits with Trump being of low intelligence and used to simply waving his dick around to get what he wants, but that simply doesn&#x27;t scale to the actions of a country. And so his pigheadedness is great for drawing attention to the workings of the corrupt system, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>I do see where Trump supporters are coming from, at least starting out. But I don&#x27;t see how there can be solidarity while they continue to go on the offensive against the grassroots of the other team (antifa bogeyman, all lives matter, etc). And at this point I would say that is most of the energy of the movement. And so it&#x27;s ultimately just another round of the same divide and conquer the masses that&#x27;s been going on for decades, only this time with disastrous pandemic response.')
