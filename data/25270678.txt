Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606860584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25269118, text='That&#x27;s nice in theory, but falls apart as Trump supporters seem blind to Trump&#x27;s own blatant corruption. &quot;Drain the swamp&quot; and &quot;fake news&quot; are valid critiques for sure, but Trump has merely channeled these frustrations to gain support while installing his own corruption. For instance you can&#x27;t get any more blatantly corrupt than stealing PPE from the states at the start of the pandemic, only to redistribute it through a private company taking a healthy cut.<p>As a libertarian I had been been intrigued by the meme that Trump hasn&#x27;t started a new war, but I think this article puts that in the appropriate context. He was happy to continue meddling in other countries or committing acts of war against Iran, just nothing strategic or long term. The defining factor is that Trump is of low intelligence and is used to simply waving his dick around to get what he wants. And so his pigheadedness is great at drawing attention to the workings of the corrupt system because he doesn&#x27;t sugar coat anything, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>Getting back to the heart of what you were saying - I don&#x27;t see how there can be solidarity while Trump supporters continue to go on the offensive against the grassroots of the other team (black lives don&#x27;t matter, etc). And at this point I don&#x27;t know what else is left of the movement.')
