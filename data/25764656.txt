So if you&#x27;re under the assumption that they don&#x27;t, this is incorrect.<p>Telegram, for all intents and purposes, is about as secure as using Facebook. The best you can do with Telegram is hope they don&#x27;t sell out or get compromised at some point in the future, because all your private communications are stored on their servers forever. Telegram does have &quot;secret chats&quot;, which from what I can gather, don&#x27;t even work for group chats, only one-to-one messages.<p>My general advice is to treat Telegram like a new Facebook if you have to use it, assume everything may by read by everyone, don&#x27;t treat it like it&#x27;s private and secure.<p>For &quot;text messaging&quot; friends and family use Signal. Everything is end-to-end encrypted by default, so you know nobody is collecting your data.')
