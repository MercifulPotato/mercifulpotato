It is just a chore monopolizing my attention.<p>Still this is way harder to pull of here than it is e.g. in Paris. No subway system serving all the city here.<p>I am using an eskate to pick up the slack. If the market street project was already completed and we did the same for some other key streets, it would be 100% viable but in the city&#x27;s current state :<p>- many roads are in a pitiful state. I haven&#x27;t hurt myself seriously yet but I saw or know of many people who did.<p>- car drivers are extremely dangerous<p>100% on acceptance, culture scene and let&#x27;s add food scene as well.')
