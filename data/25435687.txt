So that 2x is then multiplied by some factor<p>Neither the absolute number nor the turnover rate matter. Only the raw amount of biomass. The turnover rate has nothing to do with the fact that essentially all the carbon emitted by the cow was recently removed from the atmosphere by a plant, making the whole process carbon-neutral.<p>&gt; For 3, our consumption habits have exported the cow to new environments where bison were not native (like Brazil).<p>I limited my observation to the United States for a reason, but okay, I&#x27;ll bite. How does a cow being &quot;in Brazil&quot; change the fact that any carbon it emits was almost certainly removed from the atmosphere by a plant within the last year, making the cow&#x27;s digestion effectively carbon-neutral?')
