He&#x27;s a great teacher, and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot out of watching that series.<p>He streams them live, and then edited videos of the games on stream are uploaded on his YouTube channel. Here&#x27;s the YT playlist for the series:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ytkf3qZTj74&amp;list=PLT1F2nOxLHOcmi_qi1BbY6axf5xLFEcit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ytkf3qZTj74&amp;list=PLT1F2nOxLH...</a>')
