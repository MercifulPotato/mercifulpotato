Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612045925, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25972494, text='&gt; I also firmly believe that SSL&#x2F;TLS should&#x27;ve been handled at the OS level instead of everybody shipping their own custom OpenSSL implementations (complete with various vulnerabilities). I wish I could just use some setsockopt() syscalls to tell the OS I want a secure socket and let it figure out the rest.<p>IBM z&#x2F;OS actually does this with a feature called AT-TLS (Application Transparent TLS) [0]. You don&#x27;t even need to call setsockopt (actually z&#x2F;OS uses ioctl instead of setsockopt for this, but same idea). You can turn a non-TLS service into a TLS service simply by modifying the OS configuration.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibm.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;knowledgecenter&#x2F;en&#x2F;SSLTBW_2.2.0&#x2F;com.ibm.zos.v2r2.halx001&#x2F;transtls.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibm.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;knowledgecenter&#x2F;en&#x2F;SSLTBW_2.2.0&#x2F;...</a>')
