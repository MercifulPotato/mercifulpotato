Early products like Salesforce were easier to access and cheaper to maintain than their on-premise counterparts. Modern productivity apps like Google Docs, Figma, and Slack focus on things you simply couldnâ€™t do before, like real-time collaboration and deep integrations with other apps.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d consider any of these brand new things, even in the context of cloud nativity. CSCW works in particular go back to the mid-80s! They aren&#x27;t new things, but iterations on old things -- the iterative gap is so large that they _feel_ new, but the changes they provided improved accessibility to existing functionality, not innovative new functionality.<p>- Networked CRMs were preceded by so, so many database frontends.<p>- Google Docs was bought-not-made, and its components were also preceded by peer-to-peer collaborative editing tools outside of the web browser (SubEthaEdit, but also Instant Update, Aspects, and other early 90s&#x2F;00s groupware suites).<p>- Collaborative drawing and design software go all the way back to Xerox PARC projects like Videodraw.<p>- Slack wasn&#x27;t even first of its breed!')
