Item(by='Traster', descendants=None, kids=[25927426, 25927721, 25927492], score=None, time=1611750219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25908590, text='&gt;Before the internet, consumers who wanted to buy an airplane ticket would talk to a travel agent, who would type into a “green screen” terminal, which would “talk” to a mainframe computer, which would procure said airplane ticket.<p>Sorry but what? Before the internet you went to a travel agent. Now you go to... expedia (a travel agent). The only difference between then and now is your human travel agent has been replaced by an algorithm designed to efficiently fleece you.<p>This isn&#x27;t disintermediation. There is intermediation of 500 silicon valley engineers between you and your flight instead of 1 local travel agent.<p>Naturally this is A16Z&#x27;s business model, go from a state where 100,000 travel agents are getting $50,000 a year for sales and move to a state where their start up is making $5Bn a year capturing that same value.<p>What&#x27;s bizarre though, is A16Z trying to explain to you that actually that $5Bn they&#x27;re trying to capture actually doesn&#x27;t exist. Expedia isn&#x27;t a middle man making money, no according to A16Z there&#x27;s no longer a middle man. Pay no attention to the $20Bn market cap.')
