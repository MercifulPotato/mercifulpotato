Phone or WhatsApp is indeed too &quot;personal&quot; for these type of things (save for one person, an old boss of mine, who I have a scheduled zoom call with once a month. But that&#x27;s just because he and I just like the chit-chat, it appears).<p>I write up a long-form message, something like 5-8 paragraphs with real news about myself and the things I&#x27;ve been up to, and ship that alongside the usual casual chit-chat.<p>It&#x27;s surprisingly useful - I think this is the only context in which long-form e-mail is a good thing.<p>But then again, I grew up in an era where e-mail is the devil, and this was not always the case (or so they tell me).')
