Item(by='mehrdada', descendants=None, kids=[25300512], score=None, time=1607065725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25299394, text='&gt; This seems more of a case of selective enforcement, where she had been allowed to go around the process in the past (or felt that she has enough leverage to be able to do so now) and then not being allowed to do so this time.<p>Jeff&#x27;s email explicitly says the paper was &quot;approved&quot; then submitted, albeit perhaps in one day.  The two-week thing might be a policy but would be immaterial if it ended up approved anyway within whatever timeframe.
