I&#x27;ve done it about three times already and each one was a different kind of hell of new terminology I could not understand at the time (what the hell is a swap folder?), core features that broke randomly (why is my left speaker mute, after plugging a second monitor), software that failed or wouldn&#x27;t run (games, photoshop), etc. Every time I ran to get help to the internet, communities always tended to be hostile or just arcane (oh you obviously need to open up a terminal and run &#x27;xgrt -y -r &lt;your resolution&gt;&#x27; -- what in the world is a terminal?).<p>Windows just works, it&#x27;s bundled with every PC ever, and it&#x27;s hard to want to leave that for something so much more difficult.<p>Nowadays, I know I could get a Linux box up and running without issue, and that friction is an order of magnitude lower than it was a decade ago, and I&#x27;m itching towards trying once more given that these thousand cuts in Windows are killing me, but it&#x27;s gonna take time to gather up the drive to undertake the jump.')
