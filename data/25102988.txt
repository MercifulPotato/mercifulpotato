It is in the text, but it would be good to see it in the graphics.<p>&gt; <i>3% of people are destined to die due to their genetics</i><p>Hopefully, 3% is too high. In some places that had huge waves of infection, the dead rate is like 0.1% but nobody know the total number of infected persons, so we will not know the total death rate until the last wave. I hope it is like 0.1% anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t like &quot;genetics&quot; in this sentence, because there are too many factors, like age, weight, nutrition, ... Probably a part is just genetics, but it is probably just one of the factors.<p>(If someone had a bad car accident 5 years ago, and the doctors had to remove one of the lungs, the chances of dying are probably higher [citation needed], and it is not related to any genetic background.)<p>More in general, the number of asymptomatic is still not very well known.')
