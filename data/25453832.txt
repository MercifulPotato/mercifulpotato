Their intention to abandon x86 isn&#x27;t a clarion call for the obsolescence of x86.<p>Personal computers generally go where Windows goes. Heck, that&#x27;s arguably part of why Apple left PowerPC for Intel in the first place. Apple has tremendous impact on design, form factor, and other visionary steps that the market takes. I do not deny that. Still, in terms of hardware and the development ecosystem, Microsoft simply has a lot more market inertia than does Apple.<p>This is nothing like 64bit vs 32bit. That was a difficult (MacOS didn&#x27;t drop 32bit app support until Catalina) but obvious (unless you hate RAM) leap forward. In contrast, Apple Silicon is a leap sideways whose opportunity arose because Intel&#x27;s flagship process node has had a rough few years. There may be inherent advantages to Apple Silicon as a technology, but nobody should make the unproven assumption that Apple Silicon is universally superior to any and every possible TSMC 5nm x86 chip.')
