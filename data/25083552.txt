It&#x27;s rated to 30kW. That&#x27;s so I can have a decent shower. You could maybe run 2 showers off it, if you both don&#x27;t mind low pressure and the heating is off.<p>I&#x27;m a brit in a small 3 bed 2 bath terrace house (I think you call them row houses in the US? Assuming you&#x27;re American, apologies if that&#x27;s wrong!).<p>30kW at 120V is 250A (it&#x27;s actually more because of ACs power function). That&#x27;s way above what a standard house or a domestic supply is designed to sustain.<p>Now add to that that this huge peak power is very synchronised. You, your neighbours and everyone else in your neighbourhood shower around the same times. And those aren&#x27;t times renweables are most available. This is no problem for gas because you can store gas and pump it out as needed. But for electricity? You&#x27;ll need to revamp your grid, forget non-constant renewables like wind or solar (I&#x27;m a fan of both but they&#x27;re not suitable). And you need to build a tonne of capacity that won&#x27;t be used 90% of the time.<p>This is the killer app for gas.')
