The market for Apple devices with dying batteries is quite strong: just browse eBay if you need proof. There’s an industry of buyers who refurbish these devices at a profit, and the purchase price for these used devices remains impressively high.<p>Heck, I just sold a three-year-old iPhone X with a “service battery” warning for nearly $400.')
