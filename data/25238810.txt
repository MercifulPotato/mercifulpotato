As a business owner myself I can attest to this. But I think the advice gets twisted. The way I see it is this:<p>Everyone who succeeds in business believes that they can do it.<p>Not everyone who believes they can do it succeeds.<p>Therefore, believing you can succeed is necessary, but only a small percentage of people who believe are actually correct.<p>Doesn’t mean you shouldn’t believe, but chances are you are wrong.')
