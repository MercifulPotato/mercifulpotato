For coronaviruses, however, recombination means that small genomic subregions can have independent origins, identifiable if sufficient sampling has been done in the animal reservoirs that support the endemic circulation, co-infection and recombination that appear to be common. [2]<p>&gt; Recombination seems to be rampant in HCoV-OC43 viruses and contributed to originate the A to E viral genotypes, as well as viruses that do not belong to these major genotypes. [3]<p>Unfortunately, nature doesn&#x27;t &quot;design&quot; anything, it&#x27;s just the consequence of natural selection and fitness of new generations. While the mutation rate might low compared to influenza, the mutation rate is very high compared to something like a prokaryote, enough so that there&#x27;s an article entitled &quot;Why are RNA virus mutation rates so damn high?&quot; We&#x27;ve already seen a gain of function mutation creating enhanced infectivity and a recombination event involving ferrets, so it&#x27;s not a stretch that we might see a new more of this in the future. Whether or not it will impact the toxicity of the virus or whether or not its susceptible to a vaccine is up in the air, but once an effective vaccine exists strong selective pressure will be placed on versions of the viruses that evade it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jvi.asm.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;84&#x2F;7&#x2F;3134" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jvi.asm.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;84&#x2F;7&#x2F;3134</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-020-0771-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-020-0771-4</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7111218&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7111218&#x2F;</a>')
