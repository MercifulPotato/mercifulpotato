The number of customers who don&#x27;t care about all the notification regarding upcoming expiry is staggering. I keep assisting them to renew during the grace period, while they put the end-users at risk of software failure. They expect us to work for them (unpaid customers) and manage all the problems that come with late rewenal (speedy releases, no testing, urgent support requests, etc). IMO we should enable auto renewal just to help them avoid this unbearable situation.')
