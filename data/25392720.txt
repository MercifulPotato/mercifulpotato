That said most languages, including D, have supersets that are context free and can be used to build an AST which can then be refined further with context sensitive checks (ie. variables are used after declaration) and then even further with type checks.<p>Many language tools don&#x27;t need a full blown language parser and can get by with a context-free parser for the language&#x27;s superset. Things like autocompletion, spell checking, documentation&#x2F;highlighting can all be implemented using context-free parsers.')
