Nothing was justified here at all. There was also no argument made by me. Nor did I say you were defending the US. All I asked was a question:<p>What action should you take if there are repeated terrorist acts happening in your country where people are slaughtered by the hundreds? You only know the origin of these terror attacks originate from a specific cultural ethnic group, and you know you need to stop the attacks now or the next attack could harm your family.<p>It&#x27;s a hard question, but posing a hard question isn&#x27;t a justification of of the atrocities committed by China. It&#x27;s more of an illustration of the complexity of the situation and an illustration of the darker capabilities that can erupt from within every individual when the situation is extreme... Anyway the question still stands... what would you do?<p>The other part of the of the question is to help people rise to a higher level and analyze the full complexity of the situation rather than have a simple minded gut reaction to everything. The world is complex and no single action can really be placed in a &quot;justified&quot; box or an &quot;unjustified&quot; box, yet this is how people think.')
