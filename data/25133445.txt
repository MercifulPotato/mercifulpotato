They&#x27;re given four or five years, which comes out to less than a page a week. Yet more than half will fail to complete the task due to attrition. (Yeah, I know this is over-simplified...)<p>This is extremely simplified.<p>In my PhD program (engineering), you had to take more credits than a MS student does (and if you did not come in with an MS, you had to take those as well). A total of about 54 credits of just coursework - not research.<p>Then you have advisors who will not let you graduate unless you have published N papers (and N varies widely) in their preferred journals. And <i>then</i> you write it all for your 100 page thesis. I know all students slow down a lot when they have to write that thesis, but for many students, writing the thesis is the easiest part, and only at the end.')
