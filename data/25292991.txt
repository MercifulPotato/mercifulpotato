Item(by='Erlich_Bachman', descendants=None, kids=[25294982], score=None, time=1607022163, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25292861, text='Yep, store of value is actually a useful function for many indivudals and companies, and we are betting on that storing of value will become more and more valueable as we progress.<p>Storing of value is not just &quot;hoarding&quot;, useless activity. It is an important ingredient in making many of the business processes and just things work in general. It is a very impotant function. And thus if we have tools that make that function work well, - they will be valueable.<p>And as it turns out, there aren&#x27;t that many things that work well as a store of value. It&#x27;s not like you can take any thing or instrument or contract or whatever else, and make it work as a store of value. In some sense, the ability to act as a store of value is scarce in itself. We already have some instruments, like gold, properties, land, etc. Stocks and ETFs and such are also kinda a store of value, but have a lot problems (but also other functions besides just storing the value). So yes, we welcome another way to store value, this market is by no means saturated as it turns out. Gold has it&#x27;s own problems.')
