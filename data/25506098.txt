That in and of itself is a bad-faith claim frequently used by bigots to try and evade getting thrown out of a venue, by turning around the accusation onto those calling out bad behaviour. Unfortunately a lot of peope have taken this claim at face value, and have started repeating it.<p>The thing is, I <i>have</i> discussed these sorts of topics with people in good faith. The common factor is that those discussions were never in public venues, because someone who wants to discuss these topics in good faith realizes that they are sensitive and easily-abused.<p>On the other hand, every time I&#x27;ve seen someone &quot;discuss&quot; these topics in public, there were clearly identifiable signs of bad faith, independent from the topic itself. It usually doesn&#x27;t take much prodding to make the mask come off, so to say.<p>Edit: For additional background, I&#x27;m mostly speaking with my &quot;community moderator&quot; hat on, here. I somewhat regularly get brought in to clean up mismoderated communities that have gotten completely out of hand, so over time I&#x27;ve learned how to identify bad-faith actors quickly, separately from opinions.')
