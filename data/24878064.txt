In Germany, there has been a lot of research put into that before the non-nuclear strategy was decided. It was a political decision, but it has been prepared by many, many engineers and researchers.<p>In fact, there are times where Germany exports needed energy to France, in spite of that France has much more nuclear power. Sometimes that happens in hot sommers, when rivers have to little water and they become hot. Then, nuclear plants need to be shut down because otherwise they would cause environmental damage.<p>Other times, it happens in winter, because a lot of heating in France is electrical to accomodate for nuclear energy. But sometimes there is a shortfall, and it turns out that on windy winter days there is an excess of wind energy in western and northern Europe.<p>Another thing, storing energy is not necessarily expensive. A lot of energy use is things like room heating, room cooling, or hot water. Now, heat can be stored efficiently for many hours. (In larger tanks or earth installations, it can even be stored efficiently for months).')
