You are welcome to make a Constitutional argument that goes against the existing jurisprudence, and Constitutional interpretation does change over time, but it does so only slowly. One of the most important principles in Constitutional interpretation is that of stari decisis, or issues which have already been decided. In almost all circumstances, courts adhere to precedence. This isn&#x27;t always the case, but when you are fighting against the current understanding of the Constitution, you need to realize that you&#x27;re fighting an uphill battle, and frame your arguments as such.<p>So where are we in our understanding of these issues? First, the Supreme Court has literally ruled that the Tenth Amendment is useless. Specifically, in US v Sprague (1931, SCOTUS ruled that the Tenth Amendment is a &quot;truism&quot; that &quot;added nothing to the [Constitution] as originally ratified.&quot;[1] It was later used to create an anti-commandeering understanding, which in this circumstance just means that the federal government can&#x27;t pass a law that requires states to enforce a federal mask mandate. There might be a public health exception to that though, but that&#x27;s where the tenth amendment would be relevant.<p>You also need to understand that SCOTUS has repeatedly expanded the commerce clause to cover basically everything. The federal government can pass pretty much any law they want, say it affects interstate commerce, and win. You don&#x27;t have to like that interpretation, but everyone follows it. It was only during the Rehnquist Court that a few exceptions were carved out, but they&#x27;re very, very narrow. The most famous example was that the court ruled that the federal government couldn&#x27;t ban handguns in schools under the commerce clause. But for anything even vaguely interstate, and a contagious virus certainly counts, the federal government is allowed to pass pretty much any law it wants.<p>The courts also tend to be pretty generous towards allowing emergency powers to deal with a genuine crisis. I expect that the federal government could do pretty much anything it wants to deal with COVID. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d allow a national lockdown by executive order right now. A legislative mask mandate would be completely non-controversial from a Constitutional perspective.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Judicial_interpretation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_...</a> - Yes, this is Wikipedia, but I don&#x27;t feel like reading a SCOTUS case to write a HN comment')
