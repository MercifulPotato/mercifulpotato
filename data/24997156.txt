One possible approach is via smarter storage (think those dedicated datacenter storage servers) that lets the malware think they flipped the box while keeping the original safe as a previous version of the box, even if the box is a virtualized block storage instead of a file.<p>Another is to run your OS (and the malware) under a hypervisor, hoping the malware can&#x27;t escape the virtual environment (which is more or less what gaming consoles do which varying levels of success).')
