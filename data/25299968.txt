Maybe these companies simply want young, ambitious and smart people and their coding interviews measure exactly that: Young (has enough time practicing leetcode questions), ambitious (is willing to spend time practicing leetcode questions) and smart (recently graduated and still has detailed CS and algorithmic knowledge in mind and is mentally capable of solving algorithmic problems).')
