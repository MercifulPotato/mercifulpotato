Because every release is time limited, you have to stick to the official release at every time, or else fork completely.<p>The Ethereum foundation kept a huge stash from the pre-mine, so you&#x27;d have a hostile actor with a large position on your forked chain, enough to crash the price of any nascent chain. This combination is a governance model rooted in game theory.<p>Ethereum Classic shows pretty well how this works in practice. There was controversy around the DAO, yet no fork could be kept functional. It is a Grayscale project which they will keep around as long as people are willing to speculate on it. Nobody pretends it has any real use.')
