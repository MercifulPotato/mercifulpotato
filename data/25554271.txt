It loads way slower (sometimes seconds vs. consistently hundreds of milliseconds), scrolling feels sluggish, and old.reddit.com shows significantly more content and comments in less space - not to mention the content width maxes out at 740px when my viewport is ~1920px.<p>On top of this, despite obviously being designed for it, the mobile experience is borderline unusable and still obviously trying to push you towards the app. If I want to read a comment thread on new reddit, half of the comments will be hidden behind &quot;x more replies&quot; or &quot;continue this thread&quot;. When I click that link, it might scroll me to a random ass article suggestion rather than the actual comment. Then, when I click back, it will scroll me to the top again, and it will reload all of the comments. Or, alternatively, it&#x27;ll beg me to make an account and not even let me view the comments.<p>Yuck.')
