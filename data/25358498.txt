Scroll behavior is uniform in all windows on my desktop but some websites think they are so special that they should change that just for them. I personally hate smooth scrolling and have it disabled, I can&#x27;t understand why people like waiting for a useless animation when the operation could be done instantly. I feel like the computer is wasting my time! So when a website re-enables it with its own buggy JS implementation, well it&#x27;s disturbing. (Thanks for giving me an excuse for my own rant!)')
