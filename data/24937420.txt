If I don&#x27;t like how facebook or twitter are contributing to the information ecosystem I could go hang out on Gab or some other niche platform - but the tradeoff is that the people I want to interact with aren&#x27;t there.  These systems are inertial - while it is a great idea that future platforms should implement design choices that incentivize a well informed public and discourage conspiracy-mongering and misinformation that doesn&#x27;t fix the issues with the current information ecosystem for years if not decades to come.  Even if users were well informed about content moderation policies (they aren&#x27;t), and users were rational actors (they&#x27;re not), there are other goods involved that prevent that sort of ordered transition scenario.  Frankly large scale platforms need to make significant changes to how they handle their role in information-space.')
