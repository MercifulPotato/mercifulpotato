Some routes I&#x27;ve flown are scheduled for different types throughout the day; it&#x27;s not uncommon to fly on the other type. As a bonus, different types have different premium rows, if you reserve a non-premium seat and the type is changed, you may keep the seat number and get a premium seat.')
