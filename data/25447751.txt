But consider the logic:<p>&gt; &quot;Infants, kids, teens, young people, young adults, middle aged with no conditions etc. have zero to little risk….so we use them to develop herd…we want them infected…&quot; Alexander added.<p>&gt; &quot;[I]t may be that it will be best if we open up and flood the zone and let the kids and young folk get infected&quot; in order to get &quot;natural immunity…natural exposure,&quot; Alexander wrote on July 24 to Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn, Caputo and eight other senior officials. Caputo subsequently asked Alexander to research the idea, according to emails obtained by the House Oversight Committee&#x27;s select subcommittee on coronavirus.<p>This seems like a good idea to me and I am surprised countries have gone into lockdown mode instead. The risk of severe illness and fatality are almost nonexistent for the young. If they develop antibodies and stop becoming vectors for transmission&#x2F;spreading, it has two benefits. The first is that those who are willing to take on that risk are allowed to go about their lives as usual. Businesses can stay open, people can meet with each other, go to restaurants, etc. The second benefit is that once those cohorts develop immunity, it allows OTHERS to re-enter society, because others around them are less likely to be sources of transmission.<p>Personally I think retaining individual freedom is very important, and people should be able to assess for themselves what risks they are willing to take (what tradeoffs they are okay with). So I am for any strategy that means that those who are risk-averse just isolate themselves, while those who are OK with the risks can make their own choices freely.')
