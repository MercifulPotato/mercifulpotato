The Jsfuck method can&#x27;t encode a <i>direct</i> &quot;eval&quot;, only an indirect one :-)<p>Thus the emphasis on <i>direct</i>.  Well, Jsfuck can encode a direct eval inside an indirect eval, but that doesn&#x27;t give it any advantages, it still can&#x27;t access the surrounding lexical environment in the form of &quot;let&quot; and &quot;const&quot; variables.<p>(I didn&#x27;t know about Jsfuck though - it looks fun, thanks!)')
