ETrade appends the 2FA token to your password, but also enforces a password character limit. Yep, that means turning on 2FA reduces your password character limit. From what I hear, it has some surprising behavior if your password is already at the character limit and you turn on 2FA.<p>(Aside: ETrade has some very sketchy security practices, like apparently letting you use the 2FA token on its own to reset your password (according to a coworker), but that&#x27;s another discussion.)')
