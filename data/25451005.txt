I downvoted your comment simply because it didn&#x27;t add anything to the discussion and you made an assumption that has several faults in it.<p>For one, your &quot;mental model&quot; is off because you assume that the first part of &quot;readable bytes&quot; is accurate. Without actually seeing the PDF in question, you don&#x27;t know if the &quot;readable bytes&quot; are actually corrupted and Preview is fixing them to make them readable. That would mean that Preview is actually correct in its behavior and the source document is what&#x27;s flawed.<p>On the tail end of your mental model, then, is another assumption which is that this results in &quot;unreadable bytes&quot; but that&#x27;s not accurate either. The PDF that results from a save in Preview may be accurate to the PDF specification and is perfectly readable as a PDF in any PDF application&#x2F;reader. What&#x27;s no longer readable is the extra content that was originally in the file that may not have been saved correctly, in-spec, or may have been corrupt to begin with.<p>A big hint as to what&#x27;s going on here, now that I&#x27;ve had some time to review this, is that the &quot;corruption&quot; happens consistently - the letter &quot;a&quot; is always replaced by the same &quot;corrupted&quot; character, the letter &quot;b&quot; seems to be consistently replaced with the same character, etc. That points, in my opinion, to a lookup that&#x27;s no longer correct. What side of that lookup is bad is hard to say without seeing the file in question.')
