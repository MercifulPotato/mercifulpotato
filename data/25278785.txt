To me Google+ having few users and not having content pushed in my face was a bonus. Text chatting happily while in a Gmail tab (usually open when I&#x27;m working) but with minimal distraction and not having to context-switch - suits me. And now a lovely library of free 3D assets is for the chop.<p>Once upon a time I earned a little kudos for having my finger on the pulse and spotting decent emerging tech&#x2F;trends. I was laughed at by many when, in 1994, I switched from a senior role in print news to one in the nascent online space - but many people took an interest because of my recommendation or at my urging.<p>I am no seer, I am rarely an evangelist, but I hate it that many people I know have invested time&#x2F;effort in Google stuff on my recommendation. I feel as though I have let them down.')
