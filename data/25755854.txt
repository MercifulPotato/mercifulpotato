Item(by='the_af', descendants=None, kids=[25756072], score=None, time=1610495900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25753711, text='While I disagree with XKCD&#x27;s (and let me note, with many here on HN; I believe I first read this argument that only states can interfere with free speech defended by HN&#x27;ers) narrowing down of the concept of free speech to &quot;only counts as censorship if the government does it&quot; -- and it actually warms my heart that you and many others agree with me that corporate censorship is censorship, and even more important than state censorship -- I disagree that Randall Munroe is against free speech.<p>I think the issue is complex, but probably related to its sister concept of tolerance and with &quot;the paradox of tolerance&quot; [1]:<p>&gt; &quot;The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant. Karl Popper described it as the seemingly paradoxical idea that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to believe Randall Munroe supports free speech and at the same time believes someone spewing hateful vitriol can be kicked out of whatever private venue by the owners&#x2F;administrators of said venue. In order for you to believe this, you simply must accept that Randall is using a different, possibly more legalistic version of &quot;free speech&quot; than you. Again, you cannot claim he is against free speech because he thinks corporate censorship is ok -- first, he doesn&#x27;t exactly defend corporate censorship in his comic, and second, you&#x27;re begging the question! You are claiming &quot;corporate censorship&quot; is against free speech, which is not a foregone conclusion and is exactly what is being debated.<p>Finally, the whole &quot;this is because Randall Munroe is a leftie and, like all lefties, is against free speech&quot; angle only serves to inflame the debate with name calling. Anyone going for this &quot;like all lefties&quot; is not interested in honest debate at all.<p>I feel weird having to point all this out because I, in fact, think corporate censorship is against free speech -- my concept, not what whatever amendment says -- and in this day and age, it&#x27;s even worse than state censorship.')
