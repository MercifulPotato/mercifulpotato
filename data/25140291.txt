So the actual percent would be somewhere in the range of 85-97%?<p>(No actual math done here, I&#x27;m ballparking it based on looking at error ranges with sample size 100 at work; my main point is that I don&#x27;t think the ~20k enrolled in each group affects this particular error range, so even though &quot;94.9%&quot; is stated precisely the actual data isn&#x27;t nearly so precise)')
