Item(by='minimuffins', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609783721, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25632723, text='&gt; why shouldn&#x27;t I exercise the power I have?<p>Absolutely correct.<p>This is an IS&#x2F;OUGHT distinction. Who cares what labor &quot;should&quot; do under the employer&#x27;s ideology. Not too surprising they want us to think of ourselves as equal players making fair contracts with each other, while one side holds the entire world in their hands.<p>Since we&#x27;re not out in the streets starving we&#x27;re supposed to shut up and be thankful, no matter what, because the ruling ideology says they&#x27;ve given us enough (money as a wage, though little other power). All the crying about &quot;contracts,&quot; &quot;greed,&quot; &quot;entitlement,&quot; etc is just pure ideological smokescreen trying to get you not to notice the obvious, fundamental conflict between worker and owner. They want us to look at a long running historic power struggle and see something other than a power struggle so we won&#x27;t fight for ourselves. Ridiculous.')
