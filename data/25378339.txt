There is some argument to be made for exp, as it is considered an &#x27;elementary function&#x27;.  I was going off this statement from wikipedia on closed form expressions<p>&quot;It may contain constants, variables, certain &quot;well-known&quot; operations (e.g., + − × ÷), and functions (e.g., nth root, exponent, logarithm, trigonometric functions, and inverse hyperbolic functions), but usually no limit, differentiation, or integration.&quot;<p>Edit: I think if you say an integral is closed form, you must also admit that a limit is closed form, since an integral is defined in terms of limits (though technically more restrictive).  In that case, you should also admit that we already had a closed form expression for this number, as it could be expressed as a limit of an iterative process.')
