People have children because having a genetic connection is important to them. That&#x27;s not a &#x27;society-thing&#x27;. That&#x27;s just humanity. There are exception to this, and that&#x27;s why foster parents should be applauded because fostering and adopting is great moral act. But I wouldn&#x27;t impugn the rest of society because most people don&#x27;t adopt, but instead choose to have biological children.')
