We don&#x27;t have enough doses for everyone to get the vaccine, so whether it provides sterilizing immunity very much does matter to the question of who to allocate it to and how.<p>(If we did have enough doses ready to go for everyone, the government solution of &quot;have the government buy it and distribute it to everyone&quot; and the free market solution of &quot;everyone and their insurance is very willing to buy one dose but values a second dose at $0&quot; would basically collapse to the same thing, and so the author&#x27;s argument would be moot.)')
