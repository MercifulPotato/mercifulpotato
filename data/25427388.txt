Advocates point out that most plants are inedible while most animals are edible. Also, all of the nutrients required by the human body are present in animals, if you eat their organs. There is a small amount of vitamin c in animal meats, but it turns out you only need large amounts of vitamin c if you are metabolizing mostly carbohydrates. Compare this to the heavy supplementation required on a vegan diet, it seems a lot more likely that our bodies are designed to eat animals. There are massive holes in the studies that connect meat with colon cancer and other diseases — it turns out there isn’t a single randomized, controlled study that looks at that.')
