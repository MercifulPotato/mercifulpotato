And I’d still prefer something that mostly preserves commonly-understood pattern syntax. Having to guess whether ‘anythingBut’ means (?!...) or [^...] is not encouraging.<p>(This was apparently ported from JavaScript, where it is even more pointless: template literals can take care of the escaping part without abandoning standard pattern syntax. But as far as I know, Java has no equivalent feature.)')
