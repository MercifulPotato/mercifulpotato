If anyone at Anandtech wants some help with setting that up, they can reach me at [username] at x-plane.com.<p>X-Plane is indeed super scriptable, which is used by various IHV’s to auto test new drivers and hardware. We also use it extensively internally in our CI testing suite.<p>Edit: To the OP, I can provide performance benchmarks from an i7-6700k vs Ryzen 3900X for your Dad. It’s unfortunately not super apples for apples. What I can say is that the massive L3 cache is doing wonders for X-Plane, and the greater core count is definitely going to be more relevant in the future as well.')
