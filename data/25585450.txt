Recognizing that “knowledge” about the universe is always tentative and contingent and that an understanding of the universe is to be replaced when one with strictly better at predicting observations is identified <i>is</i> the scientific process. And it&#x27;s a pretty big change from the approaches taken prior to it&#x27;s adoption.<p>&gt; In this way science can never be really wrong, because it is always open to being proved wrong<p>“Science” is almost entirely a combination of openness to being proven wrong and a particular understanding of what it means for something to be proven wrong. Since it is an epistemology, it cannot be “really wrong” if it is consistent, except in terms of a <i>different</i> epistemology.<p>&gt; I think it&#x27;s rather that we have had a bunch of great curious people who worked on interesting stuff and found out a lot about nature.<p>We had a lot of that without the scientific method, too. What the scientific method did is to provide a framework in which the work of great (and not so great) curious people could be effectively aggregated so that they built-in each other, whereas pre-scientific approaches did that notably less well in terms of building an ever-better understanding of the physict universe, because work was judged by standards other than predictive power.<p>&gt; But we can&#x27;t equate that with institutional credentialed authoritative &quot;Science&quot;.<p>Science is exactly about authority having little to do with institutional credentials.')
