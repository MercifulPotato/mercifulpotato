We would have viable nuclear power by now if it weren&#x27;t for all of the leftists in the 70s-90s protesting its existence and making it a liability for many companies to even consider it.<p>The unintended consequences of this would be stunning.  But I suspect if the people that enacted these proposals were ever around to see the results, they would shift the blame.<p>&quot;Carbon tax should be so high that nobody asks if they should fly but if they can afford to fly.&quot;<p>Just like all of these types of proposals, they only help the rich and powerful.  Propose gun control?  But hire private guards with guns to protect you.  Propose Universal health care?  But have the best private care in the world that the rest of us will no longer be able to afford.<p>We also aren&#x27;t focusing on the actual source of the problem.  The US only accounts for around 25% of total carbon emission.  India and China make up a much larger percentage, yet can  can continue to pollute and destroy the environment with impunity while gaining power in the process.  While economies shrink in places that have strict carbon emission rules, China doesn&#x27;t follow those same rules and grows.  It&#x27;s sort of like playing baseball when the other team is allowed to take steroids.<p>..and before you tell me about per&#x2F;capita and &#x27;fairness&#x27;, this doesn&#x27;t really matter in the end when humanity is destroyed.')
