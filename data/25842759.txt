I suspect the doubled window alone is responsible for much of the improvement.<p>According to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fileformats.archiveteam.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ARJ" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fileformats.archiveteam.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ARJ</a> , ARJ uses something similar to LZH&#x27;s lh6 algorithm, which is LZ with a 32k window + Huffman, so the difference could be due to ARJ&#x27;s reduced file format overhead compared to ZIP, or perhaps slightly better Huffman codes.')
