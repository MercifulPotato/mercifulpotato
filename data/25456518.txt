By Jeff Dean&#x27;s own admission the paper was approved for release.<p>The demand for retraction was initially given while refusing to state what the reason(s) for the demand were.  Only after the meeting where they demanded she retract the paper did they belatedly agree to read her the feedback that they stated as the reason.  They wouldn&#x27;t even let her read it first hand.<p>Ultimately it seems like Google could have plainly stated their issues with the paper from the start, and that said issues were not so serious that they merited a demand for retraction.<p>There are a number of things that just don&#x27;t add up.  Even if you take it at face value that Gebru&#x27;s ultimatum demands were unreasonable, there are several problems with how the situation got to that point in the first place.')
