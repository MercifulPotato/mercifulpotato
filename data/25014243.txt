A business may apply those, but if they do, they need to conform to a restrictive law (AGBG) regulating what is and isn&#x27;t allowed in such conditions. E.g. no future changes without an exchange of equal value to the changes, no surprising clauses that are not &quot;normal&quot; for this kind of situation, no grossly unequal considerations to begin with.<p>Individuals and businesses still have freedom of contract however, if a contract is really negotiated freely, that is, in an equal exchange between both parties. If there was no negotiation or a very unequal one (&quot;take it or leave it, we&#x27;ll block any of your change requests but you need the ink now&quot;), AGBG applies. In all situations mentioned above, the consumer had no opportunity to negotiate (a symbolic &quot;negotiation phone number&quot; in the smallprint doesn&#x27;t count, etc), so all those fancyful clauses or the whole contract conditions would just be unenforcable, with the most consumer-friendly interpretation applied to the rest as a matter of law.')
