Item(by='bonestormii_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602562188, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24761647, text='Lol. I want to type full words, and feel that doing so is near frictionless. I access around 70 environments regularly, many of which are frequently re-imaged during testing, and I appreciate the fact that typing works the same on all of them. My co-workers also appreciate that I am not installing weird typing macros on our devices.<p>Efficiency for me is not the same as efficiency for you. Deal with it.<p>I&#x27;ll also add that something like vim is specialized and very useful. It is <i>easier</i> to use vim in a mouseless environment, which is sometimes a necessity. I use it fairly well, and it has paid dividends on the time invested. I can appreciate the value of a good tool.<p>But typing <i>speed</i> is not the same as <i>efficiency</i> because <i>standards are efficient in their own way</i>. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll say &quot;oh, you don&#x27;t value words and have nothing important to say&quot;, but that&#x27;s a ridiculous argument. It is simply that, in my opinion, this type of thing is not worth the overhead it creates, much like extremely customized vim configs. Time is invested in the pursuit of efficiency, and it is never returned. One day the config ceases to function correctly, or your friend&#x2F;coworker&#x2F;family member tries to use the keyboard and can&#x27;t use it effectively, so it gets disabled.')
