The only case where Facebook&#x27;s censorship is a positive is if the following 2 statements are both true:<p>- FB&#x27;s moderators posses better judgment than me as to what is and isn&#x27;t true<p>- FB&#x27;s moderators will always act in the best interest of the users and not the company when they come into conflict<p>I would say that the first point is very unlikely to be true, and the second is certain not to be true.
