I think they should. That is: strictly within the US market.<p>When they operate outside the US market, they have to (also) adhere to whatever law exists for that market. If that creates a conflict, the company has a choice to either open up show elsewhere, outside of US jurisdiction (if that&#x27;s the only way to comply with local market rules), or stay in the US and leave the foreign market alone.<p>Either way, being a US company should never be a valid excuse to violate laws (and&#x2F;or legal protections) somewhere abroad.<p>It ultimately is up to a company to choose what they do and where they do it. To me, the current status quo appears to be that many US companies have been (illegally) enforcing US laws outside of US jurisdiction. Aside from that, and maybe even on a far worse level, they have been essentially been making up de facto &quot;private laws&quot;, in their TOP&#x2F;EULA &quot;contracts&quot;.<p>Last time I checked, law should be left to governments. Preferable through democratic due process. Certainly not to commercial companies, who are either privately owned, or publicly by a select few rather undemocratic entities.')
