Almost all of the people I know who have fled California (to TX and AZ) are conservatives. I know a number of liberals who have considered it, but haven&#x27;t done so (yet?). From my (purely anecdotal experience) I don&#x27;t think it will turn Texas purple, I think it will make Texas more red and California more blue... further dividing two of our largest states.<p>That would be unfortunate if it&#x27;s true because I believe each state is better off when it&#x27;s purple, when the best ideas from both sides are being fought for. For complex problems, we should not try liberal or conservative proposals, but actually implement both... one of them (randomly), with the agreement that it will be measured and then the other will be tried later to measure the same metrics. Or implement them in two different parts of the state simultaneously and then switch them after a few years. In other words, we should be A&#x2F;B testing our laws to see which one performs better. It would be challenging to do it scientifically, it won&#x27;t be perfect, but whatever we do learn is probably better than arguing about ideas for years.<p>Also, I think both sides knowing that their idea is going to be tried and tested would hopefully chill everyone out a little and help bring some fairness to the process.')
