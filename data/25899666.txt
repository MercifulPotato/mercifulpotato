Humans are absolute proof of that. That&#x27;s not to say Lidar isn&#x27;t useful, or cost effective given the complexity of the problem, or even just a really good idea that will make autonomous cars better drivers than people. It might be all of those things. \nAll my comment says is that Lidar is not a requirement for driving, and we have a very obvious proof of that.<p>Anyone saying that Lidar is necessary for driving is ignoring the hundreds of millions of examples of driving with just a pair of 2d cameras and a highly specialised organic supercomputer.<p>EDIT: The point another poster made about weather and bright sunshine is a reasonable one - humans can&#x27;t drive when they can&#x27;t see either, so Lidar would potentially make an autonomous car better at driving than people. That would be an example of how Lidar is useful, but still not <i>necessary</i>.')
