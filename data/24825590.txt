My Poang chair from Ikea came with a 10 year guarantee and I expect it to last longer than that. This idea that everything that comes out of Ikea is barely going to make it home is nonsense.<p>Of course if you buy a side table for Â£6 then you can&#x27;t expect it to last long. That isn&#x27;t representative of the whole though.')
