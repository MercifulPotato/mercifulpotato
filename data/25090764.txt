Dopamine may be involved in some feelings of reward, but it&#x27;s certainly not the only factor, and it also doesn&#x27;t simply signal &quot;pleasure&quot; or &quot;achievement&quot; to the rest of your brain. IIRC, it&#x27;s not at all certain that a sense of achievement can be compared to the typical scenarios in which dopamine is mentioned: eating, drugs.')
