Instead, it is a criticism of the current abandonment of the Xorg project, which I toy with the code from time to time. I also do not use any DE and use X in the leanest way I can, and I still notice such input lag, whether it&#x27;s playing games or some gui application seeming to register input at a different x,y position than it was clicked. This does not mean I&#x27;m a xorg hater, quite the opposite. Studying the codebase, it seems pretty well written and documented and it proved me the &quot;X is unmaintainable&quot; mantra is a lie. I can elaborate more on other issues of the async &amp; client-server nature of X. I&#x27;m not spouting nonsense.')
