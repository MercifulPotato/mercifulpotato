They&#x27;d have regressed to the trend sooner or later anyway, whether it be via flu or natural attrition, but it ended up being COVID.<p>This comparison also assumes there are somehow great differences between European countries, that Sweden and France are as incomparable as Sweden and Saudi Arabia or India. Nobody ever presents an argument for why that is, so these &quot;don&#x27;t look at France or the UK, Sweden can only be compared to Norway&quot; argumetns end up looking like motivated reasoning.<p>Swedish deaths are not going to be anything remarkable this year compared over the last 10 years. Probably 3-5% higher than the 10 year average, so a few thousand deaths, all of whom will have been very old. For a supposedly deadly pandemic that&#x27;s pretty good.')
