You could always tax the shit out of fossil fuels and they won&#x27;t be competitive. You could also make other laws that punish fossil fuel usage with death penalty since you could argue its a crime against humanity. \nI mean, law is an abstract construct. This is a live or death situation. Even if we need to abandon 30 years of economic growth for the sake of surviving, then maybe it&#x27;s what we need to do.')
