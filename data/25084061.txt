I got the dash pass with my cc and have been ordering a couple times a week. That is until I finally cancelled over some recurring bad experiences:<p>1. The food is wrong often. Whether it’s the dasher’s fault or the app’s or the restaurant’s who knows, but it happens too frequently. Granted DD gives an automatic refund in credits but our meal is ruined at that point and no one wants to wait another hour to roll the dice on a DD order.<p>2. All the good restaurants are leaving DoorDash. Maybe this is more so a trend in my town but at the beginning of COVID there were lots of great restaurants on it and now there’s just chains like Chipotle and McDonalds. Apparently it’s not just DD that loses money on these orders.<p>Now I will just call the restaurant directly and pick it up myself. Much better quality control, timing, cost and selection.')
