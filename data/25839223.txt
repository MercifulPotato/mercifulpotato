Our team spent 2 years running a design agency to understand what parts of the design process could (and should) be automated, and realized that designers spend a lot of time copy&#x2F;pasting content into design templates. We thought their had to be a better way to do this with technology, so we built the V1 of Aesthetic, which is free for anyone to use as of today.<p>When a user enters a link to our platform, we&#x27;re crawling the page for all of its meta data, and then using any Schema.org, Open Graph or Title tag markup as props that we interpolate into a series of React components. While this version of the app is limited to just working with web-based content via our app, we&#x27;re going to be launch our API and enable users to plug in any dynamic content source as well as import their own templates for use.<p>We&#x27;re excited to get this into the hands of the HN community for feedback and in hopes this can be helpful in automating people&#x27;s marketing workflows today.<p>Thanks!\nJohn Milinovich\njohn(at)aesthetic.com')
