They didn&#x27;t drive any traffic.  Or if the customer puts in the exact app name and buys it.<p>&gt; In any event that is a different issue.<p>It&#x27;s very relevant to whether 30% is reasonable.  Apple acts as a legitimate affiliate some of the time, but they forcibly take that fee all of the time.')
