A certain large, loud, famous guy on the Internet had made money in the 1990s business environment of California. He bought an expensive house in the hills in the San Francisco Bay Area. He used his home address and local Internet connection to stream digital content immediately, and was quite vocal about that in groups, including in front of me personally. The content was sort of &quot;Pirate Party&quot; content, which he maximized with his engineering skills, and every challenge or legal situation that came up, written or at a party, he would literally yell and become physically agitated about his &quot;rights&quot; .. Of course this included full-length first run movies from the US (as far as I could tell).<p>In those days it was just one of the many ridiculous moments associated with the rapid 1990s Internet situation in California. I was annoyed but only slightly, knowing that this guy was personally instigating legal action on millions of others. However, this is all true.')
