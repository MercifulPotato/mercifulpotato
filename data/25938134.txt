Item(by='konjin', descendants=None, kids=[25938302], score=None, time=1611807715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25937787, text='&gt;For those who disagree, how do you explain the very large number of people who spends tons of time and energy trying to get good at maths but fails to even grasp simple concepts like calculus?<p>Calculus isn&#x27;t simple, calculus is an abuse of notation that works by anomalous cancellation in most of the cases you see in university.<p>Even for something as simple as arithmetic our notation is terrible and misleading. The people who are &#x27;good at maths&#x27; are actually good at making unwarranted assumptions and extrapolations from incomplete data.
