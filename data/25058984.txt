I never got AdWords or FB ads to work for us. A big part of our SaaS&#x27;s value proposition is its integrations (G Suite, Slack, O365) - so my hypothesis is that most of the potential users that care about integrations will tend to find us via those app marketplaces, and thus most of the leads that are left for us to pick up from other channels are just less qualified. It certainly doesn&#x27;t help that there&#x27;s no way to target &#x27;decision makers at companies that use Slack&#x2F;G Suite&#x27; as a demographic.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;ve heard of people having success with LinkedIn for B2B SaaSes - but my impressions is that this is mostly lead generation for sales rather than automated marketing.')
