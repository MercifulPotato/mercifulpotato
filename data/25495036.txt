Do we need a new Azure queue? That&#x27;s a Platform ticket in JIRA. Do we need a new tool in our CI&#x2F;CD pipeline? That&#x27;s a Platform ticket in JIRA. Do we have a build failing for something other than tests? That&#x27;s a Platform ticket in JIRA. Do we have an issue in production? We need to engage with Cloud Ops because we don&#x27;t have access to anything in prod.<p>Plus, it takes six weeks to get a feature from development to production because horrible workflow and manual processes.<p>Plus, development teams are prevented from implementing anything without the approval of Solution Architects who are too far removed from the business to understand what&#x27;s needed and too far removed from the technology to be able to design a working solution.<p>It&#x27;s all fucking horrible, and yet we&#x27;re using all the modern cloud tooling: Spring Boot, Azure, containers, K8S, Gitlab pipelines.<p>In contrast, a couple clients ago my team had full autonomy to do what we believed was the right solution. Stories would often be groomed, implemented, and delivered into production all within a 2-week sprint. No muss no fuss. When they weren&#x27;t, it was normally due to us having to wait on another team to deliver their work.')
