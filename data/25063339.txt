I&#x27;ve been in computing for 45 years now. Programs come and go. I store files I want to keep in the most generic format practical. Storing a file in some program&#x27;s special format is not a good plan for reading it 40 years from now.<p>For photos, I store them as jpgs in folders named after the year. Within those folders, there might be sub-folders named with a topic, like &quot;disneyland&quot; or &quot;christmas&quot;. I&#x27;ll &quot;tag&quot; photos by selecting a name for the jpg, like &quot;bob and sue.jpg&quot;.<p>If more is needed, I&#x27;ll just add a &quot;notes.txt&quot; file in the folder, with whatever text seems appropriate.<p>I have no worries about ascii text becoming unreadable, and few worries about jpgs becoming unreadable.')
