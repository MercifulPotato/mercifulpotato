You don&#x27;t stay 24&#x2F;7 in your hotel room, do you? And when travelling for a few days, you must have spare underpants in your suitcase in your room, right?<p>Product idea: secure suitcase with a camera that shows people who&#x27;ve tried to open&#x2F;tamper with it while you were not there.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting if the hotel staff can be questioned about government agents demanding access, but maybe the staff&#x2F;eyewitness has since been &quot;neutralized&quot;. Or if the agents were sophisticated, they&#x27;d have used widely available exploits to clone hotel keycards. Or just pick the lock. The guy on the phone even said they only go in when they know it&#x27;s secure, i.e. after the cameras have been switched off.')
