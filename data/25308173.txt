No one would tell you what the meeting was about in advance. Then in that meeting your manager’s manager tells you “it has been decided” that you need to retract this paper by next week...</i><p><i>And you are told after a while, that your manager can read you a privileged and confidential document and you’re not supposed to even know who contributed to this document, who wrote this feedback, what process was followed or anything. You write a detailed document discussing whatever pieces of feedback you can find, asking for questions and clarifications, and it is completely ignored.</i><p>(from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.platformer.news&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.platformer.news&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-withering-email-that-got-a...</a>)<p>I&#x27;ve been through the peer review process at Physical Review Letters, SIGMOD, and VLDB. You get a document containing all the reviewer&#x27;s comments, plus a metareviewer&#x27;s take on the overall decision and what has to change. You can engage in dialogue with the metareviewer, including a detailed response letter justifying your choices, highlighting things the reviewers may have missed, and explaining where you plan to make changes. You get additional rounds of comments from the reviewers in light of that letter on later drafts.<p>I&#x27;m not a Googler, and I have no idea what the standard review process looks like there, but what Gebru describes does not sound <i>at all</i> like peer review. I also note that Dean does not contradict Gebru&#x27;s account of the meeting or feedback process. If I had a paper rejected in this fashion, I would also demand to know what the hell was going on and who was responsible.<p>This feels <i>off</i>.')
