I came back to the restaurant to leave some cash in their jar labeled &quot;DOORDASH TIPS!&quot;<p>We Americans really need a way to tip via app. I wish cryptocurrency was viable, because the POS ecosystem (Toast, Square, Clover, etc) is fragmented and takes a cut, the gig-app ordering systems take an even bigger cut, and it&#x27;s just awfully annoying to have paper cash on hand. Crypto has yet to make any firm inroads though.<p>It&#x27;ll even be a great day for those who rely on gratituity when the US decides to mint $2 and&#x2F;or $5 coins. $1 coins are so hard to come by and people think they&#x27;re such a novelty yet they&#x27;re immensely more useful, more durable, cleaner, and denser (10 $1 bills bursts my wallet and eventually turns into a chaotic mess in my pocket when I don&#x27;t have time at the register to nicely stack and fold them back into my wallet; 10 $1 coins in my pocket is far more manageable.)')
