Item(by='spijdar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611811663, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25938300, text='As a US-ian who is surface level familiar with some non-US education, here in the US &quot;college&quot; and &quot;university&quot; tend to refer to the same thing, which is post-highschool education. Essentially, any higher-education that you aren&#x27;t required to take, and likewise, have to pay for.<p>(Edit: for fellow US-ians, I&#x27;m vaguely aware that in some non-US places, &quot;college&quot; refers to something we&#x27;d either call highschool or in-between highschool and college)<p>College is (generally) divided into two categories, undergraduate, and graduate education. Undergrad constitutes broad and shallow education with an emphasis on a particular subject. Graduate education is much more in-depth and more selective of potential students.<p>I believe it&#x27;s technically possibly to skip the undergrad phase and skip to getting a master&#x27;s or doctorate degree, but almost never happens in practice. The hierarchy, both for higher education and the job market, expects you to have all of your &quot;lower level&quot; degrees, in spite of your actual abilities.<p>Even if you drop out of highschool and have a college degree, some jobs will still require you to get a highschool diploma substitute.')
