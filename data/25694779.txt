Further, the statement is that access is a foundational principle to the US implementation of liberal democracy since our Nation’s founding.  \nIt’s so foundational that it’s also quite literally built into the building as there are galleries for public viewing of Senate and House proceedings.<p>It is also an <i>ideal</i> that we strive for like <i>equality</i> and <i>justice</i>.  We recognize our union as imperfect yet these ideals are what drive us as a Nation.<p>Your comment I feel confuses implementation with the discussion of ideals.  The implementation should follow the ideals as guiding principles with access being the <i>default</i>.<p>Lastly, historically the building and lawmakers were much more accessible.  This was during my lifetime.  We had lots of people then too.')
