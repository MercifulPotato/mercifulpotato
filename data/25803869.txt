I realise that Google did not provide help identifying it - but that does not mean one should simply recomission the server under a new domain and continue as if nothing has happened!<p>From TFA:<p>&gt; We quickly realized an Amazon Cloudfront CDN URL that we used to serve static assets (CSS, Javascript and other media) had been flagged and this was causing our entire application to fail for the customer instances that were using that particular CDN<p>&gt; Around an hour later, and before we had finished moving customers out of that CDN, our site was cleared from the GSB database. I received an automated email confirming that the review had been successful around 2 hours after that fact. No clarification was given about what caused the problem in the first place.<p>Yes, yes, Google Safe Browsing can use its power to wipe you off the internet, and when it encounters a positive hit (false or true!) it does so quite broadly, but that is also <i>exactly what is expected for a solution like that to work</i> - and it will do it again if the same files are hosted under a new URL as soon as detects the problem again.')
