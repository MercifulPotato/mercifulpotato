When you&#x27;ve actually gone through the process of setting up a shot and looking at the horrible result you get a much deeper appreciation for what it takes to make something that looks even half-way non-amateurish, let lone smooth and polished.  The thing that always drops my jaw is the settings of period pieces, particularly ones that have a lot of vehicles and old buildings in them.  I know it&#x27;s mostly CGI nowadays, but the quality is just ridiculous nowadays.  I can&#x27;t tell what is CGI any more, and I know what to look for.<p>(The movie I made about 15 years ago that was my substitute for film school: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;graceofgodmovie.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;graceofgodmovie.com&#x2F;</a>)')
