No one is going to do mass manufacturing of battery and electronics enclosures with 3D printing, this is a prototyping and hobby level manufacturing system. So the odds of injury and damage are a lot less with this as you automatically self-select down to a tiny fraction of the market share, and only a tiny fraction yet of those will ever experience an explosive outcome from a battery.<p>Also I&#x27;m sure that most of this market violates someones IP so again, this ensures that this type of thing (custom making battery enclosures)  will never reach a critical mass where worrying about the world burning down due to non-fireretardent plastics is something to be concerned about.<p>But if a person is very concerned about this issue then certainly there are options out there.')
