Python was an enormous breath of fresh air.<p>Type inference, generics and variable shadowing have mostly covered almost all the pain points since. I don&#x27;t have to declare what&#x27;s obvious, I don&#x27;t have to cover irrelevant differences, and I don&#x27;t have to consider the artefacts of types past.<p>Still think generics are static typists <i>admitting</i> the shortcomings of a type system, without actually doing so, though.')
