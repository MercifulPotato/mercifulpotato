It&#x27;s not a good idea to rely on this for a complete understanding but I&#x27;ve remember attempting to read the code class by class before and was unable to get a mental model of it - after doing the flamegraph&#x2F;stepping in the debugger dance a few days I&#x27;ve started to feel right at home - it also helped me quite a lot to pinpoint further issues.')
