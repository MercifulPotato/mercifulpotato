They&#x27;ll get processed in-order on the server side, with results being sent back while the next query is being processed.<p>The biggest weakness around pipelining is that a fair number of drivers don&#x27;t support it yet, including the C client interface that is part of postgres (there&#x27;s a patch being reviewed right now adding it there). The common jdbc driver, .net, and a few other popular ones do support it though.')
