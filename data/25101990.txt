Item(by='ineedasername', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605454886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099275, text='<i>how we have got to the situation where 2&#x2F;3rd of the people answering the poll claim to be clinically depressed. </i><p>Well, they might not be claiming clinical depression, which technically would require a clinician to render a diagnosis. Though many people may also not understand that distinction.<p>As for the large number, it may simply be that people who see the title of the post &amp; aren&#x27;t depressed just say to themselves in a slit second &quot;nope not relevant to me, not clicking on it&quot;. In that case, most of the people who answered &quot;yes&quot; to depression were self-selecting as people for whom it was already relevant, i.e., people experiencing what they consider depression.<p>It&#x27;s a problem with surveys in general. I hate doing surveys, but a huge portion of my job is data analysis, and most people are bad at creating surveys especially the design of individual questions. But the initial problem is &quot;How do I get a representative sample when people that choose to do the survey may not be the same as people that won&#x27;t&quot;. There&#x27;s ways to minimize that effect, none of them great-- look at the the presidential polls as an example.')
