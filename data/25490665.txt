The sociopaths often recognize that a situation <i>could</i> benefit them personally so they grab ahold--this is the point where they may stab somebody in the back.<p>However, after they mount up for the ride, the tiger goes where it wants and they really don&#x27;t have any control over it.  If it goes well, congrats on your promotion.  If it goes badly, even with a scapegoat your promotion path is done so start looking for a new job.<p>So, the &quot;sociopaths&quot; are a product of 8 coin flips that all came up heads--unfortunately they all think they are geniuses.')
