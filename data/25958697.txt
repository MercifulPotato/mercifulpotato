They aren&#x27;t running full page advertising against Facebook. Apple is making it so users have to <i>give permission</i> before companies can utilize an API. Just giving that one power to end users has apparently scared the hell out of Facebook.<p>&gt; ...why would Apple allow Facebook in their App Store and take 30% of the generated revenue?<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t get 30% of Facebook&#x27;s generated revenue. It gets 30% of sales and in-app purchases. Facebook doesn&#x27;t use either as far as I know.<p>&gt; If anything, the App Store made Facebook more popular than ever, so it&#x27;s a &quot;monster&quot; that Apple helped create.<p>If they had perfect foreknowledge, Apple would likely have done this from the start. Steve Jobs made it very clear at the time that Apple itself should ask permission before collecting information every time. If they&#x27;d foreseen influential companies like Facebook creating APIs which were widely spread through the App Store, they&#x27;d have likely closed this door a long time ago.')
