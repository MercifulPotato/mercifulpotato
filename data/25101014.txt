I find myself losing my temper irregularly over things that wouldn’t normally irritate me. I normally chalk it up to some secondary affect of other stressors or whatever (which helps to bring me back to earth when I recognise I’m being irrational), but I also have the same driven&#x2F;apathetic thing where I’m really exciting to do something, but when it comes to it I either procrastinate the task enough to become a stressor or convince myself I don’t want to do it and move on. I never framed it in the context of a depression or depressive episode, choosing rather to believe I’m just lazy, so there’s definitely something to think about  for me here.')
