Healing societal schisms is about reestablishing a vision of politics where you argue by saying &quot;here&#x27;s why this is the best policy&quot; or &quot;here&#x27;s why this is the most ethical policy&quot;, rather than &quot;my movement is very strong and you&#x27;d better not get in our way&quot;.
