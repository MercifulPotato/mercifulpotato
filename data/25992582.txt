I went with Starlette over FastAPI because I didn&#x27;t need a lot of what FastAPI provided for that particular project.<p>I want to start nudging my coworkers into using FastAPI over Flask because some of the async APIs they&#x27;ve started using.  FastAPI seems to come with all the things they want out of the box instead of adding a bunch of individual Flask packages.<p>Just for my own understanding, where would FastAPI be appropriate vs. Starlette and vice versa.<p>Thanks!')
