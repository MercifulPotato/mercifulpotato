The US has anomalously high death rates due to unintentional injury (accidents) in the young adult age groups, which skews the average for the overall population. If young people died in accidents at similar rates to the rest of the world, the average life expectancy would look quite good. This is the 3rd most common cause of death in the US, generally.<p>The primary source of injury in young people creating this situation? Car accidents. And remembering how me and my friends were behind the wheel at that age, this is completely unsurprising. Young people in many other countries do not drive nearly as much.<p>Everyone looks for medical reasons but it is largely fatal accident rates.')
