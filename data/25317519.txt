However, that&#x27;s a minority of the cases, and even then when trying to communicate that analysis, politics becomes relevant once again. Even the desire to carefully describe a particular analysis as apolitical is driven by political motivations i.e. to make that analysis more convincing to others with different political alignment.<p>As Aristotle said, &quot;Man is by nature a social animal&quot; - it makes all sense that our default mode of thinking and the associated decisionmaking shortcuts are heavily driven by social and political aspects, because in many circumstances the social impact and political perception of some statement is more important than whether it&#x27;s technically true.')
