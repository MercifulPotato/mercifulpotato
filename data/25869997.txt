This fits perfectly within the narrative I&#x27;ve described above. Take the most extreme rhetoric and generalize it to mean an entire population of people you disagree with.<p>Furthermore, if we accept the narrative of the WoT and that there was a legitimate threat to politicians, there&#x27;s still a wide swath of difference between the two. ISIS is a real threat endangering, killing, maiming and torturing an entire region. They carried out indiscriminate attacks on civilians across the world. A few nutters threatening to lynch some politicians isn&#x27;t that.<p>Conflating the two ideas is an example of how toxic rhetoric has become. Yeah, you can turn on MSNBC, CNN or even the BBC right now for validation of those narratives. You could also turn to those same media outlets for justification for the war in Iraq or crackdowns on civil liberties during that same period. The new war on domestic terrorism (read dissent from establishment politics) is similarly worth a critical look. Especially if grandmas with thermoses are to be lumped in with dangerous extremists.')
