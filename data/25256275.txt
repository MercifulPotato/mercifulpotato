Researching and training AlphaGo was expensive but it enabled the ideas and development of AlphaZero which is more computationally tractable.<p>To have any chance, an academic team would need the same compute resources as what the DeepMind protein folding team used during the whole development of the architecture during the last few years, not only the resources used to train the final system. And I bet this funding is not available to most if not all academic teams.')
