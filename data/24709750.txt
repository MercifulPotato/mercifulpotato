It&#x27;s very hard to think this way because (a) we&#x27;re mostly symmetric horizontally, certainly a lot more than vertically, and (b) we very often interact with other people that have turned horizontally (around the verticle axis) to face us but very rarely interact with other people that have turned vertically to face us.<p>Another aspect that makes this hard mentally is that if you have any identifying non-symmetrical features, like birthmarks, then they appear horizontally flipped in the mirror compared to photographs. Again, it&#x27;s the photograph that&#x27;s turned incorrectly. This one is particularly hard to sell, because <i>surely</i> a photo with a ground at the top can&#x27;t be the right way round? The answer is, for the purpose of matching your left and right, the &quot;correct&quot; way round is for the photo to face away from you. Makes logical sense, but very unintuitive.')
