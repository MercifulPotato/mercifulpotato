AMD survived some very bad years. It&#x27;s not impossible for a company to shrink, trim the fat and grow again. However, having known people who worked at Intel, it&#x27;s not just a question of lack of innovation, they had some very smart engineers, but it seemed like the culture there was very toxic. Lots of unhealthy internal competition, bureaucracy, infighting, etc. I think that they need to improve their internal culture first, in order for the company to make a real comeback. If anything, I think their recent losses are a serious wake up call. I hope they make the right decisions, because the hardware industry needs competition.')
