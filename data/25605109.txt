I imagine it&#x27;s unlikely there is any real meaning behind dreams, but I can&#x27;t help but feel there must be sometimes, especially with some of the odder dreams.<p>The most disappointing thing about a good dream though, is how <i>quickly</i> memories of it fade away upon wakening - it&#x27;s like trying to grab tendrils of smoke rising away.<p>Usually at best I manage to recall one or two small snippets, or something about the general theme, but every now and then - very rarely - more vivid details stick with me for a little longer.')
