I don&#x27;t think they did. It&#x27;s beneficial if only to increase public awareness, because tracking is otherwise invisible.<p>Heck, I&#x27;m a reasonably technical user, and I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed in most cases. Again, invisible. Now I have a negative first impression of a site if it annoys me with cookie banners, and a more positive one if not.')
