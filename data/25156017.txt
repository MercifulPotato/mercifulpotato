It had nothing to do with Flash, it was 100% a developer&#x27;s problem, not a tech problem.<p>Flash problems are: proprietary&#x2F;closed source VM, performances and security, which was all on Adobe side, not Flash developers.<p>In fact, Flash apps did run on Mobile including IOS via Air. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adobe.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;air.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adobe.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;air.html</a><p>So Steve Jobs was wrong initially. Let us remember that Jobs didn&#x27;t want native apps on IOS, he wanted people to write web apps and Native apps to be solely the prerogative on Apple, until he changed his mind.
