Item(by='subroutine', descendants=None, kids=[25643738], score=None, time=1609835197, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25642635, text='The statement, &quot;A machine that allows his alien eyes to see the first move.&quot; seems too information-rich for what the author then describes as the alternative model. Perhaps not the point of this thought experiment, but let&#x27;s assume the aliens can only crudely see the first move: they know how many pieces there are on each side of the board, their color, but otherwise all the pieces look the same. They cannot see the surface of the board (they don&#x27;t know it is checkered), but they can determine the exact center of each piece (so during the first move they can compute a precise coordinate of the piece that moves). Promptly after the first move, the image goes away. Also assume they trust the humans who&#x27;ve told them: &quot;there are actually pieces on the board with functions&quot;. They have collected data on 1000s of matches.<p>What can the aliens know or deduce?<p>- The number of pieces<p>- The pieces are divided into 2 different colors (white and black)<p>- The pieces are split by color and placed at opposite (vertical) ends of the board.<p>- There is the same number of pieces in each color<p>- The pieces are arranged into 2 vertical rows and 8 horizontal columns<p>- Opening moves cluster at 2 different lengths, towards the opposite side of the board.<p>- The longer opening move length is typically ~2x the short opening move length.<p>- The opening move vector is always towards the opposite end of the board (not horizontal)<p>- The opening move is always white<p>- White wins slightly more often<p>- They are given the duration and outcome of each game (win, loss, or tie)<p>- ? When games end quickly, first-move advantage shrinks<p>- ? Sometimes a series of games end more quicker than usual (they observe a blitz tourney)<p>- ? Win P() is slightly different for each of the 8 (x2) possible opening moves<p>- ?

I don&#x27;t think this is technically possible. If the model was selecting the winner at a statistically worse rate than 50% chance, you could just flip the sign of the prediction, and do that much better than chance.')
