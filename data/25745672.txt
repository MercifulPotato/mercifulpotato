Trump in fact has allowed the swamp to be cleared as he promised, as we can see the treasonous Republican senators who allowed all of this behaviour to continue by not removing Trump - the House impeached him, then it was the Senate&quot;s job to confirm. Trump exposed the rot, how far they&#x27;re willing to go, showed us all their true colours that Trump&#x27;s a wannabe tyrant and the Republican senators are happy to fall in line with that. He&#x27;s also exposed the flaws in systems that allowed him and others to manipulate Americans for decades. Thankfully Biden won and I believe full out civil war can be avoided now, so long as these systems including the duopoly and mainstream media&#x27;s ability to lie, to only tell one narrative; the Fairness Doctrine should be reinstated as review recommended by Andrew Yang, along with his core policy proposals will adequately counter these problems.')
