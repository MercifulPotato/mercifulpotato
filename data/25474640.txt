My impression is that people engaged in journalism for various hobby&#x2F;interest groups, clubs through at least the 1920s and considered themselves amateurs in the sense of practice for the love of the activity itself. I can see a similar strand in &#x27;zines and later web logs and blogs.<p>A rather older sense of &quot;profession&quot; (maybe concurrent with people calling themselves amateur journalists) meant any job which entailed a primary responsibility to the public, like a doctor, a lawyer, or a journalist. Unlike the other professions, one didn&#x27;t need any educational credentials, bonding or special license to be a journalist.<p>Journalism is unique among the professions: in at least some sense of the word, if one considers oneself a journalist, one is a journalist.')
