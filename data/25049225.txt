Item(by='Impossible', descendants=None, kids=[25049863], score=None, time=1605032689, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25041233, text='The format is documented and there are open source &quot;emulators&quot;, as well as (many) other Fantasy consoles like Tic-80 and Quadplay that are also open source.  Even if you don&#x27;t want to use Pico-8 for moral reasons, if you have an interest in fantasy consoles, there are many FOSS options.  It appears like you aren&#x27;t really trying, and just complaining about Pico-8.  I&#x27;m sure you had no problem finding an open source text editor, open source OS, open source compiler, etc. Do some research, or alternatively admit you actually don&#x27;t care about fantasy consoles or game development, and are here to complain about random software being closed source.')
