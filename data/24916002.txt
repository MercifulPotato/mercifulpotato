In my experience, most of the problems you need to solve with a big application like Word are either very particular to the problem space (e.g. word processors, 3D game engines, etc) or very particular to that specific codebase (i.e. how engineers dealt with the decisions made earlier by previous engineers).<p>The Word codebase is no work of art, I guarantee.
