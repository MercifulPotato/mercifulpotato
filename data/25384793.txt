You left free speech (your voice should not be censored and you should be able to say your mind) in favor of amplification and agenda pushing.<p>At least in my personal view.<p>Take this forum here for example: There is a community driven mechanism that enforces some rules. Your comment can end up dead. One can decide to view dead comments, but given enough negative feedback you can be silenced here.<p>The community enforces values. These might change over time, but they are there, because the community does value collective freedom (freedom from trolls and such things) in a form that allows individual freedom of speech to be restricted.<p>On a deeper level: There are always different forms of freedom at play and valuing one above the other restricts the other necessarily.<p>Freedom of speech without restriction enables said actors and bot farms together with content personalisation to hinder the freedom of individuals. Because they aren&#x27;t allowed to see content that amplified voices drown out or that is being hidden from their view by the algorithms.<p>So actually Google, Facebook and the likes are already restricting the freedom of people. And doing so under the thin guise of &quot;fighting for freedom of speech&quot;.')
