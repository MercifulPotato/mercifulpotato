The app won&#x27;t be uninstalled from their machines but it will completely disappear from the MAS and the list of purchased apps.<p>There&#x27;s nothing you can do to help them because you won&#x27;t be able to know which users have already bought your app. What if you wanted to help your users switch to your new distribution system, or give them a discount for the new version (distributed outside the MAS)?')
