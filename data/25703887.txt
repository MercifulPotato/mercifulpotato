This is literally how you interface with Bluetooth devices. This way you don&#x27;t need a driver specific to each device and don&#x27;t need to write code specific to each device.<p>The Bluetooth spec defines a large variety of common types of data streams (including things like friendly device names and battery status), as well as open areas where vendors can cram their own, purpose specific stuff.<p>It&#x27;s quite easy to use, once you learn the setup. And once you learn the specific API your combo of programming language and operating system use to communicate with BLE, everything about consuming a device is otherwise identical, so you can create libraries that consume specific types of data streams quite easily.')
