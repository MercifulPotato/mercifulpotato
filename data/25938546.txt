But the auto industry has such a bad record of being irresponsible about security and safety issues, and those who supposedly regulate the industry have so often failed to deal with real and potentially dangerous problems, that I have become wary of <i>anything</i> to do with &quot;connected&quot; vehicles and <i>anything</i> that integrates the essential engineering around vehicle control with non-essential systems of any kind. Sadly, modern car electronics are not only designed but in some cases even legally required to blur that line, and given all the other improvements over older vehicles, it seems inevitable that I will soon have to ride in vehicles I literally don&#x27;t want to trust with my life.<p>I have gone out of my way to avoid &quot;smart&quot; TVs and similar devices in my home and office, but I fear the options for alternatives there will also become limited unless and until some form of effective regulation makes the spy-on-your-customers business model toxic.')
