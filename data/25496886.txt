Item(by='fabioborellini', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608570566, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496166, text='I got compensated for my unvested options at an acquisition, with a mix of cash and stock of the acquiring company. I was paid a fair salary (initially, at least) and did not have to buy any shares, so I kind of earned extra 30 k€ (before taxes) without any investment besides working full time. I ended up owning the smallish amount of the acquirer&#x27;s shares for 3,5 years and their value raised 50% during that time, profiting 1500 € more.<p>The acquiring company, a listed one, had an options programme I left before vesting due to bad working conditions and some lack of vision. Shortly after I sold my first batch of stocks, the stock price crashed, and my options would be worthless now if I had decided to stick with the company. Some of my colleagues are still suffering there and the total price of their vested options has stayed below 500 € all the time.')
