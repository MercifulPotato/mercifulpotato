An ICE vehicle burns like 20 tons of fuel during its life time. An electric vehicle needs less than 10 kg of lithium, which can be completely recycled at the end of life. The next generation of Tesla batteries will be cobalt free and no lithium battery contains any rare earths. That is an urban legend.<p>Switching to electric doesn&#x27;t mean to increase the number of vehicles, they are built instead of ICE vehicles. Ideally, we reduce the count a lot, but every single vehicle built needs to be electric.')
