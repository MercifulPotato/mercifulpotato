Item(by='shusson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605874868, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25158828, text='&gt; but this game is an entirely intentional attempt to defend _Viking_ colonialism specifically. And they will have been perfectly aware that this played into neo-Nazi tropes.<p>I think they just optimized for a wide audience. They romanticised the viking age from the perspective of a modern day person in the shoes of a viking. I don&#x27;t think they had an agenda to defend viking colonialism.')
