Here in the Seattle area, if it gets close to freezing, the “strip heater” (supplemental resistive electric heating, like an electric furnace) kicks on. When I lived in Indiana, which most definitely has 0°F winters, the few that bought heat pumps hated them because the “heat pump” part didn’t get used for a few months in the winter while the real furnace did the work. Granted, that was 25 years ago, but physics hasn’t changed much: how much heat are you going to suck out of 0°F air?<p>The heat pump does a much better job of cooling the house in the summer in comparison to a gas furnace, though.')
