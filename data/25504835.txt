It’s a political ideology against a liberal democracy, characterized by ultra-nationalism, corporatism, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy. Some would argue that a government governing in close ties with corporations against the wishes and interests of the population at large is a form of fascism. Sort of like the society shown in the move Robocop.')
