To determine whether the code is safe in the general case, the Rust compiler would have to solve the halting problem.<p>Since that is impossible, the compiler uses a heuristic, which defaults to &quot;not safe&quot;. It could use a better heuristic, like &quot;Does function_xyz() contain an infinite loop? If yes, the code is safe.&quot; But that&#x27;s of dubious value.')
