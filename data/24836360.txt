You obviously know what it is and the interpreter will figure it out itself as well.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say you want to read a file:<p>read &quot;myfile.txt&quot;<p>&quot;Reading&quot; a webpage:<p>read &quot;<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;somewebsite.com&#x2F;somewebpage" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;somewebsite.com&#x2F;somewebpage</a>&quot;<p>Parsing JSON from a remote source:<p>read.json &quot;<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;somewebsite.com&#x2F;data.json" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;somewebsite.com&#x2F;data.json</a>&quot;<p>Or parsing it from a string:<p>read.json &quot;[1,2,3]&quot;<p>And &#x27;read&#x27; also can take different attributes, e.g. .csv (for parsing CSV files), .html etc etc...<p>Basically you pass a string with its options and the interpreter figures out where to get it from and what to do with it... :)')
