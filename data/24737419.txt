I wonder how this came to Apple&#x27;s attention; was it requested by Belarus&#x27;s government? And I wonder what the consequences of Telegram not complying would be.<p>It&#x27;s unclear why they would demand this, given that Google seems to not need to make similar demands.<p>This also seems like it encourages repressive governments to cajole Apple to pressure apps to remove user content in the future.')
