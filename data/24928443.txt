[0] Using an inflation calculator this comes out to 256 GBP today, [1] so about the same price as the cards you&#x27;re looking at. That being said, it looks like even in 2019 average weekly wages (in GBP) have declined since 2008, so accounting for inflation, most Britons are maybe just simply poorer now [2] (2020 of course has been even worse. [3])<p>Anyway, ignoring all that, IMO gaming is still more affordable than it&#x27;s ever been - you can get a used Xbox One S for about $100 on eBay, or for PC gaming, you can get a used RX 470 or GTX 1060 for a bit less than that, which are fine GPUs for 1080p gaming performance. Also, even relatively modern AAA games can now be played at low-medium settings at 720 or 1080p30 without a dedicated GPU on a late-model Ryzen APU.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;Print&#x2F;2007&#x2F;11&#x2F;12&#x2F;review_nvidia_geforce_8800_gt&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;Print&#x2F;2007&#x2F;11&#x2F;12&#x2F;review_nvidia_g...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hl.co.uk&#x2F;tools&#x2F;calculators&#x2F;inflation-calculator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hl.co.uk&#x2F;tools&#x2F;calculators&#x2F;inflation-calculator</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;business-49328855" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;business-49328855</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-kingdom&#x2F;wage-growth" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-kingdom&#x2F;wage-growth</a>')
