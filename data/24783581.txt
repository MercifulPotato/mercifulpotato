What can happen is that new strains can infect you. There are tons of cold strains around, and the flu mutates quickly enough that each year we get a new one, so vaccines have to be redeveloped for each new round of mutations.<p>Coronavirus is the same way, except that as far as I know, it mutates much more slowly than cold and flu viruses, meaning that vaccines (and having gotten it once) will be equally and more effective than flu or cold vaccines.')
