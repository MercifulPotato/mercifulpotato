I&#x27;ve abused diphenhydramine in the past. Like crazy amounts each night. And I know at least 2 other addicts who have as well - one even claimed they shot it lol... so it can be addictive (and slightly physically addictive hard to get sleep until after &#x27;withdrawals&#x27; end).<p>it helps &#x27;slow down my thinking&#x27; and just kind of nod out to nothingness when taken alone. and combining with other drugs&#x2F;alcohol amplifies<p>I feel like it has permanently worsened my memory. For sure brain fog is definitely noticeable for weeks after stopping.<p>There are also a few scary articles I&#x27;ve read linking to alzheimer&#x27;s&#x2F;dementia. It kind of makes sense from my limited wikipedia understanding of brain chemistry that blocking Acetylcholine would have long term effects. amped up version of this action is used to kill people vx seren etc<p>im sober from everything now. but every once and a blue moon i&#x27;ll take diphenhydramine if i&#x27;m having serious insomnia.<p>one night feels restful. after that it just exasperates &amp; continues the cycle. It also is hard to take just one, I literally have to buy a travel pack, take one, throw the rest away or i will keep taking them until they are gone. annnnd now i want one to zone out. don&#x27;t abuse drugs kids!')
