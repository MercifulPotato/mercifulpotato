I actually tried to force myself to like the new phone by &quot;dual-wielding&quot; both my iPhone 8 and a new iPhone XS for a couple weeks. I ended up sticking to my iPhone 8 and keeping the other one as a test device for iOS development.<p>By illuminating the room I meant illuminating from the light of the screen, not IR. When using it in bed I can keep a Touch ID device under a blanket as to not illuminate the rest of the room, but Face ID performs poorly in that case and I have to take the phone out completely so the light does leak.')
