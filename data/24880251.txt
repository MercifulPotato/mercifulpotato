The phone also backs up to Google Photos (Pixel phone). From there I import them into a Lightroom catalog (looking at DigiKam though) and move the photos to a ZFS dataset that has auto snapshots enabled (accidental deletions, malware protection, etc) and is on a RAIDZ2 pool (survives two drive failures).<p>From there RClone encrypts and copies them to AWS Glacier Deep Archive (11 9s, etc). I&#x27;ll also start coping them to Google Workspace (was GSuite).<p>This removes a lot of product change risks such as Google APIs not returning the original files, etc. AWS Glacier is secure and cheap unless I have to restore. If I&#x27;m doing a full restore it&#x27;s likely that&#x27;s the cheapest option so then I don&#x27;t care.<p>Glacier Deep Archive works out to about $1&#x2F;TB&#x2F;month and because it&#x27;s paid per GB it removes the risks of a company changing plans or some &quot;unlimited but not really&quot; problem.<p>One piece of advice, think about your local disaster risks. I&#x27;m in an earthquake risk area. I ruled out most off-site backup options that involved moving drives around due to those all being in my same disaster area and costs of bank boxes etc.')
