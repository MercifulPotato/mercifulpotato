These tend to be incredibly low volume, accessed a handful of times a month at most.<p>- I host some analytics infrastructure for clients. It&#x27;s for reporting, rather than data capture, so latency and uptime aren&#x27;t super critical.<p>- I run a personal zerotier[1] network, which I use as both a virtual LAN across all my devices hosted everywhere as well as to tunnel my laptop and mobile traffic when I&#x27;m not at home. My internet gateway is hosted at home, so all my mobile and public wifi traffic routes through my home connection.<p>- I do a minor bit of web scraping. This is fairly low volume, and a mix of both personal and professional work. If it was higher volume I wouldn&#x27;t host it at home, due purely to the risk&#x2F;potential hassle of IP blocks and complaints.<p>I have a fairly stable symmetrical 1Gbps fiber connection (plus a block of static IPs). It&#x27;s a residential connection so has no firm SLA, but still achieves ~500Mbps when experiencing &quot;congestion&quot; (in whatever form that means for fiber to the premise) and has only been down twice (once during a total power outage and another an attempt to use the parental control features for one device resulted in <i>every</i> device being MitM&#x27;d by an invalid SSL cert).<p>I also have a mobile hotspot I use when traveling for work, which I have connected as a failover ISP when I&#x27;m at home. This covered both instances of downtime I&#x27;ve experienced. And in the case when it doesn&#x27;t and a client needs to access a service, I maintain external backups that I can spin up on VPS somewhere in a pinch. Probably not enough guarantees for a primarily SaaS based business, but has worked without a hitch when user-facing SaaS websites&#x2F;apps are only a minor secondary component of the work.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zerotier.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zerotier.com&#x2F;</a>')
