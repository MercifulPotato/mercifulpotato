Item(by='guidovranken', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608143508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25443489, text='You can&#x27;t conveniently pay with it so after the &quot;digital cash&quot; idea didn&#x27;t pan out people settled on it being &quot;store of value&quot;. But if that was what people really wanted, they&#x27;d be cheering for less volatility, not more; people really want it to be a get rich quick scheme (and I get that).<p>There is no decentralized social network in spite of people being dissatisfied with the centralized alternatives. The last time I tried an IPFS website it didn&#x27;t load. The last time I tried Scuttlebutt it couldn&#x27;t connect. It&#x27;s been 12 years now and everything in crypto feels perpetually broken, unusable, beta-grade and stagnant, and it&#x27;s very disappointing because I really wanted these solutions to exist.<p>Ironically, I think &quot;crypto&quot; would have fared better if it was without monetary value, and its development was optimized for utility (like most other computer programs) instead of buying Lambo&#x27;s. The way I see it, BitTorrent is still the most successful and useful decentralized tech of the last few decades. It&#x27;s useful, ubiquitous, safe, clients can be maintained by a lone hobbyist out in Nebraska, and it requires no propaganda whatsoever to prosper because its value proposition is evident to anyone. With crypto, the perpetual funding of technologies that are never going to work ironically makes it a very un-libertarian economy.<p>That said, I like having it around as an emergency payment system, and with the devaluation of fiat money and general downturn, BTC provides an attractive asset class next to stocks, gold and real estate.')
