It&#x27;s a model that totally sucks for normal users who happen to hit the limit, but could work better in a storage context: full speed instant access to a 100TB archive blob isn&#x27;t quite as much a day-to-day personal essential as basic mobile data. And if you DO need fast access, there should be a path to pay for it.')
