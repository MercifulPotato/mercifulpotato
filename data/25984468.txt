I was basically stuck with time&#x2F;reality changing and moving onward, even though I was resisting it. I think I was physically moving myself in a circle on my bed, trying to resist reality.<p>Then it ended and that was it. Wasn&#x27;t enjoyable, and didn&#x27;t learn much. Perhaps just a metaphor that you can&#x27;t resist the true reality and moving of life.<p>Next time I&#x27;ll definitely do out while hiking instead.')
