I&#x27;m thinking of the scenario where the person actually had an intent to have &quot;good&quot; quality and spent more money for what they were told would &quot;look better&quot;, but due to inaccurate information sources (eg salespeople, buzzwordy feature bullet points on signage, friend, etc) they don&#x27;t end up with what they thought they would get (and paid upward for). The frustrating part is there&#x27;s no fundamental reason they couldn&#x27;t have actually got what they wanted instead of being mildly disappointed that their extra $500 spent &quot;isn&#x27;t really as different as they&#x27;d hoped&quot;. Yes, there&#x27;s a point of diminishing returns beyond which more money buys things that don&#x27;t matter (like 4k resolution vs good 1080 when the viewing distance-to-screen size makes the difference optically negligible to human eyes).<p>However, under that point of contextual diminishing returns, a little bit of on-point knowledge or information can really maximize the return on incremental spend and effort.')
