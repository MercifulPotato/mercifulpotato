I read the full blog series, and I am interested in some of the ideas.<p>It&#x27;s just for &quot;maintenance&quot; tasks which are limited to 8-12 hours per week.  Developers give a task (in a weekly meeting) an effort of low (2hrs), medium (4), or high (8) and choose which tasks they want to get done in the week.  If a developer is knocking out 3+ high effort tasks in a week there is 1) a problem with estimating effort and&#x2F;or 2) a problem with the developer spending way too much time on maintenance tasks.  Either one can be addressed.<p>I am not sure if I would try these ideas out for myself, but I think most of the criticisms here on HN are addressed in the full blog series.')
