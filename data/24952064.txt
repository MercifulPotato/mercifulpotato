A big reason why we are here is because we first tried to limit the profit margins on the marginal cost of power&#x2F;transmission which then incentivised utilities to go big on cap-ex because thigh the profit margins there were capped too the mangitude of expenditures weren&#x27;t. So of course we turn around and start specifying how they can spend it when then incentivised them to cost cut and defer maintenance because that&#x27;s what was most profitable given the now extreme regulatory barriers to entry.<p>And then of course there&#x27;s the when Enron manipulation that was also just as much due to regulators not allowing the market to install new capacity where needed and forcing fixed pricing on retail distribution.<p>What we really need is a complete market and regulatory transition to something more sane like texas model of separating things into a generation and distribution market with more lightly regulated players.')
