They brought actionable ideas and they communicated them to me in a professional and sincere way.<p>We worked together to identify their areas of concern to make sure I understood them and I communicated that I would bring these up and work to see if we could adjust with that in mind.<p>2 hours later, I had my regular weekly 1:1 with a manager involved and presented those proposals. I asked them what could work as proposed and what needed work. Most were accepted, not because I mandated them, but because this is real feedback. Some we are working to get more clarity on and figure out if we can change anything.<p>Not all of my skip levels are this fruitful but trust and vulnerability come from creating psychological safety. I thanked the group for being a part of making that happen.<p>----<p>I also have a rule in my skip levels that if you are uncomfortable raising in the group setting there are two options:<p>- We can talk privately\n- You can ask me prior to the meeting to raise the point in the room<p>The second has never been used yet, but I keep it open if someone feels like they are not comfortable speaking out, but want to discuss something in a group that could be challenging.')
