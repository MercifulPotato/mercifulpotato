Short form text (tweets) and images enable &quot;snacking&quot; and infinite scroll just feeds the dopamine machine. That&#x27;s what a lot of people <i>want</i> out of the web.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any less demand for long form text content on the web. It&#x27;s growth just isn&#x27;t ever going to eclipse the snack sized content.<p>In the case of Reddit, there&#x27;s still plenty of long form text links and discussions in the comments. The current UX doesn&#x27;t make that as prominent by default but it&#x27;s there. The Reddit snackers make more money because they see <i>way</i> more ads. As long as there&#x27;s an affordance for long form text content Reddit has utility for me.<p>If they go full TweetBook and kill the likes of i&#x2F;old Reddit then I&#x27;m out. I guess I&#x27;ll try to get a lobste.rs invite or something.')
