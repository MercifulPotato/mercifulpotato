This can take a lot of effort versus a single merge at the end.<p>You end up doing a lot of conflict resolution when rebasing, increasing the chances that you make an error.<p>And if you do make an error during conflict resolution, there will be no record of it because you&#x27;ve rewritten history.<p>We stopped most rebases for this reason, and just do normal merges. Conflict resolution is easier, and if we do make a mistake, it&#x27;s at least documented in the history, and it&#x27;s easier to fix.')
