I was also a long time Wyze fan but I&#x27;ve recently switched to Eufy after trying out their 2k cameras. Compared to Wyze, it offers better resolution (thus 2k in their name), on-device pet&#x2F;human detection (Wyze charges monthly fees for cloud-based detection), and way better app experience. It&#x27;s slightly more expensive but well worth the price for me.')
