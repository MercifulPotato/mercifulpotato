And really believe he knows better than scientists (anyone really).<p>From many conversations, it&#x27;s just to piss off liberals. What I call vindictive politics. Literally many conversations, why do you like Trump and agree with him on things like fighting over masks? Schadenfreude. Making liberals scoff and angry makes them happy.<p>Ok why so much annoyance with liberal? A common example, is gay marriage which many Trump supporters consider completely immoral on religious grounds. It&#x27;s so heinous to them they use oral rape metaphor to describe it: you liberals jammed gay marriage down our throats. We support Trump because he makes you angry.<p>I&#x27;ve asked for clarification: this is pay back for things like gay marriage and protecting abortion rights? &quot;You betcha its payback! We don&#x27;t care what crazy things he does or says. The more it pisses off liberals the better job he&#x27;s doing.&quot; Their words. They have grievances. Trump soothes it by helping them get payback.<p>He grew his base by 7 million in this election. He gained almost as many votes as Bernie Sanders total vote count in the 2020 primary.<p>A lot of people think this is about Trump. And it&#x27;s gone once he&#x27;s gone. I don&#x27;t.')
