It is clear, simple, obvious in its correctness; the greatest piece of physics since Maxwell. Once you&#x27;ve understood it it becomes almost impossible to imagine that the universe could possibly work any other way. (Contrary to this article&#x27;s claim, the equation describes the behaviour of Helium atoms perfectly well; it&#x27;s a failure of our imagination or exertion that we can&#x27;t find closed-form stable solutions, not a fact about the equation itself). So this kind of complaint seems utterly wrongheaded.<p>People hold quantum mechanics to some ridiculous standard, far higher than any other physical theory. Did they really expect that the behaviour of the very small would be exactly like that of everyday macroscopic objects? Do they enjoy the mysticism of pretending that it&#x27;s complex and hard to understand when it&#x27;s really nothing of the sort? Frankly I think an honest approach to QM would present it as something banal and obvious.')
