It only seems impulsive to you because it appears to be random. If anybody has any understanding of human psyche when they&#x27;re depressed, they would know it&#x27;s something you plan but play pretend to others so they don&#x27;t suspect you need to be &quot;locked up for your own good,&quot; as what tends to happen to people who try to seek help.<p>Mental health problems don&#x27;t persist simply because people can easily buy guns and kill themselves. They continue because people are afraid their going to have their liberties taken away simply because they want help.')
