Far from it - butterfly keyboard, for example.<p>I am just saying Apple, for me, has the most reliable and consistent experience. And I have tried most options:<p>- windows, linux, and macos for my personal and work machines<p>- android, ios, and even windows phone (remember that?)<p>So far, may experience has been the opposite of yours - my work laptop is a 2015 macbook pro 15 and still performs really well (no crashes), but I have BSODed a couple of times on my windows 10 laptop I bought last year. Doesn&#x27;t say much, I know.')
