Item(by='moron4hire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602164472, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24712229, text='I had originally thought of 3D. This isn&#x27;t my first time making a spatialized audio chat system. I built one for WebVR some 4 or 5 years ago. And I&#x27;m actually building one at work right now (with Calla as the underpinning). But for when I started this project (at the beginning of the pandemic) and for what purpose I built it (testing the current temperature of the waters in WebRTC land, as I hadn&#x27;t done a lot with it since that last app, plus trying to support a weekend tech meetup that was finding Zoom to be a bit annoying, plus seeing if FOSS WebRTC libraries were at a level that I could use for my day job), I wanted to make the graphics portion of the app a simple as possible, support the most people as possible, and not get in the way.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed with a lot of the &quot;competitor&quot;[0] apps out there is that they&#x27;re more focused on the graphics than the audio. They&#x27;re more focused on making a 90&#x27;s-era RPG than on audio conferencing. I&#x27;m the opposite. I&#x27;m more focused on conferencing than the game. I get a lot of requests in the github repo for functionality in the game. The &quot;game&quot; is beside the point. It&#x27;s just an exercise of the audio conferencing.<p>[0] I don&#x27;t really see myself as in competition with gather.town or High Fidelity or any of the other apps because I&#x27;m not building Calla to be a startup. I love my day job and I won&#x27;t be leaving it. Calla is just a component of a much larger thing I&#x27;m building.')
