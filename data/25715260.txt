The _only_ reason we still don&#x27;t have a reliable and solid code infrastructure (in the sense explained by the article) is our inability as a community to once and for all define a solid foundation for the principles of computing. Hence all the hacked together languages, tools and frameworks that people have piled on each other over the decades.<p>If one century of efforts hasn&#x27;t been enough, fine. But we absolutely can work towards that goal.')
