One such technique is called &quot;mutation testing&quot; [1].<p>I don&#x27;t know of any job that actually uses them, but they make sense to me: the tests need checks too, otherwise how do you know they are adding value? It&#x27;s too easy to write worthless tests, see them pass, and get a false sense of security. Techniques such as mutation testing check how sensitive your tests are to actual bugs (or program changes): do they detect them? If not, they aren&#x27;t useful.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mutation_testing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mutation_testing</a>')
