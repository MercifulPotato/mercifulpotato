Not sure what Dell was using in 2018, but I replaced the garbage Broadcom chip in my 2015-era XPS 13 with a much more reliable Intel model, and most of by bluetooth problems were immediately fixed.<p>That said, the replacement process is pretty fiddly...Dell likes using lots of very small screws made of very soft metal.<p>I&#x27;ve also found that Gnome&#x27;s bluetooth handling varies from barely acceptable to confusingly horrible.  KDE&#x27;s bluetooth handling has been way more reliable for me across multiple machines and distros. So the problem may very well be in userspace.')
