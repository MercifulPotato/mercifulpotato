Now there are better provisioning methods, particularly when setting up hundreds of hosts, but when doing it na√Øvely for a single or few hosts using the interactive installation software, I preferred RedHat&#x2F;CentOS.  That got me to a booting system in some ten, fifteen minutes, while the dreaded installation in Debian used to take easily 1.5h.  Once installed, I found Debian easier to maintain and upgrade in place, but initial installation was a time-sink for many years.')
