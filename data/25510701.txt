From my experience, SPAs can crap out in all kinds of interesting ways when the underlying network connection is flaky and I often end up stuck on some kind of spinner that will never complete (nor give me a way to abort &amp; retry the operation when I already know it won&#x27;t complete and don&#x27;t want to wait for the ~30-second timeout, if there is a timeout even).<p>Not saying this is better from an error handling perspective, but at least the whole idea of Hotwire and its peers (Turbolinks, etc) is that there is no state and it should thus be safer and quicker to reload the page should things go wrong.')
