It  died after 1.5 years when I used an app to get a train ticket. It turned out it was a known hardware bug judging by forums. It was in Norway so the phone was still under warranty and it was “repaired” - the motherboard was replaced. Still not much later I bought the original iPhone SE. I just did not like the idea of phone stopping working for no reason.')
