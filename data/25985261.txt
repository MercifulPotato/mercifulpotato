Built a i7 6700k with an RX 480 back in mid 2016. Just upgraded over the holidays and flipped.<p>AMD CPU for obvious reasons(4950x while I wait for the opportunity for a 5950x) and an RTX 3070 OTW(haven&#x27;t been able to get a 3080).<p>I have been mostly satisfied with AMD drivers, but I have not owned some of the problem cards(like the Radeon VII). I do like the latest Catalyst and Ryzen Master software.. But the new crop of NVidia cards crush the AMD cards on ray tracing performance, and DLSS 2.0 is voodoo I want for 4k gaming and VR. Would really, really have liked to go with an AMD 6800 XT to support the underdog but.. Those two features are clutch when shelling out nearly a grand for a video card.<p>I have a good feeling about AMD in general and for their next GPU architecture iteration. They are supposedly working on an answer to DLSS(details are thin and NVidia are ML giants though) and this was their first generation with hardware ray tracing support so lessons learned should bear fruit.')
