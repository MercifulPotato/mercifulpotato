We have to get the rest of the world on board, and that&#x27;s simply not going to happen because there will always be a country that wants to improve the lives of their citizens, and thereby want to climb up the economic ladder, and as such will seek the advantages to be gleaned from the disproportionately more powerful fossil fuel.<p>Sorry to be such a pessimist, but there&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s going to stop climate change except the free market agreeing to pursue sustainability.  Politics has no power here.  Its just a bad strategy that puts anyone who pursues green tech at an economic disadvantage, a sort of prisoners dilemma.  Anything else is just fantasizing that we live in a non competitive world.<p>My advice: move to a colder state.')
