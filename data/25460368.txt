It&#x27;s actually not healthier at all, especially if, as you said, you get the bulk of your calories from starches (e.g. chips or pasta); which is easy to do because they&#x27;re easy and obvious options until you have a larger stock of recipies in your head. It&#x27;s also easy to not get enough protein that way. (In general getting enough protein as  a vegetarian, especially an ovo-lacto one isn&#x27;t difficult, but it can require being aware.)<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s perfectly healthy to eat meat; vegetarianism isn&#x27;t healthier. What&#x27;s healthier is being deliberate and thinking about the food you consume.<p>(For reference, I became vegetarian because I ha concerns about factory farming&#x27;s environmental impact and slowly just started to dislike the idea of having to sacrifice another animal for my benefit when it became clear to me that not doing so isn&#x27;t actually that difficult.)')
