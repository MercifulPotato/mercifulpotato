Best will in the World, stuff is goona happen and STD rates would give an insight.  Be interesting in years to come to mine the COVID infection rate data and contrast against STD spread trends and see if any correlation geography.  I&#x27;m looking at crime rates in area&#x27;s and infection spreads and whilst nothing hard, it certainly does seem to have some correlation.  The more likely an area is to have people prepared to break laws, the more chance people won&#x27;t respect the laws&#x2F;rules&#x2F;advice for spread.<p>So certainly much to be learned, but like driving - you can follow all the rules and drive perfectly, it&#x27;s always the other person who does not that crashes into you.<p>Just case of managing the flow like a production line and not seeing hospital capacity bottleneck, which seems to be the case in every country in the production line of normal life.  So a mass risk increase all in short window of time is one heck of a sudden spike risk that could really jam up and backlog the bottleneck and have a knock-on effect that will not bode well.<p>This all happening in a country with leadership in a bumpy transition phase and potentially a perfect storm.<p>I&#x27;d hate to think though that the head of the CDC wasn&#x27;t prepared to do an outright internal flight travel ban or harder notice statement for fear of upsetting the current president and getting twitter sacked and classed as a communist for not protecting American values.  But for me and possibly others - I can see how that may well be plausible, so there is that in the back of my mind, can&#x27;t deny that thought and do hope I&#x27;m wide of the mark even though it is a doubt I can&#x27;t dismiss.  But politics and health are never good bedfellows.')
