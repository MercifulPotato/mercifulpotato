I suspect the process would be <i>very</i> time-consuming, and generate huge amounts of data.<p>An easier &#x2F; cheaper way that seems fairly popular is to buy an old projector, set it up square to a good screen &#x2F; wall in a very dark room, and just record that.  The quality loss is probably going to be modest, given the low-quality of the original material in any case.')
