While it does not prevent a dedicated group from talking hatefully among themselves on their own instance (like Gab), it does isolate them, makes radicalising new users harder, and protects others from potential abuse.<p>I don&#x27;t follow this logic at all. This is effectively how QAnon spread, as a niche group on fringe websites, before it grew to millions of users. A federated network gives better moderation tools to communities who actually want to moderate, but it leaves the radicalised communities free to grow, even freer than on a centralised network.<p>Another example I heard of were so called &quot;free birth&quot; groups with tens of thousands of women shunning medical help for births, even bullying women who wanted to seek professional help. As a result, quite a few children and women died during labour[1]<p>Private&#x2F;semi private anti-vax groups are of course another huge issue right now. They often have hundreds of thousands of members. On a designated fediverse instance there is no possibility to shut this down.<p>I see no evidence or reason at all how the decentralised internet stops radicalisation or misinformation. It honestly to me seems like it would make it worse.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;she-wanted-a-freebirth-at-home-when-the-baby-died-the-attacks-began" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;she-wanted-a-freebirth-at-home...</a>')
