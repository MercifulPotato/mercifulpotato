I simply don&#x27;t have company email or instant messenger on my phone, and if I&#x27;m not &quot;at work&quot; then I don&#x27;t read, answer, or even see them. I personally have never had a problem with replying to people when I am actually working rather than whenever they&#x27;ve messaged me. It&#x27;s actually often useful because very often they&#x27;ll figure things out for themselves rather and the delay means I actually have less work to do.')
