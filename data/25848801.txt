Item(by='xirbeosbwo1234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611162071, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25833557, text='I find zero-based indexing more natural. Consider the case of dates. Dates are naturally one-indexed. There is no year zero.<p>This means that the 21st century started in the year 2001. Likewise, the current decade started under a month ago, not over a year ago. If you think the 21st century started in the year 2000, as do most people, then that implies that the first century either started in the year 1 B.C. (ugly) or was only 99 years long (not a century). People naturally (and incorrectly) default to zero-based indexing in this case!<p>I would go farther and make centuries zero-indexed too. It&#x27;s far more natural to say that the Nth century is everything in the form Nxx than to say it&#x27;s (N-1)xx. Every time I run across a numbered century I have to stop and think for a split second to calculate what years it covers. I got this wrong on several occasions in grade school and was marked down for it.<p>Zero-based indexing works naturally for grouping things. One-based indexing does not.<p>This, of course, doesn&#x27;t matter much.')
