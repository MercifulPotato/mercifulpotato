Item(by='Jtsummers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610305037, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25714760, text='Last 6 years, it&#x27;s been primarily running (5k runs 2-3 times a week, reduced as I added other activities), soccer, BJJ, and a strength&#x2F;conditioning class. I would also go for bike rides as an alternative to running, aiming to complete 3-5x the distance (multiple loops around the same 5k trail).<p>This past year, due to an injury and moving, a lot of that ended for me, but I&#x27;m now back to exercising regularly with a rowing machine (3x HIIT rows, 3x slow long rows a week). Once the weather warms back up, or the days are longer at least, I plan to resume running 2x a week replacing a couple of the long slow rows. Additional strength training is primarily body weight right now, with a focus on flexibility as well due to generally poor flexibility (part of what has caused most of my injuries over the years). This is daily, but not terribly high intensity. As I get back into it, it&#x27;ll become like the rowing, several days of low intensity activity (mostly focused on stretching and flexibility) and several days of HIIT activity. I would like to lift weights, but I don&#x27;t trust the people here with our COVID rates so no gym, and no good space for a weight setup at home.<p>And then there&#x27;s just yard work, not as much now (winter), but I have a reel mower so it takes more effort than other mowers to use and has to be used a bit more often. 20-30 minutes, 2-3x a week depending on rainfall. It was actually a good warmup before the runs.<p>For general weight management, though, most of it is diet. I eat meat, cheese, eggs, rice, fruit, vegetables, leafy greens. I do still eat pastas and breads, but very little in comparison to most of my life. I still drink sodas, but infrequently, drinking primarily water, coffee, and mate. The loss in activity due to the injury last year caused me to gain weight (about 10lbs) because I didn&#x27;t adjust my diet much, but it fell off quickly once I started rowing in December.')
