But note that Nvidia does still use TSMC&#x27;s 7nm for their largest &amp; most expensive dies. The A100 is TSMC 7nm at a staggering 54 billion transistors on 826mm² of silicon. Nvidia retains the largest die manufactured on TSMC&#x27;s 7nm. By a lot. The next largest would I think be Navi 21 at 536 mm² and 26.8 billion transistors.<p>&gt; Apple has also been the primary (volume) launch partner on both 7nm and 5nm<p>Apple&#x27;s die sizes &amp; transistor counts are comparatively tiny. The first use of a new fab is pretty much always a small, low-power die. That&#x27;s what yields best when yields are the lowest.<p>See also why Snapdragons are also among the first to launch on a new TSMC node, despite those SoCs having probably the lowest margins of the high-volume stuff TSMC makes.')
