It&#x27;s on by default but I recommend toggling it onto strict mode for best results. You can also use Firefox Focus to apply the same functionality to the default Safari browser.<p>The thing with the most potential on iOS is Lockdown, a local-only firewall which filters network connections from any application. It&#x27;ll break apps like Facebook Messenger if you turn on all the options. But again, it&#x27;s focused on trackers, not ads specifically.')
