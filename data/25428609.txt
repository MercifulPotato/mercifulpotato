Basically, the crackers broke into a corporate Exchange server and stole the Duo &quot;secret&quot; key.  With this key they could sign any future log-in attempts and prevent Duo from issuing a MFA request.<p>So, they just sat on the key until they needed access to someone&#x27;s account.  Changing that key every &#x27;N&#x27; days would reduce the attackers opportunities severely.  Then again, changing keys all the time also has it&#x27;s downsides.')
