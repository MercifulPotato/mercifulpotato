There&#x27;s not many places in the US like this. Europe has a lot but there&#x27;s not much tech jobs in them.<p>You are also close to SF if you like the madness of the city every once in a while.<p>Other suburby places with nature easily accessible usually have a more spartan retail experience and sometimes the mail&#x2F;Amazon doesn&#x27;t work so well.')
