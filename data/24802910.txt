Item(by='Lambdanaut', descendants=None, kids=[24803530, 24803293, 24803063, 24803055, 24803427], score=None, time=1602868766, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800947, text='You can ask yourself why something is as it is infinitely until the cycle regresses in on itself. Like the child that keeps asking `why?`. The lie we&#x27;ve accepted is that somewhere beneath this pile of whys is a foundation that makes things as they are for a reason. Something solid. An un-moving axiom.<p>That&#x27;s something to consider.<p>Furthermore we can apply `Why?` to the widely accepted belief in the axiom that our identity begins and ends at the thin layer of air that separates our flesh from the &quot;outside&quot; world. We can see that there is no reason for this belief other than that we have been caught up in the memeplex that we are separate individuals for so long.<p>What are the repercussions of that? Does that imply, for instance, bending spoons with our mind could be a thing? I mean, if our identity extends beyond this flesh and can be aligned with the will of the universe, then maybe that&#x27;s a thing. Maybe that&#x27;s a thought we can entertain.<p>It&#x27;s becoming apparent that our consciousness can extend further than we previously believed. We can manipulate systems of our own bodies with our will that we previously thought were 100% in control of us.<p>When presented with a consensus belief in our limits of awareness and willpower, Wim Hof asks `Why?`, and is able to extend his control further.<p>I&#x27;m excited to see how far we will push our abilities as portals for the universe to see itself through.')
