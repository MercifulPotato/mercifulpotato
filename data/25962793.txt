Item(by='libertine', descendants=None, kids=[25964770], score=None, time=1611955595, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25961882, text='I don&#x27;t understand why:<p>- approval timing;<p>- contract celebration date;<p>Has anything to do with the fact that AZ is failing to comply with it&#x27;s duties.<p>AZ isn&#x27;t waiting for EU approval to start producing stock to fulfill their initial order, that makes no sense - it takes WEEKS to build stock for the goal of the 80 million doses. The stock that will be delivered, 30% of what was expected, is being produced before this approval. So this &quot;approval process&quot; argument makes no sense.<p>Regarding the contract celebration date, same applies - they were expected to deliver 80 million doses in a timeframe, which they agreed upon.<p>Why don&#x27;t we do this the other way around, why don&#x27;t we all be transparent and see if they are also failing to supply the UK? Because if it&#x27;s supply issues, then it should be a problem of both countries no?<p>Or they were shifting stock made in Europe to fulfill UK orders?<p>I really hope the EU gets to the bottom of this, because it stinks.')
