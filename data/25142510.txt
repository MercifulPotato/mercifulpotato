It definitely captures a subtractive strain of political and social thought I find incredibly frustrating. The lefty &quot;woke&quot; variant is hotly criticized lately, but its libertarian and conservative siblings have had their moments in recent years. Something in it speaks to everyone.<p>Of course, dismantling order is a poor substitute for refining order, and while the idea of starting over from scratch is seductive, I&#x27;m not convinced the &quot;post-dismantling&quot; environment is a good one for building better things (regardless of your definition of &quot;better&quot;).<p>Unfortunately, the thirst for hard resets seems stronger now on all sides than I&#x27;ve ever seen before, which disappoints me to no end.
