So 1 in (50!&#x2F;(5!⨉45!)⨉20 = 42.375.200. There are 15 ascending &quot;suspicious&quot; winning sequences, as the choice of Powerball is always last and thus must be 6-20. Therefore the chance of winning Powerball with a &quot;suspicious&quot; sequence is 15 in 42.375.200. If there are 1000 Powerballs drawings per day for a year, that gives a chance of approximately 12% of happening at least once a year.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=binomial+calculator&amp;assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22BinomialProbabilities%22%2C+%22p%22%7D+-%3E%220.00000035398063%22&amp;assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22BinomialProbabilities%22%2C+%22x%22%7D+-%3E%220%22&amp;assumption=%22FSelect%22+-%3E+%7B%7B%22BinomialProbabilities%22%7D%7D&amp;assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22BinomialProbabilities%22%2C+%22n%22%7D+-%3E%22365000%22" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=binomial+calculator&amp;as...</a>')
