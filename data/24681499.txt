OxyContin didn&#x27;t offer anything over these earlier drugs.<p>Not only doctors but many of the lay public already know this.  Even if the spurious&#x2F;nebulous argument that OxyContin&#x27;s action lasted longer or whatever, that the sheer number of alternatives would tailor for almost any patient&#x27;s requirement.  The corollary being that OxyContin offered nothing new of any significance.  Even existing narcotics can be compounded for an individual patient&#x27;s needs.<p>The fact is that almost everyone knows this, especially doctors and pharmacists yet the medical profession let itself be bought off and FDA didn&#x27;t even wink an eyelid to stop it. Where was the FDA&#x27;s corporate memory?  How did its 100+year history on this matter fly out the window as if it never existed?<p>Essentially, in the light of a few dollars on offer from Sackler&#x27;s&#x2F;Purdue these damn miserable medicos said fuck the Hippocratic Oath and let their patients rot.<p>The Sackler&#x27;s and Purdue are ratbags, but also there&#x27;s many a medico who should have his&#x2F;her license to practice revoked.')
