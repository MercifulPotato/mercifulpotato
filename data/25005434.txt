Anyone who moves to Scandinavia thinking the high taxes will give complete access to instant top notch treatment in case of cancer or many other conditions will have been straight up misled and deceived.<p>Pointing that out doesn&#x27;t imply thinking US health care is preferable or better - I certainly don&#x27;t.')
