One does not simply export images from medical systems. It takes a ton of effort and clicking to get patient images out of most PACS systems IF YOU ARE LUCKY. DICOM images are often high bit-depth JPEG2000 and are hard to get access to because of the way PACS systems and medical devices store data. Screen scraping DICOMs would take ages as each DICOM can have any number of slices. You don&#x27;t want to lose the original bit-depth either as radiologists use contrast enhancement techniques which don&#x27;t work with images encoded in 8-bits like screen scrapes. The PACS tech industry is simply painful to deal with.')
