I think we basically built the same computer with a couple different choices (;<p>I lose millimeters of fan coverage (I have millimeters of fan peeking over the top of the tower), but I opted for this, since I get more airflow over the width of the cooler. The effect is probably measurable in single-digit percentage differences in a highly controlled test.<p>The big thing for me was the case airflow. That thing throws off so much heat that my case ambient temperature was growing to be 10C or more above the room ambient. Hence the 5x140mm intakes. The back of that machine is a nice heater when I&#x27;m crunching anything big.<p>My goal is to keep those fans, but attached to radiators. I think 5x140mm of radiator should give me much better heat transfer.')
