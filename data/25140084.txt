Item(by='kemayo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605722711, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25139675, text='Sure, but I don&#x27;t think the prevailing argument here is that any offense no matter how small should be catered to.<p>To produce a silly hypothetical, how about if anti-vaxxers got really upset about the phrase &quot;code injection&quot;? Even though anti-vaxxers are a worryingly large subgroup who&#x27;ve managed to return us to the days when measles is a thing to worry about, I still think that general cultural perception is such that everyone would roll their eyes at this complaint.<p>Rather, for &quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave&quot; and &quot;blacklist&quot; and whatnot, it&#x27;s that enough of a groundswell of awareness occurred in general society that a lot of people started to feel awkward about the use of a term. It&#x27;s akin to how &quot;negro&quot; used to be a perfectly acceptable descriptive word, but if you used it in casual conversation now you&#x27;d get a negative reaction even though it&#x27;s not the <i>bad</i> &quot;n-word&quot;.<p>We can&#x27;t separate the current drive to replace slavery-related terms from the last few years of events in America. There&#x27;s been a lot of events which have driven home to people that, yes, Black people in America are still having a rough time -- and in America, that inexorably ties to the historical reality of slavery.<p>A lot of these replacements are symbolic, driven more by a desire to say &quot;hey, we accept you! you are welcome in our community&quot; than any severe offense at any particular term. But symbolic things matter in aggregate.')
