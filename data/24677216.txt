I actually knew about this because they tested for it the first time I got glasses, and it came up there. But for years afterward I never really thought about it; I’d be able to tell basically every color and only falter on some that seemed ambiguous to me but others had an easier time distinguishing–but I never ascribed this to colorblindness; I just thought it was I who didn’t know the colors well enough. For both of your examples: pure red and pure green are very clearly, obviously distinct colors. I don’t think peanut butter looks green at all, it’s clearly a shade of light brown. Really, the only way I can describe the difference I see is this page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Color_blindness#Signs_and_symptoms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Color_blindness#Signs_and_symp...</a>.
