I was cutting down for summer, and had switched over to a very high-protein diet. The first time, I thought I had broke my toe, or gotten an infection - it was absolutely horrible.<p>I get it roughly 2-3-4 times a year now, and it is always after the following pattern:<p>- Not drinking enough water<p>- Eating too much chicken<p>- Drinking too much beer<p>Often in combination. Luckily, that makes my gout incredibly predictable - and I have found meds which work. As soon as I take meds fast enough during the onset, I&#x27;m fine.')
