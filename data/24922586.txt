These are high level conflicts between equally valid government entities about how they should operate as well as nebulous questions on how constitutional law applies. I would assume there are legal memos, signed authorizations, etc. for what is going on.  We could argue that secret authorizations for these kinds of things shouldn’t exist, but the fact is they do. If the president authorizes something, and years later, a court decides this action was unconstitutional, the employees are not criminally responsible. This isn’t a Nuremburg trial situation where crimes against humanity are committed under the guise of “just following orders”. This is a case of following orders because the best legal experts cannot 100% agree on constructional law and how it applies to different circumstances and different powers given to the various branches of government.')
