I&#x27;m not sure what Anuke (Mindustry dev) does for a living, but they are very fast to fix bugs and implement new features.  It&#x27;s free on itch.io, and android, but costs money on steam and iOS.  I would ask them what kind of monetization they get out of the game.  They&#x27;re likely an exception and not a rule.  You can&#x27;t expect to make a very successful game ever.')
