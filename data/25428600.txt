That&#x27;s essentially what the bitrate tells us, how much of the bits are new and how many are copied from a previous frame. This is an oversimplification, but with static images, you would need a low bitrate after the initial few frames because it doesn&#x27;t change. And bitrate is a proxy to how much data is transmitted while streaming, it&#x27;s bits per second.<p>So a more concise answer, the codecs used for video by YouTube have the optimization you&#x27;re thinking about built in. It would send a &quot;pixel didn&#x27;t change from last frame&quot; and not need to send all the color information for all the pixels.<p>YouTube does not really do variable frame rate, and it&#x27;s messy for editing, but it&#x27;s another optimization that is possible and could be useful for the type of video you&#x27;re describing.<p>The article describes DASH which you would need to send the full frame initially every time segment but per segment the previously described concept still applies. I don&#x27;t believe YouTube uses DASH for anything outside live streams.')
