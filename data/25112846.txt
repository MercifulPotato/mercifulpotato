Tart cherry juice is mentioned a lot as a cure. There are a quite a few studies[2]. Make sure and get the tart cherry (Montmorency) juice, you can get it in a concentrated syrup. My uncle says he has not had an attack since he started drinking a generic supermarket tart juice every day. I have never had an attack whilst taking cherry juice but i haven&#x27;t been taking it consistently.<p>Tart Cherry Extract capsules are another option. Gout pain relief within hours. (Note, there is a drowsy&#x2F;melatonin side effect with big doses)<p>Creams with high concentrations of menthol and methyl salicylate seem to help. Also applied to the ankle and knee (along with massage) to help stimulate circulation away from the big toe.')
