In practice it might be more like, “if the user has more than 7 items in their cart and if the user is not a returning customer that filled out personal data and the value of their cart is greater than $100 and they have not put a new item in the cart for 2 minutes, and the confidence score of the predictor is less than 0.4, THEN don’t show the next recommended item, just display a checkout link.”<p>And the number of items, the cart value limit, the time since last item-add, etc., will all be hotly debated by product management and changed 5 times every quarter.<p>In grad school there was a professor who said of machine learning that “parameters are the death of an algorithm” - so you want to avoid coupling extra business logic parameters tightly with the use of machine learning models.')
