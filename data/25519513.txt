So many of the descriptions are vague and based on apparently informal descriptions, leaving much to the reader&#x27;s imagination.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not theoretical, researchers are quoted in the article and papers have been altered.<p>In grad school, PhD students&#x27; advisors typically insist on various revisions before publishing a paper, as publications reflect on the advisor and their institution.  So there&#x27;s nothing even slightly weird about Google having the same interest in revising the papers pushed by its researchers.<p>Unless there <i>IS</i> something weird about what Google&#x27;s doing?  But if so, what is it?')
