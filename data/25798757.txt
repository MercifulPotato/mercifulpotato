Svelte surprises me in how much people fawn over it. I really don&#x27;t understand the hype since I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge jump forward, and there&#x27;s also a lot of &quot;misunderstandings&quot; about it in comparison to other frameworks.<p>Like one thing I&#x27;ve seen a lot is people mention how it requires less code, but it&#x27;s not that much smaller. It just looks smaller for small test cases where there are like 8 lines of code or because svelte makes stylistic choices that have tradeoffs that aren&#x27;t immediately obvious. If you take a loot at react&#x2F;vue, they&#x27;re not that much bigger for realistic component size.<p>Anyways, front-end framework discussion is long and muddled and confusing. I wanted to make a point of how svelte people often confuse the engineering&#x2F;implementation vs the philosophical approach in frameworks. Things like svelte&#x27;s bundle size being smaller is because other frameworks don&#x27;t put as much emphasis on it. I was going to say that react is bloated and that preact is much smaller, but looking it up it seems like somehow react is 2.6kb, preact is 4kb, and svelte is 1.5kb. Angular is 62kb. Which proves two points, react&#x2F;vue can be smaller if it wants, the approach it takes doesn&#x27;t limit it and that things move so fast that somehow preact makes bigger bundles than react.')
