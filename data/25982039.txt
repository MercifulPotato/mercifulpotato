Say you are a person. You have a goal to make {thing}. You achieve that goal by selling {thing}. To aid in this task under the economic system you live within, you create a legal entity, called a company. Your aim is still to achieve your goal. The aim of the company is to help with that.<p>The profit is a necessary condition, as you say. I&#x27;m not sure how you can write that and then disagree. This is a basic fundamental thing, like 1+1 is 2. If profit is the necessary condition to acheive {goal} and a company is the legal vehicle by which you attempt to achieve {goal}, then the aim of the company <i>has</i> to be increase profit, there isn&#x27;t a choice.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad thing, it&#x27;s just a thing. There will be other primary and ancillary aims, but the core reason for its existence is for that aim.<p>&gt; But you only have to look around to see that the vast majority of people who both run companies and who work for them are not in it to maximize profit.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s what I said re workers, and sure, it can apply to many smaller business owners. As you go up the ladder in company size from small business I would <i>strongly</i> disagree that the people running the companies are not there to maximise profit: appointments are very often explicitly made for financial reasons.<p>&gt; The vast majority of companies in a capitalist system are small to medium sized businesses that are constrained in how much money they can ever make.<p>Right, but the ones who are the original subject are <i>not</i> small to medium sized businesses, and they either are not heavily constrained by this, or actively lobby to remove restrictions that do constrain them.')
