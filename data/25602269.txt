Not even for governments. So if anyone takes basic precautions, you can&#x27;t trace them.<p>Although I assure you a normal person can&#x27;t read bitcoin transactions lists like they can a bank statement, and this goes for people working at the tax office too. And they can&#x27;t forbid those transactions, either. It raises the bar significantly on Tax offices, and therefore means less enforcement.<p>And if need be, there are several anonymous cryptocurrencies that would love nothing more than to replace Bitcoin, and of course they will as soon as governments actually start tracing payments.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinmarketcap.com&#x2F;alexandria&#x2F;article&#x2F;is-cryptocurrency-anonymous" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinmarketcap.com&#x2F;alexandria&#x2F;article&#x2F;is-cryptocurren...</a>')
