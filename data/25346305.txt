They then need to rationalise their decision that they made the best choice.<p>If I make $50 an hour, I am not going to waste 8+ hours searching and doing spreadsheets to figure out &#x27;what is the best for the money&#x27; because I am already losing 50$ per hour. The new pair that is &#x27;cheaper&#x27; costs as much as the device itself + as much as I &#x27;paid&#x27; searching for it.<p>If it isn&#x27;t my hobby, there is no reason to waste time on it.')
