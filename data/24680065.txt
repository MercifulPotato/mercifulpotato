Namely, who defines human rights?  The UN has its own definition that has received some attention (and indeed, it appears this is the definition used), but it defines things such as social security, paid time off, food, clothing, housing, and a whole laundry list of other things; I along with some others scorn the UN&#x27;s concept of rights because I don&#x27;t believe one can possess a positive right.<p>So we reach the age-old question of, &quot;Who decides?&quot;<p>Another potential problem is the mention of promoting &quot;equitable relationships&quot;.  While this may be confusion due to translation, &quot;equitable&quot; has recently been taken to mean equal in outcome, which I will never actively encourage.')
