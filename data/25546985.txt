Overall I prefer GeForce Now slightly, I think Stadia does have some advantages. Whether or not they&#x27;re worth it depends on your use case. GFN works great to supplement a gaming PC when you&#x27;re traveling or laying in bed, but has some deal breakers that keep it from being the main way I play games.<p>If you use the free version of Stadia, it&#x27;s the same resolution as GFN. If you&#x27;re a monthly subscriber, the picture quality is much better than GFN because GFN doesn&#x27;t support resolutions higher than 1920x1080. GFN is REALLY frustrating if you have a 1920x1200 or 1440p monitor. Because of this, GFN can complement my gaming PC (like when traveling with a crappy laptop) but never replace it. Stadia probably could replace my gaming PC if I was willing to buy the subscription.<p>No waiting period (its rare, but there&#x27;s occasionally a wait for GeForce Now even with the founders edition)<p>Games don&#x27;t disappear from the service like they sometimes do with GeForce Now (granted, if a game you bought disappears in GFN you can still install locally so this may be a win for GFN as long as Steam&#x27;s cloud saves don&#x27;t glitch on you)<p>Stadia doesn&#x27;t require you to install a 200 megabyte app (assuming you already have Chrome installed)<p>GFNs video clip feature is a bit buggy for me compared to Stadia although I haven&#x27;t used those features enough to tell if GFN is consistently glitchy or if I&#x27;m just unlucky with the NVidia overlay<p>The UI for GFN feels clunkier to me but I suppose that&#x27;s personal opinion. It feels more like VPNing  into a really locked down PC, where you&#x27;ll hear Windows sound effects when there&#x27;s errors and if a game crashes you&#x27;re stuck with a Steam error and you have to restart the whole app and wait in a queue to play again. Stadia feels a bit more well-integrated to me.')
