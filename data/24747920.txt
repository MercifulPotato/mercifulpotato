Which means that any problem I have which is in the 32-bit space is a candidate for brute force.<p>No, the post is about exhaustive testing, and that it&#x27;s completely <i>reasonable</i> on 32 bit values because it only takes a few minutes.<p>&gt; Given the advances in computers over the past few years: exhausting the 64-bit (or 2x 32-bit) space is &quot;reasonable&quot; for the year 2020.<p>That&#x27;s not actually reasonable, it&#x27;s <i>feasible</i> for very specific contexts.<p>&gt; At least, reasonable for people who are willing to wait a month (on one GPU), or willing to buy a cluster of GPUs.<p>And whose code specifically can run on GPU. TFA <i>is about CPU-optimised code</i>, the entire point was to exhaustively test an SSE3 implementations. How do you do that on a GPU?')
