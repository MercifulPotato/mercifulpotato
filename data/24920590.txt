But indeed this library is based around the idea of having performant UI (as they mostly redraw whole screen on each frame, it has to be quite quick, though there are ways not to do this, this is the most basic case) and generic containers do not really cut it, also usage of exceptions is sort of impossible with the way you have to structure ImGui code. So it&#x27;s more of a codebase that illustrates how to write performant code, not so much modern C++ guideline.')
