It&#x27;s easy enough to understand when you parse through it and have a degree in parsing through tricky language.<p>What&#x27;s going to destroy the country is respectable news outlets running headlines like &quot;The Unbearable Whiteness of Storming the Capitol.&quot; It&#x27;s language that&#x27;s designed to make college-educated elite feel like they&#x27;re in the in-group, while enraging normal people who don&#x27;t see the term any differently than if you had inserted any other race in there.<p>I have tried to explain these academic terms to my dad. He eventually got it, but says &quot;well if it stays in academia it&#x27;s fine.&quot; My mom doesn&#x27;t get it at all. She&#x27;s got a graduate degree, but has a language gap. My in laws in exurban and rural America mostly think it&#x27;s a racial attack on them. If they&#x27;re somewhat right-leaning to begin with, to them it&#x27;s as if respectable media has normalized overt racism against white people.<p>Normalizing this will provoke something very ugly for no reason. There are shared premises that exist when you use terminology like that among educated people. In particular, most people have internalized the idea that &quot;you can&#x27;t be racist against white people&quot; and things like that (or at least won&#x27;t complain about it too loudly). Those shared assumptions do not exist when you&#x27;re talking to the public at large, in a context that&#x27;s already adversarial and charged.')
