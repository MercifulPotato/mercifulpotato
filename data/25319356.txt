If Walmart buys the cheapest land it can find and builds a distribution center on that land, how much is that land worth? What they paid for it? What someone else would pay for it now? How bought all the parcels around it that now would be useful for housing?<p>Either <i>paradigm</i> is real estate valuation (at which point it become real estate tax) or the paradigm is something else with that something else up for grabs.')
