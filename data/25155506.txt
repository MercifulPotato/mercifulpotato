There&#x27;s a flash animation I used to enjoy back around 2000 and I have been looking for it for almost as long.  It was basically a showcase animation sequence done by what I think was a Japanese designer.  I don&#x27;t remember the full sequence but it was an anime style animation and at the end was a girl standing on a cliff with her hair blowing in the wind.<p>I&#x27;m really hoping it will end up on The Internet Archive.  I sure would like to see it again.  It was very beautiful.')
