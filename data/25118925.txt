Your friends are just sharing content that you don&#x27;t find interesting but there is a &quot;X TikTok&quot; for just about every topic no matter how niche. Everyone&#x27;s TikTok is very different, you can have overlap in topics with friends but you can also have a highly personalized feed of stuff you like.<p>Edit: I say of this because I thought VERY similarly to you before I tried it.')
