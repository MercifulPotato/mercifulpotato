If you&#x27;ve ever been to Camden Market in London, there&#x27;s loads of food vendors, and they all do this, they have examples of whatever they are making just sitting there, so you don&#x27;t even need a menu - just point at the thing that you want and they will make it for you. I think it&#x27;s the same with these - a roll in itself probably won&#x27;t attract interest, but display it cut in half so everyone can see straight away what you&#x27;re selling and it becomes a lot more attractive.')
