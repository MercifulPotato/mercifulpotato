At best.  Half of the recommendations look like your standard rebadged Alibaba crap peddled on Amazon with all the fake reviews that follow.<p>I guess the name of the site is a tacit admission that probably the products are not good, but this page is content that&#x27;s designed to match for certain search terms and not something that&#x27;s organically good content.<p>I&#x27;m fine with Google ranking this content straight to zero.<p>Edit: The author is a nice guy and a decent writer. Emotionally, I want to feel for him. But not for content like this.<p>You can have all of the best intentions and still contribute negative value to the world.')
