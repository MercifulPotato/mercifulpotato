You&#x27;ve only agreed to RENT a book for an unspecified amount of time. You never owned a thing, and thus nothing was stolen from you.<p>Ownership doesn&#x27;t exist in the digital marketplace; if you really wanted to do something so stupid as to OWN a good, you&#x27;d pirate it.<p>Note that for goods like DVDs you&#x27;re still only purchasing the right to access the data.. you didn&#x27;t actually take ownership of anything more than the physical disk.<p>Hence, the OP has lost nothing they had... because they had nothing to begin with !')
