This signaled to everybody that safety was that one guy&#x27;s problem, not theirs. Accidents went up further and stayed up until they got rid of the Safety Directory position and made everybody responsible for safety.<p>That resonated for me because I&#x27;ve seen that happen in software, that classic pattern where cowboy coders ship garbage to QA. The lowest bug rates I&#x27;ve seen are where everybody cares about quality.<p>With Facebook, I expect that &quot;Chief of Advertising Integrity&quot; is sort of light a lightning rod. The job is not to solve the problem, it&#x27;s to take the hits.')
