When a reactive component is rendered, Matestack renders a HTML component tag, passing in configuration via props and ships that to the browser. Vue.js on the browser then detects these component tags and mounts the appropriate Vue.js component, which reads the configuration coming from the props and perform the desired (configured) functionality. The HTML within the component tag is used as the inline template for the Vue.js component. It&#x27;s rendering HTML tags out of pure Ruby on the one hand, and mounting pure Vue.js component on top of that in the browser on the other hand.')
