A dedicated entity can shoot entirely new original scenes (unique footage), deepfake actors’ faces to look like the people they’re targeting, edit it all together, and possibly add CG VFX as a final layer to make the resulting video look very real<p>This was treated (along with the ubiquity of CCTV in London) by the 2019 BBC show <i>The Capture</i>[0].<p>They glossed over a bunch of technical issues, but got the idea across pretty well.<p>Of course, they made the Americans look like the <i>worse</i> bad guys (no one comes out looking good, even the nominal &quot;victim.&quot;) but that&#x27;s to be expected, given the darkness the show attempts to purvey.<p>It&#x27;s not great, but it absolutely provides context for the <i>eventual</i> advent of reasonable quality deep-fakes and the potential for abuse of the technology.<p>I&#x27;d expect that we&#x27;ll see lots more of this sort of story telling, especially since any sort of video <i>production</i> (not including <i>raw</i> video footage) is never seen the way things actually are.  As such, the &quot;faking&quot; (minus the deep-fakes with faces, etc.) is the key to the exercise.<p>Go watch the taping&#x2F;filming of <i>any</i> television or movie and that will become immediately clear.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Capture_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Capture_(TV_series)</a><p>Edit:  Added the <i>missing</i> link.')
