The recent riots seem to be more than adequately handled through existing law enforcement procedures.<p>The crowd (who had previously been chanting &quot;hang Mike Pence&quot;) came within about 30 seconds of being face to face with Vice President Pence and some large fraction of Congress (source [0]).
