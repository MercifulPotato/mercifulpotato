I believe we should &quot;rush&quot; a vaccine during a pandemic by modifying testing protocols which will ultimately save more lives by speeding up the approval time. The FDA should have done challenge trials with a healthy population to better determine the vaccine&#x27;s effectiveness.<p>I believe the silver bullet for future pandemics will be pre-approved mRNA vaccine pathways with the only change to the specific vaccine being the mRNA payload that targets the pathogen. Then testing could be a lot more straightforward and quicker which could end future pandemics.')
