You still need some engineering to keep everything under control.<p>I suspect this assumption come from the fact CGI have a lot of different things to render so you try to get the hardware that &quot;support&quot; by and large the problems you will have: You can&#x27;t focus optimization on every single problem, but you can optimize the 90% use case, so the 10% use case can represent 90% of artist time and keep deadline safe.')
