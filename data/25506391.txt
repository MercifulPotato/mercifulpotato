If someone has access to the email account, it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether there resides a token based url or a plain text password, both can be accessed.<p>Having expiration goes for both of course.<p>Why is token based better than sending a plain text new password with an expiration, forcing the user to create a new password? Best practices and why?')
