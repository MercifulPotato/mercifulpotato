We looked at existing freelance platforms and 3D marketplaces. A lot of them were cluttered and the process of ordering an item to be printed was too cumbersome.<p>Our platform is designed for one specific purpose - find someone to 3D print your ideas - so the entire UX was created with that in mind.<p>We also try to keep things &quot;peer to peer&quot; as much as we can: you speak to the creators themselves, not some intermediate party. As a creator you choose what to work on and you price the projects yourself.')
