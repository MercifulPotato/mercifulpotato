Item(by='troupe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609268557, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25572693, text='&gt; Do they deserve it? No of course not. Nobody deserves bad fortune like this.<p>Imagine two people that both earn $100k a year. Person A spends $50k and saves the rest. Person B, spends everything they possibly can.  Person A is working toward a master&#x27;s degree in their field investing an hour each evening toward it. Person B spends an hour each evening watching netflix.<p>Then the pandemic hits. (or any other number of other things that are likely to result in job loss.) Both lose their jobs. Person A has savings to get by and ramps up finishing their master&#x27;s degree. Person B is broke and facing eviction.<p>Does B deserve to be in a worse situation than A? Well, yes, but by &quot;deserve&quot; I don&#x27;t mean that I would wish anything ill on them, but A was willing to forgo spending in order to have more security in the future. It is kind of like asking if someone who buys 20k mile tires &quot;deserves&quot; to have them wear out at 20k miles when someone that spent significantly more on 90k mile tires has their&#x27;s last much longer. It was just a matter of investing in different things with different consequences. Both buying the 20k tires and the 90k tires could be very rational depending on what the person was optimizing for.')
