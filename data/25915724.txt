There is no chance for quality here.<p>I wouldn’t call subtitles that require about a GB of RAM to process and don’t even get 20fps on an i7-6700 &quot;quality&quot;. That’s just a bunch of shitty hacks people accept because there’s no alternative.<p>ASS is a horrible format (three implementations, only a single well-working implementation, performance hungry, etc), and almost all of the benefits of ASS can also be had with e.g. TTML without the issues.<p>And stuff like rendering the same line hundreds of times to get a gradient effect or blurred background is absolutely wasteful, especially because it’s just a hack to work around the broken ASS limitations.')
