So no strict measures just enough to make sure our health care isn&#x27;t overrun. This was perfectly fine in the first few months, now they are still doing the same measurements (no real lockdown or any strict measures) while our health care is being overrun because of a 2nd wave. This time herd immunity is nowhere to be found.<p>I can only imagine that NZ is indeed sitting this out till a vaccine is available, because if countries that had herd immunity as a goal in the first place to not have that goal anymore, it probably means it isn&#x27;t feasible.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t see how _any_ country is able to do anything other than sit this out. Everyone in the US, NL, even DE (which is doing okay in Europe) or NZ and TH (with no local infections) cannot do anything else than to wait for a vaccine to be available or before we just accept this as a reasonable risk.<p>Personally I think accepting the risk is the most likely situation. I do not have much confidence in a good vaccine being available in 2021, personally I&#x27;ll get back on the plane in 2021 and just accept the risk. I als know that this is something a lot of people will not accept, but we cannot lock up the world economy for a few years for a virus where the fatality rate for healthy people is so low.')
