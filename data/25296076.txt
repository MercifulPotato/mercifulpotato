I don&#x27;t see the feedback as negative, as what I&#x27;ve seen so far has been 95% overwhelmingly positive. My thesis has proven true - this tool is helping people. While HN might not be the most appropriate audience, I&#x27;m still grateful for the comments made here. Always good to see things from different perspective.<p>As for your points:<p>1) Trading is a game of probabilities and risk management. None of the best traders I know are trying to predict anything. They are merely reacting to situations where they have calculated advantage. They know their edge, they know their odds, and they are placing their bets when it&#x27;s skewed in their favor.<p>2) For most retail trading styles and portfolio sizes, real trades will have an impact, but not significant enough for it to worry about too much. Unless asset your&#x27;re trading is really illiquid.')
