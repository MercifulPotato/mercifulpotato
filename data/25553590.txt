How often do you do that IRL? Do you just do it any old time, or do you look for certain signals that it is OK?<p>I do think there is a generational &quot;thing&quot; where older people tend to see online interactions as superficial and unreal, while younger people see them as a natural extension of the IRL social sphere. As a younger person, I find it easy to point out that interactions with strangers present similar difficulties whether online or IRL.')
