That&#x27;s significantly different from tapping out at 30, or even 60.<p>But if we actually did that, then life expectancy would probably drop.  So we&#x27;d lower the age at which we cut off medical care.  Then the life expectancy would probably drop some more.<p>Mind you, I&#x27;m not saying that I agree with legerdemain.  I&#x27;m just saying that I think that your particular criticism of his idea is off base.')
