Until I got a set of wireless headphones on a whim.<p>Spoiler alert: It was not fine.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like wheels on luggage... you don&#x27;t think you need them until you have one, then you never want anything else.<p>Just to be clear though, I actually use my wired headphones way more... but that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re very very good and driven by a good dedicated amp.<p>Portable is a whole different ballgame.')
