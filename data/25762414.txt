And Rachelbythebay is way more technically inclined than most users; if she wasn&#x27;t able to correctly apply the blame to Apple, then normal users are definitely not going to be able to do that. Developers need to be more up-front about why these issues exist, we need an education push.<p>For all the criticism about how Fortnight framed its issues on iOS (and some of that criticism was warranted), coming out of the gate strong with a consistent message that Apple was to blame was likely the only way to get any &#x27;normal&#x27; user to even consider that there were multiple issues and viewpoints at play. There&#x27;s no such thing as subtlety or nuance when you&#x27;re trying to talk to that demographic about why their phone&#x2F;desktop doesn&#x27;t do the thing they want it to do.<p>In the long term, I don&#x27;t know. On one hand, these issues do affect final users, but communicating with final Mac users is difficult.<p>But on the other hand, Wireguard isn&#x27;t going away, it&#x27;s a clearly better protocol. So right now, final Mac users assume it&#x27;s the devs&#x27; fault. But are they going to assume that when literally everyone around them has decent VPN clients and their Mac experience is just miserable? Mac users aren&#x27;t completely isolated from the Linux&#x2F;Windows world, at some point they&#x27;re going to realize the pattern if all of the software on their platform is just worse.')
