We have, oh, three heat sources and half an AC in our house (old house) and can install a freestanding HRV or ERV simply as an air exchange (bringing in fresh air and letting out stale air). As we live in a cold climate, we&#x27;re working out what we need in terms of HRV vs ERV. It seems like a slightly better solution than &quot;leave the upstairs window cracked&quot; which is what we do now.')
