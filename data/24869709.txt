They have been quite generous with visit pass extensions, however I didn&#x27;t want to outstay my welcome, so at the end of August I moved to Dubai and I&#x27;m actually getting a residence visa here.<p>Preferably I would like to fly to Mainland China soon for business and also personal reasons and would be willing to stay in 14 days&#x27; quarantine for that, but it&#x27;s still proving difficult due to visa paperwork (a so-called &quot;PU letter&quot; is needed) issues.')
