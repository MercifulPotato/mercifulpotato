Think of it like low range.&lt;&#x2F;i&gt;<p>Not with modern motor controls. For the last 20 years or so, most new locomotives have used 3-phase AC servo drive motors. It&#x27;s striking to see one exerting enormous torque to get a train started, yet the Diesel engine generating the power is barely above idle. \nAlso, no wheel spin. All the wheels can be synchronized electrically. This almost doubles the useful traction.<p>Early Teslas had a two-speed transmission. It was a flop. The shock loads on gear shifting were too large and the transmissions wore out rapidly. Tesla had to replace all of them. The big advance was liquid-cooled motors. Finally a way to get rid of the excess heat fast enough that you could use full power at zero speed if desired.')
