Item(by='hndecaythrw235', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610388865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25731697, text='Wait, seriously, why the hell is this flagged?<p>We&#x27;ve had weeks now, of blatantly &quot;Front page mainstream news political debating&quot; flooding the front page, and yet one of the first technically focused takes on that, that to my eyes would be PRECISELY the question a &quot;hacker&quot; (in the traditional HN sense) would ask when confronted with this situation is flagged?<p>@dang, I&#x27;m sure you can identify who my real account is, and I will ask your forgiveness and understanding as to why I avoid any of these topics (or making this post) under that alias, so please take this as a plea from a typically moderate source that this is all going very unproductive and disappointing directions.<p>That every answer here is, &quot;you can&#x27;t&quot;, sidetracking into political arguments on the same tired quotes, or just blatant greying?  We&#x27;ve GOT to be better than this.<p>Why aren&#x27;t we discussing scihib?  Why aren&#x27;t we discussing bittorrent?  Why aren&#x27;t we discussing IPFS?  Why aren&#x27;t we discussing advanced forms of sneaker&#x2F;mesh nets?  I will gladly hold myself to this standard:  I think we have seen the technical approach we need; we need to start thinking about ideological and centrally controlled platforms as points-of-failure in the same way we used to think about datacenters or network uplinks.  Straddle technologies.  Provide fallbacks.  Build your core indexes on technologies that cannot be deplatformed readily, or are not cross-correlated in their deplatforming tendencies.<p>The is insane.  I&#x27;ve been on this board over a decade, used to have such high respect for the level of discussion.<p>Please; please; I honestly beg of you all as one human to another hoping to pull back from our current mode of dialogue. Is anyone else in the room able to bring a steady keel back into these discussions?')
