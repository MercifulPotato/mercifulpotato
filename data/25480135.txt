Many many people made sensible decisions to go to lower cost schools, in-state schools or community colleges to avoid debt. Then there are people who chose to avoid college altogether to avoid debt. Some people religiously are forbidden from taking on debt and they oblige that by avoiding expensive schooling.<p>And forgiving student debt is a punch in the face to all those people. If we forgive student loan debt we HAVE TO give the same amount to people who were prudent enough to avoid that debt in the first place or else it&#x27;s all a sham.')
