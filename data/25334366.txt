Item(by='Nacdor', descendants=None, kids=[25334639], score=None, time=1607362018, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25332605, text='&gt; I noticed a substantial improvement in my health when I started putting HEPA air filters all over my house, and another jump when I moved away from a major road.<p>Same for me when I moved out of a stuffy old high-rise in Philadelphia. I had frequent coughs and wheezing, shortness of breath, and just lots of general discomfort with breathing. Every time I washed my car there was a thick black layer of soot covering it within a couple days, so I&#x27;m sure that was doing great things for my lungs. Also got a couple serious colds every year when I lived there. That was as a 20-something who never smoked, didn&#x27;t have asthma and wasn&#x27;t overweight.<p>Living in the suburbs now and haven&#x27;t had an issue since moving.')
