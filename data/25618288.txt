Having observed how the Chinese government responded to SARS, our health &amp; national security systems should never have taken what they said at face value. That we did not respond with more intensity is on us.<p>However, this does not excuse the Chinese Government&#x27;s active (and ongoing!) attempts to downplay what they knew about the initial severity of the outbreak. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to blame the botched first two months of response on the provincial government.')
