CCs theory on disruption might be the most misused and overhyped stuff I&#x27;ve ever come to research. (did my MSc thesis on it, with support from a professor whose main research area was disruption...) - unless there are underlying new  technological paradigm shifts underpinning those UX changes, but I doubt that.<p>This is a case of Google not seeing the cost&#x2F;benefit equation being positive between changing the UX from it&#x27;s current UXs to some other ones (within the same technological paradigm).<p>Sure, it might be a case of resource dependence and a lack of will to &quot;start over&quot;. But that doesn&#x27;t imply disruption as described by CC (at least not originally)')
