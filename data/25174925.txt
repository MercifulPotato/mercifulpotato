In order to become a proficient pianist, you must learn (create muscle memory for) every scale and chord 11 unnecessary times. 1 pattern for C, 1 for C#&#x2F;Db, one for D, and so on.<p>If we dropped the &quot;white keys are for C Ionian and black keys are for &#x27;accidentals&#x27;&quot; layout for a chromatic one, a pianist would only need to learn every scale and chord once, and playing in a different key would involve nothing more than moving their hands.<p>The same goes for notation and theory verbiage. It&#x27;s like we&#x27;re stuck in a codebase that was started centuries ago, and everyone is too afraid to commit a bugfix, let alone a major refactor.')
