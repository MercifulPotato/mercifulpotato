Item(by='FleaFlicker99', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608072493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25433741, text='The internet was such a big deal because groups of people could finally interact without the mediation and filtering of a large (typically corporate) entity determining what&#x27;s &quot;fit to print&quot;. You don&#x27;t have to search very hard to find the bounds of acceptable thought from corporate-sponsored media, even pre-internet. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in feeling constrained and frustrated with that situation. Sure, it&#x27;s not a North Korea situation, but it&#x27;s not great either.<p>There are some very real problems with unfettered access to communication, and I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve solved them yet. I am very concerned that this law will have a range of unintended negative consequences, and I don&#x27;t think defending our existing (flawed) structure really proves that it&#x27;ll all be fine.<p>Specifically we&#x27;re talking about moving from a model of centralized media control (eg: media companies and the conglomerates that own them) to one where a select group of people get to manage the filtering of content on the largest platforms. That seems like something that will be almost impossible to manage properly, and ripe for (at a minimum) political manipulation.')
