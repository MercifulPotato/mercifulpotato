And the shape does get recognized by the immune system when that protein is secreted from the cell. But there is also a shape-independent mechanism that works on the sequence alone. The proteins in a cell are also chopped into tiny pieces and presentend on the surface. That part could not distinguish between different folded versions of the same protein like with prions.')
