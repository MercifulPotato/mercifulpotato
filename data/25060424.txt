It makes sense to me to say &quot;the predications were right, Trump just got lucky&quot; when he outperforms the 95th percentile error bars in a state. He just got lucky. But if he outperforms it in a bunch of states because the polls didn&#x27;t account for the fact that Trump supporters don&#x27;t answer pollsters, then it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me to say &quot;the predictions were right because they factored in the chance that the polls hard correlated errors.&quot; I get that you&#x27;ve quantified the possibility that the polls are wrong in a systematic way, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the kind of possibility people are thinking of when they hear &quot;there is a 5% chance Trump could still win.&quot;')
