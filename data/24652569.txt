We would love to talk to you.<p>- Reverse Engineering (iOS)<p>We pop open some of the most well protected mobile apps in the world as a prerequisite to integrating a new bank. If you have a more sophisticated answer than &quot;MITMProxy&quot; for the question &quot;How would you reverse a banking app&#x27;s API contract?&quot; please get in touch.\nWe&#x27;re working on some exciting projects like our own LLDB debugserver undetectable by state-of-the-art anti-RE tools and static decryption of Apple&#x27;s FairPlay DRM. We strongly believe investing in proprietary tooling is major advantage.<p>- Erlang&#x2F;Elixir Engineers<p>Our application is 100% Elixir. We really mean it. We are 100% all in on Elixir, we&#x27;ve already built a lot of new features on Phoenix LiveView too.<p>- DevRel&#x2F;DevX Engineering<p>Do you think DevRel has jumped the shark and needs a reboot? Same here. This role involves a mixture of core engineering, being a user advocate within the company, creating great content and tooling for the best possible developer experience.<p>Sound interesting?
