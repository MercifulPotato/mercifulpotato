Bing doesnt know you are searching, it can only see duckduckgo and the search term, not you.<p>DDG gets results back from bing, sometimes modifying it with it&#x27;s own results to make them better.<p>&gt; But I think you&#x27;re talking about which index it is that DDG queries internally to yield regular (non-bang) search results?<p>Yes. Most of it is Bing.<p>Ecosia doesn&#x27;t proxy it properly. It sends it to bing from you browser, not from Ecosia&#x27;s servers. Bing knows your IP and sets cookies to track you. You can observe it with dev tools.<p>They might have changed it since I last checked.')
