It had already escaped China at the time.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;outlook&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;debate-early-travel-bans-china&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;outlook&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;debate-ear...</a><p>&gt; The measure that the Trump administration implemented could not be described as a “ban” that “closed the country”: It only prohibited U.S. entry to <i>foreign nationals</i> who had visited China in the last 14 days. Americans and U.S. permanent residents returning from Hubei Province were still allowed, subject to a 14-day quarantine. After these policies were enacted, <i>hundreds of thousands of travelers continued to arrive in the United States via direct flights from China</i>. Until Feb. 27, no other travelers to the United States faced such travel restrictions and quarantine requirements — even if they were arriving from other nations that were reporting coronavirus cases.<p>&gt; Restricting flights from China did nothing to prevent the virus from arriving from other parts of the world. <i>Genetic analyses have shown that the large epidemic that unfolded in New York was linked to travelers from Europe.</i> In the early days of the U.S. epidemic, testing was restricted to people with a travel history to China, which limited the ability to detect locally the cases and infections among travelers from other countries.<p>&gt; By the time Trump expanded travel restrictions to Iran on Feb. 28 and to European nations on March 12, it was largely too late. By mid-March, the United States was approaching 2,000 confirmed cases and experiencing severe shortages in testing capacity that meant many infections likely went undiagnosed. The travel restriction did not initially apply to the United Kingdom, which already had hundreds of reported cases. And, implementation caused chaos. Photos showing large crowds of Americans stranded together in long lines and tight corridors for hours at airports may have increased virus transmission among those travelers who eventually made their way back to the United States.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;0dc271ad7f7917374a5a0cfb49273783" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;0dc271ad7f7917374a5a0cfb49273783</a><p>&gt; A recent study from the journal Science found China’s internal crackdown modestly delayed the spread of the virus. It cast doubt that travel restrictions elsewhere will do much compared with other preventive measures, citing in part the likelihood that a large number of people exposed to the virus had already been traveling internationally without being detected.')
