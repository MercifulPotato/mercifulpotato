Regardless of the presence of security flaws in dockerd, the Podman architecture just feels cleaner.<p>And the CLI compatibility is great. Until it isn&#x27;t. At work we switched to Podman for a small deployment because Docker didn&#x27;t yet work with cgroupsv2 and many hours were spent debugging Podman-specific issues. In the end switching to cgroupsv1 would have been significantly less work.<p>Therefore claiming you can `alias docker=podman` is a bit disingenuous. You can, but only if you don&#x27;t do anything Podman can&#x27;t handle and what it can and cannot handle isn&#x27;t immediately obvious.<p>All that said, I wish the project the best and hope it reaches the maturity where this alias actually does work.')
