The gravitons correspond to (excitations in) the curvature of space-time. The other force bosons correspond to (excitations in) the curvature of <i>other</i> fields, such as the electromagnetic field.<p>Interestingly the Yang-Mills equations (used in quantum mechanics) and the Einstein-Hilbert action (used in general relativity) are pretty much identical if you use general enough mathematics.')
