I’m not that kind of libertarian but as I learn more about their theory, a major complaint is that right now the wealthy use their money to influence the state to influence markets. The libertarians theorists would prefer the wealthy use their wealth to compete in the market, not use the state to force things to the benefit of one firm. That’s why they want a weaker state. So it can’t be influenced by the wealthy.<p>However lots of people misunderstand that theory and think the wealthy influencing the state is what libertarians want. I’ve not found any libertarian  theoretician who advocates for that.')
