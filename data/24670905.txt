It was spring loaded and simply turned on the microwave circuit and broke it when the timer mechanically reached resting position.<p>The new knob is digital, and you use it to navigate a digial menu and to increase&#x2F;decrease the timer prior to pressing it inward to start the process. Completely novel input mechanism.')
