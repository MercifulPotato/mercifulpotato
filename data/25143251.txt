Item(by='umvi', descendants=None, kids=[25143643], score=None, time=1605737989, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142325, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t think people who are outside of these underrepresented groups understand just how many small reminders a day we get that the &quot;default&quot; is for us not to be welcome.<p>IMHO (and I didn&#x27;t downvote you, btw), I believe you (and other minorities) are <i>choosing</i> to interpret things like complaining about political changes to code and projects as persecution. That is a <i>choice</i> you are making. You could also <i>choose</i> to see it for what it really is - people disagreeing about politics. Interpreting a political stance as a personal insult or persecution is not the right way to go, IMO. Assume good faith; give the benefit of the doubt.<p>If a project maintainer pushes back and complains when internet mobs try to force him to remove the word &quot;red&quot; from his codebase because it triggers soviet refugees... that doesn&#x27;t mean the project maintainer is persecuting soviet refugees or that soviet refugees are &quot;unwelcome&quot; to contribute. Soviet refugees may choose to interpret the project maintainer&#x27;s actions as such, but that doesn&#x27;t make it so. In reality the project maintainer disagrees with the politics on the issue of removing the word &quot;red&quot; from his code and is pushing back.<p>The beauty of GitHub, HackerNews, and internet fora in general is that nobody really knows your race or gender or really anything about you (unless you make it known). From my experience, people on the internet are just usernames with personality, judged on the merits of their insights and contributions. I&#x27;ve worked with some great people online in the past on different projects, and to this day I have no idea if they were male or female or non-binary or black or white or asian or blind or deaf.')
