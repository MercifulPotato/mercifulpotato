(I can’t remember the exact number.). EV’s have more embodied carbon, so they’re removing less than half the emissions in that part of their life.<p>This will drastically improve as the grid decarbonizes.  However, we really should be focusing on swapping out the drive trains on 2000-2020’s most popular models.')
