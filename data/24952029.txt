I think it is crucial to the books. There are many other good books without that aspect, including 1984. But a key part of the book is the hopefullness in asserting that it is not only by our own strength or insight can the evil things we see around us be overcome. A major point of the book is that evil does exist, conspiracies exist, but that good will triumph because there is something special about good. 1984 ends in a very different tone, both make good points. The variety is good.')
