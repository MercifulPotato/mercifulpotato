Item(by='breakingcups', descendants=None, kids=[25933455], score=None, time=1611738635, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25920569, text='Hi Brian,<p>I&#x27;m not the person you responded to and I&#x27;m a happy user of both Backblaze and B2, but I wanted you to know that this response by you reads as quite disingenuous. You seem to want to shift the reason for his disgruntlement with Backblaze from all the reasons he already mentioned to some other, imaginary slight that you indicate you&#x27;ll do your very best to fix. How about just reading his very real gripes and responding to those?<p>Let&#x27;s take his twitter thread for some highlights, these seem like very real reasons to get upset, maybe you &quot;can try to fix&quot; those?\n* Backblaze changed their client to add an allowlist some time after my report, while also <i>intentionally</i> breaking their TLS code so it would accept INVALID TLS certificates. Thereafter, the local code execution vuln became a full blown RCE vuln.<p>* When I submitted my report 11 months ago, they told me they already knew about the problem, downplayed its severity, dodged follow-up questions, didn’t seem to understand how CVE IDs work and refused to issue one after being asked four times. It was not confidence-inspiring. The CVE ID for the vulnerability I gave to them is CVE-2019-19904. They should’ve announced it, but they never did. Actually, they never seem to voluntarily disclose <i>any</i> security bugs… there are <i>a lot</i> of verified, closed, undisclosed bugs on their HackerOne account.<p>* This is all in stark contrast to their security page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backblaze.com&#x2F;security.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backblaze.com&#x2F;security.html</a>) which makes many claims about best practices, and their blog &amp; social media which present a sense of radical openness. I used to like their blog, but it all feels so gross and dishonest to me now.<p>* Backblaze mislead users about PEK. The decryption key is sent to their server, and so is your password. The only way to restore data is to decrypt it on their servers first. It is not a zero-knowledge system. PEK data is not ‘inaccessible’ to them. They don’t care.<p>At face value (and I haven&#x27;t done any digging of my own) these all seem like valid reasons to distrust Backblaze. Not necessarily because they happened, but because of the way Backblaze has addressed them (read: apparently not)')
