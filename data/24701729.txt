Touch typing is an important skill and once it&#x27;s learned it&#x27;s with you forever. On a platform like this they can also practice reading and comprehension, and the teacher has a way to ensure that the reading material was indeed read. Ideally it&#x27;d be coupled with some comprehension questions to make sure the kid didn&#x27;t go on autopilot.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert in pedagogy though so take that with a grain of salt.')
