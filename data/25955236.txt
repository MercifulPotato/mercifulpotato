They force you to open the app with the icon, then use the main menu of the app on the other side of the screen to choose &quot;Quit Creative Cloud&quot; to then be presented with the following choices:\n(Cancel) (Quit) (Hide)\n&quot;Hide&quot; is highlighted and &quot;Quit&quot; is the one you just asked for. Perviously that step would pop up a nag screen begging you not to quit the app, but that no longer happens.<p>They are obviously testing various ways to become &quot;stickier&quot;. And with each iteration it gets more and more difficult to close. I just want my RAM back please!')
