You are getting a service, you are paying either directly or indirectly through ads.<p>Facebook wouldn&#x27;t be a thing if it were a paid product from get go. It&#x27;d probably even lose a major part of its user base if it became a paid product overnight.<p>Like i said, i would love if i can pay for a product i am benefiting from, but it&#x27;s not always possible.')
