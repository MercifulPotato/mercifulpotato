I love the simplicity of the site, but the way the links work for the results, I would expect that clicking on the license type would filter by that license rather than bring me to the license itself. It would be cool if those links acted like a filter, but were also accompanied by something like a question mark or info button that would bring me to the definition in case I needed it.')
