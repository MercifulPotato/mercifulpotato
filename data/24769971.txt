Item(by='powersnail', descendants=None, kids=[24772435], score=None, time=1602620987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24768820, text='I have a feeling that the concept of TV will be phased out.<p>There will be iPhone, iPad, iOS-based computer, iDesk, iWall, and finally, an iHouse.<p>You wake up to a big ceiling made out of ceramic-enhanced scratch-resistent glass screen, which artificially has emulated sunrise, so your experience of waking up is natural and absolutely amazing. Siri greets you, plays you a song, and while you brush your teeth, calmly tells you about your day, which is of course planned by an intelligent algorithm powered by the latest A42 neural chip.<p>Bacon is crispy, and eggs are tender. What a breakfast prepared by iChef! Not to mention the special sauce that is part of your weekly gourmet discovery program. Just savory.<p>The wall is playing you your morning news.<p>&quot;What day is it today?&quot; asked Siri, cheerfully. &quot;It&#x27;s Apple Event&#x27;s day!&quot;<p>Phew, for a second there, you thought Siri has asked you a real question. Turns out it&#x27;s just rhetoric.<p>The new A43 chip is going to blow A42 out of the water. The trade-in program is amazing.<p>You look around the house, and the iWall looked bleak. The screen contrast-ratio on iChef is lacking. Your iToothbrush doesn&#x27;t have a speaker as booming as the one in the advertisement.<p>&quot;Hey, Siri. I&#x27;d like pre-order the new iHouse package!&quot;<p>&quot;Of course. Do you want to enroll in the trade-in program to exchange your current iHouse with a discount.&quot;<p>&quot;Yes, please.&quot;<p>&quot;Done.&quot;<p>A month later, the trade-in team has taken away the iHouse, yet the new iHouse isn&#x27;t there. There has been a delay; the iHouse was supposed to be transported by the Pixel automatic railway, but Google just cut the project last week, so everything is stuck in warehouse for now.<p>&quot;Damn it!&quot;<p>You cursed, reflected, and walked into a Samsung shop.')
