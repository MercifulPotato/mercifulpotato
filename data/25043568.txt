Thank you.<p>&gt; <i>Without naval power, China has almost uncontested control</i><p>The United States has bases in the region. Large bases. They&#x27;re not configured to pack a strike group&#x27;s firepower. But there&#x27;s no reason they couldn&#x27;t be.<p>&gt; <i>hypersonic antiship missiles, for a great many reasons, only work very well against large, slow-maneuvering ships</i><p>Large, slow, surface ships will go the way of the battleship when hypersonic anti-ship missile technology matures. (Unless missile defense does something unexpected.) That doesn&#x27;t mean other modes haven&#x27;t been discussed. (Swarms being the concept <i>du jour</i>.)<p>&gt; <i>offensive options are more than sufficient using purely air and missile power over the South China Sea</i><p>Planes and missiles don&#x27;t hold territory. Denying large Chinese ships their coast significant curtails their force projection capability onto their neighbors.')
