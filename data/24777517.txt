From my POV I don&#x27;t really care who wins but I think my preference leans to Trump. That has mostly to do with the Democrats being overly populistic about all the concerns, without offering any solutions. If you push through the endless barrage of misinformation from both sides, it does seem that the conservatives have a better understanding on how to progress the USA in a reasonable manner.<p>Unfortunately, in the online, and also in the educated world, this is an incredibly unpopular opinion. I&#x27;ve been labeled a racist, xenophobe, women-hater, and bigot so many times, it&#x27;s a bit stale by now.<p>I&#x27;m pro-choice, I&#x27;m pro-guns, I love science, I think the Trump administration royally messed up the COVID-19 response, and I also think anyone in his stead would have done a terrible job (albeit slightly better from an advisory POV). Still, a Democratic POTUS wouldn&#x27;t get any of the Republican voters to listen to them. So that would&#x27;ve ended in disaster as well.<p>Trump is a vile person. But from the two available options, he&#x27;s the lesser of two evils. I&#x27;ve grown up being a left-wing ideologist and I consider myself a centrist today. It just took people like AOC to push me all the way over into the realm of, well, not falling victim to populist rhetoric that is based in the realm of fantasy.<p>By that I mean, of course, her ridiculous Green New Deal plan. Luckily a plan that Biden doesn&#x27;t support, his one redeeming quality from the last debate.')
