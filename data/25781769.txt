There is one exception. There is a small percentage of far-right and wealthy that largely ignores social distancing, in my experience.<p>It does make sense though overall. The wealthier you are the more likely you are to have a significantly more comfortable living experience that makes social distancing more bearable. More access to food&#x2F;grocery delivery, more access to entertainment and technology, more access to at home recreation&#x2F;exercise equipment, more space in your home or the financial means to change that. The list could go on.<p>In short money buys you space and things to fill your time alone.')
