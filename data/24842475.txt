The best ones for capture maybe different, but this is what I recall for analog NTSC playback. S-Video connectors, if you can get them may help, but not always.<p>If I were going green-field the design of a VHS&#x2F;S-VHS VCR from scratch today, I use some sort of solid-state helical-scan-equivalent head that can over-capture tape domains, pre-process data to align scan lines per PAL or NTSC, and output unencrypted HDMI.')
