[...]  Some are still working their way through the distros [...]<p>Can you back this up ?<p>Because I can back this up that this is not the case.<p>* Neither Chromium nor Firefox properly support wayland yet and have a lot of bugs. Fedora ships a patched version of Firefox to workaround some of these issues, so does arch, but none of this is properly fixed. Chromium-dev + patches does not handle multiple displays with different resolution (text is in the wrong position, toolboxes are wrong), it is not able to share a full screen (shows up as black), etc.<p>* Emacs does not support Wayland yet. Some users have some patches no enable GTK3 wayland support, but these work badly with Wayland&#x2F;Sway, not properly recognizing input devices (e.g. Delete key recognized as Backspace is the classic bug for this). Users using these have to remap their keyboards every time they start emacs.<p>* Point us to one Electron app with Wayland support please. Just one. Go ahead. I&#x27;ll go sit down, and wait, in case you need to wait for any to be released, maybe next year, or the year after that. Whatever the &quot;Year of Wayland&quot; in the Linux desktop will be.<p>* Can you share a screen shot of the Zoom or Webex videoconferencing software (the native packages) on Sway sharing monitors ? If not, don&#x27;t worry. Can you share a screen shot of using their crappy web versions through any official browser release (unpatched) sharing full monitors through screen sharing?')
