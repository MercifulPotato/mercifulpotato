Historical data from Argentina, Israel and Denmark show significant reductions in death rates when doctors go on strike. The last strike was in the 1960&#x27;s and I have been repeatedly promised (by doctors) that &quot;..it is different now..&quot;<p>We have also noted a quite dramatic reduction of cancer diagnoses because of reduced screening for breast- and gyn cancer. The common wisdom among &quot;experts&quot; is that there is a large number of undiscovered cases which will show up later and with much more severe and deadly cancer in the months and years ahead. I doubt this. I have read a couple of the research papers defining guidelines for interpretation of pathological finds and they state explicitly that it is better to &quot;overdiagnose&quot; by at least a factor of 10 (and in reality up to a factor of 50) in order to not miss any &quot;real&quot; cases of cancer. Better to cut nine healthy breasts or prostates than to have one undiagnosed case.<p>Well, in just a couple of years we will have clear and unambigous evidence for or against the efficency of the cancer screening programs. This is a form of full scale clinical trial happening in front of our eyes.&quot;<p>And<p>&quot;Oh, todays newspaper say it is 75k less surgeries in Sweden since Mar -20.&quot;')
