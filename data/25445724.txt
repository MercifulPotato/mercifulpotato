Brave has never inserted affiliate links into any content. What you may be referring to was the offering of affiliate links within the suggestions-dropdown in the browser itself. We wrote about this back in June of this year: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com&#x2F;referral-codes-in-suggested-sites&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com&#x2F;referral-codes-in-suggested-sites&#x2F;</a>.<p>When a user searched (e.g. &#x27;binance&#x27;), the browser would check to see if an affiliate link existed. If it did, it would be displayed as a suggested URL. If the user were to press Enter at that point, they would be sent to the domain, with Brave&#x27;s affiliate code in tow. We did make a mistake, however. We unintentionally matched against a fully-qualified URL as well (e.g. binance.us). We were able to fix that within a couple of days, however.<p>This is not in any way &quot;sketchy&quot;. Open Firefox, Opera, Vivaldi, or Edge and perform a search for &quot;Hacker News&quot;. You&#x27;ll note that in Firefox, and Opera (IIRC) you&#x27;re sent to Google with an affiliate-identifier in the URL. In Edge and Vivaldi, I believe you&#x27;re sent to Bing, but with the same type of identifier.')
