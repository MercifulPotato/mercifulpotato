My Canon EOS R and L lens may look great in 60fps through an HDMI capture card, but what point is there when it&#x27;s still going to be a 24fps 360p[0] video stream on Zoom even if I choose the HD option? Sure, the pandemic is somewhat to blame[1], but I&#x27;m just using Zoom as an example.<p>Google Meet goes up to 720p maximum.[2]<p>Google Duo doesn&#x27;t do 1080p unless you&#x27;re on a Samsung S20. Not even Pixels suppoprt it.[3]<p>WhatsApp does great 1080p video calls on your phone (I think? I haven&#x27;t verified this), but you can&#x27;t make video calls on desktop clients.<p>Skype seems to be the only consumer-facing free cloud video conferencing tool that will do 1080p and look good, but I haven&#x27;t tried in years -- the redesign and general clunkiness drove me (and everyone else, seemingly) away from it. I can&#x27;t believe support for 1080p video calls in 2020 is like looking for a needle in a haystack.<p>I stumbled upon TrueConf[4], and might give them a go with my setup to see if I can get an actual 2020-esque video call going between my family. TrueConf appears to be self-hosted, which I guess is why there&#x27;s no restriction on quality (takes bandwidth and transcoding out of the picture for the service provider, so zero cost per call.) Although this may be great for me, it&#x27;s certainly not for the average joe, so the aforementioned industry-wide issues still need to be addressed and quite frankly I find it embarrassing that we have such low quality video calls in 2020.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;h88yrdu2gu9kh59&#x2F;zoom.png?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;h88yrdu2gu9kh59&#x2F;zoom.png?dl=0</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.zoom.us&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;207347086-Group-HD" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.zoom.us&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;207347086-Group-HD</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;u74x9g89mtts6ho&#x2F;meet.png?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;u74x9g89mtts6ho&#x2F;meet.png?dl=0</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gsmarena.com&#x2F;google_duo_will_be_integrated_into_the_galaxy_s20s_dialer_supporting_1080p_video_calls-news-41490.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gsmarena.com&#x2F;google_duo_will_be_integrated_into_...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trueconf.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trueconf.com&#x2F;</a>')
