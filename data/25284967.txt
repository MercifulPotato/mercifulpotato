The carriers were pretty bad before smartphones, now it&#x27;s Android+iOS.<p>Large entities can play all sorts of games like forcing their buyers into exclusivity, requiring them to not carry competitive devices all sorts of things.<p>Microsoft is a classic example with Office: they can integrate their software into their OS in a manner they don&#x27;t afford to competitors, thereby leveraging their OS monopoly, into other monopolies, which in the long run is bad for business.<p>Platforms have an inherent aspect to them which makes us want to have fewer players, but there still should be more diversity.<p>Remember feature phones? There were plenty of choices. And buying one, did not lock you into the next one. They were not &#x27;platforms&#x27; there were 1000 varieties even if there were some &#x27;big players&#x27; (ie Nokia).<p>There are actually some consumer benefits when vertical integration is done well, and there is pricing competition - which is why I think that the <i>desktop</i> market is fair.<p>Apple is being a &#x27;good capitalist&#x27; on the Mac side - great innovation - and choice.<p>The issue with Facebook is an entirely different issue, I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s one of &#x27;anti competitive&#x27; behaviour - the real issue is a little bit political and it&#x27;s about the control of information, liability, content filtering, &#x27;truth&#x27; etc.. That&#x27;s where that discussion is focused.<p>If I were &#x27;Capitalist God&#x27; I wouldn&#x27;t break up Apple but I would force them to allow open distribution of apps, while allowing certain measures for security, and of course, transportability of personal data from all apps, all vendors, including Apple. Similarly to Google with their services and Android.<p>With Facebook and content, requiring them to have a completely independant panel for content filtering, with some kind of objective oversight (like a board, but not corporate), where FB gets to set pretty much any policy they want, but that Board&#x2F;Panel ensures that there&#x27;s fair and consistent application of those policies to the content.<p>Much like Banks are regulated: they have to have &#x27;firewalls&#x27; between their buy and sell side operations to avoid conflict of interest.<p>Finally, some rules about channel ownership and exclusivity - so that Apple&#x2F;Android can&#x27;t join in with AT&amp;T&#x2F;Verizon to basically cut every little other vendor in the world out.<p>Honestly, what I just described just as an example is not deeply interventional, and it would allow those businesses to thrive mostly the same while giving users more choice, privacy, allow business to set their own content guidelines and wash their hands of politicians thinking &#x27;their party is treated unfairly&#x27; because it&#x27;s literally and independent body doing the filtering equitably, and it would let smaller players with actually decent products into the playing field.')
