The spectator is asked to think of a card and then place their finger on the magician&#x27;s screen - after a few seconds, their selected card magically materializes into view. So far I&#x27;ve been trying it on family and friends and it&#x27;s been getting great reactions. Disclaimer: you probably would want to have a little bit of card trick experience for the app to be useful.<p>Apple: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;card-mind-reader&#x2F;id1548145803" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;card-mind-reader&#x2F;id1548145803</a><p>Google: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.carddisplay.magic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.carddispla...</a>')
