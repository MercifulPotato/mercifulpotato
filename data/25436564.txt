The reason is that we were updating the game on last-gen consoles until the very last minute, and we thought we’d make it in time. [...] That was not intended; we were just fixing the game until the very last moment.<p>This is absurd. They didn&#x27;t hide console footage because they were sure they&#x27;d miraculously turn around the entire game at the last second; they hid it because they didn&#x27;t want people to see it so they could have massive launch day sales. If you&#x27;re going to apologize just apologize. Don&#x27;t pretend it was some innocent oversight.')
