Item(by='morrvs', descendants=None, kids=[24918124], score=None, time=1603853535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914339, text='True, we should respect all the resources of a device, at best. Also true for desktop (Slack&#x27;s memory usage comes to mind).<p>A major result of the study is greatly reduced bandwidth (and consequently, shorter parse time) compared to the original TeuxDeux, so I&#x27;m working towards respecting these resources, for what it&#x27;s worth.<p>To be clear, the study does not care about doing SPAs or not. The results are applicable to server-rendered HTML as well (write a function that enable some behavior on an element, mount by class name, done). I agree that many use cases (e.g. blogs) should mostly be server-rendered and only progressively enhanced with JS for some UX improvements.<p>But highly interactive apps (drag &amp; drop just being one example) will <i>not</i> have comparable UX without client-side rendering. I do not want a 100-1000ms delay (or an error message) after dropping an item in some list because of a server-roundtrip. This is not good UX.<p>Also, when filling out a form, I do <i>not</i> want to lose data or context when clicking submit while I&#x27;m in a tunnel. I&#x27;d rather have a client-side rendered UI that keeps my context and tells me &quot;Sorry, try again when you&#x27;re connected again&quot;.<p>Even better if it works fully offline and syncs the transactions I&#x27;ve done with a backend once I&#x27;m connected again.')
