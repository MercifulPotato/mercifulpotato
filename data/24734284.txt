If some people use the term to mean something else then perhaps it just means that they do not fully understand the words they use.<p>Certainly threats are not free speech. Insults may indeed be considered free speech, but it&#x27;s hard to argue that insults used in the way described in the law being discussed (which is about <i>serious insults</i> and <i>threats</i> to people <i>while they&#x27;re working</i>) can serve any useful purpose including in terms of expressing one&#x27;s opinion.<p>Note that in France this applies to anyone performing a &quot;public service&quot; so you would also in principle be committing an offence by insulting a bus driver.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is unwarranted or excessive. Free speech is very important but, at least in Europe, people think that this does not give you the right to insult the police, bus drivers, firemen, teachers, etc. to their face while they&#x27;re working.<p>I note further than in the US &quot;fighting words, &quot;threatening the President&quot;, &quot;obscenities&quot;, and &quot;true threats&quot; are not protected under free speech.')
