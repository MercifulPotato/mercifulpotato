Item(by='quietbritishjim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603199143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24833523, text='&gt; The entire purpose of emotions is that they are they only place where human motivation comes from.<p>I agree that this is literally true, but only so long as you include intellectual curiosity as an &quot;emotion&quot;. In fact I would count it as an emotion, exactly for the reason that you said - ultimately all human motivation can only be explained by emotion - combined with the fact that clearly most people and even some animals do some things solely out of curiosity. Just like all emotions, curiosity exists because its presence increases your chances of survival (having hunger at the right time decreases your chances of dying due to lack of food, having curiousity at the right time decreases your chances of dying due to lack of knowledge of the environment). Of course it&#x27;s a lot weaker than other emotions (e.g. if a furious lion is running towards you but has a very strange spot on its nose, you&#x27;re probably going to run away rather than investigate).<p>All that sounds like supreme pedantry, but it&#x27;s important due to this other thing you said:<p>&gt; everyone argues from an emotional perspective<p>I think most people reading this sentence would interpret the word &quot;emotional&quot; here in a subtly different way: to exclude intellectual curiousity. The implication is therefore &quot;no one ever really argues because they&#x27;re just curious about the truth&quot;. I agree with the literal meaning of this sentence, but not with that interpretation of &quot;emotion&quot;, and not with that conclusion.<p>I&#x27;m sure I see this sort of mix up a lot: two statements that both sound completely reasonable on their own, but use the same word with a subtly but critically different meaning, forcing you to draw a conclusion (because you can&#x27;t disagree with either part individually) that isn&#x27;t really true.')
