Friendly NPC left behind in mission area which was scripted to become inaccessible. Couldn&#x27;t reach the NPC to finish the mission.\n2. Killed an NPC two times: once in a side mission and once in a main mission\n3. The player goes to sleep perpendicular to the bed and with the bottom half side of the body outside the bed.\n4. Friendly NPCs start to shout randomly during stealth missions.\n5. There&#x27;s no driving AI, all machines follow predefined paths sometimes going through one another as if there&#x27;s no collision.<p>And probably lots more I didn&#x27;t remember. And these exclude the physics and rendering bugs and I encounter every 5 minutes.')
