There are two app stores of consequence. Google just nuked free speech supporting Parler from their app store for example, trying to force them into ideological censorship compliance.<p>When aggressive monopolies are doing the censoring in tandem, it&#x27;s identical to an act of violence by the companies in question as there are not reasonable other channels left. It stops being a matter of a stray private corporation merely controlling how its property is used and becomes a matter for the government to defend the people being assaulted.<p>Monopolies are always ultimately a matter of force and the sole way to deal with them short-term is to call upon the government to use its legal powers to stop the violent monopolists.<p>A coup definitely occurred the other day, just not the one the laughable headlines proclaim (&#x27;unmasked, unarmed man in buffalo hat and jeans conquers US Government in daring toppling of superpower!&#x27;); rather, by big tech over speech. They&#x27;ve all been waiting for this moment of convenience (it&#x27;s a Patriot Act kind of moment). From here on out they&#x27;ll unabashedly use their co-monopoly over everything online to dictate speech.<p>Quick question for everyone on HN: who actually seized power given our present context? The clown in the buffalo hat, or the billion &amp; trillion dollar corporations that control most of the channels of communication? Now that that power move is taken care of some of the interested parties in the government will put the companies to work on more interesting privacy-destroying tasks.')
