This can quickly become a heavy financial burden if enough people do it.<p>You could factor that into the price, but then you&#x27;re potentially making the price point even more unattractive to users than it already is, and users that are responsible with their budgets would be subsidizing those that aren&#x27;t. Not a very workable solution.<p>I&#x27;d say a good solution is giving customers the option to stop accruing more storage capacity, and to have a max deadline accounted for in their budget to store data (basically each customer decides whether or not to pay for a grace period).')
