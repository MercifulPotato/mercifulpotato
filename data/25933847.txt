They know it&#x27;s wild. They know it&#x27;s gambling. They know there will be bagholders. There were also plenty of savvy people on this early, understanding the bull case that Michael Burry pointed out and the potential for a short squeeze.<p>It was the hedge funds who went <i>over 100%</i> short who were foolish here, not the momentum trading WSB crowd who helped cause the squeeze.<p>The interviewer and just about everyone else I&#x27;ve heard are missing the squeeze part of this. Yes, GME isn&#x27;t worth $20+ billion. But Volkswagen shouldn&#x27;t have been the most valuable company in the world in 2008, but it was. Short squeezes are just part of the market. Good on WSB for piling in.')
