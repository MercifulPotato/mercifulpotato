Item(by='cosmie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609871131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25648132, text='&gt; has access to everything else<p>Everything else _that&#x27;s on my computer_.<p>The person with access to my camera has access to observe the environment my computer is in. My WFH setup is in my bedroom - I don&#x27;t want to be paranoid that my company (or a random IT employee at my company) can use my computer as an incognito candid camera at a whim by remotely activating it and suppressing any visible indications that it&#x27;s activated.<p>Manual shutters ensure that you definitively know if it&#x27;s even _capable_ of viewing&#x2F;recording you. Automated shutters at least can provide re-assurance at a glance if it&#x27;s active (or capable of being activated) at that point in time. An indicator light that may or may not be capable of being manually suppressed means you have no reassurance at all about whether you&#x27;re being visually observed any time your laptop is open and powered on, which can be stressful.<p>I can shut it and turn it off at night when I&#x27;m not working to provide reassurance that it can&#x27;t record me when I&#x27;m not working, but my room is a shared space where there are plenty of things that happen in it while I _am_ working that I wouldn&#x27;t want captured, such as my SO in bed behind me if I start work before she gets up, or her coming in to change during the day or get dressed after a bath&#x2F;shower.<p>The abrupt shift to WFH over the past year is likely one of the drivers of it being such a hot trend for business laptops. Many people I know and work with have don&#x27;t have dedicated home offices, and have similarly resorted to repurposing shared spaces to work from (bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, etc), and likely have similar concerns about maintaining their personal privacy as much as possible.')
