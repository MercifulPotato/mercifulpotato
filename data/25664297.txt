Will things then be better than the &quot;best&quot; case scenario?<p>There&#x27;s two lag factors to consider. The first is the lag between restrictions and cases dropping, this takes a couple of weeks and cases and the growth isn&#x27;t likely to even slow for 1 week. The second is the lag between infections and people getting seriously sick and needing hospitalization, that takes 3-4 weeks. There&#x27;s also the serious possibility that the restrictions arn&#x27;t strict enough to make a big difference.<p>This scenario is basically baked in, avoiding it required action weeks earlier.')
