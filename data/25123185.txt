Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605617849, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121761, text='&gt; It&#x27;s not &quot;yellow peril&quot; or &quot;Orientalism&quot; to criticise China or its foreign policy.<p>I did not use &quot;yellow peril&quot; or &quot;orientalism&quot;, I used &quot;ignorance&quot;. I&#x27;m not opposed to criticism of China or it&#x27;s foreign policy, I&#x27;m opposed to <i>getting the facts wrong</i>.<p>You say that &quot;no power is doing anything of substance about China expanding and laying a tacit claim out to the nine dash line&quot;, which I assume means you are ignorant of the many cases of other countries&#x27; coast guards attacking Chinese fishing boats (as linked in other comments), Vietnam subsidizing fishers specifically for fishing in Chinese-controlled but Vietnamese-claimed waters (as mentioned in the article) or the US Navy&#x27;s &quot;freedom of navigation&quot; operations (also mentioned in the article).<p>There&#x27;s a narrative circulating in right-wing Chinese blogs that the US plans to use its network of military bases and client states across the western Pacific to neutralize the Chinese fleet while simultaneously launching a land-based invasion across the Korean peninsula and amphibious assaults all along the coast. Hopefully you realize that that&#x27;s quite an absurd scenario and just a transparent excuse to call for greater military spending.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s absurd to claim that there&#x27;s no opposition to Chinese expansionism, while the overall media consensus is one of opposition and there are many instances where such opposition manifested as actual physical violence.<p>Talking up how strong your enemies are and how no one can stop them is one of the oldest tricks in the military propaganda book. Julius Caesar wrote about how strong and dangerous the Gauls were before he went and conquered all of their territory.')
