I don’t think pycharm can fix the entire packaging ecosystem.<p>So, fair... it’s not perfect; but compared to what? Have you used tools with better support, better stability? Better tooling?<p>It’s a pretty high bar to clear to say the editor isn’t completely perfect.<p>Yeah yeah, it uses Java, it eats your ram and the cpu can go crazy, sometimes you need to reset the cache or delete your entire .idea folder.<p>Eh.<p>I also wish it was better at some things, but I still love it; what’s the alternative? Visual studio? Hahaha~~~~')
