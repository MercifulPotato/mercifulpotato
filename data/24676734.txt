Like, you can use red, blue, yellow, purple, and black for lines on a graph before you even need to find an additional color like green.<p>I don&#x27;t see this advice getting much uptake.<p>First, green isn&#x27;t a second thought for people with normal vision. It&#x27;s a first thought. I can understand how this wouldn&#x27;t be true if, to you, it didn&#x27;t exist.<p>Second, the color space without green is harder to draw contrasts in than the color space with green.<p>Third, a friend of mine with red&#x2F;green colorblindness always complained that he couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between blue (&quot;rare&quot;) and purple (&quot;epic&quot;) items in World of Warcraft. (WoW has since solved this problem by throwing out the concept of item quality entirely, but the colors are still there anyway.)<p>So you&#x27;re advising that people should make a quite unnatural choice, which will markedly reduce usability for almost everyone, but which won&#x27;t actually solve the problem for the colorblind. It&#x27;s just not a move that makes sense.')
