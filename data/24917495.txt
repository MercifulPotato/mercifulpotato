The experience of using a native app is substantially superior to web&#x2F;electron.\n2. Figma has done an amazing job of building features to support teams and organizations.<p>I used to use Sketch, and now I use Figma. Do I wish Figma had a native macOS app? Absolutely. Would it be better than the web&#x2F;electron app? Definitely.<p>Native vs web isn&#x27;t a <i>feature</i> differentiation - it&#x27;s a matter of user experience (responsiveness), platform integration (filesystem, native controls, accessibility, iCloud), and delivery (App Store vs download). As a company, the choice boils down to: &quot;Are you going to spend <i>more</i> resources supporting multiple platforms but delivering the best possible experience? Or are you going to spend <i>fewer</i> resources to ship an inferior experience faster?&quot;.<p>I do enjoy Figma, but it&#x27;s worth calling out that they&#x27;re compromising on user experience by going the Electron route. Yes, I know that maintaining a Swift version of Figma alongside the web version would be tough, but they&#x27;re not an under-resourced team and I believe they could make it happen.')
