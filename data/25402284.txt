That&#x27;s a very reasonable and correct form of skepticism.<p>The lazy assumption that anyone who claims to be scientific actually is has been exploited by demagogues throughout history. Karl Marx was famously keen on presenting his own views as &#x27;scientific&#x27; although there is of course nothing scientific about Marxism. Lysenko justified his beliefs on the grounds that they were scientific, and all sceptics of this claim were suppressed (i.e. jailed).<p>The way to tackle scepticism about the scientific method is to recognise that it&#x27;s not scepticism of a methodology but an academic sub-culture.')
