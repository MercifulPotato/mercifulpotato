They&#x27;re past denial, they literally build up stories of master strokes, tho all of them were mega failures.\nWe have a PM who is afraid of press conferences, who only speaks on his own air time. Never takes questions. I sometimes watch the comments under news channel sites they&#x27;re a cesspool of hatred.')
