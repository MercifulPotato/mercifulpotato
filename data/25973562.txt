Or indie games or business apps in general.<p>Also, all those services prevent you from sharing with friends for their business reasons, meaning absolutely no coop or splitscreen.<p>Anyway, the key for making such services work is custom ultra low latency udp protocols. I&#x27;m going with nvenc hardware encoding, cuda for data wrangling, and a boost::asio based c++ core for the network layer. That, and controlling packet loss, for example by self-throttling and spacing to avoid overflows at intermediate relays.<p>BTW, I&#x27;m surprised by the bandwidth numbers in the article. Even fast explosion heavy games like BroForce work reasonably well with 5mbit&#x2F;s if you use h265.')
