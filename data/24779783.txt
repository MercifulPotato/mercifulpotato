Often a Big Lie, but <i>always</i> simple, clear, and heavily repeated.<p>- Targeted propaganda pits individuals (or identifiable, but small, market segments, against an extensive data store (past behaviours, activities, and behavioural models), <i>and</i> machine intelligence.  The individual is pitted against trillion-dollar corporations or state actors, yottabyte-sized data stores, and predictive and AI behavioural models.<p>With macropropaganda <i>at least the message is publicly evident</i>.  With micropropaganda <i>it may be impossible to determine what is or isn&#x27;t manipulation</i> as well as <i>what manipulations are targeted as which individuals or groups.</i><p>The targeting element of micropropaganda still pressumes some sort of targeting. To take an example, Cambridge Analytica would have been much less successful if it had to, say, pull data from 100s of individual ISPs&#x27; personal home pages, email and chat logs, and inconsistent data formats and standards.  Facebook&#x27;s one-stop shopping of users, activity logs, data standards, and integrated activity across a wide range of services <i>and</i> third-party site integration, created CA&#x27;s opportunity.<p>The messaging may not be centralised, but the enabling infrastructure must be.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toot.cat&#x2F;@dredmorbius&#x2F;105024594626128707" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toot.cat&#x2F;@dredmorbius&#x2F;105024594626128707</a><p>Adding to that:<p>The observation that medium shapes messaging isn&#x27;t new (see McLuhan), but is worthwhile.  Network topology, scale, directedness, and other characteristics, drive and dictate possible interactions.  It&#x27;s not accidental that radio pioneers borrowed <i>both</i> the name <i>and</i> business model of farmers;  broad-casting seeds into a fertile medium and harvesting the returns through bulk and undifferentiated mechanical processes.<p>As I&#x27;ve noted elsewhere, the <i>specific defining property</i> of propaganda is intent serving a cause.  Accidental memes are <i>viral</i>, but unless coopted, not themselves propagantistic.  In Dawkins&#x27; conception, such memes selfishly serve only themselves.')
