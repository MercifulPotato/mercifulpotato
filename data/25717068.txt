One example of ToS could also be the house rules in your local gym, which possibly weren&#x27;t even handed out to you but instead they are up on a wall somewhere near the front desk. The important thing is that you need to have the _possibility_ to read them (if you are blind they will need to make sure there is a workaround). Depending on the circumstances the obligation to make sure that you are aware of the ToS can be more strict.<p>The important caveat to using terms of services as a company is a strict content control. § 307-309 of the german civil law define certain things that you cannot possibly put in your ToS. And if a company still does it, a Court will not try to interpret the rule in a favorable way for them, they will strike it out completely. (no &quot;geltungserhaltende Reduktion&quot;)<p>Examples of content control include that when buying something it is impossible to sign away (some of) your rights as a consumer for a faulty product. But there are also some &quot;catch-all&quot; clauses in there that will check whether parts of the ToS placed an unfair burden on you as a consumer.<p>ToS can also be void if they are unclearly written.<p>Edit: Signing with &quot;I do not agree&quot; is an interesting approach and sometimes these &quot;hacks&quot; can actually work in Court. That being said, it would probably not hold up. Pressing on &quot;accept&quot; is not somehow invalid just because you said so somewhere else.<p>Off topic but an interesting example of a similar hack is this case of a man changing a pre formulated contract with his bank which they send to him first and then signed it when he had send it back to him. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themoscowtimes.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;14&#x2F;man-who-outwitted-bank-ends-700k-lawsuit-a26770" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themoscowtimes.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;14&#x2F;man-who-outwitted-...</a>')
