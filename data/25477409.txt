In a memo issued Friday [Dec 11], CD Projekt — the parent company of developer CD Projekt Red — said that its revenue from digital pre-order sales alone exceeds all of Cyberpunk 2077’s production costs and all of the company’s marketing and promotional costs for the game this year.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.polygon.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;11&#x2F;22170468&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077-sales-revenue-cd-projekt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.polygon.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;11&#x2F;22170468&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077-s...</a><p>CDPR said they had 8 million preorders, and Steamspy is saying 10-20 million copies sold on Steam alone.  The game industry has been growing quite quickly the past decade so it maybe isn&#x27;t that surprising that they are certainly in the top 50 best selling games of all time already and could be in the top 20.  It seems likely they will make quite a lot of money even with issues.  Sony has a new more capable system to sell anyone disappointed with the performance of the old one so I&#x27;m thinking they will do quite well also and both of them are just playing up the issues for free media attention.<p>The game industry is strange, buy at release and you usually get a low quality product.  Wait a year and not only will it work much better but you have a good chance of getting it 50% off as well.')
