This wave gets upvoted heavily to sit at the top.<p>So when you and I arrive 9 hours after the drama, we&#x27;ll see the top X comments either complaining about a slant that is now down-voted, or up-voted comments being reflective of the true biases of HN.<p>That&#x27;s basically what happened here.... it&#x27;s not that the pro-authoritarian comments are naturally shallow, is that they were merely the first comments posted in the first <i>seconds</i> after the article was posted, and are just reflexive since no one reads an article in seconds. If we post an article with a pro-authoritarian title, we&#x27;ll get a wave of reflexive anti-authoritarian comments too.')
