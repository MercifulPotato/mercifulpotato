This intrigued me at first glance as a fun typing exercise, as I&#x27;ve always struggled with typing - I started using computers way before they started teaching typing around here, so my typing is far from the optimal 10 finger method, but I&#x27;ve always found typing exercises mind numbingly boring.<p>However, as I started typing The call of Cthulhu, I&#x27;m now much more intrigued by this as a new way to read books. It is a very different literary experience from just simply reading. I&#x27;m way more attentive to the text itself, rather than just the meaning, if that makes sense. Though it&#x27;s very possible that this effect is going to go away as I get more used to it.<p>Any chance of typing out custom uploaded books? Maybe copy pasted plaintext?<p>Also kudos on the execution, the site is really nicely made.')
