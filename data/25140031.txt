First there is a non invasive test that can be done to evaluate if the foetus is &quot;at risk&quot; of Downs. Then there is a  sampling one that is very specific. Basically counting the chromosomes. But the catch is that the specific test carries a risk to the pregnancy - so it&#x27;s not applied without cause. As well as  the sensitivity issue in the article there is also a specificity issue.<p>My daughter was tested (non invasively) as at high risk of downs (the doctor said 50&#x2F;50) we decided we didn&#x27;t care... lo and behold: she doesn&#x27;t have downs. I don&#x27;t know enough about the area to make judgements, but I am definitely concerned that it&#x27;s not a slamdunk that the doctors are getting this right.<p>There is a huge agenda of control around pregnancy in the UK - our consultant was so arsey about us not doing the follow-up that I had to get him changed out (it later turned out that he was struck off 2 years later for more or less murdering a woman and child, but that&#x27;s another story).')
