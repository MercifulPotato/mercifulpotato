As a student in the 80s I remember them as an earnest, way too serious bunch of ideological zombies ranting into microphones at the Student&#x27;s Union about the latest crimes against humanity perpetrated by &#x27;Thatcher&#x27;. They&#x27;re the kind of people that come up to you in the street with leaflets about some atrocity in Africa and shout &quot;Would you murder children&quot; at you. I&#x27;m not entirely sure they&#x27;d recognise what an actual &#x27;Worker&#x27; was if they met one. I always found them quite comical.<p>However they are a serious party, they&#x27;re a highly motivated  and active movement with significant influence in the Labour Party grass roots. They&#x27;re sort of our equivalent of Antifa in that they are a significant organising presence in lefty street protests, but much more politically active and spend a lot of time in conferences and action committees wondering what Capitalism ever did for us.<p>Importantly, they are in no way shape or form a terrorist or criminal organisation. I would not be at all surprised if some ultra-violent or would-be Red Army Faction types joined or associated with them, but that&#x27;s not at all who the SWP are as an organisation. They&#x27;re the well meaning, impressionable white middle class girl next door with a class guilt complex and a side shave that&#x27;s been going to BLM protests.<p>If they are getting banned by Facebook something has gone horribly wrong. Quite possibly some of them got a bit excited and posted things they shouldn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m not saying this is for sure Facebook&#x27;s fault, but they&#x27;re not about to murder any bobbies in Parliament Square.')
