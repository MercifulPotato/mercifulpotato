The answer could be a &#x27;YES&#x27; because a company uses front-end TLS and pretends to not completely understand the ask.<p>In this case it is mostly the business either forcing security to bs or another group (Sales?) filling out the response untruthfully because they are loosing revenue if they&#x27;re honest.')
