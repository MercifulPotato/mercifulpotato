The system is built to be anonymous so finding evidence is not possible. The problem instead is people being on the roster when they shouldn’t. I know of 2 cases of this, one of which was in my immediate. Both instances an individual received a ballot but should not have. One of the individuals was not even a US citizen, yet they were registered to vote. Dems didn’t want voter IDs, don’t want voter reform because of “disenfranchisement”.')
