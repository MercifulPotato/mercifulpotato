It&#x27;s worsened by the fact that, for lots of gamers, gaming is their strongest form of escapism. But I think it also compounds with this tendenct for gaming to suffer from a lot of the same polarization that&#x27;s happening in politics. It&#x27;s like it gets at the same core part of your lizard brain.<p>Instead of Red vs Blue, it&#x27;s Green vs Blue (and Nintendo stands off to the side, having fun with its family in Wii Fit, and PC is in a basement garbed in dark blue worshiping GabeN and trying to summon HL3). And people will look the other way to an excessive degree while &quot;their&quot; team does bad stuff.<p>I will say that one thing gaming has that politics doesn&#x27;t is &quot;the only thing we hate as much as the other side is our side&quot;. Obviously even microsoft fanboys will be quick to turn on Microsoft if they do something obviously anti-gamer, since gamers also love to be victims.')
