It&#x27;s sort of aimed at a niche audience because imho you should know what everything in that guide does, or at least know how to look it up, before applying it.<p>Also I feel that the overhead added by not using systemd creates a lot of attack surface too. So that&#x27;s a difficult trade off to consider.<p>This is a rabbit hole of a debate but I&#x27;m interested in comparing the security trade offs of using for example RHEL with systemd where you get properly packaged SElinux policy for all your packages, and using Gentoo without systemd where you get no SElinux policy packaged at all and you have to write and maintain a bunch of init scripts.<p>(And before anyone chimes in, I know RHEL has had to make compromises in their SElinux packaging but at least it&#x27;s there and you have the option to build upon it)<p>I personally prefer having the systemd+selinux option over any alternative. Because ease of administration is also a factor that influences security in the long run.')
