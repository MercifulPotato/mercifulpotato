But think about why a cookbook of selected recipes <i>is</i> copyrightable even if the recipes individually aren&#x27;t.<p>&gt; And that&#x27;s what an API is. It&#x27;s a formal functional specification.<p>The problem for Google is the Java API is also <i>code</i>, which is generally copyrightable. You seem to be saying that since this particular code happens to form a specification it should be treated differently under copyright law, but I&#x27;m not sure the court would find that argument very convincing.')
