It makes it seem like MSNBC and OAN are equal and opposite. I consume news from a great many of these sources. The only actual leftist news source I recognize on here is Jacobin. The New Yorker and MSNBC don&#x27;t have a lot of content espousing the ideals of socialism and communism.<p>Meanwhile, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find any daylight between the news sources in the &quot;Right&quot; column and Trumpism.')
