The virus is not going to go away just because humanity is bored of it, or unhappy with it, or because we just have this desire to go back to some nostalgic definition of normal. Nature doesn&#x27;t respond to a macho &quot;I&#x27;m not afraid&quot; attitude.<p>We see this again and again with the re-openings (and then the inevitable follow-up re-closings). When the re-openings happen based on clear, measurable criteria being met, they have been more successful, but still not 100% successful. When they are based on this vague feeling of &quot;well, we have to get back to normal some time so why not now?&quot; then hospitalizations go up, deaths go up, and everyone goes &quot;surprised pikachu&quot; and businesses have to close again. When we look back, the proof will be in the pudding, and I believe we will find that the outbreak spikes are strongly correlated with repeated efforts to re-open too soon.')
