Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25218500], score=None, time=1606359475, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209255, text='&quot;Humans didnâ€™t appear out of a void of randomness&quot;<p>They did though, at least according to the materialist position which we now mostly accept as being &#x27;science&#x27;.<p>We basically define the universe &#x27;as having a bunch of rules, which can be modelled&#x27; - in which case ... there literally is no <i>life</i> or rather a &#x27;bag of random particles&#x27; (you) in a random environment, interacting according to some rules ... which is just net randomness.<p>A researcher once said that evolution is no more interesting than a rock rolling down a hill - and he&#x27;s right, from a materialist perspective. Nothing is &#x27;evolving&#x27; any more than the ball of wax in a lava lamp lumping together and apart - it&#x27;s just &#x27;stuff happening randomly&#x27;.<p>The problem with this materialist view when taken to it&#x27;s full extent, is that it completely denies the most important reality to us - that we are &#x27;life&#x27;. What we care about is the expression of life, we don&#x27;t write laws to protect &#x27;random bags of talking jelly&#x27; - our entire cultural foundation surrounds this notion of our being alive. And FYI - most common definitions of life exhibit this &#x27;consciousness&#x27; problem, in that they may use biological terms, reproduction, all of that, but it&#x27;s ultimately mechanical and materialist.<p>So scientific materialism essentially denies the existence life as we commonly understand it preemptively, causing some deep existential problems.<p>&#x27;The Problem With Physics&#x27; I think is not &#x27;Dark Matter&#x27; - it&#x27;s the fact that it really hasn&#x27;t brought us any closer to understanding what we actually are, which is <i>the</i> big question.<p>There is a movement called &#x27;emergence&#x27; which starts to move the needle on this, starting from a fairly material perspective but is ultimately metaphysical, at least it&#x27;s a start.')
