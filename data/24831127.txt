If you&#x27;re getting good at doing something you love because you love doing it so much, I don&#x27;t think &#x27;grind&#x27; is a word you&#x27;d use to describe that time consuming process.<p>I think &#x27;grind&#x27; is caused by a disconnect between what the learner is being made to do and what they want to do.  Grind can therefore be reduced by providing people with the opportunity to study things that interest them, for instance by offering a broader range of educational &#x27;tracks&#x27;, or by reformulating lesson plans to make the material more interesting (explaining the real world applications or consequences of the subject matter.)')
