The point I would make is you have to weigh the app experience in Nov 2020 against your expected experience for the rest of the life of the machine. I know people who&#x27;ve kept Macs running for nearly a decade (e.g. 2011 Macbook Air) and I&#x27;d strongly suspect 5 years from now a 2020 M1 Mac will be a lot more futureproof and app-compatible than a 2020 Intel Mac.<p>If your main concern is running Zoom and OneNote for the next 6 months, maybe sit out M1 for now.')
