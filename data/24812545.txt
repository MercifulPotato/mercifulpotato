Look within a given league at these long term effects &#x2F; organ damage &#x2F; health problems among those who recovered to rule out a lot of the self-selection or other variables.<p>To some of your other points, the high end leagues are quite well medically documented, and the individuals are quite healthy.<p>That said, it also appears for some individuals, initial “long term” damage (ongoing heart or liver problems three months after recovery) may be less or gone some six months in.<p>Seems answers are as yet by and large unresolved.  In situations where one does not yet know the actual risk, one may prefer an abundance of caution over unknown “calculated” risk given the long tail of possible effects.')
