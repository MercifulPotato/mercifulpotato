Similar to NodeJS which can handle 10K concurrent IO calls on a single thread, python releases the GIL on IO. So you can write pure python and have multi threading and have all the benefits of &quot;parallelism&quot; depending on whether or not python releases the GIL which it does with certain libraries and on IO.<p>For all else use multiprocessing.')
