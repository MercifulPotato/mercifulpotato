Have a light footprint on other people&#x27;s time &amp; communicate clearly and concisely. Make sure <i>you</i> understand the actual problem, and weigh in if you&#x27;re being asked to build a solution that doesn&#x27;t solve it well (there may also be good reasons you aren&#x27;t informed of about why it&#x27;s built that way).<p>It&#x27;s not <i>hard</i>. But it is <i>specific</i>. And trainable in yourself!<p>Most companies are variations on the same theme. And their dysfunctions are variations on the same problems.<p>&quot;Building the solution&quot; is table stakes. The real skillset for consulting is shadow-technical-PMing.<p>Remember: by definition, you&#x27;re parachuting into a company that wasn&#x27;t able to efficiently and effectively solve this problem themselves. So is it reasonable to expect <i>them</i> to tell <i>you</i> how to solve it? ;)')
