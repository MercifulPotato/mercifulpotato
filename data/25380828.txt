Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607647056, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25379892, text='&gt; Airbnb enabled a great range of people to see places they might have never afforded to see before. It managed to commoditize travelling in a similar way low-cost airlines did.<p>By running illegal hotels. It&#x27;s easy to be cheaper when you&#x27;re breaking the law. The whole thing is a criminal enterprise: without the crime, none of the rest of it works.<p>&gt;  Sure, the company made a good profit while there was a profit to make, but their service benefited consumers as well and I think it did leave a positive impact not only on the travellers but also on some of the communities that understood how to balance its pros and cons.<p>It benefited their clients at the expense of the surrounding communities. Even if you think the laws those communities set weren&#x27;t in their interests, they were the legitimate laws of those places. The price of living in a society is respecting the law even when you don&#x27;t agree with it, and AirBnB et al have been tearing that apart for the sake of their profits.')
