Doesn’t it already follow that bar’s TEXT needs to be at the same virtual address in every process?<p>Yes, and this is how the shared cache works. If you wish to map the shared cache elsewhere there would have to be another copy of it in memory, which is why this would be a massive pessimization if done without designing for it. Perhaps you might have some idea as to what would need to change to make this not be as bad.')
