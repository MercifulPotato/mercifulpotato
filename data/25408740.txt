Yes, no code is really self-documenting, but requirements documents, handbooks, documentation comments, VCS logs and tests should make it possible to elucidate weird code parts.<p>Bad comments are detrimental: some are outdated comments that were forgotten to remove or to update, and others were wrong or misleading to begin with. Some are just redundant (they might state the obvious) and might become misleading later on. Their existence is of historical interest in the best case.')
