And by your reasoning, then bullying shouldn&#x27;t exist today because the school policies should prevent it, yet it&#x27;s more rampant than ever.<p>I was bullied once. Eventually I fought back and gave the kid a bloody nose. Guess what - he was nicer to me <i>and to other kids too</i>. Prior to that he had no empathy. That experience changed him. I know others with similar experiences too.')
