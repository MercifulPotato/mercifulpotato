Implementing a comprehensive, fast test suite is up to the team to build, not AWS. Serverless is a tool like any other that needs to be used in a responsible manner.<p>If you&#x27;re using cloud features that geniunely cannot be tested locally or quickly I would reconsider using more stable technologies that are perhaps enhanced by your cloud provider instead of totally replaced by them. _You_ are responsible for creating a short feedback loop regardless of your deployment environment.<p>I&#x27;ve been using serverless in both GCP and AWS for many years now and have helped migrate mid sized startups onto those platforms for event processing and API build. In that time I&#x27;ve seen bills go from thousands of dollars to a few dollars a month.<p>Mid sized startups are now able to compete in data heavy fields precisely because of technologies like serverless that have enabled small teams to build scalable systems. When you work in transaction processing or analytics I think you&#x27;ll understand that scalability directly limits how many customers your platform can support.<p>Not everyone just makes simple json http endpoints.')
