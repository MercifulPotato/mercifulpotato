The blue on purple color scheme is a little hard on the eyes. Changing the blue lines and circles to #0f0 green helped a lot. (Green also has strong &quot;on&quot; semantics)<p>2. My SO and I both had trouble finding the trash can. We both tried to drag components back to the workbench or off of the mat to delete them. A larger trash can icon or just making it red might help.<p>3. I ran into some z-layering issues (at least on Firefox). Opening a component info bubble from the workbench displays under the mat. Also the &quot;results&quot; popup displays underneath any components that might be on the far side.<p>Overall great game though! I had a lot of fun with it. Thank you!')
