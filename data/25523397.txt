Most companies aren&#x27;t comparing AWS and MS in a vacuum when presented with the decision. How much of the world&#x27;s software runs on dotnet? Windows, Office, and Active Directory command their own predominant shares, not to mention other tools like CRM. MS earned a reputation for the battleship; relatively stable, plays nicely with their other products, LTS, backward compatibility, etc. Suppose the CTO for an insurance claims company is presented with the decision of migrating a legacy platform which already runs on a fat stack of MS products. They don&#x27;t even need a salesperson to convince them Azure is the obvious first choice, because to them it&#x27;s just another cannon on the battleship.<p>In my experience the tribal evangelism for AWS is... intense... and they&#x27;ve somehow convinced people to proselytize unpaid on their behalf. Having worked with both I&#x27;ll occasionally mention Azure if only to revel at the spicy takes. Honestly though, I worked at that claims company I mentioned. Likewise the startup I work at today threw their hats in with AWS. Both were respectively good decisions, both bad in their own right. As ever, try to do everything and something is going to give.')
