An attacker probably already has access to secrets, to the database, and all the assets worth protecting.<p>On the other hand, changing the docker user to non root might introduce some failure scenarios (eg file ownership) which might lead to other problems like availability incidents.<p>Security should start with threat modelling, and taking a risk-based approach. You can spend hours fearing that someone might break out of the Docker virtual machine through a zero day, instead of using that time to fix much more likely and plausible threat scenarios. Pick your battles.')
