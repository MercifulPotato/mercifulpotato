Phone-as-webcam was more trouble than it was worth, but it did get me playing with OBS for better control over exposure, white balance, gamma, etc.<p>From there I rigged up a couple of desk lights and clamp lights I had around for better lighting.  Then I got a cheap green sheet to replace the white sheet I&#x27;d hung behind me to hide the junk room I&#x27;ve been using as a temp office.  Then I hooked up a Shure mic to the old USB audio interface I used to have hooked up for messing with guitar.<p>So now I&#x27;ve got the best sound, lighting, and video-loop backgrounds of the team.  Yay? ;)')
