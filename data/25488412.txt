I feel like I can deliver these experiences through a browser using some clever tricks.<p>Going through my current project has really worn me out with regard to tolerating UX slowdowns in developer tools. I am getting so incredibly tired of how shitty visual studio performs on a threadripper with effectively infinity ram. I&#x27;ve had to turn off all of the nice features to get our codebase to be even remotely tolerable. And, dont get me wrong. This is not a plea to Microsoft to fix VS. I think everyone involved can agree that fundamentally VS will be unfixable WRT delivering what I would consider an &quot;ultra-low&quot; latency user experience (mouse&#x2F;keyboard inputs show on display in &lt;5ms). Any &quot;fixing&quot; is basically a complete rewrite with this new objective held in the highest regard.<p>Current developer experiences are like bad ergonomics for your brain. This madness needs to end. Our computers are more than capable. If you don&#x27;t believe me, go play Overwatch or CS:GO. At least 2 independently-wealthy development organizations have figured it out. Why stop there?')
