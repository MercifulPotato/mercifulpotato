So, what you need to do to use Hasura is to first lay out all the tables in Postgres, and then map those table schemas to GraphQL schema. Any changes to the schema would then need to be applied first to the Postgres instance, and then brought back to Hasura. Of course, Hasura has benefits in that if you&#x27;re already on Postgres and don&#x27;t want to move to another DB, then it makes for an easy adoption.<p>Dgraph works very differently. It&#x27;s a native GraphQL database. You set the GraphQL schema directly. Any changes are done within the GraphQL schema itself, and the database figures out how to serve that best. Not to mention, the database is optimized for running GraphQL queries, so fast joins, traversals and so on coming directly from the storage layer. Not to mention it scales as your data size grows without needing to do data denormalization.<p>Overall, app iteration can be much faster with Dgraph.')
