It is a backend driven system that allows app developers to remotely switch on and off features and code changes. This is really useful when rolling out updated features, you can roll it out gradually, eg 1%, 5%, 10%, 100%. Roll out a new feature 1% and notice its crashing for a subset of those users? Roll back the flag so users see the old UI and fix the problem for next release. Itâ€™s better than updating a feature for all and having it crash for everyone (yes, even with testing sometimes bugs sneak through, especially when you have millions of users).<p>It also allows app developers to bucket users in groups and A&#x2F;B test experiments on users to see what works best. It would not be uncommon for the larger players (Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Pinterest, Uber, Spotify, etc) to have 100s or 1000s of experiments running concurrently. It also decouples rolling out features from App Store releases.<p>Having said that, I also hate generic changelog messages and not defending the practice.\nIf new features are to be launched with the build, write it in the changelog and add &quot;(rolling out)&quot; or \n&quot;(coming soon)&quot; next to it.')
