By way of their contracts, they strongarm their contractors into dealing with any &quot;misclassification&quot; issues (eg. exerting too much control over a contractor) individually, silently, and outside of court.  Contractors have no ability to sue in a class action suit, and aren&#x27;t even allowed to speak to fellow contractors if they go through arbitration.  It&#x27;s such a sneaky and frankly complicit way to enforce their business model.  They know it&#x27;s grey, and they put people in the corner so they can&#x27;t call it grey with a loud enough voice for serious attention to be brought to the issue.<p>Thankfully some law firms have taken the approach to overwhelm Arise with individual arbitration claims.  Arise likely calculated in to their model as a cost of business expense, so the best that can be done is to make that expense grow.')
