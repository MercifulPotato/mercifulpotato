For instance this product: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buyforlifeproducts.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;18" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buyforlifeproducts.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;18</a> why were only a handful of glowing 5 star reviews pulled in? Sure, most of the reviews on Amazon are positive, but a fair mix would be nice.')
