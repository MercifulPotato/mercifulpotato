Item(by='dangus', descendants=None, kids=[25659448], score=None, time=1609949074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658692, text='Maybe you’re right about some things becoming infantile, but a lot of the examples shown on this product page aren’t just about messing around with GIFs. You can build visual virtual spaces, like a virtual conference space or auditorium. The idea of being able to virtually walk around a virtual physical space and speak to people in an analogy to real life (by getting “closer” to them) seems like it’s an idea with at least some potential, and certainly a better idea than doing the real thing right now.<p>Also, you may be surprised to find out that you <i>are</i> allowed to have silly fun as an adult.<p>In my opinion, the “infantilization” of our workplaces is a huge positive, it’s really a side effect that’s demonstrating that employers are caring less about forcing us to wear fake clothes, fake personalities, and fake formality during our day to day work. Comedy is one of the best coping mechanisms to deal with stress and in that way it helps to be able to slap a GIF over a situation without feeling like the boss man is going to tell me to tone it down.<p>And sure, maybe there’s no need for this product, but what I can say is that if you build another Zoom&#x2F;Meet&#x2F;WebEx you aren’t really making anything new or interesting.')
