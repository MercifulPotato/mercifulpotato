Diet, exercise, better sleep.. they all interact and make each other stronger.<p>I have also found that a brisk morning walk in the cold (deliberately wear just a hoodie and shorts in near freezing temps) has helped as well.  Maybe it&#x27;s the sunlight, maybe it&#x27;s the exercise, maybe it&#x27;s the cold but I feel like it gets my hormones into better shape and I have more energy (specifically referring to T, and for example I have had very mild acne, which I hadn&#x27;t seen in about 15 years).')
