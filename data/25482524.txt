Item(by='exmadscientist', descendants=None, kids=[25483295], score=None, time=1608422560, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25481729, text='&gt; Haven&#x27;t been on one to verify use by ridership, or to see what the driver&#x27;s reaction to noncompliant riders is.<p>Compliance is very high (&gt;95%?), but the people who do not comply are basically the same people who were problems in the Before Times: belligerent, mentally ill, or both. The drivers almost always let them get away with it, again just as in the Before Times, probably because it&#x27;s a risk to even interact with these people. I, for one, try very hard not to make eye contact with them or even look in their general direction; treating them like the Bugblatter Beast of Traal is at least moderately effective.<p>I do wish they wouldn&#x27;t flash the stupid &quot;Masks Required&quot; on the route signs so often, though. It makes it a lot harder to tell which bus is actually arriving. And showing it on the route indicator on the _back_ of the coach is just spiteful.')
