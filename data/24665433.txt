That&#x27;s the first step in any scientific process. A few replications later, we&#x27;ve got a theory, and then a few more later, a fact. The first papers are as important as the rest of that pipeline.<p>What causes outright harm is:<p>1) Papers with poor methodology;<p>2) Authors overselling their results; or just as often<p>3) Readers &#x2F; reporters giving too much confidence in preliminary results<p>To be clear, I was calling em500 on #3, not the authors on #1 or #2.<p>On a skim, I don&#x27;t see obvious problems (but, then, I wouldn&#x27;t expect to find them; most require a deep read). It&#x27;s published in an open access venue, which is always a good sign. It also helps that you&#x27;re from BC, which for the most part, (still) has a pretty good reputation for scientific integrity (there&#x27;s been a rapid decline in scientific integrity over the past two decades, and that&#x27;s hit the institutional culture across the river from you particularly hard).<p>So you&#x27;re okay by me!')
