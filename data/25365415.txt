This is as true for the &quot;free market&quot; as it is for the &quot;free market of ideas&quot; or the contemporary ordering of law and punishment.<p>The state has to be the ultimate authority, to prevent smaller aggregations from stripping minorities and individuals of their own liberty.<p>No proposed alternative system has so far demonstrated stable viability.<p>That the examples we live within are terrible does not mean they are not also the least bad viable alternatives.<p>Personally I may think this is a shame, but, oh well.<p>Heinlein loved to portray rationalist societies in which ad hoc aggregations formed just long enough to enforce a purported majority-recognized rational moral order, without need for formal constitutional law or persistent institutions with formal institutional memory.<p>When I was 15 I thought this was how things should be.<p>At 50 I am certain that it shall never be so, not with the limitations of our actual evolved embodiment.')
