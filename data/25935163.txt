Its versioning scheme is utterly insane.  It made a slightly difficult problem incredibly complex, and for no good reason.<p>Every current platform of note has a perfectly good linker, making libtool redundant.  More often than not, it&#x27;s been an &quot;anti-portability&quot; impediment when it thinks it knows how to drive modern linkers but because it&#x27;s barely maintained, it gets it wrong by trying to be too clever.<p>Even proprietary embedded toolchains come with full-fat ELF linkers these days.<p>Of all of the pieces which make up the Autotools, libtool is the one which could be dropped today with zero impact.  It&#x27;s the least useful and the least necessary of them all.')
