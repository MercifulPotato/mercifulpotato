Same with the water consumed by those crops.  With these natural and finite resources, there very much is a zero-sum game, since your use of that resource is at everyone else&#x27;s expense.<p>This is something Graham entirely misses in his article: the wealth, contrary to his core assertion, <i>does</i> flow from a common source, specifically land.  The wealthy, in turn, are such specifically because they happened to be the ones able to control that land at the exclusion of everyone else.

It&#x27;s land all the way down, and the company externalizes those opportunity costs on everyone else.  <i>That</i> is where the injustice in their wealth lies; it is unjust for them to reap the benefits of that land without adequately compensating the rest of society for the opportunity cost the members thereof now bear.')
