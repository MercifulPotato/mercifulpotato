He is a Sr engineer type who attends meetings to weigh in on things, not in my direct line of management. The guy is older (50+ likely) and talks to everyone like they don’t know what they’re doing. Very little in the way of any politeness whatsoever (and i really don’t expect much). Whenever i come out of a meeting with this guy I always feel a little less happy with my career.<p>What can i do to deal with this? For reference I’m in my 30s.')
