First of all, they have a different trajectory that is more difficult to intercept, so that they can maintain lower altitudes.<p>These lower altitudes allows the ballistic missile to maneuver. This makes their trajectory unpredictable, which makes missiles like the SM3 almost useless.<p>In combination with this, China also has hypersonic glide vehicles, which are not only harder to target, but also fly on non-ballistic, fully unpredictable trajectories at such altitudes that the horizon becomes a real issue.<p>To top it all off, China and Russia are both in the advanced stages of construction (Russia is farther ahead and should Comission them soon) hypersonic cruise missiles, with possible sea-skimming terminal modes.<p>All in all, the SM3 missile is pretty much useless against that threat.<p>The better explanation is that this is a test that congress asked for, and that if anything is more suitable to target North Korea, not that it&#x27;s very likely it would be perfectly effective against North Korea as they have second-stroke capability and sure as hell won&#x27;t send a single missile with a single warhead, more like 15 real missiles with a mix of decoys and nukes plus multiple dummy missiles with no real payload. But it&#x27;s a start against a North Korea class threat.<p>Anyways, here&#x27;s a lesson from modern warfare, never rely on countermeasures.')
