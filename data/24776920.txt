Any attempt to quantify something like &quot;hope for success&quot; can branch into endless debate about setting success criteria, defining hope, measuring anything in this space, etc. This is a philosophical or psychological issue, not a mathematical one.<p>Data visualization is a terrible way to make an argument about human behavior.')
