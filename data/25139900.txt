Item(by='DCKing', descendants=None, kids=[25140453], score=None, time=1605721949, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25138956, text='I believe it&#x27;s not clear because Apple is set to gain nothing if they would move against &quot;open computing&quot;, and only lose. iOS has not been an open computing platform since the start, and Apple appears to have trouble changing their backwards attitude there. There&#x27;s no attitude to change on the Mac. Everything they&#x27;ve done on Mac nudges to strict defaults, but does not limit anyone (at best it improves security, at worst it annoys, but it does not fundamentally limit anyone). You can fully disable Gatekeeper with one Terminal command if those defaults annoy you.<p>In my view you can only believe Apple will lock down the Mac if you somehow view them as an irrational ideological opponent, not simply a company that wants to make money by selling computers. Since you say you don&#x27;t care what Apple themselves say towards this, I can&#x27;t escape the impression that you might actually already view them in this way. If so, there&#x27;s not much we can talk about.')
