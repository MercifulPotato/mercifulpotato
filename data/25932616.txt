Were all of the rounds depleted uranium?  We knew it could be DU, but didn&#x27;t have a scintillation counter, and didn&#x27;t bother to measure its density.  He just kept it far from his bed and his food.<p>I know solid uranium metal isn&#x27;t so bad, and armor piercing shells typically have a tungsten or DU core covered with lead (if nothing else, to keep the super hard core from abrading the barrel).<p>It must have been solid lead, or lead jacketed tungsten, right?  My brother has 4 perfectly healthy kids, but I could imagine some kid keeping a DU shell in his&#x2F;her pocket, in close proximity to their gametes for years.')
