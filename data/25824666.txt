You meet them at a party thrown by someone who is not your favorite person but you went anyway.<p>The reason this works is friend (and date)  finding is a numbers game. You just need minor contact with thousands of people to find the handful that fit great.<p>It also works because of practice. You get practice building curiosity, reliability, body language, jokes, etc with the friends you don’t quite click with, so that when the right person appears you have the skills to engage them fully.<p>And none of this means doing the same things over and over with people you don’t really like. Do your best to find life with them, but keep saying yes to new people. Let the people you really don’t click with sort of decay out.')
