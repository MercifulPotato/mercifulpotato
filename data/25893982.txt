Social and political conservatism are the flashpoints.<p>For examples consider the 1619 Project. It freaks out social and political conservatives because veneration of society&#x27;s history and institutions is a basic precept. This is not something unique to American Republicans. I once had a Japanese acquaintance go through several hundred years of history to explain to me why Japanese culture is less susceptible to political corruption than Chinese culture. Conservatives internalize the saying that &quot;90% of everything is crap.&quot; They believe that our current prosperity is the product of a set of societal choices, and we need to install respect for those choices because if we try something new, there is a 90% probability it will be bad and harmful.<p>Liberals are, by their nature, don&#x27;t venerate history, and are optimistic about new ideas. It doesn&#x27;t matter to them that there are almost no examples of successful countries that cast an intensely critical eye on their own history. They don&#x27;t think we need to venerate Jefferson, the Constitution, etc., to preserve our democracy. They&#x27;re optimistic that we can replace reliance on history and tradition with new frameworks and new ideas. And they&#x27;re confident that those things will turn out well.')
