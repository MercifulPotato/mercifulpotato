Item(by='ALittleLight', descendants=None, kids=[25844050], score=None, time=1611123718, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25842614, text='I agree that the comment you are responding to is saddening, but I disagree with the characterization of the Capitol protesters as being treated with a &quot;gentle touch&quot;.  One unarmed woman was shot and killed, others were maced, beaten etc.  Three other protesters died from causes that I&#x27;ve just seen described as &quot;medical&quot;.  This hardly seems like evidence of a light touch to me.<p>In my estimation the Capitol Police were some combination of surprised, unprepared, under-equipped, and under-manned.  The police didn&#x27;t seem to have any plans or preparation.  Some police are seen standing aside and letting protesters in to the Capitol (which, I agree is a light touch, but I also saw police kneeling in solidarity with BLM protesters, which is also a light touch).  Other police are brawling with protesters (which, I think is probably about the right level of violence, we just needed more police to be there doing it and for all the police there to understand what they were supposed to be doing).<p>I don&#x27;t think the police should shoot Capitol protesters or BLM protesters.  I do think they should use physical force against both when they do things that are unacceptable - e.g. entering the Capitol or destroying or looting stores.  I would say both groups call for a similar medium touch.')
