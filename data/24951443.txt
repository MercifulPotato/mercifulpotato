They trained and tested on a balanced dataset, which is very unlike the data distribution this algorithm would see “in the wild”.  Under real world prescreening  conditions the data would likely be extremely unbalanced toward the negative class, and also be subject to drift over time.<p>2. They seem to have identified positive subjects through a questionnaire not via clinical chemistry diagnostics; so (a) it is unclear whether their training labels are correct, and (b) they may have completely missed the asymptomatic population.<p>3. As mentioned in another comment ca. 5000 patients and 250K samples is not a lot considering the size and diversity of the population(s) where this would be deployed.<p>Disclaimer: I gave the article the brief high level scan treatment so I could be wrong about any or all of these.  Please correct me if I am mistaken.')
