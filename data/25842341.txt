There are still a lot of subsistence farmers in rural areas, and there is still a large underclass that powers the urban economy by working for very low wages in factories, on delivery routes and so on.<p>China has come a long way in a relatively short period of time, and that&#x27;s worth applauding, but it still faces some big challenges in raising the quality of life for all its citizens. I&#x27;m not an economist, but I expect that there will be a point where the growth can&#x27;t continue because there won&#x27;t be enough of an underclass to provide all the services that the current &quot;middle&quot; class takes for granted. I think the government is hoping that by that point either automation or outsourcing will be able to fill the gap.')
