Item(by='amw-zero', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609552008, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605117, text='&gt; A state diagram is usually richer than a directed graphâ€”usually the edges are labelled. This multiplies the number of possible transitions by the number of possible labels.<p>This is true. The technical term for this is a &quot;multigraph.&quot;<p>&gt; (Also, for anyone interested in comparing with the graph-theoretic terminology, the term &quot;complete graph&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Complete_graph" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Complete_graph</a>) is often used for undirected graphs with no self-loops, in which case there are only \\binom n 2 possible edges.)<p>You gave the formula for the number of edges in an undirected graph. The number of edges in a complete directed graph is n^2 - n when transitions from a state to itself is not considered. I take liberty with that fact, and often just say there are n^2 edges in a complete directed graph, since transitions to self don&#x27;t usually harm the design. Either way, it&#x27;s O(n^2).<p>As you said though, state diagrams can be multigraphs. In that case, I&#x27;m not aware of a general formula for the number of states. But I imagine it would still be O(n^2), just with possibly more edges.')
