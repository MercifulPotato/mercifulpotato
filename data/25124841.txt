But then again, Twitter refuses to address covid-19 misinformation, and allows politicians to generally say whatever they want, conservative or no. All while youtube does nothing about qanon conspiracy videos flooding the platform.<p>It&#x27;s just a shame that american politicians now have to be hardline partisans to the point where they will lie right into the microphone to toe the party line.')
