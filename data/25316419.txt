Botnets could link spam pages to each other and even generate traffic.  If that got into the wrong hands, we would be unable to distinguish truth from fiction.<p>If the general public heard of this, Googleâ€™s stock price might be hurt.  In such a bot-filled world, humans might prefer to start their searches in walled-gardens or on sites that could better-validate content.')
