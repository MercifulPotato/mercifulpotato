Calling a method directly is the same regardless of whatever annotations are on it -- of course, unless it or one of its upstreams looks at the annotations, but that&#x27;s isomorphic to just passing the data along.<p>Java annotations induce different behaviors in specific callers that are designed to take advantage of those annotations, which is arguably even worse -- like a meta analogue of the COMEFROM keyword.')
