The remainder wasn&#x27;t smart enough to stop instantly and thus got multiple beatings. There&#x27;s always the one kid who needs to touch the hot stove multiple times until they realize it hurts ;)<p>Would I recommend it to children now that some decades have passed and I am an adult? I don&#x27;t know.<p>But it does work, ideally if applied without prior threatening and in quick succession. People really don&#x27;t like having multiple fists in their face when they didn&#x27;t expect it to happen.')
