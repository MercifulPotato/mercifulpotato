If social media companies didn&#x27;t do anything, they would get blamed for not doing anything to prevent what&#x27;s happened in the Capitol building. If they do something, then the freedom of speech argument comes in.<p>Not an expert on freedom of online speech  by any means, but how come private companies saying what the US president does is violation of their policy is a freedom of speech issue? When this happens to an ordinary user of the platform, is it freedom of speech issue as well? You accept terms and conditions when you signup, it&#x27;s as simple as that. Why being the US president should give you right to be exempt from that policy?<p>If US president wants to talk, it has its official channels, he can organize meeting every day that they can host 100s of journalists. If US president wants he can write whatever he wants at his website. I really don&#x27;t understand why political leaders continuously picture things like social media websites are the only medium the president can talk at?<p>I have criticism for the social media sites tho, if the president of where I&#x27;m from was doing what Trump has been doing I&#x27;m pretty sure they wouldn&#x27;t give a damn and wouldn&#x27;t take any actions. If social media companies want people to believe to their policies, they must apply them to everyone.')
