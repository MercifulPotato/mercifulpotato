Why would you buy something you don&#x27;t need? It doesn&#x27;t even matter if the Mac Mini with Apple Silicon existed or if from now on the only computer Apple sold is a Mac Mini.<p>Okay lets be serious. You bought the x86 Mac Mini because you wanted a x86 Mac Mini, not because you wanted to make perfect purchasing decisions with infinite foresight. A lot of software is broken on the M1 Mac Mini so you made the right decision at that time. It&#x27;s entirely possible that you would regret buying the M1 Mac Mini.')
