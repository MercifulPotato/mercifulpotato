If you feel pain, try different positions out. I had the setup you recommend for many years. At first I started getting shoulder pain, and realized that I was stopping over to accommodate when looking down. I forced myself (at regular intervals, and modest cost to productivity) to have better posture, and to tilt my neck downward instead. It fixed the shoulder pain but my neck was uncomfortable. Not in pain, but constantly uncomfortable. I kept with it because I knew this was the &quot;proper&quot; ergonomics.<p>Then I realized: I spend most of my time staring at the bottom half, to bottom edge, of the screen. Typing in a terminal, adding functions at the bottom of a file, etc. I moved my monitor such that my eyes are almost dead-center, vertically, and haven&#x27;t had any issues since, neither neck nor shoulders. I kept the improved posture too, so I&#x27;m sure that ultimately helped too.<p>I&#x27;m sure the recommended is recommended for a reason, and works for most, but hopefully my experience is useful to some.')
