You need specialized car trim tools (similar to the phone case ones but well bigger) to remove them along the edges without denting the outer plastic edges.<p>Also most of them are meant to clip-on once. So if you take them apart too many times you might start seeing gaps on the trim and things not properly fitting.<p>Again it might not be something you care about but just thought I would mention. Ideally you would be better off getting one of these from after-sales or 2nd hand from scrap parts and working on a bench top with a 12V line.')
