A modern paint shop costs about a half billion; the forms &amp; presses for pressing steel are also quite expensive.<p>750,000 preorders means that these low-volume production advantages are mostly moot, but perhaps Tesla will still take advantage of this to create some low volume variants.<p>Which is the only way you&#x27;re going to see variants -- the unibody design of the Cybertruck means that coach-builders can&#x27;t use a cutaway base.')
