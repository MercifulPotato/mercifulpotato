I do think it is likely that she isn&#x27;t fired if she was a white male. In my experience, people have more patience with people who are in their &quot;in-group&quot;. This goes beyond race&#x2F;gender -- just look at sports fandom for an example. Isn&#x27;t it odd that players for the team you cheer for can do no wrong, but as soon as they&#x27;re traded then they start doing a bunch of bad stuff, even the stuff they did while on your team actually now looks kind of bad. In the tech industry role&#x2F;team&#x2F;company&#x2F;race&#x2F;gender are probably the biggest in-group delineations.<p>I think you&#x27;re right about her not being in the in-group.  But the in-group had nothing to do with race or gender but instead was about whether or not she played ball with Google executives.  It seems like she was a team player with regards to people she worked with directly in AI ethics research, but definitely was not a corporate team player.<p>I think in this specific circumstance a white male would have been easier to fire.  It&#x27;s a much worse look to fire a woman of color investigating AI ethics (A lot of which is revolves around racial and gender bias) than a white male.<p>&gt; Yes they do. The most common ultimatum is given before employment, where candidates will often give a minimum salary&#x2F;benefits they will take for the job. I&#x27;ve seen and even been involved in these negotiations where a candidate states that they will not go below this offer, period. And then we counter with a number below that but provide some other incentive we think may counter it.<p>When I used the word ultimatum I wasn&#x27;t referring to pre-employment salary negotiations, which this most certainly wasn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; There are other ultimatums I&#x27;ve seen in the workplace. For example, &quot;I can&#x27;t work with XYZ or I&#x27;m leaving the team&quot;. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen the response come back as, &quot;good luck finding a new team&quot;. It&#x27;s always been to dive deeper into the relationship.<p>I think there is a subtle difference between delivering an ultimatum and communicating the minimum needs for a job.  &quot;You need to stop requiring me to travel or I quit&quot; will be treated very differently by most employers than &quot;I talked with my wife, and due to us having a new born, I don&#x27;t I think I can fit travel into my life any longer.  Is there any way to continue this job without travel?&quot;.  Judging by her generally assertive nature (which is a valuable asset in a researcher and activist, but can be a liability when navigating corporate America) and the other message she sent out to her co-workers I imagine her email was phrased more like the former than the latter.<p>&gt; I can imagine it being listed as a firing offense in some handbook. I can also imagine that others who have written damning emails have gotten away with no more than a slap on the wrist (or less).<p>Even without an employee handbook, this is incredibly unprofessional behavior. Telling co-workers to stop doing certain types of work and apply external pressure to your employer seems unfathomable to me?  If I was really angry or drunk and sent out a message like that I would be afraid of losing my job. If I also submitted my resignation at the same time I would just assume they would accept it unless they had a very important reason they couldn&#x27;t let me go.<p>I think if she had just submitted her resignation&#x2F;ultimatum letter or just sent out that withering letter she&#x27;d still be employed at Google.  I&#x27;ve seen two people act that unprofessional and one was immediately fired and the other was told &quot;This is you&#x27;re first and second strike. You think we can&#x27;t replace you.  We can, and if you do this again we will.&quot;  And those unprofessional outbursts weren&#x27;t in writing, they were just people being unprofessional because they were stressed and frustrated.')
