I don&#x27;t like when people who hold those ideas just keep shouting the same thing over and over without actually engaging with the rebuttals presented--frankly I find that behavior reprehensible. I have <i>sympathy</i> for people who want to suppress that sort of behavior, which is what you&#x27;re picking up on from my previous comment, but I&#x27;m far from convinced that it&#x27;s a viable solution.<p>Mostly though, this conspiratorial content is so obviously damaging and in bad-faith, etc that I don&#x27;t <i>care</i> so much about imperfections with respect to free speech ideals, just like I&#x27;m not very worked up that Germany bans holocaust denialism.<p>&gt; About them being loud, how can they be “loud” when none of the media is representing their case?<p>Because social media exists, and because the POTUS is using his enormous platform to the same end?<p>&gt; This act of censorship is showcasing very grim future where absolute minority gets to decide what tune whole generations are playing to<p>This has always been the case. Traditional media is exactly this model.')
