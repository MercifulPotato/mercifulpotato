And with 2020 shaking up to be one of the &quot;worst years&quot; in history, it is important to remember what we can truly be thankful for.<p>Tomorrow, give a moment to thank the hard working nurses and doctors who have done what they can to save as many lives as possible in this year. That&#x27;s what Thanksgiving is all about: even in the worst of times, we need to give thanks to the people who made this year just a little bit less shitty than it could have been.<p>That&#x27;s absolutely something to be thankful for. For the 80-hour weeks, for the endless stress, for the worry of contracting COVID19 and spreading it to the ones they love. The frontline workers: be they paramedics, doctors, or nurses, have put in extra effort this year. Their work is usually seen in a negative light (# of deaths), because its impossible to see the converse (# of lives saved).')
