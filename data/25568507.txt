The US effectively banned hemp production prior to WWII, although temporary exceptions were made during WWII due to needing hemp fibre for war time production. Hemp production was only legalised at a federal level in 2018(!).<p><i>Why</i> hemp was banned is an open question. Various theories involving the DuPont family, Andrew Mellon, and Randolph Hearst exist, although evidence supporting them is scant. Alternatively, the whole thing may just have been a mistake; cannabis was often called &quot;Indian hemp&quot; back then, and it <i>does</i> contain trace amounts of THC.<p>In any case, at least as far as the US goes, hemp was competing quite well with cotton (it was a major crop in Kentucky prior to the civil war); the decline was caused by the legal system, not economics.')
