An HTC OneMax (t6vzw).<p>I unlocked my bootloader (cf. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.xda-developers.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;guide-s-off-root-your-htc-one-max.2550559&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.xda-developers.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;guide-s-off-root-your-htc...</a>), installed TWRP[0] and then re-locked my bootloader.<p>I then variously installed different custom roms (LineageOS, NuSense, ResurrectionRemix) and in between re-flashed the stock rom.<p>I used SuperSU and AddonSU to root the installed images.  Magisk is also a popular rooting tool (AIUI, the MagiskHide component blocks Google Play from identifying the device as rooted as well).<p>Once I installed TWRP, I was able to do all of those things with a locked bootloader and had <i>zero</i> problems running any Android application.<p>I&#x27;d note that LineageOS[1] supports hundreds of different phones.<p>Any reasonably tech savvy person can do this  fairly easily and a non-tech savvy person can do so with a modicum of effort.<p>If you&#x27;re actually interested, I&#x27;ll happily sell you my services to do this on your phone.<p>And I promise you that I will charge you an outrageously large amount for those services.  It&#x27;s definitely not worth it, but I&#x27;d be happy to take your money.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twrp.me&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twrp.me&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.lineageos.org&#x2F;devices&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.lineageos.org&#x2F;devices&#x2F;</a>')
