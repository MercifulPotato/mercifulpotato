Or for some engineers it’s hard to do the converse, and stop at the 80&#x2F;20 solution.<p>I think by talking explicitly about tech debt you can get the non-technical stakeholders on board. (It helps I think of you were warning them about tech debt when you were taking it on, too, and not just starting to educate when it comes time to pay back.)<p>In my experience teams run better when everyone is somewhat aligned on how much tech debt to be taking on or paying back.<p>I am sure there are other ways to get alignment too; I’m interested to hear what other leads have implemented. I could believe for some team compositions the “let each engineer figure it out” approach would work well, but I think that is kind of like the Agile “self organizing team” — it’s rare that you get to work in a team where everyone is experienced enough for a free form approach to work, especially when you are growing fast.')
