Even if you 10x the payouts, they would still on make £2000 a year, and the complaints would still be there, 80% of artist are making less than £2000 a year narrative.<p>The Nadine Shah mentioned in the article, has 5 recording labels, I would say at least one manager, pr manager, marketing manager, producer etc etc. Of course she is finding it difficult. The majority of artists in any field do, in fact a lot of people find it difficult, athletes, musicians, painters, etc, the majority being from the creative or talent side of the fence.<p>80% of artists probably have extremely low streams per month, and maybe even 0. 80% of 80% make music which 80% don&#x27;t listen to and make 80% of basically nothing.<p>If you turn your art in a commodity, then you get paid for its market value. Currently 80% of musicians aren&#x27;t worth £200.')
