Because 1ms &quot;that sounds kinda good enough :?&quot;, while 1s &quot;that&#x27;ll never work!!!&quot;<p>Ammendment:<p>Thinking about it.\nUsing a 16bit timestamp prefix with second resolution and rollover should probably provide a good tradeoff between improving insertion performance (most expensive in terms of index touching), a 112 bit random value, and a dense usage of the timstamp field.<p>It also allows you to do thing like &quot;forgetting&quot; old values,\nwithin a 18h timeframe.')
