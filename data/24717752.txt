That&#x27;s a good argument to be in a union.<p>Or it would be, except (apart from a few specialist groups like police unions) unions seem to be amazingly bad at actually doing this.  We haven&#x27;t had pro-worker legislation in decades as far as I can tell.  I don&#x27;t know why unions are so bad at this as (at least IMHO) it seems like a core responsibility AND a major selling point.  But they are.  We&#x27;ve seen fewer and fewer rights for workers, higher taxes for working people, the removal of benefits for working people, higher student loans, sky high house prices, you name it.')
