Arguably even Elvis was. It’s just that generations of the past got to coalesce their chosen canons over a few years, because of physical limitations of media distribution that allowed for critical elaboration and recreation; now show-business is just another “business at the speed of light”, like Gates predicted, so trends get created and vaporised too quickly to properly decant into homogeneous subcultures. By the time you’ve learnt to play the guitar or your ProTools, your cult band or DJ is already passé.')
