Whether you agree or not with what Google did, it seems clear that they wanted to fire her for a while. They made the calculation that using this as a justification would allow them to get rid of her at a PR cost that was acceptable to them. None of the comments coming out of either side should be taken at face value, what’s being said is just window dressing and justification of the real motivations.')
