It felt like I knew nothing and was then being asked to lead my team of 6. While it was intimidating, it was a wonderful opportunity to learn and grow. 90% of my time was still spent coding, but that 10% was spent communicating with other teams and working out any issues that popped up across the 7~ scrum teams. It was a lot of fun and I only stepped down from the role so a young lady on my team (also a level 1) could give it a try.')
