For example, voters could elect people who they thought were qualified to interview and test applicants for the roles that would hold day-to-day power.<p>I suppose that sounds a bit like how an electoral college should&#x2F;could work, or how a parliamentary system expresses confidence in a Prime Minister, but obviously I don&#x27;t think those systems are perfect implementations of the principal I am aiming for.<p>There are various types of &quot;test&quot; that could be used to filter applicants, such as IQ tests, polygraphs, general knowledge, psychological diagnosis, but each of those have a lot of scope for introducing false positives and negatives in the selection process, even before we consider the meta-gaming of candidates acting dishonestly and testers acting to bias the outcome.<p>Maybe if recall elections were possible for all roles (with zero administrative cost, and 100% turnout rate) that would be enough to solve the &quot;buyer&#x27;s remorse&quot; problem with electing someone whose ability to gain power is greater than their ability to exercise it wisely.')
