I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re trying to put backdoors into all sorts of equipment that is shipped to the USA.<p>But Bloomberg NEVER explained how a hypothetical 0402 capacitor could contain a backdoor. They literally took a picture of the smallest chip on a motherboard and said &quot;this could be a backdoor&quot; in big-bold letters. Even from a paranoid anti-China perspective, that article was awful.<p>&quot;Chinese Backdoor in server equipment&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be surprising news to me (especially since important groups: military, telecommunications, etc. etc. use equipment like that). But when it comes to writing security-based articles, you need to be very specific about the nature of the threat. If you take the tiniest chip (a passive capacitor) and claim that there&#x27;s a backdoor in it, you deserve to be laughed off.')
