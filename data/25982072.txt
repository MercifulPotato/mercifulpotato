I&#x27;ve still seen people mess it up, and generally it&#x27;s when the developers begin to &quot;play&quot; with things they don&#x27;t understand, like bringing in Aspect J, writing custom annotations, slowly moving logic to configuration files, starting to dynamically load modules in&#x2F;out.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a struggle because an experienced dev will hate the framework, as they know better, but then as less experienced dev work on the code base it&#x27;ll degenerate in a way the framework would have survived longer due to availability of documentation and Stackoverflow Q&#x2F;A.')
