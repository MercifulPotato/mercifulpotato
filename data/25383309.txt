I&#x27;m in a similar position where work is pushing cypress, but there is no library for cypress in our backend language, there is for playwright. I want to do something in the frontend, and check the backend, so it would be nice to use our existing backend language for both so we have access to our internal library. I was told we could write a bash script and have cypress exec. Of course we can do a script in any language, but suddenly I&#x27;m seeing a bash QA library emerging at my work. Does that sound absurd to anyone else?')
