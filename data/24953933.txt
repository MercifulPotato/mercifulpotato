For every 1 pound of body weight you lose, I have heard it removes 4 lbs of pressure on the knee and lower back. My 12 plus day water fast cleared up any remaining skin blemishes and a little Vitiligo between my fingers disappeared. I&#x27;m thinking after a year of monthly 5-7 day water fasts (18&#x2F;6 Time delayed eating the rest of the time), the 12 day water fast was incredibly impactful, it felt like my body was pushed to use anything it could at that point to fuel itself.<p>My only regret is that I wasn&#x27;t able to have someone doing a study or researching fasting monitor and harvest the wealth of information that was available.')
