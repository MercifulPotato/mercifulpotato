Item(by='wst_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602629821, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24768391, text='&gt; English speakers.. struggled with everything but pronunciation<p>This is interesting observation which doesn&#x27;t go in par with mine. From my experience, native English speakers have really bad pronunciation as the Japanese is full of &quot;soft&quot; sounds like shi, chi, ji. Those are missing in English. For example when you want to say Shibuya, the first two letters should not be pronounced the same as in word &quot;shell.&quot; The same &quot;j&quot; in kanji should not be pronounced as in the word &quot;jam.&quot; I find this quite common among native English speakers.<p>On the other hand, I find people of central and east Europe the most gifted. At least WTR pronunciation. They got used to the most of the sounds spoken by Japanese and some more. Some subtlety aside, of course - it&#x27;s not 100% the same, but close enough.')
