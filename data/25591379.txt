Because they are small and visible out and about you have a second motivator for replacement besides straight improvement pressure. People using them as a status symbol&#x2F;indicator feel the need to have the latest and greatest.<p>Phones, even the premium tier are a much less costly investment than a desktop PC. In addition to the $1500-$2500 for a decent desktop computer you also have all the supporting bits, a desk to put it on, a chair, maybe a printer, + the floorspace to house it all.<p>With a phone it&#x27;s just the phone, and maybe a case.
