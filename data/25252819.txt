The interface was a plus as well. That being said, given the sheer amount of scientific libraries for Python and universities moving towards it as well, I&#x27;m wondering if the effort to maintain Octave is worth it.<p>One use for it could definitely be running older MATLAB scripts that have deprecated language features.
