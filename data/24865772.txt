The dryness is awful and it’s why I moved. But anything that can be reclaimed and reused is. The only waste is the stuff people pour into the yards and thus let evaporate instead of staying in the system. It’s also got the Hoover Dam and Colorado river piped straight to it. (Unfortunately much of that water is sent out to California, but that’s another problem.)<p>Yes, water’s a huge issue in the southwest. It’s also managed differently in different places. But from what I saw in LV, I think it can be a solved problem. It is not a constraint.<p>Edit-But let’s assume water is a constraint. Then why don’t we add to the needed infrastructure projects a project to pump water in from the coast? I’m sure there’s a feasible and affordable way to do it since we already have the highway systems. Just run some pipes alongside it - powered by solar? Doesn’t need to be running 24&#x2F;7.')
