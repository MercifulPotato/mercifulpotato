Unless Amazon want to put at least 8 zeros in their offer, I can&#x27;t see it happening, and at that point Amazon might as well hedge their bets and build their own offering (which is exactly what they&#x27;re doing). At worst, their offering will be only _okay_, and at the same time Timescale is doing business with Amazon by hosting DaaS instances on their infrastructure, which I&#x27;m sure Amazon takes a handsome cut from.')
