They&#x27;d get shouted out. That&#x27;s not promotion of &quot;free speech&quot;, it&#x27;s promotion of &quot;echo chamber of the same opinions as mine&quot;.<p>Same goes on the left - imagine suggesting that maybe immigration should be thought about or you have an angle on the trans community that didn&#x27;t quite sit well with the wokies...<p>The point is that life is subtle and nuanced. Free speech in my humble opinion needs to be earned - which means open dialogue where ultimately you might be prepared to admit you&#x27;re wrong.')
