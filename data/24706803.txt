When in actual fact in the case of things like libinput and systemd they were developed at RedHat and I imagine that they also exerted some influence to increase their adoption. In these specific cases (high profile projects with a few noticeable issues) it makes sense to go back to the people who developed and maintain them to say &quot;Can you please fix these issues&quot;')
