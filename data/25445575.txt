The fact that you&#x27;ve stuck with the business for this long and grown it is great, and better than most people do.<p>I Strongly recommend engaging directly with your customers whenever&#x2F;wherever possible (Twitter, Slack, Discord, etc). One thing I immediately noticed on Twitter is that your name overlaps with a email newsletter published by @Doctor_V<p>Lastly, I would do a quick read over of your site and content. If you&#x27;re going to start advertising, make sure everything is professional. For example, when I opened the link, I immediately noticed this:<p>&quot;with ...@joesmith.33mail.comwill be&quot; - that missing space between .com and will is super glaring for someone like me. Make sure you clean that stuff up before you start advertising. When I see that kind of stuff, I go from &quot;this is a professional service I might pay for&quot; to &quot;this is not a real business.&quot; I know it seems small, but just being honest.')
