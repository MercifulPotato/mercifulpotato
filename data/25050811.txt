Even when there&#x27;s a buyback agreement.<p>Retailers are also NOT interested in buybacks, as the cost of shelf life is not cheap(much more expensive, than warehousing)... and white label products are also higher risk(not shared risk) for the retailers and are always lower margin.<p>There&#x27;s a very clear difference between financial incentives between traditional retailers and Amazon.
