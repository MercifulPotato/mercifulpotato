He&#x2F;everyone he works with are required to get rapid tested before they step on the set every single day. Anyone he comes in contact with on set has passed the same rapid test.<p>&gt; I bartend. Im constantly surrounded by people who deem dining out for pleasure to be a smart choice during a pandemic. This group consists roughly of 20% responsible people who take outdoor dining rules seriously, 40% Covid truthers who take a weird pride in breaking the rules, and 40% people in their 20s&#x2F;30s who think the rules don’t apply to them because they are invincible. And that’s before you even add the effects of alcohol to the equation.<p>&gt; Neither me or anyone I work with was ever provided with a Covid test by management or even asked by management to go get independently tested.<p>&gt; One of these things is not like the other. I understand this bar owner’s frustrations but “extremely controlled production sets are allowed to be open&#x2F;eat food so why aren’t bars open” isn’t exactly sound logic.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LosAngeles&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k6y5f5&#x2F;bar_owner_in_los_angeles_ca_is_livid_to_see_that&#x2F;genp97b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LosAngeles&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k6y5f5&#x2F;bar_owne...</a>')
