This is a convenient, but rather crude solution which may result in snapped off leads so use at your own risk!<p>If that mishap on an SOIC chip occurs, don’t fret, you can usually shave off a bit of the plastic and get enough pin surface to solder a jumper to VCC.<p>An alternate method is to follow the VCC trace and cut it, then solder your own wire to the unlifted lead and a nearby capacitor with a switch. Beware that you might power more than the chip if the trace continues, but that’s usually fine. Sometimes this is a good thing because you still power pull-up resistors.<p>Yet another option is to place a glob of solder across 4 pins, heat them all up, and lift half the chip. The other 4 legs will be hot and soft enough to bend easily.<p><i>Finally</i> for the non-VCC connections, could follow the traces and find easier places to solder to rather than a bunch of side-by-side leads.')
