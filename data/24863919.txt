I considered RMS&#x27;s previous personal politics on pedophilia similarly deplorable and distasteful and I actively, financially support him as Chief Gnuisance because it was his personal politics and he is entitled to his view, and all humans are naturally imperfect and many of the most brilliant in some ways have the greatest weaknesses in others. I still like Roald Dahl&#x27;s  books after learning about his antisemitism and I donâ€™t resent Terry Davis over his racism.')
