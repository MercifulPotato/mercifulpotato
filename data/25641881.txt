Not only will you have a pool of IP addresses just for that reason, you&#x27;ll also likely need a few unused ones for when one of your users tanks your reputation and you have to roll them.<p>Nobody taking real money for email will use a randomly assigned IP as source. (unless it&#x27;s randomly selected and then tested for reputation before use) Mailgun and other services even allow you to book a dedicated IP just for your outgoing emails.')
