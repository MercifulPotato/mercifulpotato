In laboratory experiments, viruses saturated with mutations do not go extinct.[10] Sanford also misuses Kimura&#x27;s mutation distribution; Kimura excludes beneficial mutations because they would have too large an effect, not an insignificant one.[11] Sanford has refused to acknowledge this problem, even after being directly confronted with Kimura&#x27;s own words.[12] Further, Sanford&#x27;s assertion that there are virtually no selectable beneficial mutations is contradicted by examples of exactly that, such as lactase persistence in humans,[13] or tetherin antagonism in HIV-1 group M Vpu.[14]')
