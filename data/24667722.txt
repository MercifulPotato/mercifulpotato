The specifics are irrelevant and can sometimes even obscure basic relationships. The point is recognizing the relationship to more familiar forms of combustion and oxidation in day-to-day life; that&#x27;s how you orient yourself when you come to the question for the first time.<p>My middle school biology class would have been in the early 1990s when many of the finer details of cellular respiration weren&#x27;t in any textbooks (certainly not middle school). It wasn&#x27;t until 1996 that a critical step in ATP synthase was confirmed. But you don&#x27;t need to know anything about ATP to understand the basic role of carbon in energy extraction and respiration. Actually, now that I think about it biology classes tended to focus more on photosynthesis, which sort of makes sense historically--I suppose breaking CO2 photosynthetically was for hundreds of years the far more scientifically intriguing question, and perhaps that&#x27;s why it was emphasized so heavily in primary and secondary school biology.')
