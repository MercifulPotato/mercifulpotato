Distance doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>I think it is reasonable to charge more for larger animals. If your dog takes up a seat then a ticket price is a fair price.<p>If you have a well behaved animal it is basically just a carry-on.<p>If some flights aren&#x27;t profitable that doesn&#x27;t justify price gouging people with animals that weigh nothing and use up no jet fuel. Increase ticket prices and baggage prices. That actually makes sense.')
