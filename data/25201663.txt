So you’re left with one real killer-feature of Rust: the safety. It’s a massive feature that cascades very well into pretty much anything you do... but it’s also <i>one feature</i> really - the benefits of which might not be particularly relevant on large established projects who have probably addressed that problem a long time ago (in their own ad-hoc ways). So the cost-benefit analysis of moving an existing codebase from C&#x2F;C++ to Rust is not exactly a slam-dunk.<p>For greenfield, though, my feeling is that one should justify why <i>not</i> using Rust, at this point (when building stuff that was previously the realm of C&#x2F;C++, of course). If it’s just because of unfamiliarity and initial slow speed of development (as people learn it), it becomes an issue of institutional laziness more than a technical choice.')
