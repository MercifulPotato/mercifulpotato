More to that, I still feel like you&#x27;re responding to your imagined version of my response, and not the actual one. It feels to me like you&#x27;re creating an argument when I was merely disagreeing and presenting my reason why. I don&#x27;t really understand how the tone of this chat became so aggressive through you.<p>My sentiments to you exactly. You hyperfocused on the term &quot;reformation&quot; when it was very clear from the context and the previous 5 - 6 paragraphs I had written on the subject, that it was intended as a substitute for &quot;self improvement&quot;, &quot;self betterment&quot;, &quot;taking accountability for one&#x27;s actions&quot;. You decided to somehow interpret it as an authoritarian argument, and deliberately twisted my argument into something that you could then argue against. It was utterly fascinating and simultaneously irritating to witness how deft you were at doing it, hence the sarcasm.<p>The argument was literally just about how everything you do in public happens to affect the people it reaches. And people should be accountable for the effects of their actions in that public (or private) space.')
