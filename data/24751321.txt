Item(by='pandaman', descendants=None, kids=[24755523], score=None, time=1602475965, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24748428, text='Given that the distance between Washington and Chicago is ~950km and the speed of light is ~300,000 km&#x2F;s I have a <i>huge</i> issue with trusting anything in the article which starts with &quot; It takes seven milliseconds for this information to get to Chicago. &quot;.
