Still very very much work in progress. Happy holidays :)!<p>Uri<p>How it works:<p><pre><code>  1. Go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;room.ai, enter nickname, \n     permissions for the camera if asked or needed.\n  2. Share the room link with your opponent\n     (and additional people you want to hang out \n      with).\n  4. Whoever wants to be white makes the first\n     move. Then, the same goes for black.\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunate known issues:<p><pre><code>  0. No AI... yet.\n  1. Disconnects do happen and reconnecting reliably still needs work.\n  2. Video connections sometimes don&#x27;t initialize properly. Refresh helps and hit that &quot;turn camera on&quot; button if you see it.\n  3. May work on mobile but will likely work better on desktop : firefox, chrome, safari and opera I believe should work. Haven&#x27;t tested extensively yet.\n  4. Layout is funky.\n  5. You tell me :)...?</code></pre>')
