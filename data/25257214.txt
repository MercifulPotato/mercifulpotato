The traffic in the bay area is completely absurd. There is no rush hour. There&#x27;s a small window around 10:00am-11:30am where you can just get in the car and run somewhere real quick without sitting in it. Otherwise it turns a quick trip to the grocery store into an hour long affair. I can remember working in Oakland, and living in Pleasant Hill, and if there was an accident at the tunnel, you&#x27;re literally just sitting at the office until 8-9pm because the entire route is a parking lot. It&#x27;s the number one thing I am thankful for since moving away.')
