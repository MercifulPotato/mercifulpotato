Item(by='timr', descendants=None, kids=[25311749], score=None, time=1607124663, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306954, text='<i>&quot;Jeez. Clickbait title, tons of fallacy, like goalpost moving.&quot;</i><p>Pretty much everything in the post is true, the title isn&#x27;t clickbait, and I didn&#x27;t see any fallacy. It&#x27;s only &quot;goalpost moving&quot; if you confused the location of the goalposts in the first place. For the record: I have worked on protein folding, I did a PhD in a closely related area, and I work in computational structural biology professionally now.<p>The OP is saying that the general problem isn&#x27;t solved, and provided (IMO factual, true) explanations why there&#x27;s still a long way to go. Arguing that it&#x27;s OK <i>for some uses</i> (which is what you&#x27;re doing) is true, but not a rebuttal.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s possible to use this method to come up with models &quot;good enough&quot; for rigid-body docking, or to get the overall idea of a fold. But it&#x27;s also true that these structures aren&#x27;t going to be good enough for any kind of drug discovery, which is what TFA says.')
