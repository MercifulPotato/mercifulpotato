That&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve heard that take. I mean, obviously what killed the USSR was a failure to dictate an efficient economy (what is likely to kill the CCP as well), but the Cold War defenitely, in my opinion and in the opinion of every piece I&#x27;ve ever read on the subject, sped things up significantly.<p>&gt;As we have seen in Western democracies when their governments are more concerned with blaming external enemies, rather than fixing internal problems.<p>I think this is a skewed view based on a shallow view of most western democracies. The most publicized actions are those taked by leaders in unilateral context, which are most often related to foreign relations and military operations, and thus not related to domestic issues. However, if you look at what the vast majority of these democracies spend their time on, on a man&#x2F;hr basis, it&#x27;s solving domestic problems. The US is a prime example. Trump represented &lt;1% of the government&#x27;s actions, but got 90%+ of the media time. Meanwhile the entirety of congress was working on nothing but domestic issues.<p>&gt;Change in the CCP will have to come from movements within China. These kinds of changes take generations, and will not always result in the kind of change you would like to see.<p>Agree for the most part.<p>&gt; Even in an authoritarian country, there is still a feedback loop between public sentiment, and their ruling government<p>The fact that these feedback loops do not exist is why most authoritarian regimes fail. We are seeing the slow decay of those feedback loops in China from their more liberal economic policies 10+ years ago.<p>&gt;Strong-man anti-China posturing will not do anything to China<p>Posturing, no, but policies can and do have a large effect.<p>&gt;In the 90s, tough-on-crime was popular in America, for the same reasons, to devastating consequences.<p>It had it&#x27;s problems, but the falling crime rate over that time was in part because of these policies. NYC is a perfect example of both sides of that coin.<p>&gt; Today, we&#x27;ve moved on to tough-on-China (which will result in devastating consequences if it ever moves past rhetoric, and into a shooting war.)<p>Well yeah. No one wants a war. It would pretty much destroy earth at this point. I think if you want to point to rising risk though, most of the blame needs to go to China itself. It&#x27;s ever expanding territorial claims are the largest risk factor. We can talk about how the US lays claim to a large part of the Pacific, but then we have to start talking about  the validity of most of the world&#x27;s borders, so that&#x27;s kind of moot in my opinion.')
