For example having a lot of metadata columns has different performance implications than having a high cardinality of actual measurements (although it&#x27;s been long enough since I&#x27;ve used Influx I don&#x27;t remember what those differences actually are)<p>If you&#x27;re used to writing SQL, TimescaleDB is much easier to write queries with although if you get over the learning curve both of the query languages in Influx seem very powerful<p>One notable advantage of Influx is its integrations with other tools for ingest and visualization, and it seems like 2.0 is doubling down on that')
