It seems fairly well targeted at the 200k Colombians that are employed in the production of cocaine.<p>These people have multiple generations that have grown up with this industry being a fantastic way to make a living. The cat and mouse game of destroying the growing fields has led to an expanded destruction of Columbiaâ€™s rain forrest.<p>To me this policy seems like a social policy to bring these people on the right side of the law, limit the additives, and most important have a hand in distribution.<p>Honestly, the point the author makes about protecting the lives of Columbians is included by necessity, but it is argued weakly. It seems that other comments seemed to have latched onto this idea.<p>To me, this seems like a pretty innovative policy for a Columbia.')
