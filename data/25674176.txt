I&#x27;ve got a friend who sold his bitcoin recently to buy a house.<p>Yeah I&#x27;m not surprised about moves like this. 35k+ is when things start to get interesting.<p>A few years ago I grabbed one at $1,200 and then sold it like 6 months later for around $1,800 because I was like &quot;cool a 50% gain&quot;.<p>If I had held onto it, selling at 35-40k seems reasonable because even after 15% capital gains tax that&#x27;s enough to live comfortably in the US for an entire year. That&#x27;s a life changing amount of money.')
