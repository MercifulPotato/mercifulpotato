Plenty of what makes Explorer what it is aren’t part of the actual control that both Explorer and file picker dialogs use.<p>To me, thinking of file picker dialogs as literal Explorer windows is as contrived as file picker dialogs <i>not</i> offering full CRUD abilities — except one approach is vastly friendlier and safer.<p>I understand the technical decision, too, but there’s nothing that could prevent Windows from making file picker dialog behaviour non-destructive.')
