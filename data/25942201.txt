It is short and clearly written, a pdf of a few pages.<p>As Protonmail admits, &quot;it&#x27;s not explicitly stated in the resolution&quot; that the proposal &quot;seek[s] to allow law enforcement access to encrypted platforms via backdoors&quot;. Protonmail argues, however, that this &quot;is widely understood&quot; to be its aim.<p>I am disappointed that Protonmail provides no evidence that this is really the underlying purpose of the proposal. (They do point out that previous proposals did contain such wording, but this in my view is insufficient - the explicit removal of such words can be called progress, after all!)<p>So what am I missing? Can someone here maybe provide evidence that this is really the actual intent of the proposal?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consilium.europa.eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;press&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;encryption-council-adopts-resolution-on-security-through-encryption-and-security-despite-encryption&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consilium.europa.eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;press&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2020...</a>')
