You can also connect to Chrome and steal the cookies directly, wrap terminal to install pty loggers, backdoor ssh and so on.</i><p>&gt; <i>The real point of wayland security is you can safely run multiple user accounts on the same desktop. And the LD_PRELOAD tricks (or PATH tricks etc..) do not work across accounts, unless you are doing something stupid.</i><p>If this indeed be the point, then I ask you to come with a single official <i>Wayland</i> reference that promotes it as such and phrases it as such, as that is not the point the advocates make at all, and they phrase it simply as “<i>One can no longer be keylogged by malware.</i>”, which is a very dubious claim.<p>Once malicious software has been executed as one&#x27;s user, that is the end of it, and one&#x27;s entire account can now be treated as forfeit, and <i>Wayland</i> does nothing, and cannot do anything due to the fundamental designs of Unix to stop that.<p>Furthermore, there are already quite a few mechanisms on <i>X11</i> to achieve what you illustrated. — that does not mean that <i>Wayland</i> is useless, it simply means that it does not provide a solution to any existing problem in this specific field that is not provided elsewhere.<p>There are two common claims that are very frequently made by official sources such as GNOME that are false:<p>- X11 <i>cannot be sandboxed.</i><p>- <i>With</i> Wayland<i>, one cannot be keylogged.</i><p>&gt; <i>that&#x27;s it -- this will stop this attack, and many others, cold. And will not require any SELinux.</i><p>Yes, never running malicious code with the privileges of one&#x27;s user would stop it from gaining access to said user, but the promises of <i>Wayland</i> are protections even if the former have happened. — this is false advertisement.')
