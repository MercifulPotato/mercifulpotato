I just didn&#x27;t want to reproduce the whole post in my reply.<p>&gt; So then you should trust literally no software or hardware.<p>I give free software the benefit of the doubt. I don&#x27;t trust hardware. It sucks that hardware costs billions to manufacture. Centralized resources are easily targeted by governments.
