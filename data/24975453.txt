(They aren&#x27;t, but ignore that for the moment.)  If you say something good about Java, there are a lot of people here who have used Java, and some of them have bad impressions that they came to through some pain.<p>But if you say that Common Lisp is great, there are fewer people who have really used it, so fewer people who have used it and didn&#x27;t like it.  And since fewer people got into it unless they really wanted to, it&#x27;s easier to say &quot;You didn&#x27;t really understand it, then, or you would have liked it.&quot;  The number of people who can say &quot;No, I really got it, and I still didn&#x27;t like it&quot; is relatively small.<p>So far, that&#x27;s just demographics.  But then you get into the language itself.  Java isn&#x27;t an <i>exciting</i> language.  It&#x27;s not <i>fun</i>.  It&#x27;s kind of corporate and bland.  There aren&#x27;t many people who are really <i>enthusiastic</i> about Java - nor does Java give them reason to be.')
