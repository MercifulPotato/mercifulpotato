I had to build and install an older version of LLVM that would work with the bindings, several times.<p>Note: this was years ago, situation may have improved.<p>I understand that LLVM API doesn&#x27;t change significantly between versions any more so the work required to update the bindings to a newer version shouldn&#x27;t be huge for the maintainers of the bindings. But for an end user like me there was quite a lot of manual steps to get my project and the dependencies building.<p>There&#x27;s always the option of emitting LLVM IR by writing text, but that doesn&#x27;t give you the ability to do JITting and a REPL and so on.')
