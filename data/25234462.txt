For those with intensive back-end logic and only light interface needs, HTMX offers a incremental way to add front-end interactivity without having to take the deep dive into Javascript frameworks. Longer term, the concept of encoding server interaction in hypertext seems rather novel to me. Perhaps this approach may be one of many missing pieces towards an ecosystem of interoperable hypertext-based web components?')
