This has always been the case and nothing new. And i really don&#x27;t care about your views, note from the start i have explicitly noted that you may be right or wrong. It&#x27;s just that what you&#x27;ve said about having views that other people had in the 90&#x27;s isn&#x27;t proof that your views are within social norms. You may be outside them or you may be within them but &quot;Someone X years ago had the same views as me&quot; isn&#x27;t a defense to be called outside the norm.')
