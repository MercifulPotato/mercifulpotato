However, that&#x27;s more due to the fact that working from home does not fit with the way I want to live, rather than any actual logistical hurdle.<p>At the same time though, I highly doubt many companies in the future will go 100% WFH, so all these discussions seem rather academic to me. I feel like the people that want to work from home will get more opportunity to do so, and the people that don&#x27;t, won&#x27;t have to. Easy.')
