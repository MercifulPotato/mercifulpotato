Item(by='johnchristopher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602005995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24697920, text='&gt; The industry is absolutely inefficient when you consider what inputs required: pesticides, seed, machinery, fossil fuels for planting&#x2F;harvesting&#x2F;transport, massive government subsidies -- not to mention the depletion of the soils that come along with it. It is not even monetarily efficient: take for example the dumping of millions of gallons of milk to match quotas this past year. It&#x27;s far from efficient.<p>&gt; I would not consider something that requires so much input to be &quot;more efficient at feeding a person&quot;. It is however a system that is efficient at feeding mass amounts of people -- if you ignore the inputs.<p>I do agree but at the end of the day all that matters to most people regarding food is the price in the supermarket aisles.<p>I have fun memories of my SO digging up her father&#x27;s potatoes and getting back from the garden with 5 of them “damn, that took a lot of muscle to get them out of the ground”. They were really good though. Gertrude Betrand&#x27;s stuff.')
