You are right, we must be careful not to make the review cumbersome. Letting the user setting the frequency makes sense since it will vary between product categories.\nIn addition, if the user has nothing to add, a simple click on a button &quot;Condition unchanged&quot; should be enough. That&#x27;s definitely something I will discuss with the UX designer.')
