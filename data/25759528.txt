But either way you lose a lot of the benefits that being officially in the Debian repos would bring. Devs want to distribute their software to users, and they aren&#x27;t going to chase down rabbit holes to get it packaged to comply with every different distributions set of available dependency versions.<p>Really this idea that a distro (even a large well maintained one like Debian) has the resources to package a set of known versions of go&#x2F;node packages for common open source software seems wrong? If they aren&#x27;t going to package every exact version that&#x27;s required, how is it going to be possible to test for compatibility? There is no way. And no dev is going to downgrade some random dependency of their app just to comply with with Debian&#x27;s set of available versions.<p>Developers hate this versioning issue with languages like C\\C++ on Linux, it&#x27;s a huge pain. And that&#x27;s partially why dependency management in languages like Go&#x2F;Node work the way they do. A multitude of distros with slightly different versions of every lib you use is a huge headache to dev for, so people have designed languages to avoid that issue.')
