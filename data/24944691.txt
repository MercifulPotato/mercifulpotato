I believe in truth. My point is that the news industry isn&#x27;t in the business of truth. They have never been. The news is in the propaganda business. They exist to form opinions. It&#x27;s why pretty much every news company around the world was formed by a politician, banker, industrialist or government. If trump created &quot;Real News Company&quot;, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d say only the naive would view such a company as a purveyor of truth right?<p>&gt; You might want to watch this video to see why that&#x27;s a dangerous attitude, and one that plays into the hands of morally unscrupulous actors<p>You might also look up the history of the news industry, manufacturing consent, etc. And the morally unscrupulous actors are the major news companies.<p>The real danger is not from those who question the news, it&#x27;s from those who blindly view it as the truth.')
