Obviously that was quite the scoop, which is exactly what newspapers love and how they make money.<p>A free press loves embarrassing governments by showing them doing stupid stuff. The press in Europe is a mockery of a free press because too many journalists at some point decided that the EU is a morally and ideologically pure vision of the future, so they just stopped reporting on all the bad stuff it does even when it&#x27;d make for interesting stories, whilst continuing to do such reports on their local governments. Except in the UK, where parts of the press retained their traditional role.<p><i>I think if this was true, nobody would bother printing them. It&#x27;s not like they make much money.</i><p>Left wing super-pro-EU papers often don&#x27;t indeed. Other papers do make money, plenty enough to justify making them. The Daily Mail made Â£72 million in profits in 2020 despite COVID. The Guardian bled money and announced job losses.')
