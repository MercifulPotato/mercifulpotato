Concurrency simply means that you can execute several tasks over a period of time, but it can happen on the same compute unit (so even within one thread). Tasks could be interleaved and still all progress over time.<p>I guess some ideal usage is a combination of parallelism and concurrency, but using a separate thread for each task isn&#x27;t necessarily the most optimal method, because threads have their gotchas like context switching and etc.')
