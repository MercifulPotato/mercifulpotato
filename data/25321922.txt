Each bitcoin is currently divisible to 100 million satoshis and it could be further subdivided if necessary.<p>Regarding not knowing how much exists, at least with Bitcoin, that&#x27;s not true. Anyone running a full node has a complete copy of every transaction going back to 2009. And the generation of each and every block that contains newly created bitcoin.<p>We would know <i>exactly</i> how much money exists if we were on a Bitcoin standard.')
