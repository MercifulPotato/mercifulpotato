I think maybe we should stop synonimising &quot;business&quot; with &quot;management&quot;. The rewrites I&#x27;ve seen are due to changing &quot;business&quot; (read: management) requirements, that had little to do with an actually changing business. These were new &quot;hotshot&quot; execs coming in and wanting to expand their influence or make their mark, and the best way they saw fit was dragging developers into it.<p>Your mileage might vary. I&#x27;m open to people with longer or different experience than my own having observed another reality, as this is just anecdata.')
