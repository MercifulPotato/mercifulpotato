Your ex&#x27;s anger treated you as someone <i>capable</i> of recognizing having done wrong, because if you didn&#x27;t, you wouldn&#x27;t be manipulable.<p>(That&#x27;s not the same thing as saying you actually <i>did</i> wrong. Just that if you couldn&#x27;t imagine having done wrong, her anger wouldn&#x27;t have been effective, and she would have chosen a different manipulation tactic. Or alternatively, your ex&#x27;s manipulative behavior may be distinct from anger - perhaps she found the appearance of anger to be useful, and so she <i>acted</i> angry.)<p>This ties into a bigger picture: should we choose to be someone who can be victimized? I was cheated on and lied to, and in examining what I could have done differently, I concluded that yes, I would rather be someone trusting than someone with their defenses fully up.')
