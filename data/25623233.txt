You design a survey with whatever data you want to collect, then the app gives you a notification at whatever interval you configure.  A couple taps and you have a sample point about your life, which gets appended to a Google Sheet or similar, and maybe some in-app visualization of trends.<p>I&#x27;ll probably never actually get to it, but it would be perfect for a thing like this.')
