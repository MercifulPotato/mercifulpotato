Item(by='djaque', descendants=None, kids=[24671160, 24670896], score=None, time=1601691110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24666608, text='&gt; hereâ€™s the paper, which is published in Nature, that famous scientific tabloid.<p>One annoyance I&#x27;ve had with this whole discussion are all of the people saying it was published in Nature.  This article even makes that mistake which I think is pretty egregious given that it looks like an academic website and the authors should know better.<p>The article was not published in Nature.  It was published in Nature Communication.  This may sound like a nitpick to an outsider but is a world of difference.  Nature&#x27;s impact factor is 42 versus Nature Communication&#x27;s which is 12 and is wildly less selective than Nature proper.  They are two completely different journals and the only similarity is ownership and a word in their name.<p>Edit: I just saw all of the comments on the article itself noting this.  Glad I&#x27;m not the only one.')
