However, some games can have _extremely_ interesting emerging content, e.g. as seen in Dwarf Fortress and RimWorld.  Since much of the content is procedurally generated, at the moment we are left with text descriptions of things.  I can easily see a future where the game worlds are automatically fleshed using these types of techniques, and it would be for the better.<p>Also, on a purely economic scale, automating some aspects of art asset creation for games would be a complete game changer.  It would probably up the art capabilities of indie game developers quite a bit, although it&#x27;s hard to predict these types of things (in the sense that it might benefit AAA developers even more - who knows).')
