It’s more complete, less information is lost (sampling is never lossless though) but there’s no difference in precision.<p>If i have IQ data then i can derive the data that would be preserved by any other modulation (phase, frequency, amplitude shifting). I can’t recover the original IQ samples from a sampled FM signal.')
