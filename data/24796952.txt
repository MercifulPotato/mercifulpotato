People will say “well they don’t really _mean_ that”, etc. but they should be taken at their word. They do.<p>And who is &quot;they&quot;?  Specifically.  Not some amorphous &quot;group&quot; like &quot;progressives&quot; or &quot;the left&quot; or &quot;SJWs&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not being snarky here.  It seems to me that one of the most damaging trends we&#x27;re seeing is equating a hundred million (and more) people with the loudest, most obnoxious and nasty .01%.<p>Painting folks with such a broad brush is a recipe for division, conflict and mayhem.<p>Assuming that someone with a Trump bumper sticker is a dyed-in-the-wool racist and white supremacist fascist is stupid in the extreme.  And so is assuming that someone with a Biden bumper sticker is a totalitarian monster bent on total mind control.<p>People are individuals and should be assessed and measured as such.<p>It&#x27;s intellectually lazy to just stick anyone who doesn&#x27;t share your beliefs about Trump or Biden or abortion or gun rights or any of a hundred other contentious issues into a big box called &quot;enemies.&quot;<p>And when you do so, you play right into the hands of the tiny group of folks who want to profit (politically, economically or both) from dividing us.<p><i>You</i> have the choice not to do so.  It&#x27;s up to you and me and everyone else to step up and judge people on their individual actions, not some invented &quot;in&quot; or &quot;out&quot; group.')
