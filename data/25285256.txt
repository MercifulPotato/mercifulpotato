That&#x27;s a valuable selection effect for the government, because it means if you can find out that someone is using a non-custodial wallet, it means ~waggles eyebrows~ they probably do have something to hide. You can get a warrant to seize their stuff and figure out what&#x27;s going on. Which solves the main problem the government has with cryptocurrencies -- that they can be used to easily hide illegal activity.')
