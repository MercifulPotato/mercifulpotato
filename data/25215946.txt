This stage0 gets you a basic C compiler. An impressive achievement for sure. I don’t see how it really solves anything though.<p>More generally each language would need it’s own path from this basic assembler to a compiler implementing that language in C which doesn’t necessarily exist. While initial versions of the Rust compiler were written in C, more recent versions are self hosted and rely on the previous version. This goes for projects like LLVM too since it requires a c++14 compiler to start with.<p>A better approach is to figure out how to cross compile stage0 and how to make sure the cross compilation step can be trusted. Going the approach of trying to build a “trusted” path from source is noble but IMO ultimately futile.<p>This is what I mean when I say this as an unsolved problem. It may be getting better but there are fundamental unsolved challenges to this exploration and very little guarantee the task can be accomplished in the first place (ie no mathematical theory that might present a path to follow rather than just trying to accomplish it through sheer effort). Some small part of the problem might get solved but that’s very different from saying that any package will be verifiable in this way.')
