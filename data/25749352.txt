The top of the file contains the latest task I have to finish, and the details, including the device&#x2F;machine involved, files, what I was doing, and what needs to be done.<p>When something of higher priority comes up, I enter that at the top.<p>When things are done, I add &quot;DONE&quot; against those tasks.<p>Once in a while, I clean up all the &quot;DONE&quot; tasks.<p>It is a mangled mess, but it has helped me survive for one decade now.')
