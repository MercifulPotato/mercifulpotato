Item(by='smichel17', descendants=None, kids=[25525387], score=None, time=1608769259, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25522322, text='&gt; Look how often people lose patience with each other online.<p>I think this is largely an issue of scale.<p>Say you are driving on a single-lane, one-way road, which ends at a T intersection with a stop sign. The other road is also 1-way, 1-lane, and does not have a stop sign. It has a traffic light around 20 car lengths after your road. You are waiting for a chance to turn in; the other road has a fair amount of traffic, but moving slowly since the light was red. A car stops (or moves very slowly) to make room for you to cut in, and waves you on. Very nice for you, and the cars behind you are not inconvenienced much.<p>In my experience, this kind of thing happens relatively frequently in rural areas, and quite the opposite in cities. For myself, that&#x27;s largely because in the city there&#x27;s <i>always</i> a car looking to get in, and if I stopped for them all, I&#x27;d never get anywhere.<p>In person, I am quite patient. Online, still relatively patient I guess, but less so, especially with strangers. There&#x27;s just so many people who I could be talking to, that if I gave everyone I talked to the same attention that I do irl, I wouldn&#x27;t have time to do anything else! My impatience translates more into &quot;ghosting&quot; a conversation if the other person isn&#x27;t getting my point, vs snapping at them, but it&#x27;s the same cause.<p>Sometimes I write long (as in time to compose) comments like this one, but that&#x27;s partially for myself, to verify that my thoughts are logically consistent.')
