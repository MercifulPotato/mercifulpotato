The solution to online privacy and data mining is not collecting it all in a central repository, it is not collecting it at all.<p>Further, and I realise this will come off as alarmist, but, what then if the software suffers a 0-day? All that data will then be nicely aggregated for a bad actor. Somehow, knowing that there is perhaps a non trivial amount of work to be done to collect data and compile a profile from many different sources feels safer than putting it all in one place.')
