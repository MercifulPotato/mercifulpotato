Really, it&#x27;s designed to help makers and &quot;microbusinesses&quot; get their products online and selling quickly, without having to build a website, pay extortionate fees, and navigate the minefield of SEO, SEM, and social media advertising.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched it and am attempting to attract small merchants from anywhere to sign-up and list a few products. Similarly, I&#x27;m trying to ramp up some attention from folks that just want to browse products in an Instagram-like feed.<p>Ultimately, I&#x27;m going to need scale if I really want to start solving the problems I&#x27;m setting out to, but I figured showing it off to HN was a good way to start getting thoughts and feedback. :)<p>Hope you like it.')
