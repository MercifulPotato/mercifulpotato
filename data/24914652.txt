Identifying where the market has born a bad actor is par for HN.<p>It isn&#x27;t widespread knowledge that Apple is actively engaging in practices they market against. It&#x27;s also interesting to note that they seem to get worse each release and people still haven&#x27;t been acknowledging the reality.<p>The knowledge that Exxon is promoting anti-global warming hand waving is ubiquitous.<p>The perspective presented is to the point that it&#x27;s marketing is laughably contradictory. It&#x27;s good fun for both those who visit Apple stores (and didn&#x27;t realize what happened) and those who don&#x27;t for various reasons...like avoiding planned obsolescence.')
