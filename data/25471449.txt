It&#x27;s not as advertised, and for some of the most standardized systems (consoles), it doesn&#x27;t even work. That&#x27;s really bad on CDPR. False advertising is unacceptable to some.<p>2) This surprised nobody. Acting surprised is like being surprised you big mac doesn&#x27;t look like the marketing materials. That&#x27;s on the people pre-ordering and buying day of. If I bought it today, having seen all the reception, that&#x27;s on me. Some people are extending &quot;that&#x27;s on you&quot; that to pre-orderers.<p>3) It seems to work as well as any other AAA launch day game for players with certain setups. Some people see their footage or have that experience and think others are just being unrealistic expecting the big mac from the ad.<p>Personally, I feel like it&#x27;s a friend complaining about getting scammed on craigslist after ignoring everyone telling them to do due diligence to make sure it&#x27;s what you expect. Like, that really sucks and fuck scammers, but this was easily preventable, so I&#x27;m going to roll my eyes a little.')
