Item(by='kmclean', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609940682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25655620, text='&gt; requires a lot more effort than just avoiding using google.com, youtube.com, gmail.com, etc.<p>Yeah this is fair! I don&#x27;t want to give the impression that this is all it takes to get Google to stop stalking you. But I do think it at least helps. I found a lot of the chatter in the de-googling community to a bit purist and defeatist at times, but maybe I went too far the other way, here. I want to encourage people to do the same without thinking it&#x27;s all hopeless or doesn&#x27;t make any impact because Google&#x27;s gonna get you one way or another, but I also don&#x27;t want to paint an unrealistic picture, as if this is all it takes to wash our hands of Google&#x27;s reach.<p>I updated the post to reflect this.')
