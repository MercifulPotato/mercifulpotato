Item(by='awb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610338432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25722786, text='&gt; To be hyperfocused on the free speech or &quot;big brother&quot; aspect of these bans, not the fact that a small group of rioters were just a few feet away from irreversibly staining American history<p>This. Violence, intimidation and death are the ultimate forms of censorship. Much more so than having to switch your digital payment processor or having to self-host your blog or social media app.<p>Germany decided after WWII that it was better to mass-censor Naziism than it was to let Nazis freely organize or spread their ideas again. It&#x27;s not that Germany doesn&#x27;t like free speech, it&#x27;s that Naziism and free speech are diametrically opposed and forced to make a choice, they choose free speech.<p>It seems like a contradiction where censorship promotes free speech, but it all depends on your timeline. In the short term banning Nazis limits free speech, in the long run banning Nazis increases free speech.<p>When we give violent groups space to grow and organize, we&#x27;re more anti-free speech than we realize because the capital riots are the inevitable arc (and only the opening act) for very small groups to violently oppress large numbers of peaceful citizens who love democracy.')
