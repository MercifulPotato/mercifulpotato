The amount of chipsets that pretty much force you to use an outdated compiler toolchain with some shitty unmaintained Eclipse plugin, or Visual Studio 2008 or whatever outdated piece of shit, is baffling.<p>I&#x27;ll never understand why professional embedded developers just suck this up. I know large companies that develop enormous C codebases in stuff like Notepad++ or SlickEdit with ancient toolchains, no way to attach a debugger, and no way to automate tests. When I moved from embedded programming to web dev, I moved to an environment where people care about their own productivity. I can&#x27;t understate how different that is, it was a breath of fresh air.')
