Item(by='Arnavion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604204208, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957086, text='&gt;I quoted you.<p>No you did not. Nowhere did I say that the books written by Dinanath Batra were pretty innocuous. If you had quoted me, it would&#x27;ve been quite obvious I didn&#x27;t say what you claimed I did, because a proper quote would look like:<p>&gt;&gt;I found some pages from the series but they&#x27;re pretty innocuous.<p>&quot;some pages from the series&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t get any clearer than that.<p>&gt;Read the preface of the book, and the story number 52. How is that &quot;pretty innocuous&quot;, and especally a book that is aimed at kids?<p>I already summarized what the preface says in my original comment. And #52 is not in the pages I linked to. The only ones are #55 and the first half of #56. #55 has a Mughal emperor praising a Hindu man for giving the emperor&#x27;s daughter an Islamic education despite his religion, and #56 starts off with the son of a Naval officer in a war between England and France before it is cut off. I say again, that just these one-and-a-half stories that I have access to are pretty innocuous.<p>&gt;No wonder caste discrimination has carried on for centuries in India with learned people like you able to charitably justify the oppression.<p>Incidentally, the rest of the comment that you&#x27;re misquoting clarified pretty clearly that I&#x27;m against the story that the Aljazeera video talks about. But you do you; don&#x27;t let facts and reading comprehension get in the way of your spiel and slander.')
