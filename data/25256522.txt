I also quite liked a Ray Bradbury short story that I believe was called &quot;The Homecoming&quot;. However I had to look it up. I think that was it.<p>I used to love short stories, but I don&#x27;t see as much of them anymore. I think that some of that has been swallowed by the more serial novellas that I see on platforms like kindle unlimited. I&#x27;ve long felt that this is incentivized by the ways that the platform pays writers (percentage of the book read). It encourages writers to write shorter gripping stories. That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing. I&#x27;ve been going through quite a bit of great pulp fiction recently, but it is a bit of a departure from the more traditional novel or short story.')
