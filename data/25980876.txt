D-Amphetamine is heavier on the dopamine and NE, MDMA is heavier on the serotonin, but it&#x27;s still a dopamine releaser, which contributes to its addictive qualities. What MDMA does, neurochemically speaking, is not that far from what methamphetamine does. Meth is much more addictive for a number of reasons, including the way people typically consume it (smoking vs oral), but MDMA is no toy.')
