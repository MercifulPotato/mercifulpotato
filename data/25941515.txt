Item(by='massysett', descendants=None, kids=[25941589, 25949220], score=None, time=1611840740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25940799, text='Yes, for just this reason I am beginning to remove my projects from Github.  I have &quot;given back&quot; by posting my Haskell libraries to Hackage, where they may be used and inspected by all.  I&#x27;m not going to &quot;give back&quot; by maintaining software to the specifications of others, free of charge.<p>This level of &quot;giving back&quot; is not trivial: I have often benefitted from seeing the source code of other projects and deciding I don&#x27;t want to use the library, or seeing the code and deciding to modify it or take a different approach - or seeing the library and realizing that I wanted to try something similar, but this library shows me why I shouldn&#x27;t do it.  Maybe others will similarly benefit from seeing my stuff.  If they see my stuff and think it&#x27;s deficient, wonderful!  Alter it to make it fit your needs, or use it as an inspiration for your own fresh rewrite.<p>But I&#x27;m not maintaining software for other people.  God bless people who do; that&#x27;s wonderful.  But it&#x27;s perfectly OK to just post stuff up in case someone else wants to use it.  When people see the code on Github they think &quot;oh I can make feature requests&quot; or &quot;I can send a PR.&quot;  Fair enough - Github is &quot;social coding&quot; after all.  So I just won&#x27;t put code on Github.')
