Of course if you play an 808 and 909 next to one another, they don&#x27;t sound the same. But if you play a random piece of music and ask a casual listener what drum machine it features, I don&#x27;t think they would be able to tell you. (Unless, perhaps, it&#x27;s an 808!)<p>Even something that synth nuts know to be as unique and genre-defining as a TB-303, to the casual listener it isn&#x27;t distinguishable from an SH-101 or any other analog monosynth. People might know what an acid line sounds like, but they don&#x27;t tend to have the same kind of ear that musicians do to be able to spot one synth model from the other in the final mix.<p>When I think about a synth so distinctive and widespread that it changed modern music, I think about something that average people who aren&#x27;t musicians can identify. The DX7 might have been that, since it was the first synthesizer that really went mass-market. All the synths before that were &quot;niche&quot; instruments, but the DX7 made synth music mainstream, so perhaps it was very identifiable. But then the floodgates opened, so it might only have lasted for a few years.<p>The 808, though, I think a lot of people still really know and understand what kind of &quot;sound&quot; that is. But I could be wrong.')
