They don&#x27;t want to defect.<p>A public group actually makes it easier for people to avoid defecting. It&#x27;s very difficult for a job candidate to talk to employers about this when you&#x27;re just some lone weirdo with idiosyncratic principles. It&#x27;s much easier to have that discussion when there&#x27;s a public group of people you can point to with the same principles. There&#x27;s strength in numbers.<p>Consider it a kind of &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; for interviews. You wouldn&#x27;t say that can&#x27;t work because people defect. Yes, people defect and drink again, but they joined AA in order to avoid drinking, and the purpose of the group is to help them with the goal of not drinking. And also to remove the private shame of admitting a problem, by showing publicly that it&#x27;s a very common problem. This is not a perfect analogy by any means, but the gist is similar.')
