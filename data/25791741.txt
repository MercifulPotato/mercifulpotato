Item(by='jdbernard', descendants=None, kids=[25791925], score=None, time=1610723149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25791452, text='&gt; Javascript is not a beginner language anymore.<p>Why not? You can still write vanilla JS the same way you could decades ago without much (any?) change.<p>&gt; It has a lot of edge cases and traps that defeat the average person.<p>It&#x27;s always had that. In fact, I think the reason it feels less like a beginner language is that the solutions we&#x27;ve created to handle the edge-cases and traps have been solved for professionals. It&#x27;s more that the way we teach it has changed. It&#x27;s now a &quot;professional&quot; tool, so most content out there is aimed at people endeavoring to become professionals, needing to deal with all the complex realities of professional-grade problems. But you can still teach it in the same beginner-friendly way you could in the early 2000&#x27;s.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this teaching my son (using JavaScript). My instinct is to direct him to use all of the techniques I use because it&#x27;s the &quot;right&quot; way. But a beginner doesn&#x27;t really care about the problems that the &quot;right&quot; way solves. They don&#x27;t even know about them yet. So it&#x27;s overkill. Forget Typescript, webpack, eslint, Angular, node, etc., let&#x27;s just write everything in one HTML file (not even using &lt;script&gt; to include a separate .js file yet) and focus on the thing he&#x27;s interested in making. We&#x27;ll get to all that other stuff eventually, and then he&#x27;ll actually have enough foundation and context to understand and appreciate (not to say all the complexity we&#x27;ve built is perfect).')
