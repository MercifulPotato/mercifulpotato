It looks like a backdoor. Anyone competent writing that code would be doing so because they wanted the backdoor. But there&#x27;s no reason to assume Telegram&#x27;s authors are competent unnecessarily, and competence in UI design doesn&#x27;t imply competence in security. And it&#x27;s also a rather obvious-looking backdoor, anyone competent would presumably try to hide it better. Then again, the NSA backdoor in Dual-EC-DRBG was pointed out before anyone started using the spec and not that well hidden, and the NSA are generally considered competent.')
