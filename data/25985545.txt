To settle debts, B will have to buy a widget from C, return it to him, and then buy it again and return it to A. The widget isn&#x27;t &quot;tainted&quot; by being at one point borrowed, anybody buying it can lend it out.  Doing so can create more IOUs than there are widgets.<p>Imagine getting in a circle with all of your friends, you have a dollar and the person on your right borrows it from you, then the person on their right borrows from them until you get around the circle and you borrow the dollar from the person on your left.  There was only ever one dollar but now there are as many IOUs as people in the circle. That&#x27;s of course a silly thing to happen, but if you rearrange it to make it messier the result is the same, more IOUs than there are things to be borrowed.')
