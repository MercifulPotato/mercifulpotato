I am reminded of this every time I start work on my Dell machine running Windows 10, which is also maybe mostly dead, but not dead enough?  Microsoft seems to still occupy living spaces in the enterprise desktop marketplace.  So what exactly is mean by death here?  Innovation? Dominance? Marketshare?<p>And death where?  The application space?  The cloud space? Most comments I&#x27;ve seen here suggest Microsoft still lingers in these domains.  Its tentacles still manage to reach Cthulhu-like into spaces that weren&#x27;t expected.')
