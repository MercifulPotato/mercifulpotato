Instead of evil Skynet, suppose the entity resurrecting long-dead brains is a benevolent entity. As such, it would avoid resurrecting people against their will. How would it determine which people wanted to be resurrected? One method would be to scan the memories for events such as accepting our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. People who did that would be resurrected because it&#x27;s obvious they want to be resurrected. Atheists who spent their lives preaching oblivion would be left alone, since resurrection would obviously torment them with cognitive dissonance :)')
