You&#x27;d better have money for a good lawyer or good legal insurance if you plan on sharing your local Gitlab with such code.<p>One thing I considered is getting myself an instance of a small Gitlab clone with little attack surface and hosting the code on TOR. Ignoring the potential ethical issues, that should provide good defence against legal repercussions from groups like the RIAA and the MPAA. There&#x27;s always a possibility that you&#x27;d get Kim Dotcom&#x27;d if your code gets popular enough, though.')
