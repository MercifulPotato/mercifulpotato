Communities stop scaling because of it (see nixos&#x2F;nixpkgs) because it does not allow horizontal scaling at all - thousands of &quot;PRs&quot; open, nobody feeling responsible and slowdown overall.<p>Having a tool that provides only an &quot;overlay&quot; over the workflow git wants to be used with, and that&#x27;s what sourcehut is, but not a replacement for it (which is what github is), is refreshing and promising!')
