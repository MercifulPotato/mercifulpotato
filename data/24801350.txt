How would you approach things if you were in my shoes?<p>1. If someone is selling a course on FB or YT, that business is dead and not worth pursuing because otherwise that person would be doing it themselves. FBA, drop-shipping and real estate are the big three.<p>I&#x27;d accept an argument for RE, but that&#x27;s not a casual thing to get into, easy to blow your cash and you need to go long-term. Flipping wholesales is one I&#x27;ve heard bad things about.<p>2. You need more &#x27;at-bats&#x27;. I am not sure the velocity you had with your previous Saas ventures, but launching full products every 6 - 12 months isn&#x27;t going to cut it. In addition, when products aren&#x27;t gaining traction after 1 - 2 months, you need to cut losses and move on. I have fallen into this trap twice now, of thinking a product just needs a bit more tweaking. Both of those projects have been been put on the backburner, so nothing says you can&#x27;t keep the idea but do it later when you have more resources, research, eyes, whatever.<p>You need to launch smaller products faster. Target niches rather than big markets. You want to be going after small markets where no VC-backed companies are. A $10k MRR market is worthless to VC, but worth a lot to a single person. Caveat: You could carve a niche out of a VC-backed company and eat their lunch on that segment, by doing things that don&#x27;t scale &#x2F; serving that market better by building specifically for them.<p>Check out Pieter Levels (levels.io) and the wider indie maker community, if you haven&#x27;t already.<p>3. Focus on a specific market. I see some indie makers say they don&#x27;t have a market, but they pretty much always do. You want compounding returns rather than launching a lot of diverse products where your social media and previous gains have to be thrown out.<p>You want content marketing for product A, which you may shut down in a month, to bring you people who will be interested in product C, D, E...<p>You don&#x27;t need a specific niche, but I&#x27;ve realized it would be better to focus on a community or general interest, rather than launching tons of products that have nothing to do with each other.')
