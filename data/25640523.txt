The rules are stay home unless you reasonably cannot do so. That&#x27;s what he said. He didn&#x27;t give a prescriptive set of rules because we live in a common law society. What else do you want?<p>Stay home. Unless you reasonably cannot reasonably do so.<p>If you have no common sense and aren&#x27;t sure what is reasonable then you can argue it with a magistrate.<p>Maybe err on the side of caution if you aren&#x27;t sure?')
