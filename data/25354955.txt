Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607484018, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25354110, text='<i>&gt; Unfortunately that whole business unit got canned and the code is now gathering dust somewhere :&#x2F; would have loved to open source that one</i><p>I&#x27;d encourage you to reach out and ask for permission to release it. In the past I&#x27;ve found that the sticking point was usually copyright assignment rather than the release per-se (with a side helping of worry over hidden IP violations), so get them to release a tarball under a permissive license like MIT&#x2F;BSD, even if your intention is to immediately fork it.<p>Basically, if you can manage to do the work for them so they can just rubber stamp the release, you can probably get it done.')
