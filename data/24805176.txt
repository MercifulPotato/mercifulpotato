I once had a temperature&#x2F;humidity sensor, but never figured out if it was analog or digital (it had three prong. \n someone in field thought it could be digital).  What would be some ways&#x2F;tooling needed you could use to independently test this out?<p>2. In&#x2F;Out on embedded boards is any suggested way to capture reads (or write), for example raw data?  What about the other way around?<p>3. Which board here might be good to practice (or something else) doing a hello world on making device drivers.  Something on easy, learning side and possibly practical that interacts with a real device.<p>Thx!')
