Yes, don’t waste time like OP did, but you’re allowed to use your judgement to at least lay down some of the train tracks before you slam the throttle on the fully loaded train to 100%.<p>And no, I don’t advocate bike shedding on “code quality” for months before touching anything that matters. I still very much value prototyping ideas to inform MVPs, it’s an amazing workflow when you cut out the friction to get to the meat of an idea! And then by all means, get to the path of least resistance where you can sell it ASAP. But along the way you’re going to encounter friction, and you’re going to see where process is actually needed. LISTEN to these “impulses”, just do it carefully and only when the need is VERY clear.<p>Do not consciously sabotage all engineering efforts because a large number of people on HN told you to otherwise your startup would fail. Turns out, like everything else in life, that there isn’t some magic formula to success here— that the day is only won by the ones who build high rises on landfill.')
