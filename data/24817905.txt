An AI might see that not everybody speaks one language and lean towards a symbol based language that transcends any individual human language bias.<p>Then how would you train that - show it what computer languages have come before, would it weight it upon how well they are used to get an idea of what humans prefer - the prospects of some java-C-Cobol mutant language do seem a logical output perhaps.<p>Area&#x27;s in which I&#x27;d like to see AI focus would be - optimisation and code auditing.  Which may well prove easier as you have a solid defined goal.  Also such endeavours would prove invaluable down the line if you wanted to have AI come up with a programming language.   As to do that you would need to train how humans communicate&#x2F;think and how computers communicate&#x2F;think and meet in the middle.<p>[EDIT - spelongs]')
