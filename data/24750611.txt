Many of his works he knew the philosophical themes that would be present before writing them, but none of the come off as preachy&quot;</i><p>I don&#x27;t know about that.. they come off as incredibly preachy to me.<p>C. S. Lewis was basically a Christian apologist, and that&#x27;s very obvious in his work.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hard to stomach for those of us who don&#x27;t share his views.<p>A much better example is Dostoyevsky, who was probably at least as devout a Christian as Lewis, and also had an agenda, but he didn&#x27;t make even the most repulsive of his characters in to two-dimensional caricatures as Lewis tended to do.<p>Instead, Dostoyevsky could get the reader to understand and even sympathize with the worst characters in his books, and see the world through their eyes... something Lewis could not aspire to as he always had to make his antagonists in to whipping boys for his faith.')
