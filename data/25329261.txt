They&#x27;re probably taking a break anyway, there&#x27;s nothing critical or even interesting happening, so watching some ads is fine.<p>But randomly interrupting in the middle of a conversation or right as the good part hits to show an ad shows that the Twitch management no longer understands or gives a shit about their platform.')
