All right, Stan. Don&#x27;t labour the point. And what have they ever given us in return?!<p>XERXES: The aqueduct?<p>REG: What?<p>XERXES: The aqueduct.<p>REG: Oh. Yeah, yeah. They did give us that. Uh, that&#x27;s true. Yeah.<p>COMMANDO #3: And the sanitation.<p>LORETTA: Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg. Remember what the city used to be like?<p>REG: Yeah. All right. I&#x27;ll grant you the aqueduct and the sanitation are two things that the Romans have done.<p>MATTHIAS: And the roads.<p>REG: Well, yeah. Obviously the roads. I mean, the roads go without saying, don&#x27;t they? But apart from the sanitation, the aqueduct, and the roads--<p>COMMANDO: Irrigation.<p>XERXES: Medicine.<p>COMMANDOS: Huh? Heh? Huh...<p>COMMANDO #2: Education.<p>COMMANDOS: Ohh...<p>REG: Yeah, yeah. All right. Fair enough.<p>COMMANDO #1: And the wine.<p>COMMANDOS: Oh, yes. Yeah...<p>FRANCIS: Yeah.

Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.<p>REG: All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?<p>XERXES: Brought peace.<p>REG: Oh. Peace? Shut up!')
