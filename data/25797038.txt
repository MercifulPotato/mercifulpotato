Curiously, their statements often take a didactic tone.  It seems they want to tell others what to do and what not to do.  Sadly, these are not the folks who anyone should be attempting to &quot;learn&quot; from.  They are antithetical to curiousity.  Nice to hear something from someone who is not working as a programmer.  This is a much clearer perspective, IMO.  At the very least, regardless of anyone&#x27;s opinion, it gives us a more balanced perspective.')
