I&#x27;m not saying if you&#x27;ve ever felt anxious you need to take all the drugs.<p>But this type of intense anxiety, from which most workplace abuses manifest, cannot be easily healed. So if you see abuses at your company, fire the offender or leave.  Don&#x27;t let HR think they can simply heal the abuser it won&#x27;t happen as every study has shown.')
