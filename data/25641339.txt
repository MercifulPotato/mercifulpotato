Some cool stuff can be done today, but we&#x27;re not quite at the place where we can build truly generically useful stuff yet.<p>Ethereum 2.0, which is just starting to launch now and will take another 2 years probably to be actually useful, goes a long way toward making it really powerful as a platform though, imo.')
