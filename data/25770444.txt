But that doesn’t cover the I&#x2F;O performance, especially with Realtek Ethernet interfaces.<p>Most mini-PCs are using 2-GHz-or-lower Gemini Lake CPUs with much worse single-core performance, but much better video I&#x2F;O performance. But that still doesn’t cover network I&#x2F;O, and Realtek vs Intel. (And Intel i40 vs i211.)<p>Relatively few people have gigabit Internet, but it can happen suddenly. 3 years ago, I upgraded from 20 Mbps DSL to 1 Gbps symmetric fiber. Bye-bye to my old MIPS 24K router. But all these years later, my brother 1 mile away is still waiting.')
