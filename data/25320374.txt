They have figured out that one way is to engage in mass patent or copyright lawsuits. (Another famous one is to represent dead celebrities. There&#x27;s a documentary online.)<p>Prenda Law was a similar example back in the day:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;prenda-law-porn-troll-saga-ends-with-prison-for-founder&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;prenda-law-porn-...</a><p>- but in this case there is a legitimate need for a copyright lawyer to represent photographers against the large rights aggregators, who claim copyright ownership on everything they can find to convert it into a revenue stream. (The online music industry works the same way. If your work is not registered in their particular database, they just keep the revenue until you make them do a database insert with your works and payment address.)<p>- the problem is that this lawyer didn&#x27;t approach it in an organized fashion, including contacting the actual owners<p>- this is not patent trolling, as frequently reported in the press, which is concerned with &quot;defending&quot; one or two patents by the owner. This is when a lawyer acting as a third-party does litigation regarding masses of IP for the primary purpose of generating fees, not actually to represent a client who came forward. And that&#x27;s what the suspension is about.')
