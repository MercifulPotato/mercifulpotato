Since we get our water from a well, I had a system installed with 2 large carbon tanks (~4 feet tall each), a UV light filter (more-so for non-PFAS bacteria concerns), and a sediment filter. Then to catch anything that might slip past, I have a reverse osmosis tank filter linked up under the kitchen sink (for drinking water).<p>It costs about $1200 a year to have the tanks swapped out, but don&#x27;t have a monthly water bill since it&#x27;s a well. Public water companies claim to do the same type of filtering, but who knows what they&#x27;re actually doing. It&#x27;s a good feeling knowing for sure my water is clean.')
