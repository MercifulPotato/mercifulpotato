I found it tremendously fascinating to listen to people living in faraway countries talking on radio, both the hosts and the callers. Often, normal, but nonetheless less interesting, people: the barber in Argentina describing how he started his business 50 years ago; the pissed-off lady who&#x27;s calling to complain about the traffic in Lisbon. I found it refreshing; I recognized that I was (and I am) still quite fed up with the Tim Ferriss, Weinsten or Joe Rogan&#x27;s wildly accomplished or popular-on-Twitter guests, and with the dramatizations that after 5 podcast episodes leave you as clueless as you were 5 episodes before.')
