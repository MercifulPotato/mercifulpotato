Item(by='tristor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607699458, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25372330, text='&gt; Freedom at times kinda looks a lot more like selfishness.<p>It very much does.  I think that one of the great philosophical debates that&#x27;s never really been resolved is the moral quandary between individualism and collectivism.  Individual freedom, at it&#x27;s most fundamental level, is the freedom to do what is good for yourself, rather than being forced to do what is good for your community.  It is the freedom to make the moral choice of what &quot;good&quot; is for yourself.  In many many ways, freedom &#x2F;is&#x2F; selfishness.  It&#x27;s not clear to me that this is a bad thing, except at the extremes.  It&#x27;s clear that the &quot;best&quot; society would be one that finds a balance, but that is very hard to do.')
