Either of which, if true, would be bad.<p>Data is preliminary but based on previous metrics on exposure and “immunity” we shouldn’t see so many people getting sick. Also possible this is another “super contagious” strain and it is ripping its way across the remaining population that’s not immune. Also possible they just overestimated the number of people that should be immune (obviously this would be the ideal answer).<p>Everyone is sort of holding their breath that the vaccines will maintain immunity until “herd immunity” can be established. If the virus mutates so existing immunity no longer protects you then we’re sort of back to square one and this will be like fighting the flu where it never “goes away.”')
