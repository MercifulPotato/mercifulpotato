But there are other factors.  Such as consumer choice, pricing and competition.<p>You also seem to assume vertical integration is the only way to provide a stable, secure and private computing platform.  That is not obvious to me and I don&#x27;t believe regulators could (or should!) arrive at such a conclusion.<p>The question for regulators is simply if the market is operating with sufficient competition.<p>Apple for example is not <i>completely</i> vertically integrated.  They buy glass from someone else, and screens.  I don&#x27;t think they mine aluminum.  Clearly it is possible to deliver their product by working with other companies they do not own.  This means it may be possible for them to deliver a product with similar capabilities even after spinning off the app store as &quot;apple apps co&quot; which provides apps for &quot;apple device co&quot; but they may occasionally also make apps for &quot;Samsung Device Co&quot;.  This is further reinforced by the fact that the vast majority of apps on Apple&#x27;s (and Google&#x27;s) platform are not written by Apple.<p>Kinda like how Boeing and Airbus both buy engines from Rolls Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney (which used to be part of the same company as Boeing).  Or even like how Apple buys processors from Intel but also used to buy IBM processors.')
