All Stripe gateways used to be like that, but fixed it two years or so ago.<p>I think Amazon.se rounded it somehow, last time it worked without 3D secure, which was surprising since .co.uk and .de usually required opening the card. I&#x27;d guess they are on the hook if any fraudulent transactions would happen though. Amazon&#x27;s interface for dealing with failed transactions at least used to be horrible since you would actually get past the checkout, but then be forced to somewhere in the lists find the order and from there retry the transaction, instead of simply failing visibly at the checkout like any normal webshop.')
