Item(by='laughinghan', descendants=None, kids=[25451157, 25440485, 25444278], score=None, time=1608106778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25440162, text='That is such an interesting and...low-level way to think of it.<p>To me it feels a little deeper than just there being a &quot;maze of rules&quot;. Your earlier mention of &quot;everything&#x27;s connected to everything else&quot; resonated with me more.<p>In a sense, the expressive power of programming languages, and mathematical notation, feels very <i>small</i>. I liked the board game metaphor brought up in the top comment: programming languages and mathematical notation merely feel like arrangements of board game pieces (from an infinite box, and the rules of how they can be arranged are &quot;context-free&quot;). They don&#x27;t have <i>meaning</i> except what we impose (ideally, assisted by comments).<p>A metaphor I brought up in another comment is that it feels &quot;easy&quot; to systematically translate an arbitrary program into an equivalent diagram, such that the diagram would contain 100% of the operational information in the program, and could be runnable as-is. (Would be cumbersome to input into the computer, ofc.) Whereas the idea of systematically translating an arbitrary natural sentence into a diagram just seems...nonsensical to me. I wouldn&#x27;t even know where to begin.<p>Does that resonate with you?')
