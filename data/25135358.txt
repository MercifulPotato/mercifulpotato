They have already shown their lack of respect for human life by the treatment of their own people and their overt threats to South Korea. They even make propaganda showing attacks against the US and other countries.<p>In a rational world we would not need a military except we are far from living in one. Worse we live in a world where we accept nations like North Korea and worse prop them up all because of the threat they project. This will simply encourage them further.<p>Iran is a threat to its neighbors and a lot of this is from purely factional religious differences. Reducing the world&#x27;s oil usage could actually make things worse as we end up with a larger humanitarian issue, similar to Venezuela where the economy needs that money')
