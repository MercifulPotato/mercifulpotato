And my point was exactly what you&#x27;re saying: <i>many</i> text editors choke on files like this, so it&#x27;s not such a huge indictment of ox that it chokes on it as well.<p>However, ox clearly performs poorly even when your text files aren&#x27;t massive single lines, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter: ox basically can&#x27;t handle files like this regardless of line distribution.')
