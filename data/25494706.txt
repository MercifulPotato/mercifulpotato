Who would benefit if PJON and others like it didn&#x27;t exist? Who would benefit if users instead had no other option but to pay a for-profit company for the hardware, software, and (of course!) the recurring monthly subscription fee instead of just doing it themselves? Hmm... (see how easy that is)?<p>jlgaddis, probably there could not have been a better way to describe the situation.')
