And if they did emulation, the x86 the performance would certainly be awful! When I claimed that they could probably reach performance parity, or maybe even beat the x86 performance of the Intel chips they were replacing, they didn&#x27;t believe me.<p>I was thinking that they&#x27;d probably add custom instructions for x86 emulation, I haven&#x27;t heard if that&#x27;s the case or not. Would be interesting to find out. Given the complexity of a modern x86-64 frontend, it was never that far-fetched to think that a combination of world-class JIT and a bit of custom silicon could have a negligible overhead compared to a pure silicon solution. After that it was mostly a question of how good the CPU core and technology node was. And Anandtech, among others, had already shown they were well on track to beating Intel there.')
