We are at the 40k VMs running 1000 different types of apps.  We suffer from tremendous wasted resources as a result.<p>The company started before k8s (and even docker) were things.  So getting us there seems like a real daunting (yet worth it) task.<p>So, we are left with sort of a chicken&#x2F;egg problem.
