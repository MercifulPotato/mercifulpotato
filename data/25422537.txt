Trying to sell you on my epistemology was outside of my intent.&quot;<p>Well, you either know a thing or not.  Its really that simple. You know you are sitting at a table, typing, etc.  I also accept the results of repeatable experiments, as long as I have verified them.<p>It really comes down to you.  The individual.  All ideas are therein.  Are you prepared to kid yourself, or do you want the truth?<p>Often people say &#x27;we&#x27; know to get around this.  What does this usage of &#x27;we&#x27; mean?  It is trust that someone else has done the verifying, that they are trustworthy, that they are relaying the results faithfully, etc.  If you are trusting though, you are not knowing.<p>Now, it is fine to have beliefs, and to accept other people&#x27;s ideas and hypotheses.  But it is another thing to say you know them to be true!')
