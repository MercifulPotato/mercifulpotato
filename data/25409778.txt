The demand for oil exists from all 196 countries of the world.<p>If USD devalues too much (but is still reserve currency), other countries will become richer aka, they can buy more dollars for fewer of their own fiats. Which means they can import more oil by converting more and more of their fiat to dollars. Which means demand for oil internationally will go up while supply remains about the same, causing price of oil to go up, regardless of where it is produced.<p>If USD devalues and other countries decide to abandon the dollar for trade in favor of say Oil-coin, US will lose access to international oil until it &quot;earns&quot; oil-coin somehow. How does America earn oil-coin? By exporting something. Since America can produce so much oil, the producers will try to export oil for oil-coin. Which means increased global demand and thus rising prices again.<p>US could shut down all exports of oil and only use it domestically and shun oil-coin entirely. But this means that<p>a. US can&#x27;t import other things because of lack of oil-coin. So we will suddenly have severe shortages. Oh a bad disease in one year caused all potatoes in America to die? Tough luck sustaining all the food processing and chips companies. They can&#x27;t do a stop gap import potatoes since we don&#x27;t have any oil-coin. You can expand this experiment to all kinds of things such as stent-valves, rubber for tires, coffee. Our rich lives are truly there because other countries are working for it.<p>b. US energy supplies will be limited by domestic production and domestic supply and demand characteristics. Oh, we have such a great economic boom that increased oil demand but a few oil wells are down for repairs a few quarters? Boom, spike in oil prices again despite being self-sufficient. Another recession beckons since industries can&#x27;t function with such high oil prices.<p>This globalization thing is not very simple. It may have caused a lot of grief, but it&#x27;s also a very good distributed system that&#x27;s preventing us from going back to shortages like medieval times. We&#x27;re not dying just because there&#x27;s a 2-3 year span of famine any longer because there&#x27;s always somewhere else to get it from.')
