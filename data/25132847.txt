They ported to the PS4. It&#x27;s just too small of a market.<p>Nintendo Switch level games should port fine, many are developed on cross platform engines like Unity that already support Metal on iOS. However Switch games sell for $50+, already higher than PC or macOS titles, so it&#x27;s usually pretty bad economics - you&#x27;d rather the user buy on their Switch than their Mac.')
