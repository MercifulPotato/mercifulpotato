Item(by='snewman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609646791, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25619265, text='Per Wikipedia:<p>&gt; In computer science, a memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released.<p>In most of your scenarios, e.g. &quot;pushed to some queue&quot;, the object in question is still needed. Hence, this is not a leak. Presumably, the entry will eventually be removed from the queue, and GC will then reclaim the object.<p>At any rate, I think we&#x27;re moving past the point of productive discussion. My experience in practice is that memory leaks are more common &#x2F; harder to avoid in non-GC languages. Of course a true memory leak (per the definition above) is possible in a GC language, but I just don&#x27;t see it much in practice. Perhaps your experience is different.')
