Most non car company chargers I’ve seen are laughably expensive (sometimes exceeding the price of gas per mile) and slow. Despite being so expensive, it’s hard for me to believe that they make more than $10&#x2F;day. It’s a few dollars per hour to charge, and most of the time they’re empty. And that excludes the maintenance cost. So you end up with many broken chargers. I’m guessing there’s some sort of state subsidy that helps establish these chargers in parking lots? It all feels like a money laundering operation.')
