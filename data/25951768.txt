Like blood vessels. It&#x27;s a network to keep capital flowing from those with money to loan to those who need to borrow. You don&#x27;t want to put that responsibility on a single entity, that&#x27;s a recipe for failure. It&#x27;s better to spread risk by allowing some to succeed and others fail. There is added complexity and that&#x27;s a feature, not a bug.')
