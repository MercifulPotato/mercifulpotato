Item(by='pseingatl', descendants=None, kids=[24927537], score=None, time=1603919759, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24922268, text='Good point--judicial orders contain no security features and are printed on ordinary paper. They long ago did away with the embossed seals, so now copying these are trivial and normally not needed unless a certified copy of the order is required. The article shows surprise at the defendant&#x27;s cleverness in filing electronically. Not so--in many jurisdictions, electronic filing is mandatory. Pleadings filed by parties have no security features either. In some countries, pleadings have to be filed using special paper that is taxed. The paper has security features and the tax feature is a way both to obtain revenue and discourage prolixity. Now imagine that in the 3141 counties in the US, each with different protocols, it&#x27;s a wonder this isn&#x27;t more frequent. Oh and each of those counties has its own system for counting votes. Good luck, USA.')
