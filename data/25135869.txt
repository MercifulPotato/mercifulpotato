Could you explain?<p>-edit-<p>I guess what I mean to say here is I&#x27;m not commenting on how drug prices work. It doesn&#x27;t matter. I am commenting on the fact that somebody, somewhere has to pay for the drug, regardless of the price. I want to push back on this idea that drugs are &quot;free&quot; in Europe or elsewhere. Sure the healthcare programs appear to be better managed, higher taxes on the wealthy or corporations (although I don&#x27;t know for sure) appear to be subsidizing costs for lower and middle classes, but the drugs still aren&#x27;t free in any sense of the word to the society as a whole.')
