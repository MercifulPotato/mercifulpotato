A few of the interesting things that I&#x27;ve come up with so far are: screenshots can be exported as SVG files rather than bitmaps; a lightweight remote graphics protocol is possible thanks to the desktop being described as a scene graph; apps can easily scale to any DPI&#x2F;resolution; new and interesting widgets and app designs are possible - pie menus and the like.<p>Unfortunately the GitHub build is currently broken and I&#x27;m probably 2 months away from sharing anything here.  I&#x27;ll post something when it&#x27;s more presentable.')
