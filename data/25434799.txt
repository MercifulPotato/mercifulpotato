If the user wins, the company pays all costs, and must reinstate the content or account. If the user loses, they only pay their portion of arbitration costs. (The company&#x27;s portion are just part of doing business in the EU).<p>Oh and the user (not the company) get to decide which arbitrator to use, from among those that have been certified by any Member state, with the relevant expertise for the type of social network and content or TOS violation in question.<p>Obviously all of this is subject to change if the proposed law is changed before being enacted.')
