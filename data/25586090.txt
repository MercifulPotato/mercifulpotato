I personally think that implementing a jail-backed OCI runtime and getting docker running on top of it (all of which should be fairly simple to do) would be a huge boost to getting more users - bonus points if it can run FreeBSD-native <i>and</i> Linux images by using the existing Linux-compat layer. I&#x27;ve even looked into actually implementing this myself, but the runc-containerd-docker codebases were too much for me to make sense of so far, unfortunately.<p>[0] Actually, partial caveat: cbsd and bhyve are at least meant to fill this space, I think, but they&#x27;re neither a perfect match nor as easy to use IMO.')
