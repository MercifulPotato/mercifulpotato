Item(by='joeraut', descendants=None, kids=[25921920], score=None, time=1611692719, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25920138, text='Happy rsync.net client here, thanks for the great service; the ability to use rclone for exactly this purpose, without having to worry about ingress&#x2F;egress charges, is a huge value-add.<p>Edit: Will free-of-charge ingress&#x2F;egress always be a feature of the service? With more customers using rclone for shifting data to&#x2F;from&#x2F;between other services, I&#x27;d hypothesize that bandwidth use could be creeping up.<p>Edit 2: A feature I&#x27;d love to see would be the ability to setup automated cron-like jobs directly from the admin portal, for e.g. automated rclone backups, eliminating the friction of having to setup another service to periodically run a command on rsync.net. (Tricky to do in a serverless fashion for long-running commands like rclone.) Is this something that might be in the pipeline?')
