Or at least that it is part of the problem. If it were situational only, everyone in the same situation would have the same outcome. But the physical structure and chemical cocktail of each individual brain plays a huge role in how those situations affect each person. The brain is an organ, and just like any other organ, there are situations that cannot be fixed with “lifestyle changes”.  Medication should not just be hand waved away.')
