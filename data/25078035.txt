Everything you&#x27;ve claimed to like about it is just as true in other free, rich countries, and the negatives you repeatedly decline to mention are largely absent. You&#x27;ve brought in libel as an example, which of course is _not_ protected by 1FA. The importance of 1FA at this point is a national religion.')
