It had a simpler sensor construction, similar to how regular gamepad buttons work. Each panel flexed very slightly upward at rest, and had a foil layer on the bottom, which would make contact when the panel was pressed down. This worked surprisingly well, even for &quot;heel-toe&quot; playing (and didn&#x27;t seem to deteriorate over a few years of quite heavy use). Though, for really fast songs the &quot;stickiness&quot; would become a problem, and you&#x27;d start getting a few errant misses. But below, say, ITG difficulty 11 it was fine.<p>I remember reading about more expensive pads like the Cobalt Flux using more sophisticated sensors, similar to (or exactly the same as?) what you&#x27;d find in an arcade machine. Are the sensors in this design similar to what that pad used?<p>1: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayflash.com&#x2F;Products&#x2F;DANCEPADS&#x2F;TX4000.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayflash.com&#x2F;Products&#x2F;DANCEPADS&#x2F;TX4000.html</a>')
