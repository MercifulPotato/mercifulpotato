It&#x27;s fucked and Russia fucked it.<p>The wonderful thing about being in a free nation is the access to the news of other countries. It helps you see which ones are the outliers. It&#x27;s not yours.<p>&gt;  In the last three years the New York Times hasnâ€™t reported a single positive story on Russia<p>Gee, I wonder why that might be?
