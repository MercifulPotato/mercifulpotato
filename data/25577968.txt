No firm wants to enter a perfectly competitive market, because the expected long-run profit margin is zero.  If a firm loves competition, they are free to increase competition in their market at any time by giving away their patents, copyrights, tech, etc.  They don&#x27;t do these things because they don&#x27;t want competition.\nJust because a bunch of people claim to love competition doesn&#x27;t make it true.<p>Regarding the rule of law, some pretty disgusting things have been done for private investment (i.e. capitalism.)  Banana republics come to mind.<p>This &quot;broken capitalism&quot; claim is essentially a no-true-Scotsman fallacy.  Real-world capitalism didn&#x27;t play out like the perfect scenario in our heads, so blame it on &quot;broken capitalism&quot; or &quot;crony capitalism&quot;.  In truth, the system yields flawed results like everything else.')
