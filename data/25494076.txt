Nikon fumbled with the mirrorless market quite spectacularly and nowadays its mirrorless cameras like Z6 and Z7 are basically copies of what Sony published year or two earlier but with quite bad native lens line-up.<p>The funny thing here is that Nikon outsourced the sensor development to Sony in the 2000s.')
