The police station in Minneapolis that was burned down (to pick what most people would accept as the worst example of BLM-related violence) just shouldn&#x27;t be part of a discussion about whether or not there was a threat against Amazon&#x27;s data centers from the right.<p>This is pure whataboutism, basically.  Even if you&#x27;re right (for the record, I think you&#x27;re right), you&#x27;re applying it to deflect an argument against &quot;your&quot; side.  Isn&#x27;t that making the problem you are explaining WORSE and not better?<p>Surely you&#x27;d agree that step one to being less divided is to stop reflexively defending &quot;our&quot; side when bad things happen, right?')
