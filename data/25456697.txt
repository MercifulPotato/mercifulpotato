Not forgetting they currently deal with multiple other tribes - investors, media, government etc.<p>I would like to add a couple of small points:<p>+ Personal risk to executives is the change in the mix with highest impact. This becomes more important as this risk is transferred up the corporate ladder.<p>So, leaders examining issues, from this &#x27;new&#x27; perspective, in a balanced nuanced way while still considering profits, politics, strategy, foresight, ability to manage change ( et al, ad nauseam ) increasingly becomes a key career soft skill. Especially if decisions are delivered in communication styles that are still clearly understood by <i>all</i> relevant other tribes they deal with in situations like this.<p>+. I would like to suggest that some folks are missing PART of the point (not all of it, just an important small nuance)\nNo single party gets to frame this debate. Ethics is now inside the corp. fence so it has to be heard.<p>Just consider that every side of the debate has their perspective and the other side is &quot;crazy&quot; from this viewpoint. E.g a key tool for academics with leadership is demanding the removal of leaders with a &quot;or we go &quot; chaser - this is normal in that world and it would be crazy not to use the tool as part of a &quot;normal&quot; negotiation. But it is not normal in the corporate world.<p>Point being everyone&#x27;s normal is some version of some other person&#x27;s crazy.<p>Well, these folks are from another &#x27;tribe&quot;. The way things are done in their world is different&#x27;. Corp is the one behaving in a way that &quot;does not make sense&quot; from their perspective.<p>Just considering that the view from someone else&#x27;s vantage point could be different would go a long way here.')
