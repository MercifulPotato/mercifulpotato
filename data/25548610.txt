Stallman had modified the software for the Lab&#x27;s previous laser printer (the XGP, Xerographic Printer), so it electronically messaged a user when the person&#x27;s job was printed, and would message all logged-in users waiting for print jobs if the printer was jammed. Not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor from most of the users. This experience convinced Stallman of people&#x27;s need to be able to freely modify the software they use.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richard_Stallman#Events_leading_to_GNU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richard_Stallman#Events_leadin...</a>')
