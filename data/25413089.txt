I just saw the Washington DC official bike map has the laws on it, but others do not. And what use are the laws if the drivers don&#x27;t know them? Both bikers and drivers need to know them to be successful.<p>I&#x27;ve asked a good number of both bikers and drivers in my area and they don&#x27;t know that the laws exist:<p>A driver must move over to the next lane if it is open and a biker is in the bike lane or the lane the driver is in.<p>A driver must not pass closer than 3 feet from a biker<p>A biker may take an entire lane and ride two wide<p>I think if drivers knew that the above rules, and it became a norm to take the entire lane when 3 feet was impossible based on the size of the lane, then biking would be safer.<p>To not leave this as a &quot;this is bad&quot; without proposing how to fix it... the education could be incorporated into gaining your drivers license, city sponsored advertisements, or having police actively spend a period of time enforcing the above laws (warnings would be fine, more for education than penalty)... or all 3.')
