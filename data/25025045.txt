With a CA, sortition is used to select a sample of the population, and they come together along with subject matter experts to do research and shape the policy itself.<p>I view the problems with our democracies in terms of information theory. Even if you move from representative to direct democracy and people can vote on issues, a vote is still a very small amount of information, and the bandwidth from the people to the policy-makers is tiny. Contrast that with citizens&#x27; assemblies and the bandwidth is much wider, because it democratizes the policy construction process and allows people to discuss the policy, instead of just signalling a single bit (yes&#x2F;no).')
