I am a smoker and this cut my consumption greatly; there&#x27;s little social joy in standing outside by yourself purely to satisfy a craving.<p>In 2014 I went to Australia, where I lived and worked for nearly three years. Anti-tobacco regulations there were far stricter than in the UK. Plain packaging had been introduced, prices were astronomical, smoking bans extended to many outdoor areas. My consumption reduced further (tobacco, that is - there was lots of terrific grass in Australia at agreeable prices).<p>After Australia, I spent a few years in central Europe (mainly based in Prague). Cigarettes were dirt cheap (a third or a quarter of the price in Australia or in the UK). Smoking in restaurants and bars was allowed, and my consumption increased. Then, while I was still based in Prague, smoking in bars and restaurants was banned - my consumption fell once again.<p>I&#x27;ve seen smoking presented, societally, as something sophisticated, and I have lived long enough to see that image exposed for what it was - so now people know that it&#x27;s not sophisticated and that it is damaging. In the UK and Australia, and increasingly in central Europe, even smokers (myself included) do not smoke indoors even in our own homes. My behaviour, and that of other smokers, seems to have changed.<p>Tobacco pricing has had an effect, I think. Advertising&#x2F;sponsorship  bans may well be working - but I was already a smoker before they were implemented; figures on young people should be informative. Similarly with plain packaging.<p>My guess, then, is that smoking bans in social contexts (bars, restaurants, parks etc) have the greatest effect, and price also has a strong effect.<p>Perhaps more interesting, for me, has been to see the effects of smoking being increasingly stigmatised, via advertising bans and also in TV shows etc. Slowly but surely, acceptability has been chipped away. (And, of course, with the tobacco lobby having been caught out lying for decades; but I wouldn&#x27;t overestimate the effects of that truth on society, though.)<p>There is no need to ban smoking, in my opinion. That would give it a new life and shadier markets. It is already dying as a habit.')
