Would you mind changing them all to “WebAssembly” or “WASM”&#x2F;“Wasm”&#x2F;“wasm”?<p>(Concerning capitalisation, though you don’t look to concern yourself with that, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;</a> and a few other sources abbreviate it to “Wasm”; before March 2018, that site used “wasm” instead; in common practice, almost everything I ever see uses “WASM”.)')
