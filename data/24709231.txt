If you don’t believe so, then there’s no sense in continuing.<p>Second, if the only solution <i>you</i> see is communism, don’t attribute the same outlook to me.<p>As far as I’m aware, if communist regimes so far are any indication, communism could only make the situation worse with blatant nepotism if nothing else.<p>What if, if a solution you can think of off the top of your head is horrible, all it means is that the problem is just not that easy to solve?')
