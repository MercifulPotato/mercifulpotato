I am in serious foot pain for anywhere from a week to a month or longer. Currently I&#x27;m dealing with a buildup of gouty tophi on my heel that has been there for a few years and finally surfacing and causing real issues. I thought it was just a callous from walking with flip flops for too long or something, but nope, just more gout coming around to ruin my days.<p>It is very depressing that, on top of the pain, I feel like I&#x27;m constantly making excuses why I can&#x27;t do things with my family. Often times I will &quot;power through it&quot; and just make things worse.<p>Nowadays I am quick to get on my crutches and keep my foot elevated at any hint of a flare up.<p>I did not know of Eric but can certainly understand taking too much Tylenol for foot pain.')
