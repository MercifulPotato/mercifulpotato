You never came across a recipe that called for 200g sugar and 400g flower, for example?<p>From someone who watches american vlogs I heard that everything in the USA is cups and spoons. It makes me wonder: doesn&#x27;t it get old to have to clean the cup and a set of spoons after every use? Why not pour directly into the mixing bowl that you put on a scale?')
