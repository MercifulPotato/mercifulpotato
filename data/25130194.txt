Adults manipulate by being underhanded when they have the option of being straightforward. The baby is being straightforward. What do you want the kid to do to communicate? &quot;I am unhappy and while I could probably soothe myself I would like a parent&#x27;s attention&quot; -- hard to say all those words when you don&#x27;t have language. What else can the kid do? Get a pet? drink whiskey? send you a text message? call a therapist?<p>Crying is a baby&#x27;s only tool, and babies are certainly allowed to feel emotions like boredom, disgust, annoyance, cold, as well as physical pain. You&#x27;re also allowed to ignore your bored or upset child. But don&#x27;t call it manipulation when the kid is being absolutely aboveboard and straightforward. Viewing it as &#x27;manipulation&#x27; actually increases the likelihood, in my view, that you&#x27;ll raise a duplicitous child, because from babyhood on the kid&#x27;ll be taught that saying directly what you want is frowned upon.<p>As for sleep training, mentioned by a sibling commenter, our reactions to a baby&#x27;s cries are definitely directly related to kid&#x27;s bedtime patterns, and I would advocate for a middle road: there&#x27;s no need to be rigid about a philosophy. With our kid, we&#x27;d wait five minutes for crying to stop. Any kid and any adult can wait out five minutes when it&#x27;s just bedtime, not a question of physical distress. If the kid was still crying after five minutes, check in; if the kid is asleep, win! The kid knows they&#x27;re not being abandoned for all eternity; you know you don&#x27;t have to listen to this (*&amp; forever; and we were lucky that it never took us more than 15 minutes (two checkins) before kid fell asleep. Children are different; YMMV.')
