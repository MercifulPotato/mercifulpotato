You only can follow everything the person tweets, likes, and retweets (albeit randomly filtered by Twitter&#x27;s AI logic). Which makes it hard to exclude various nonsense from the feed.<p>I wish Twitter allowed people to tweet into different personal channels, and I could only subscribe to the personal channels I&#x27;m interested in.<p>Social networks badly need to evolve.
