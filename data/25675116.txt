Your approach must work for you as for sheer efficiency. You will spend more time on relevant issues, if so desired, of producing meaningful content.<p>Now include hardware into the same philosophy, the long term into shelf live, a single programming language worked on by dedicated knowledgeable individuals ideally. You are on our side of things.<p>A page (web&#x2F;print) should be written, locally, off-line, in the same editor of always, in open-source code, preferably the blob of compiled code at it&#x27;s nucleus, if there is any neeeded also. Content should have a seven hundred year lifeline, readable, view-able in minimal software allowances. Then it cannot be said too often, hardware-software is in-extricable.<p>For all those that think phishing in the public domain for the soul of the crowds, well, that is fine, but nothing the matter. And be prepared for a frustrated life-time of scratching your itches.<p>Theodore Kackzinski, people who vouch for the &quot;hundred year&quot;, robust hardware, for the fashion of the ages, they seem to be on the right side of history. That same observation de-obfuscates the evidenced in what is going on in AI, and statistics, mining data. ...when the data are repeats, high-level, junk, outright meaningless, no amount of AI or tweaking using computer power will assert anything but junk outcomes.<p>People scale badly, that makes for the most efficient workflow to be a-synchronous, for nuggets of which as an individual we have as a rule none, and few individuals very little, that sort of data merits a long life-line, that data need to be tailored for the above allowances as you point rightfully out.<p>You might be fake, or limited in your ambitions, but from what I read, I must concede you make sense before any back-ground check is at order.')
