At least from anyone who responded.<p>I find it rather shameful, that apparently everyone who responded to my question, did so by explaining that a US company has to abide by US law. You don&#x27;t say!<p>That was never the question, but apparently even reading is even too much to ask from people these days.<p>Of course US companies have to follow US laws. But if that conflicts with law in wherever their services are offered, they no longer have any business operating there. They should consequently stop offering their services in that territory.<p>Since that&#x27;s unlikely going to happen on their own initiative, maybe the EU should simply declare companies like these as illegal on their market.<p>Actually, that might even help to finally get rid of the stranglehold which many US have had for a long time on any emerging  potential competition from EU companies. Something for which US companies have regularly used and abused differences in law and economy (between the US and EU), in order to obtain an (unfair) edge.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s about time that comes to and end, so US companies can prove that they can compete on equal grounds. I personally doubt that, because for most of the last century this competition has been dominated by the US exploiting artificially created advantages.<p>Politics aside, it&#x27;s rather sad that this aspect of legality is even a discussion topic. It should be a no-brainer that US companies should abide by whatever laws exist on a foreign market they operate on (of course on top of US law).<p>If they can&#x27;t, the only (legal) option is to stop operating. Either that, or the company is a criminally operating organization. That is, the violations are systemic and not just a few unintended incidences, of course.')
