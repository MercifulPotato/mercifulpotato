In that case a part-time in Lisbon will pay you slightly more than half of your room and in &quot;your case&quot; it would pay the whole room. It&#x27;s a BIG difference if you have to go down that road.<p>&gt; Yet more [ancient] data: UK science research council funding for PhD students in the late 1990s was nothing to get excited about; I have an old bank statement here, BBSRC paid me the princely sum of Â£1377 on 1 July 1998, and by the way, that was for that quarter not for a month.<p>I do agree that post-grads are very badly paid. But that&#x27;s another issue.<p>&gt; Q: Do we really think postgraduate students should expect their parents to still be funding them?<p>Not really, but if there&#x27;s an emergency I think parents will not let their kids starve.<p>And this hackernews rhetoric of &#x27;if I suffered everyone has to suffer as well&#x27; needs to end. That&#x27;s not how you move forward.')
