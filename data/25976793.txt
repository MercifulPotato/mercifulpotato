If I have warp drive &quot;knowledge&quot; that has been claimed by someone else, then there are two non-mutually-exclusive options:<p>- I have the knowledge of how to integrate a fusion plant and warp motor to form a warp drive. The only purpose of this knowledge is a warp drive, therefore I cannot express it.<p>- I have the knowledge of the fusion plant, and a warp motor, both of which are claimed. I cannot build the fusion plant even if I intend to integrate it with a terrestial power grid. I cannot build a warp motor even if I intend to integrate it with solar cells. There&#x27;s no other purpose for any of this, so I am forbidden from expressing it.<p>I&#x27;m not seeing another way to define &quot;knowledge&quot; that would allow me to express it despite it being claimed by someone else, so I conclude IP makes knowledge useless.')
