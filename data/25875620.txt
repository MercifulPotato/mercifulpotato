Was wondering if the community had any experience&#x2F;thoughts on recruiting participants for a taped interview. The idea is to talk with a diverse group of people on a variety of topics on life, work amongst other things. I see a few user research tools that fit the bill, but wasn&#x27;t sure since this isn&#x27;t a product but more of an interview series with the common people.<p>Will be happy to compensate for their time!')
