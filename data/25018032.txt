When they were bought by Apple they had a Structured Light sensor on the market and apparently had a MEMS-mirror LiDAR sensor in the labs.<p>Despite the name, ToF sensor typically means using modulated flood illumination and phase shift to compute the depth. It&#x27;s conceptually very simple but suffers multi-path errors and poor efficiency. Real Time-of-Flight sensors (that measure depth by timing light) are typically called LiDAR. These typically collect many pointwise independent measurements.<p>The LiDAR inside the iPad Pro and the iPhone Pro is solid state (no moving parts, not even a MEMS mirror). It was developed by Sony and they are now selling it to Apple.')
