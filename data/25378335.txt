Some magical browser, 100% anonymous. That doesn&#x27;t mean no one is going to try and have an ROI for published content on the internet.. producers still want to get paid for content and&#x2F;or products, and consumers still want to avoid paying.<p>So yay we got privacy, but what is the next step?
