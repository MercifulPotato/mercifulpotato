I&#x27;d have the same feeling even after completing an advanced level course.<p>What we need are technical MOOCs that discuss what decisions to make when approaching a problem, evaluating trade-offs, what are the common practices you&#x27;d come across in a production environment and where the concept you learned fits in the big picture.<p>I haven&#x27;t found any MOOC that talks about the above in depth for web dev and the only youtuber I found who talks about this is TechLead but he mostly puts out 10 minute clips instead of complete tutorials.<p>I&#x27;ve gone back to books and I&#x27;m learning much more per time spent studying something.')
