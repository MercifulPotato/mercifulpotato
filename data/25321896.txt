It was soul destroying.<p>Now I can construct a post, complete with trendy hashtags, and passively watch _hundreds_ of recruiters reach out to me in 24hrs.  Now I can sit with a coffee and easy filter out the crap. It&#x27;s taken some time to build up the 8,000+ contacts, mostly of senior tech people amd recruiters.<p>Every job in the last 5yrs has been through LinkedIn and due to the ease by which I could change jobs, salary has sky rocketed too.<p>Maybe I am in the minority of people who use it as a tool this way?')
