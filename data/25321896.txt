It was soul destroying.<p>Now I can construct a post, complete with trendy hashtags, and passively watch _hundreds_ of recruiters reach out to me in 24hrs.  Now I can sit with a coffee and easy filter out the crap. It&#x27;s taken some time to build up the 8,000+ contacts, mostly of senior tech people amd recruiters.<p>Every job in the last 5yrs has been through LinkedIn and due to the ease by which I could change jobs, salary has sky rocketed too.<p>Maybe I am in the minority of people who use it as a tool this way?<p>Edit:  I also have an emoji as the first &quot;letter&quot; in the string of my first name. This instantly allows me to visually&#x2F;programmatically filter out genuine &quot;human&quot; messages from bots.  I also reply to these messages, as let&#x27;s be honest, a human took time to compose the message to me.  A quick &quot;thank you&quot; (one button click!) goes a long way.')
