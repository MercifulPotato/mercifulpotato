Maybe Google wanted to be part of the anti-establishment movement as long as its part focused on competitors.<p>I find the sequence of decisions made by Google problematic.<p>Until they describe in intimate detail what their management has been planning to filter they are effectively retracting all research from their institution as having this unknown bias.
