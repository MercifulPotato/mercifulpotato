Sometimes these answers are alright, but often they are shallow and miss context.<p>The problem is excacerbated by the fact that 1000s of sites try to get into the top results for programming questions. So you end up with crappy shallow answers, and never learn the underlying details.<p>And then there&#x27;s the problem that the more experienced you get, the less you look up answers, so the less you are exposed to sites like Stack Overflow, and the less you contribute to Stack Overflow. So the result is that the least experienced contribute most to the answers on the web.<p>My preferred solution is to buy books. Find the best book on your topic and read a chapter, and you&#x27;ll learn more than if you had googled 100 questions.<p>The downside of books is that it only works for &quot;old&quot; tech. If you want to learn about the hot new Swift UI Declarative Reactive Whatever, your out of luck and you need to scrape together any info you can find from random blog posts...')
