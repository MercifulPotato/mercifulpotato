Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25782990], score=None, time=1610658956, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25782565, text='Mechanically at its core, 5e is has a very close similarity to 4e with encounter powers becoming recharge on short or long rest and daily powers becoming recharge on long rest, and a few similar translations; it&#x27;s much closer to 4e in that regard than to any earlier edition. And the catalog of classes, and other options, and their design doesn&#x27;t throw out 4e heritage entirely, either.<p>But it manages to avoid, IMO, the super-metagamey feel of 4e.')
