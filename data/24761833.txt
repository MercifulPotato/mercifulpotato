I would feel less like I was imposing.</i><p>I think it depends on your relationship with the friends.  There are some friends where I&#x27;d be really sad if they didn&#x27;t stay with me or I didn&#x27;t stay with them.  We cook and drink together, and stay up late watching movies or TV or just talking, to the point where we don&#x27;t want to worry about having to get one of us to a hotel.<p>One of my oldest friends has a cat that I&#x27;m mildly allergic to, but I will always sleep on his couch when I visit, even though the cost of a hotel room is well within my budget, and a hotel bed would probably be more comfortable than the couch.  It&#x27;s just so much more <i>fun</i> to stay with my friend.  I get that this isn&#x27;t for everyone, but that&#x27;s kinda the point: everyone has different tastes.<p>&gt; <i>The analogy I use is the gym: I can do workouts at home, but the mental routine I have for getting up and going to the gym means I actually go much more often.</i><p>I&#x27;ve tried at various times to do the gym thing, but I just can never motivate myself.  I think it&#x27;s the overhead that kills it for me, the need to get myself ready to go, transport myself there, get into a routine, change, get myself home, etc.  What ends up working for me is going for a 3-5 mile run in my neighborhood.  I just change my shirt and pants, throw on running shoes, and go outside.  I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve found a routine that helps keep you on track, but, again: everyone&#x27;s different.')
