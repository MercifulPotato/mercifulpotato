Item(by='ninly', descendants=None, kids=[25290067, 25290284], score=None, time=1607009956, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25289798, text='&#x27;indexes&#x27; has been a just-fine variant of the plural for a very long time -- actually it&#x27;s the first one listed in Merriam-Webster, so probably the more common variant, though I haven&#x27;t dug into other references. That said, you&#x27;re correct that the more common or preferred variant will depend somewhat on the culture&#x2F;community&#x2F;industry. The house style guides in finance probably tend toward &#x27;indexes&#x27; -- in part because an index is a branded product they produce, so consistency is important -- while software&#x2F;tech companies (or at least people in them) may tend prefer &#x27;indices&#x27;.')
