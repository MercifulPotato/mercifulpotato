There are countless businesses that are successful soaking up excess time that people happily participate in.  The mobile gaming business for example is an industry worth tens of billions of dollars that simply didn&#x27;t exist a couple decades ago.<p>&gt;The only viable path forward for EVs is to reduce recharge time or make it invisible (do it outside rush hour). Until then I see no way for them to displace hybrids as primary family cars.<p>Hybrid market share has likely already peaked and they never became the primary family car for Americans.  Hybrid&#x27;s share of new cars only ever topped 3% once and that was in 2013.  Plus charge time has already been decreasing for EVs and Teslas have gotten to the point that an average American would probably only need to charge for 10-20 minutes once a week at one of their highest powered Superchargers.  That really isn&#x27;t the inconvenience that some people are making it out to be if there are other business at these charging locations that can keep people occupied.')
