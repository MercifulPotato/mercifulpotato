But I think people sometimes take it to far, including you.<p>If you look at the amount of material, technology, and cost the German had to spend on the air war, air defense, u-boat war and fighting on a different continent. This type of fighting doesn&#x27;t kill as many people but its very important. Without the Western Allied efforts Soviet Union had basically no way to effect German economy at all.<p>And one of the single most important points that is often ignored is the economic blockade of Germany that started in 1939. This was a massive issue for Germany.<p>Overall is far, far more then 20% any way you measure it other then casualties.<p>And that is without even mentioning that literally from the moment the German invasion of the Soviet Union started Britain was sending them important war material and eventually the Soviets received massive amounts from Western allies that massively helped them to actually win the war.<p>Britain even sent ships full of the most advanced fighter aircraft that were planned for the defense of Singapore, poor choice there Britain.<p>&gt; People assume Nagasaki and Hiroshima convinced Japan to surrender, but it was actually the (surprise) Russian declaration of war...<p>This is often claimed but its simply false. Japan hoped the Soviets could help them make a deal and once they declared war, Japan understood that there was no deal to be had. What Soviet joining of the war did was to convince the last few people in the war part that conditional surrender was not possible.<p>It was the US nukes that convinced them that surrender was inevitable and in response to the nukes the emperor formally asked by the war council to give his opinion.<p>I&#x27;m all for questioning national myths, but many people are simply willing to believe anything as long as it goes against the national myth because they are so sick of hearing.<p>Edit: And I&#x27;m European not American, this is just my study of WW2 history')
