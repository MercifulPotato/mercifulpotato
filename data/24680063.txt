Even if there was, there is a prisoners dilemma - it would only work if many of them switched at once.<p>This is absolutely nothing like the situation with multiple app stores, where not all apps have to switch at once.<p>Most users do not refuse to use Facebook.   New people take up smoking daily.  The idea that users would ‘refuse’ to buy apps from a store run by Facebook (or worse) is an idealistic fantasy.<p>As for why apps would switch to other stores?  Paid exclusives, just as with every other media type - TV, Movies, Books, Podcasts.<p>People who have hits get paid a huge premium for exclusives, because it forces customers to use the new store or platform.<p>Epic is already buying exclusives. Amazon and Facebook, and TenCent et all would obviously do so too.<p>The only choice for users would be to install all of the stores.<p>The only choice for developers will be to deal with all of the stores.<p>Apps will be the new TV. Costs will rise.  Almost everything will be funded by the store networks.<p>The long tail of small developers will be absolutely decimated.<p>Users won’t care and will barely remember the difference.  The ten years of Apple’s store will be a quaint memory from the early days.')
