The DailyStormer got &quot;canceled&quot; by vendors for not even trying to moderate content that actively promoted violence (among other horrible things). Now Parlor gets &quot;canceled&quot; by vendors for not doing a good enough job trying to moderate content promoting violence.<p>If you do a sufficiently poor job, you might as well not even be trying at all. Especially if you court the content as a growth strategy.<p>Everyone&#x27;s free to manage their risks however they please, but I personally have no less confidence in AWS than I had before this event. I have updated my understanding of their decision heuristic as it applies to kicking people off their service. But the probability of me or any company I&#x27;d manage running afoul of it is far less than the chance of getting struck by lightning.')
