The failure of this argument is here:<p>&gt; Therefore, increasing your consumption of computing resources increases your contribution to the suffering of others.<p>Yes, this is technically true. I think there&#x27;s an easy way to trump this:<p>The amount by which your extra compute cycles increase global warming is much less than <i>both</i> of (the opportunity cost of spending your time tweaking your code instead of some other method of fighting global warming) and (the amount that some single-digit percentage of your salary could contribute to fighting global warming).<p>At some point, you will be punished for prioritizing performance-tuning code over producing business value. If you use your dollars to fight against global warming in some way, this is a net negative. Likewise, if you do this off the clock, I believe there are other volunteer actions you could take that would decrease carbon emissions more than spending that time optimizing code.')
