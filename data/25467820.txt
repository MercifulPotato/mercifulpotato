There should be a trade off between the power you can gain from doing missions and the damage the chip is doing to your brain.<p>Secondly the whole concept multiple personalities should&#x27;ve been a game mechanics it&#x27;s a goldmine for a morality and loyalty system that actually fits perfectly within the nerrative.<p>You as a player get 3 options, Fight&#x2F;Control Johnny, become Johnny or become something new this could&#x27;ve been the basis of a morality system that isn&#x27;t good&#x2F;evil and you could&#x27;ve essentially had 3 factions that represent your moral compass.<p>The people who knew V before the chippening, Jackie should not have been killed he should&#x27;ve served as the moral compass for old V, Johnny&#x27;s old gang like rogue and the new factions&#x2F;chars you meet in the game after the chippening like Panam and her nomad tribe.<p>I loved TW3 despite all it&#x27;s flaws, and I&#x27;ve actually created a lot of mods for TW1 and TW2 I&#x27;m not American, my GF is Polish I actually know people who worked at CDPR on previous games so please stop with this whole poor polish schtick it&#x27;s unbecoming, CDPR has no longer the benefit of being an indie&#x2F;small studio when they are working on games with a budget of over $300M. Their long term support for their titles is admirable but it doesn&#x27;t excuse the piss poor state of the game considering that Cyberpunk 2077 had a bigger development budget than freaking GTA IV and probably in the same ballpark as RDR2....')
