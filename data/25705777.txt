I&#x27;m just saying that <i>this crazy printing is consistent with the current market</i>.<p>I also tell loud and clear to stay away from them and to any exchange that wants you to be holding this shit. This doesn&#x27;t mean that I swear off anyone working in crypto as a fraud like Tether.<p>&gt; Money printing is irrelevant (...) You&#x27;re pointing at a system working<p>Working <i>for whom</i>? For the ones that already have access to cheap capital? For companies in Wall Street that have enough money in their balance sheets to buy Uruguay or half the Mediterranean? For banks that should&#x27;ve been liquidated decades ago?<p>Inflation rate is under the target? Oh great, so now all the small business owners will go bankrupt and <i>not</i> be able to afford the things they need at almost the same price they were before, and the rest of the unemployed people can just take their $600 checks to buy a PS5 to kill the time they will be spending at home.
