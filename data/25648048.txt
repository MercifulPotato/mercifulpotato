Item(by='jaymzcampbell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609867782, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25647429, text='A couple of years ago I moved everything over to my brother who resides in Dublin just in case I lost my long standing domains. It seems I could in theory update this back to my home address in Northern Ireland given this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blacknight.blog&#x2F;brexit-and-eu-domains-again.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blacknight.blog&#x2F;brexit-and-eu-domains-again.html</a> - does anyone know if that&#x27;s actually the case? I found the potential loss of yet another part of my EU identity thanks to Brexit a real kick in the teeth :(<p><i>Edit</i>: I guess as I hold an Irish passport I&#x27;m entitled to own an EU domain. Though I remember messaging EurID at the time (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;EUregistry&#x2F;status&#x2F;1086252921380065285" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;EUregistry&#x2F;status&#x2F;1086252921380065285</a>) and they didn&#x27;t seem to know for sure - but that linked page now says <i>a Union citizen, independently of their place of residence</i> - so that probably covers me. I feel for any UK only citizen losing theirs :&#x2F;')
