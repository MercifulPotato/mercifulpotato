After all, we all know the Catholic church has The Pope as their leader, and probably about the only religion people know who the World voice of that religion is.<p>But kudos for the Catholic Church for what they have done throughout this pandemic.  I am by no means saying other religions efforts during this pandemic are any better or worse and just wanted to clarify that so no subtext is inferred.  Indeed I don&#x27;t want to hear what others if they are be doing wrong, kinda want to hear the good examples so we all learn from them.<p>&gt;And yes, the Catholic Church definitely cares about tradition. In fact, people criticize it for caring too much about tradition at times.<p>The Catholic Church also has a tradition of caring and people have a tradition of complaining (I&#x27;m British so maybe a cultural perspective slant there), but nobody complaining here upon that tradition of caring too much.')
