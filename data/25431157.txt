Hedge Funds, VC Funds, PE Funds, Ect) that are generating very strong and consistent returns, often 25% IRR or more.<p>However, the average investor will never have the ability to invest due to the lack of connections and fact that most have a min. check size - typically $1 M or more.<p>I have built an application that pools together smaller check sizes with a much smaller minimum and diversifies your investment across VC&#x2F;Hedge&#x2F;PE Funds in the top quartile of performance.<p>Previous comments have indicated a lack of access to big names funds (E.g. A16Z, Sequoia, Ect.) Actually, these funds are often not top performing because they have too much money, but rather smaller managers often with less than $1 B AUM.<p>Also, they have referenced Fund of Funds, this is different than Fund of Funds, because they indeed have reduced check sizes, but they are still out of reach for most accredited investors and intentionally try to minimize the amount of investors they have.<p>Look forward to your comments.')
