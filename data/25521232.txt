Unfortunately, Google being anywhere in range of a product makes it radioactive.<p>I&#x27;d definitely agree the battery life on Fitbit is a huge deal, I used to get a week out of my Ionic, though as it has aged, it&#x27;s good for less than a day (replaceable batteries needs to be a thing again in tech). The sleep data was pretty interesting, although I don&#x27;t feel like it was ever actionable for me.<p>I absolutely think there are opportunities for health (in another comment, I talk about a personal experience with my Fitbit), but Google will not be the one leading the charge on that. Their focus is, and will always be, ad revenue.')
