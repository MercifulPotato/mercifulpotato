I stopped all drugs (including the SSRI) and confessed to my psychiatrist, who prescribed me clonazepam. Clonazepam reduced the intensity of the visuals, and after the summer ended I was mostly able to tune out the visual static and focus on my schoolwork. I stopped needing the clonazepam, finished learning to tune out the noise and got on with my life. I also had DP&#x2F;DR, but that got better with focusing on work and community to rebuild my shattered ego and life.<p>It was unpleasant but I ultimately came out better than I went in. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for you, but rebuilding worked for me and made me stronger.')
