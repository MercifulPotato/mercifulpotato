It was waaaay to low. I got 20k&#x2F;Weekly for 8 weeks and was back in the normal range.<p>A few weeks without Vitamin D supplement later and I&#x27;m very low on Vitamin D again. So more Vitamin D supplements.<p>I&#x27;m not taking it regularly yet, but I can feel the difference. Number one must be not being as tired, number two is sort of like... more content? I just feel better and healthier and a lot calmer.<p>If there is an actual link between hypothyroidism and vitamin d levels I would be interested in other stories.')
