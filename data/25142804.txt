There&#x27;s a degree of Stockholm Syndrome in healthcare tech where people <i>don&#x27;t know</i> what a well-developed product or codebase looks like. It&#x27;s unlikely to change from the top, so getting more technical folks with higher leverage into the field is IMO the next-best option.<p>And yes things are changing at a glacial pace, but they <i>are</i> changing. For example, my province is developing a new patient portal [1] out in the open. AFAICT, they seem to be doing everything aboveboard: CI, code quality standards, documentation and proper testing, etc. Yet if you look at another team in the same org (ministry of health), you&#x27;ll find non-existent dev practices, oodles of VBA, or (even worse) some slow+buggy third party system put in place by one of the procurement vampires (IBM, CGI, Deloitte, you know the bunch). The biggest difference? The former project has a dedicated, US Digital Service-style team of skilled and hopefully better-compensated dev(ops) people who know how to deliver good software.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bcgov&#x2F;healthgateway" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bcgov&#x2F;healthgateway</a>')
