Let&#x27;s say 20% of waiters at a restaurant under-report their tips to the IRS. It would be objectionable if the IRS decided to target one guy in particular because the agent had a grudge on him, but it&#x27;s far less objectionable if the IRS acted on an anonymous report that the guy was evading taxes. If anything, it would be more objectionable if the IRS didn&#x27;t act, and said &quot;well 20% of waiters are evaders as well, so it would be unfair to investigate that guy because we don&#x27;t investigate the rest&quot;.')
