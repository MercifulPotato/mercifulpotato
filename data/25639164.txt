Think of it this way - if the government of the country you live in places a bounty of say ($2000 USD or that country&#x27;s equivalent) for each top secret document - it both places a high value target on us, as well as revealing the things that they DONT know. I mean, specifically do you know of the latest in Fort Knox&#x27;s security protocols? Do you know the latest in high powered microwave weapons that we&#x27;re developing (and how to make them)?<p>These are things we really don&#x27;t want additional countries knowing how to make.')
