And it&#x27;s really bitten me recently because the codebase I work in (C++, Chromium based) just won&#x27;t index in CLion, it&#x27;s so massive that CLion just pukes. That and with my remote work situation I&#x27;m really down to mostly using CLI tools, so it&#x27;s back to Emacs (which I like, and have made work for me, but it&#x27;s ... not the same)<p>I fear someday having to do job interviews and having to get up on a whiteboard or use some half-assed shared-coding IDE, because my fingers and eyes, they really want JetBrains products there... I don&#x27;t type out for-loops, I use generators, etc. etc. it&#x27;s all so much faster...')
