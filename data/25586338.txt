Mostly 1080p60, it&#x27;s been awesome, some filters take a bit longer to preview than they do on my intel MacBook with amd gpu (my dev machine, node, python), but nothing to cause issues. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised how well it works so far. Win 10 arm via parallels is a bit slower than I&#x27;d like but i don&#x27;t need to do much in it to bother.')
