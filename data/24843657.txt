This is very different from the US which just supplies one phase to each house even if the supply itself is 3-phase. This is why you commonly see 200+A main breakers on a house in the US whereas in Sweden, 25A is a pretty common main breaker size.<p>(It&#x27;s as if the US grid characteristics were decided by the copper vendors... ;-)')
