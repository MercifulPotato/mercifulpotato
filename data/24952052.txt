Costs associated with subscriptions are negligible for full time professionals.<p>I think the rise of FreeCad is good for amateurs or part-time architects, and I hope one day it can rival others in the industry, like blender did for modeling, sculpting, composing and FXs. But when it comes to BIM, I&#x27;d rather have an architect that uses Autocad than one that uses subpar tools.')
