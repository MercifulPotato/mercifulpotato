Once or twice a week, I will receive an offer to add &quot;a couple lines of code&quot; to my extension which are always generously described as &quot;allowed in the Chrome Web Store&quot; by little fly-by-night organizations that only even have a landing page half the time and usually have throwaway-looking gmail accounts. Out of curiosity, I&#x27;ve asked a few what their code does and they never fully describe it, but it either collects analytics to ship home (my extension runs on all sites, so it&#x27;s appetizing to them!) or places paid results at the top of any search results, for which I can make &quot;thousands of dollars a month based on the number of North American users I have&quot;.<p>Here is an example email I received yesterday. It&#x27;s a good example of how they call it &quot;an SDK&quot; and looks like one of the more legit ones (they registered a domain to send email from, at least).<p><pre><code>  We at [redacted] are considering purchasing the complete license and ownership of the extensions which have 50K+ active users, may I know if you would be interested in selling? If so, - what is your estimated price?\n\n  Regarding the SDK monetization which we discussed earlier, as it is not distractive and is compatible with any other monetization. We have straightforward terms and provide support for your users agreement. Our partners generate 3-20 K USD monthly with our solution for the browser extensions.\n\n  As a kind reminder, we are [redacted] â€” a reputable global peer-to-peer ethical proxy network. All our clients are big reputable companies, we authorize their business before providing any proxy plans. \n\n  Look forward to your further feedback and discussing further details of our financial proposal for your Software in a short Zoom call or here by emails.\n</code></pre>\nFinally, I am also hounded by teams at Microsoft and Apple, who want me to port the extension to their new plugin ecosystems so it can be featured&#x2F;showcased. I worked with Apple on one similar thing for an extension and it caused such a huge jump in support and feature requests from users that I was overwhelmed, so I am not keen to do it again until I have more free time. They can&#x27;t understand why I don&#x27;t want to grow by tens of thousands of users a week, but I&#x27;m just one person and don&#x27;t make money from it whatsoever.')
