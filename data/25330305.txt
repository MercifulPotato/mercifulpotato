Is the Servo layout engine _not_ original because layout engines already exist? :)<p>Moving away from the rhetorical question, I think there are several reasons to rewrite something in Rust, the first and foremost being the huge improvement in memory safety&#x2F;management. The other reasons are typically related to speed: C wasn&#x27;t built with concurrency in mind, and trying to develop multi-threaded C applications that run in a cross-platform manner is not straightforward. On the other hand, Rust has the following:<p>1) Memory safety during concurrency [1].\n2) Multi-threading in the standard library [1].\n3) An amazing package ecosystem revolving around &quot;crates&quot;. And there are several build specifically to make concurrency safe and easy to implement.
