I don&#x27;t know if that kind of environment is for me but I&#x27;d love to give it a spin.<p>I have never found the REPL (the Python&#x2F;Ruby REPL which is not a &quot;real repl&quot; according to this article) to be that useful beyond quickly playing with API of a library with sample data and getting a feel of it and its return types. So this version of repl described in the article does sound interesting.')
