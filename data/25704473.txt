Speculative mania is not a pump and dump. It&#x27;s poor decision making, and generally speaking, that&#x27;s not illegal.<p>On the other hand, if I start a stable coin, let&#x27;s call it Anchor. Then I get a bunch of un-banked exchanges to use it in lieu of dollars because they can&#x27;t get legitimate banking and don&#x27;t want to bother with AML, KYC, the sanctions list or enabling international terrorism. I then start printing 750 million totally un-backed Anchors per day. I then use them to buy Bitcoin to drive the price up parabolically. I then sell all my Bitcoin for dollars to the most recent institutional clowns invested, and flee from the island I currently reside on to a different island. <i>That&#x27;s</i> crime.')
