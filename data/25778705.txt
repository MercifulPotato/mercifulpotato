We see how hard that is in the context of Twitter and Facebook. There are laws on the books in some countries criminalizing as &quot;hate speech&quot; the voicing of opinions that many reasonable people would consider simple truth, political or moral beliefs, mild skepticism of power, or disputing of facts&#x2F;interpretations. In the US there is no definition of &quot;hate speech&quot; that is currently consistent with existing law. We already have laws to criminalize certain speech acts and a body of law to support them. If someone knows what &quot;hate speech&quot; is and can define it in a policy that isn&#x27;t used to silence political opinion, then they are in rarefied company. Many people&#x27;s opinions are noxious to others, of course. But who gets to decide which are which? Apple? Amazon? Twitter? Facebook? The 2020 US Congress? The 2022 Congress? The President of Russia? The CCP? The loudest keyboard activists and their online mobs? Those who are celebrating this aren&#x27;t thinking it through, or have other agendas.')
