It&#x27;s not even that clear cut in practice: Even if a no-code UI allows visual coding, many users will still consider that &quot;someone else&#x27;s job&quot; for most of their work.<p>-- How: Whether it&#x27;s MDD, neural nets, program synthesis, or the latest VC-fueled JS-is-the-new-VB dumpster fire ready to implode, it&#x27;s the devs who care, not the user.<p>Interestingly, as soon as you appreciate the constraints of the Who&#x2F;What&#x2F;Why, new implementation dimensions open up for the How. We&#x27;re picking our own pieces for the How part of no&#x2F;low-code (rejected the MDD + JS approaches), but IMO just as important, working through design considerations for the social &amp; collaborative nature of code, esp. as it enters team&#x2F;org&#x2F;OSS&#x2F;etc. scenarios. It&#x27;s sort of like, all social networks are basically the same from 10K ft, but it&#x27;s not easy getting the design decision right of how 140 characters for dense broadcast x AI-mediated voting will define a successful niche like &#x27;community newsfeed for between tasks on your laptop + on-the-go&#x27;.<p>Edit: Historical note on the How - MDD is from a fun era when folks were figuring out domain-specific workbench tools and what becomes possible with them. While some of that is continuing even today (esp. in Europe!), most R&amp;D here has largely advanced to program synthesis (esp. via SAT&#x2F;SMT), and much more nascent, via neural nets. That&#x27;s far out enough that I can count on my fingers how many startups are here, vs more VB&#x2F;Excel&#x2F;Hypercard-in-JS')
