Keyboards are generic, there&#x27;s been very little innovation in a long time, everyone knows how to make a basically equivalent product. The only real distinguisher between competitors is cost. That&#x27;s going to drive margins to be razor thin. But not because its hardware but because the type of product a keyboard is. You would probably see the same thing in the market for hammers, cutlerly, etc.')
