MacOS <i>is</i> UNIX. Unix and Linux are similar in many ways and plenty of Linux utilities have been ported over or packaged for macOS, the same as any other BSD, but as you say, it’s one kernel and one system with different interface options. It’s not as if you’re having to deal with different file systems or share the same hardware across kernels.<p>A better comparison would be Docker for Mac, which has had several approaches over the years. Originally, Docker Desktop for Mac used VirtualBox in the background to spin up a VM that was then used for containers. It then moved to using HyperKit, which is the more “native” soliton but has downsides, largely around I&#x2F;O and CPU usage, many of the same problems facing WSL1 and some of the edge cases with WSL2.')
