I manually launch one ssh&#x2F;tmux session per server and typically have multiple tmux panes, with nvidia-smi and htop outputs. I keep reconnecting to these ssh&#x2F;tmux sessions to monitor progress. I also save the results of experiments to text files, so that at the end of the hyperparameter search I can just look at those files. Looking at files is sometimes easier&#x2F;quicker than looking through tmux sessions (files are kept in shared storage).<p>I&#x27;ve seen plenty of experiment management tools being advertised, but every time I looked at them they were either very limited, or required significant restructuring of my code or my workflow.<p>I&#x27;d like to hear about whatever solution you find because I agree, this does get tedious and painful sometimes.')
