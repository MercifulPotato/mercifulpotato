That comes to an end in a few days; at that point what happens next depends on the outcome of negotiations. There&#x27;s certainly a world in which EU patent rules continue to apply to the UK; in fact, that would probably have been the default assumption until the British government went off the deep end.<p>So, if you use &#x27;Brexit&#x27; to mean purely the legalistic act of leaving the EU, then yes, it&#x27;s happened. However, effectively none of the _effects_ of Brexit have happened yet.')
