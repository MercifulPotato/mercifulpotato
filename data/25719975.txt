Item(by='daxfohl', descendants=None, kids=[25720084], score=None, time=1610313431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719642, text='Fwiw I&#x27;ve been doing 100% Huel Black and a keto dinner for the last two months, and never felt better. It takes the decision fatigue of &quot;does this fit in my diet&quot; out of it all, and makes eating right so much easier. I honestly feel like my brain is functioning better now too, just one less thing gnawing away at it. And I like Huel Black because it&#x27;s kind of gross, so no urge to overconsume, which I&#x27;ve run into with other products. Plus, it feels somewhat nice in that it&#x27;s probably one of the more environmentally friendly ways to eat.<p>I never would have thought I&#x27;d be able to keep up with it (love sugar too much) but actually it&#x27;s been not so hard once I set my mind to it. I gave up alcohol a few years ago and this has been easier than that.<p>We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts. It seems weird to think about doing it forever, but who knows. For now I see no reason to stop, and lots of reasons to keep going.')
