But fiscal balance itself isn&#x27;t a useful yardstick for that.<p>&gt; Piloting federal fiscal policy on MMT is akin to steering the plane to FL 100 and keeping an eye out for a stall.<p>No, it&#x27;s more like guiding nap-of-the-earth flight with a radar altimeter rather than a barometric altimeter calibrated to the long-term average global pressure at sea level. Monetary effects are the actual hard constraints, fiscal balance is a distant, murky proxy with an uncertain and time-and-conditions-variable relation to the actual constraint that obfuscates rather than clarifies.')
