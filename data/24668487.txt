In my college, sophomores teach freshmen about Google&#x27;s Summer of Code, open source and events like hacktoberfest. These endeavours are headed by the one or two guys among the students who happen to get into GSoC&#x2F;ICPC or (in majority of the cases) have a good competitive coding profile<p>In my mind the problem lies with the college, they should be teaching their students how to contribute meaningfully. Spamming behaviors will only hurt the reputations of everyone from that college.')
