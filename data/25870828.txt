Best to get a little hindsight.<p>That is an interesting exhibit, thanks. It has swayed me on the time-frame, I&#x27;m not sure it changes my basic view - the AWS rep is talking about literally 3 posts in mid November, one of which seems to have 450 views in 5 days if the eye icon means what I think. From politely raising 3 horrible posts to extinguishing a business in a month and a half still leaves me questioning if the TOS was enforced politically.')
