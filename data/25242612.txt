But I realize not everyone lives this way and busy life can be distracting.<p>You&#x27;re very right it would depend much on the person AND the goal.<p>The main value I personally see here is the setup. I wouldn&#x27;t have to set up reminders and tracking manually. I may even learn a new goal I hadn&#x27;t considered if others share their goals. As long as it doesn&#x27;t devolve into a perfectionism race to the burnout line.<p>I hope it results into more a tool for self improvement than yet another business preying on human flaws&#x2F;needs.')
