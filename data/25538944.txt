If more &quot;serious&quot; contributions need to be made, learning the basics of how git works isn&#x27;t that difficult - branching, commits, and merging are basically all that a novice user needs to understand, and they&#x27;re pretty easy to explain concepts (even if it means you&#x27;re telling White lies about how it works under the hood).<p>We don&#x27;t expect the average person to understand the tools and workflow of a mechanical engineer working with SolidWorks PDM - we shouldn&#x27;t expect the average person to understand git (which is basically the software equivalent). I&#x27;ve never disagreed with the arguments that git is confusing or difficult to learn for non-software-developets, but I&#x27;ve never really understood why that&#x27;s a problem.')
