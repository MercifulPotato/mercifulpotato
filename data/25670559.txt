It works great — I can dedicate an entire portrait monitor to Slack, for example, and I can just make a tiny head movement or chair swivel much faster than surfacing windows or switching virtual desktops.  I tried a single large flat monitor, but when the center was the right distance the corners were too far away to read comfortably, and this way they are all angled directly to me.')
