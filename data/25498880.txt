But it can also be made to make packet filter decisions (thus altering <i>what happens</i>), and with at least one network card that eBPF program can be pushed to the network card and filter before the packet even hits RAM, much less the CPU!<p>eBPF can run at socket init time, and set some default TCP tuning parameters.<p>Another comment in this thread asked if one can write a whole device driver in eBPF. The answer is actually not clear.<p>eBPF is more similar to &quot;the ability to load kernel modules&quot; than it is &quot;a tracing framework&quot;.')
