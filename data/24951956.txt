Will read in full shortly.<p>--<p>Polarization isn&#x27;t just one thing. It&#x27;s the result of everything mushed together.<p>Ezra Klein&#x27;s Why We Are Polarized is a terrific summary, synthesis of the research. Connects so many dots. Physical sorting (urbanization) promotes polarization, faceted identities are now super identities, nationalization of media begat the nationalization of our politics, the massive political reorg fallout from LBJ&#x27;s Great Society ending the Dixiecrat&#x27;s strangle hold on southern states (aka Nixon&#x27;s Southern Strategy), and many more.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Why-Were-Polarized-Ezra-Klein&#x2F;dp&#x2F;147670032X" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Why-Were-Polarized-Ezra-Klein&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1476...</a><p>--<p>Klein doesn&#x27;t much touch on social media in this book. Some of his podcasts episodes are relevant. Two underreported factoids popped out for me, First, how the landscape changed from blogging to social media. Second is the elephant in the room about the algorithms and how most critics are guilty of  conflating speech with signal boosting.<p>(I have my own thoughts about social media, shared piecemeal thru my comment history. No thesis or narrative yet, sorry.)<p>Whatever the evil of social media today, eliminating it outright (not gonna happen) would only mitigate some of the toxicity and definitely won&#x27;t unwind polarization.')
