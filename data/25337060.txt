The memory isn&#x27;t on the die, but it is in the package (MCM). I don&#x27;t think that provides faster throughput, but it should help latency.<p>Regardless, the big win was giving unified access to that memory using a memory fabric.

Intel can too, but it has a hill to climb WRT GPU performance.<p>Apple&#x27;s AI chiplet is another matter...')
