A phonebook is a single list compiled by one organization. DNS is more like asking a librarian for information on a subject, and the librarian handing back a reference book. The librarian may or may not know anything about the subject, but they know where to go to find the information.<p>Just like DNS:\n- Which librarian you ask can result in being pointed to a different reference book.\n- If the librarian is already familiar with the subject, they may be able to give you the answer directly to save time instead of pointing you to the reference book.<p>The phonebook metaphor was a good one to give to completely non-technical people, but technical people used it as well, and so often didn&#x27;t intuitively understand that DNS involves clients exchanging data with arbitrary servers on the internet, using their own DNS server as a proxy. As a result, they often leave s significant communication channel open to the internet even from supposedly secure environments.')
