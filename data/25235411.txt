It seems the CISC architecture creates an upper limit for decoders, as complexity rapidly grows when you have no idea where the next instruction begins in a variable length ISA.<p>So Apple has twice as many decoders, eight, and may actually be able to keep adding to that number while AMD and Intel may get stuck on 4, thanks to the x86 CISC legacy.')
