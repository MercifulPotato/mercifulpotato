I was just contemplating trying to explain this to someone and having them make them for me...and here they are. You are amazing. Now, please make the middle and back-end cards and I will be delirious with joy. When you don&#x27;t know how to code and cannot visualize the steps that a potential customer might take these will be so freaking useful as I try to create my first SaaS. I guess I could have went to a site and stopped every few seconds to write out my whole journey....but what a waste of a day. The only thing missing is some kind of overview about which types of sites benefit from specific workflow examples with APIs that are currently available. I am probably not explaining it very well. But Clement Vouillon of Point ( Capital wrote this incredible post called &quot;How APIs are eating the Product Stack&quot; and the one thing missing was the hierarchy. In other words, a visual representation of when things went where.... Now, with these flow cards, I can map out the stack and see how it is supposed to work. For those of us on the &quot;No-Code&#x2F;Minimal Code&quot; side of things, this seems like a huge game changer.<p>Thank You.<p>Postscript: I joined HN just to leave this comment. I&#x27;ve been lurking for years.')
