ESL is likely too advanced.<p>I would use that screenshot I posted above as a litmus test. Do you understand that notation? The `E` with the subscript? And why they&#x27;re using `trace[]`? If you do, then you can likely follow ESL. If not -- which would be understandable because even early undergrads likely can&#x27;t -- then I say you shouldn&#x27;t try and follow ISL up directly with ESL. It really is a graduate text.<p>&gt; Iâ€™ve seen the Bishop book highly recommended too, and it has been mentioned in this post.<p>Bishop has a similar problem: [1]. I had to scroll to chapter 2 for this screenshot (pg. 83), but it really is  par for the course.<p>So, and this is totally my opinion here so YMMV, recommendations for foundational ML info tend to be wildly too advanced for the people seeking them out. I&#x27;m a math-y person. I really like learning about the math foundations of ML. But ML builds on a lot of other concepts and you can&#x27;t just jump into the deep end. In my opinion, ML foundations should come at the end of a lengthy sequence of math and statistics courses. Students will just be too lost without them.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be discouraging here. I think nearly anyone who&#x27;s willing to put in the time can learn this stuff! But here&#x27;s a more reasonable sequence I found on reddit a while back that would set someone up nicely for being able to follow ESL: [2]. Without the proper foundation, it&#x27;s just too difficult to follow ESL or Bishop IMO.<p>Last, I&#x27;ll note that you don&#x27;t need to understand the nitty-gritty of ML math to be an ML practitioner. In fact, I&#x27;d argue that taking the effort would be distracting because 1) a basic understanding (like you&#x27;d get from working through ISL) is probably good enough to start messing with libraries and 2) practitioners need a whole bunch of other knowledge (like general software skills and how to maintain ML datasets) that they also have to take the time to learn.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;uXWZ6Bv" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;uXWZ6Bv</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;learnmachinelearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ggpzk2&#x2F;a_comprehensive_selfstudy_guide_for_the_math&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;learnmachinelearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ggpzk...</a>')
