There are still plenty of entities, particularly larger ones, that buy their own metal because at some scales it becomes far cheaper to run in a COLO (at least acc to near monthly articles posted on HN). I&#x27;d therefore put the risk that only big vendors will be able to buy hardware as low. That said, as ARM or custom chips gain market share within cloud providers, there&#x27;s a risk that x86 or standard suppliers will struggle, but AMD&#x2F;Intel see this too and surely one or both will adapt.<p>On skills I think there&#x27;s a small risk of people not knowing how to manage&#x2F;set up their own racks, but doing a passable job there isn&#x27;t that hard. On general sys-admin stuff, cloud infrastructure seems to have parallels to hardware infrastructure, so it shouldn&#x27;t be completely unfamiliar to set up a hardware router&#x2F;network&#x2F;linux server. There are definitely skills and details missing (remote admin tools for hardware maybe), but this doesn&#x27;t seem like a big gap to bridge if $$$ is on the line?')
