I am not sure if JS needs Option. In many cases try&#x2F;catch and Promises on boundaries of your code is enough.<p>In real life you would wrap async file operation in try&#x2F;catch and then call parseFile once you know that you have data. The obvious benefit of try&#x2F;catch is that it can catch unexpected errors (including logic&#x2F;data errors).<p>IMO JS&#x2F;TS provide a nice compromise between Go checking errors everywhere and rust more complex abstractions.')
