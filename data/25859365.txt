It knows that the &quot;usage&quot; of that variable in an f-string is an actual reference to the variable vs just part of the string with the same set of characters.<p>Not sure what you mean by complicated expressions? If you mean the variable is referenced in a complicated statement with calcs or as part of a ternary operator, etc... AFAIK they are all supported. It even understands scope. So it won&#x27;t go outside of the current scope where the variable is defined.<p>PyCharm&#x27;s refactoring is very neat. In certain instances it even &quot;refactors&quot; relative paths inside a string if you move the file being referenced. Moving files around is intelligent and <i>all</i> imports get fixed. It has neat naming-convention renaming (myVariable-&gt;my_variable). Lots of nice little quality-of-life features, which is why I think it is the best Python IDE out there atm. Give it a whirl, it&#x27;s got a free community edition that is near 100% functional!')
