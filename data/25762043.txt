Postmodern leaders, such as AOC, have encouraged low levels of violence using the Twitter platform.<p>This definition of violence is meant to describe violence as a spectrum which includes the destruction of property and destruction of job prospects of conservative individuals.<p>As far as I know, AOC has NOT tweeted the worst levels of violence. I apologize for using AOC as the primary example. If I could edit the parent statement I would because she is NOT the best example. It is also possible there is a less inflammatory word to describe cancel culture and property destruction than violence; I don&#x27;t want to mix two things up.<p>The AOC tweets I was referring are below:<p>- Encouraging riots.<p>AOC, protests&#x2F;riots threat:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AOC&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334184644707758080" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AOC&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334184644707758080</a><p>&quot;The thing that critics of activists don’t get is that they tried playing the “polite language” policy game and all it did was make them easier to ignore.&quot;<p>- Encouraging cancel culture.<p>AOC list tweet, is now deleted but was widespread.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ScottAdamsSays&#x2F;status&#x2F;1324817917456736257" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ScottAdamsSays&#x2F;status&#x2F;132481791745673625...</a><p>Other tweets I&#x27;ve seen:<p>Mike Adams bashing soon after suicide before burial:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ProfeRandolph&#x2F;status&#x2F;1286440502271901707" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ProfeRandolph&#x2F;status&#x2F;1286440502271901707</a><p>Most Rand Paul violent tweets were deleted.
