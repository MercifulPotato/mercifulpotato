Mine has dents all over the body, battery has been replaced a few times, upped the memory and replaced the optical drive with 1TB storage.<p>It&#x27;s performed surprisingly well for over 10 years. Once had to visit the &quot;geniuses&quot; to replace the logic board after a few years, but that&#x27;s it really.<p>Its worked in pubs behind the bar, as a live mixer for audio gigs, as a development machine, as a university note making machine...<p>Although now I&#x27;ve got what seems to be a hardware fault with the display where black pixels turn bright green. That and the fact the speakers and microphone are shot to pieces means I&#x27;ll have to move on soon.<p>End of an era for me. I will miss this machine dearly.<p>--<p>On jumping ship: if I can work out a way to get iTunes + Apple Music running reliably on Linux I&#x27;ll be jumping over there asafp. Not liking the software direction (news&#x2F;rumours?) Apple has taken recently.')
