It is my earnest hope and prayer that we may open our hearts and minds to these oft victimized people and understand their storied history and potential. All peoples are capable of great beauty and accomplishment - including Albanians - and it strikes me deep in my soul to witness the unjust downfall of such an exemplary young man who had risen above hardship and disadvantage to build something so great. In my mind there is nothing more responsible for the unearned hostility he has suffered than brutish prejudice, and I hope he still has time to complete his grand visions for a future with fewer life-threatening illnesses threatening humanity despite these unfortunate setbacks.<p>Hacker to hacker, stay strong Shkreli, my brother.
