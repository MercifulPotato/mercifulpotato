Russia might have opinions on someone else touching its junk.<p>* Proliferation risk of developing technology that can easily interfere with satellites on-demand. If a satellite mover can move junk, it can move live units too.<p>* Actual risk of error causing uncontrolled deorbiting, either with a mis-push, or by bouncing junk off the growing moon-like mass<p>* That moon-like mass could easily become a liability - irregularly shaped with hard-to-model behaviour. Most space junk will burn up on reentry, but a giant agglomeration of metal might survive reentry and land on something it shouldn’t.')
