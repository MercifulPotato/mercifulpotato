When I first started working there ~5 years ago, they were testing out SSDs in the appliances and the team ultimately decided against it because they estimated the SSDs would burn out in under a year.<p>By the time I left they were shipping appliances with SSDs that were predicted to have lifespans longer than the longest hardware support you could buy from the vendor (longest hardware support contract - seven years). Hundreds of thousands of writes per second, every second, for 7+ years, uninterrupted.')
