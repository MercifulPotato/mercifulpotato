When you do a lesson, it picks up the overdue cards first, but if there aren&#x27;t any, it pulls in new cards instead.</i><p>Those are features of AnkiDroid, and probably the desktop Anki also.<p>There is a daily review limit, and you can configure to see review cards before new cards. Anki does not tell you how much is overdue beyond the review limit.<p>If you&#x27;re set on writing your own app, you will tend to overlook the configuration details of the original, though.')
