It may also be below that, but I personally haven&#x27;t seen that data. But because HEPA fails to filter gases&#x2F;vapors, its performance must fall off before 1 angstrom = 0.0001 micron.<p>&gt; odors are not particles at all but rather gases&#x2F;vapors<p>I think the confusion comes from people referring to &quot;particulate&quot; as particles of &gt;= 0.01 micron, whereas in physics we say that gases&#x2F;vapors are also composed of particles. They may be single atoms floating (can&#x27;t actually come up with an example though) or small molecules like O^2, CO, etc, but I&#x27;d still call those particles.')
