I searched up bt gene&#x27;s use in pesticides[1] and it looks pretty safe.<p>Its referring to herbicide-resistant GMO crops where the pesticides are Roundup or Liberty. With regard to Bt, there&#x27;s a big difference between topical application of Bt and GMO Bt corn (where the Bt is produced inside the plant so bugs are poisoned by the plant).<p>&gt; &quot;all pesticides are bad&quot; assumption<p>Its more of a heuristic where we assume that things that are bad for biological organisms are bad for biological organisms because molecules don&#x27;t make decisions about what to react with, they react with anything that forms the right molecular bonds. Since the biosphere has <i>a lot</i> of bimolecular pathways its not possible to categorically test everything and catalog all the possible reactions, we just know we can limit the amount of unwanted reactions by using the minimum amount of pesticide.<p>&gt; As opposed to the natural gene pool being constantly polluted by spontaneous mutations?<p>They aren&#x27;t in opposition because mutations don&#x27;t stop when you start polluting the gene pool with GMO products.<p>&gt; Or is that fine because of the naturalistic fallacy?<p>Its an application of the precautionary principle where we act in such a manner to create the least possibility of harm because the scope and extent of the effects are not known.<p>&gt; AFAIK this is a non-issue except to the farmers.<p>Yes its a problem for the farmers because they can no longer rely on the herbicide to control those competitor organisms, which was the entire point of using a selective herbicide &#x2F; GMO crop system.<p>With regard to the ecosystem disruption due to pesticide runoff, its an issue for anyone who is dependent on the biosphere because of the harmful effects on biodiversity.')
