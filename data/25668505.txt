So there is no door to hit me on the way out.<p>&gt; Well, they repair all kinds of parts, and have guarantees and guarantee extension programs.<p>You can not get a lot surface mount chips to repair a mac book or iPhone without having to look on the gray-market. This is even before possible firmware issue if you manage to find parts. Heck even getting full replacement boards is basically impossible, unless they are from donor machines that have other problems.<p>&gt; &quot;Well, it does in a few ways. Mandating how the software is made, and what software is sold, when it should adapt new libs to continue being sold, etc, means that they can move the platform in different ways faster.&quot;<p>I disagree, allowing people to side-load does not stop apple from having policies in place for it&#x27;s app stores. That&#x27;s honestly the only problem. It&#x27;s the owners hardware, they should not need apples permission to run code on it. Unless the owner can sign software themselves and&#x2F;or run it without apple&#x27;s consent this will always be a problem. You can&#x27;t even install gcc without jailbreaking an iPhone.<p>At the very least I should be able to install an other OS on the device like GNU&#x2F;Linux. If apple does not want to open iOS the user should at least have that option for the hardware.<p>This is even before you get into how apple treats developers. Have you read the entire App store guidelines. Some of it is ridiculous. Some of the insanity prevents Firefox from even porting their own browser engine.')
