It&#x27;s been used by millions of users across different products<p>I recently decided to change the approach and instead provide a new library on an open-source basis, along with an supporting elevation API (www.nasadem.xyz).<p>Procedural GL JS is a complete reworking of the original library, with the following features:<p><pre><code>    * Stream in standard raster imagery tiles. Supports map tiles from a variety of providers\n    * Batteries included elevation data. Global 3D data coverage courtesy of nasadem.XYZ\n    * Powerful overlay capabilities. Draw crisp markers and lines\n    * Well-thought-out API, complex applications can be built without needing to deal with 3D concepts\n    * Great UX and intuitive controls, mouse-based on desktop &amp; touch-based on mobile\n    * Tiny filesize means library is parsed fast. Package size is less than THREE.js thanks to code stripping\n    * Novel GPU powered level-of-detail system. Off-loading to the GPU frees up the main JavaScript UI thread\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m planning a series of blog posts about how it works in the future, but for today it&#x27;s just the launch. Happy to answer any questions!')
