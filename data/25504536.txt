Unless you work for one of the top-top-top social networks we probably serve many more users that your systems do.<p>And even our existing services are not &quot;micro&quot;: they are relatively large, and were mostly extracted to handle tasks that needed a different language.<p>This massive code base is a very good example of how most people can do just fine with a monolith. I even learned to appreciate this uniform approach to things: monorepo, unified ci&#x2F;cd process, shared responsibility.')
