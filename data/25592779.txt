One of the reasons why is because it is a simple, linear calculation that values abled-bodiesâ€™ lives over disabled people. That is basically the entire premise of the measure, too. It is a human rights issue.<p>Unfortunately countries like the UK, Canada, and Australia routinely use it. The UK does so especially, and it is well embedded in its NICE guidelines. In the US, this practice was generally abandoned with the passing of the Affordable Care Act. The US system, certainly is the most problematic system of all, though.')
