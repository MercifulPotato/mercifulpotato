I&#x27;m certainly not an expert on the law -- I did some quick googling, but not a lot.<p>Session cookies, e.g. are fine. As best I can tell, &quot;remember me&quot; &#x2F; &quot;remember my email&quot; checkboxes still do require a banner, though I&#x27;m not sure. Preference cookies in general seem to. That strikes me as silly.<p>Facebook&#x27;s tracking me on thousands of unrelated websites; Wikipedia is remembering that I X&#x27;d out the donation banner last week and don&#x27;t want to be shown it again[0]. These are entirely different use-cases with entirely different privacy implications. As far as I can tell, both require a banner, and while the banner allegedly has (or links to) details about which is occurring, I&#x27;ve never, ever paid enough attention to those banners to see those details.<p>Part of this mess may be due to the fact that our client software is dominated by the largest advertiser, but I&#x27;d prefer regulations that address that by demanding privacy-respecting settings and setting defaults, not by showing me banners that I&#x27;ve never found useful.<p>I use uBlock Origin and Firefox&#x27; tracking protection. I don&#x27;t use the consent banners. I think most people automatically click &quot;yes&quot; on those, yet given the option to block tracking cookies en masse, would enable that option.<p>[0] Okay, seems as if Wikipedia ISN&#x27;T storing that info, but I wish they did.')
