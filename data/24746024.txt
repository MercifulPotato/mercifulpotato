In cases where its not practical exhausting a subset can still be very powerful.<p>E.g. for a function that takes two floats (x,y) test every value of x input with y={0,-0,1,nan,inf,-1,x,-x,2x,x&#x2F;2,FLT_EPSILON,FLT_MIN,FLT_MAX,random,random,random...}, and then repeat with x,y swapped.<p>A little knowledge of the domain can help pick better special values, but there is a trade-off in introducing the same blind-spots that permitted bugs in the first place. Still: testing just one argument on all values because that&#x27;s all you can afford is still a lot better than only testing a couple special values for both arguments.<p>Exhaustive testing, like randomized testing catches errors you weren&#x27;t even thinking about-- but unlike random testing exhaustion can reliably catch bugs which are extremely rare.  &quot;Partial exhaustion&quot; can have some of the same benefits.')
