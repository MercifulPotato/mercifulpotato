On one hand, I understand your stance. On the other hand, I think that you are overreacting and, more importantly, looking at tech through your &quot;custom&quot; lens (i.e., from several specific perspectives). The issues that you have mentioned are, indeed, real, however, so are many other things that are certainly positive. Plus, it seems that you are conflating (mostly Silicon Valley-based) VC-backed startups&#x27; culture and other aspects with a much larger and more diverse tech ecosystem. You just need to zoom out from your current viewpoint and look at the bigger picture. Despite all negative effects, tech and science play an overwhelmingly positive role in improving people&#x27;s lives on this planet. Consider just a couple of the following examples. Drones that enable delivery of medical supplies to remote locations, helping firefighters to improve their situational awareness and enabling safe and accurate maintenance of large infrastructure objects (buildings, bridges, etc.). Robots that replace people in highly physical-intensive and dangerous industrial and other environments. Medical equipment that improves accuracy of diagnostics, improves treatment outcomes and saves lives. Advances in chemistry and relevant technologies as well as materials science and engineering* provide us with much improved and new advanced materials that improve practically every aspect of our lives. Computational drug development, genetic therapies, green energy technologies, automated transportation. The list goes on and on ... So, I encourage you to reconsider your stance and look at tech from a higher vantage point. Best wishes!<p>*) Currently I&#x27;m working on (bootstrapping) a frontier tech startup in this domain, which I&#x27;m very passionate about.')
