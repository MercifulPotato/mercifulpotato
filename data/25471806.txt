This sort of goes to why humans are so bad at seeing patterns in the ”random” numbers generated by computers. Simply put, coincidence is generally our inability to make sense of the more complex underlying mathematical relationships, and so our dumb monkey brains attempt to fit together information that may not really have any logical commonality.')
