The second chapter of The Road to Wigan Pier (separately published in the excellent essay collection &#x27;Inside The Whale&#x27;), which describes the working conditions of coal miners in the North of England, is one of the greatest pieces of journalistic writing in history [1]. In fact the whole book is very good, and contrary to this article I think only a fool would not find it relevant to the modern day - especially in its discussion of utopianism and the post-work society.<p>In general, the fact that Orwell is remembered in the public consciousness as the 1984 guy is a shame (and is particularly jarring when right wing populists invoke his name to decry people who try and get them to stop lying).<p>Orwell&#x27;s essay &#x27;England Your England&#x27; (the first part of &#x27;The Lion and the Unicorn&#x27;) is perhaps his piece which is dearest to my heart, as a patriotic but anti-reactionary Englishman. However, of broader appeal are &#x27;Shooting an Elephant&#x27; and &#x27;A Hanging&#x27; - essays which expose the brutal workings of colonialism better than any jargon-laden journal of post-colonial theory ever could.<p>But that&#x27;s just the start when it comes to Orwell. I don&#x27;t think the man wrote anything not worth reading and at his best he was near-untouchable in his ability to capture in the written word a society and its injustices.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orwell.ru&#x2F;library&#x2F;essays&#x2F;mine&#x2F;english&#x2F;e_dtm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orwell.ru&#x2F;library&#x2F;essays&#x2F;mine&#x2F;english&#x2F;e_dtm</a>')
