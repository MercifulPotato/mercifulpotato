Apple shipped the first 64-bit ARM processor at least a year before Qualcomm could do it.<p>It took 10-years of designing their own ARM SoCs to get to the point of being able to produce the M1.<p>Apple showed Debian running in a VM on a prototype 6 months ago, so we know that&#x27;s coming. There&#x27;s a decent chance Linux running in a VM (or native Docker when that comes) will be much faster than Linux running on similarly priced Intel&#x2F;AMD hardware.')
