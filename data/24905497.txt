I felt the same way living in the US (minus the kids). Now having moved back, I realize that the problem was not entirely the US, most of it was my own attitude. I won&#x27;t claim that every country is equal, but there are often good and bad things about most countries, and I haven&#x27;t seen a perfect one yet. Being an expat in a country though you will notice every little flaw, or anything that&#x27;s different from what you&#x27;re used to. Things that annoyed me disproportionatly included paying rent with paper checks and the look and density of US cities. There were a million things like that, along with more serious issues like politics and healthcare. Meanwhile you are partially (sometimes completely) blind to the problems of your home country.\nTry to be cognizant of this and try not to be bitter, it&#x27;s not worth it.<p>This is a sideline, but I want to be very clear: I don&#x27;t hangout with expats (I&#x27;d say 90% of my friends are Swedes), and I have no illusions whatsoever about the faults of my original country (the UK), which I would never move back to. As a person who grew up in England with parents from Spain who were Basques, I&#x27;m actually very critical of &#x27;patriotic&#x27; sentiments, and extremely aware of the personal biases that they involve.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not bitter - but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s typical of you as a Swede to characterize my hatred of Sweden in that negative way.')
