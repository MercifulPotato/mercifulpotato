Last year mine was telling me the battery was dead. I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry to replace this one because it wasn&#x27;t powering anything too important at the time, but it was still useful to leave there as an overpriced power strip until I could get around to replacing the battery, so that&#x27;s what I did. A few weeks passed with the dead battery in there, but no new alerts. I was cleaning under my desk and ended up touching the UPS when I realized it was uncomfortably hot. I very quickly turned it off and unplugged it. I wasn&#x27;t sure what the safest thing to do was at that point, but I figured I should get the battery disconnected ASAP. It was difficult to remove, and after I got it out it was easy to see why. The battery casing had actually deformed.<p>That scared me of of APC. The unit should have shut down before letting itself get that hot.')
