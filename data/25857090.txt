But if the cost of generating that revenue puts OKRs at greater risk, its better to raise more money to extend your runway.\nIf you meet your OKRs, assuming you&#x27;ve chosen the right OKRs, your KPIs will follow.\nIn many ways this is a culture issue:\nCulture trumps Strategy, OKRs trump KPIs\nProvided you have the cash.\nCitizen Shareholders is now looking for that cash. When we&#x27;re asked why we have no revenue projected for 2 years, it&#x27;s because being able to survive for 2 years without revenue will derisk us to the early B2B adopters.\nHaving that early revenue in the bank alongside those investor funds is a problem we can live with.\nJust in time supply chains are so very 2019, we plan to make sure we have enough to succeed by, at times, having more than enough.\nIf you want to find out more: CitizenShareholders.com')
