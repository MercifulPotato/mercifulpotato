Where is your conception based off of?</i><p>They are (were?) at 3% vs 6% average, on small absolute numbers. Not great but certainly within margin of forgiveness.<p>My conception is based on the scene as a whole, which is extremely international. Look at the public personalities in crypto vs. the wider VC tech scene. It&#x27;s possible Coinbase is a pocket of prejudice, but it would be an exception.<p><i>&gt; stated principles and actual beliefs&#x2F;actions often don&#x27;t match in tech.</i><p>I agree, but this isn&#x27;t just a principle here, the mechanics of crypto themselves prevent racial, gender, socioeconomic bias. You can&#x27;t say one thing and do the other when the code is open source and is the main UI. That&#x27;s the difference with things like big-tech&#x27;s empty &quot;privacy pledges&quot; for instance, here the bad thing is made actually structurally inconvenient.')
