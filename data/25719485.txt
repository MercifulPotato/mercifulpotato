It has a use. There is a difference between &quot;This person is inciting violence&quot; and &quot;This person is disagreeing with us&quot; and the line has not been blurred yet.<p>I&#x27;m glad Trump got banned, because he is an Internet troll who happens to hold office.<p>I&#x27;m glad that a few rioters were arrested. I hope they are convicted and serve jail time. I hope they live to realize why they were wrong. If they die it means I will never have them on my side.<p>I don&#x27;t want anyone to die. Death, unlike de-platforming, cannot be undone if it turns out we are wrong.<p>So please don&#x27;t lump me in with people calling for guillotines and mob violence.')
