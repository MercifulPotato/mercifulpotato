But human nature being what it is it might not be possible for that large a group to correctly and consistently do so. Someone is going to be lazy or greedy. More processes and controls are added, making it more complicated, etc.<p>Another example is voting for president. We&#x27;ve made a political system that puts so much authority and influence in the hands of one person, over such a complex society and economy, and we ignore all of the important issues of the day instead squabbling over irrelevant details.<p>In practicality things keep becoming more complex and the risk of major incidents increase because of this, incidents that nobody sees coming and nobody knows how to fix right away. A serious problem.')
