With my limited university statistics class knowledge I would say they are 95% sure that the efficacy lies between -12.1% and 100.0% for age &gt;=75.<p>Is this the correct interpretation? If yes, doesnâ€™t it show that we simply do not know about its efficacy in this age group yet (due to lack of data)? If not, could you please explain it?<p>Thank you in advance!')
