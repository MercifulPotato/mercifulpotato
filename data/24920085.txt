But you&#x27;re right they don&#x27;t have the density.<p>The key is to realize <i>the cars themselves killed density</i>.<p>Parking lots, parking spaces, and extra lanes all conspire to push humans and human spaces further apart. This then makes walking less feasible, cars more required, and more space required to accommodate those cars in a feedback loop.<p>Taller buildings are not required for density, far from it. Look at Somerville, MA, where just about nothing is higher than 3 stories, yet they fit almost 20,000 people into a square mile -- and they like it. What they <i>don&#x27;t</i> fit is 20,000 parking spaces, and that makes all the difference.')
