I think we are beyond the point where we need to recognize that psycology is a weapon and even knowing how it works won&#x27;t make you immune to it<p>According to this logic, consumers are helpless children. If we accept this, (I don&#x27;t) the nanny state managing the purchases of childish consumers easily follows.<p>Perhaps drug addicts would be a less inflammatory comparison. Drug prohibition has arguably done more damage, and failed to eradicate drug addiction. We aren&#x27;t talking about protecting helpless victims from violence. We are talking about using violence to prohibit individuals from freely trading with each other.<p>We are back at the core of the issue which I presented above.
