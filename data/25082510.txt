We can&#x27;t have that if some parties appoint themselves the arbiters of permissible speech.</i><p>Are you a free speech absolutist? So calls for violence isn’t a line you are willing to draw in the sand? If Bannon was distributing child pornography should Facebook allow that too, or should Zuckerberg not appoint himself as an arbiter is that situation? This is an insane premise, so I’m not sure what to say to this. Even the current law doesn’t let you recklessly abuse free speech like this (e.g. fire in a movie theater). You do realize Fauci and his family doesn’t even feel safe anymore leaving their home without security detail? Why should someone like Bannon be afforded such great benefit of the doubt given Fauci’s situation. Someone like Bannon would and has cried about “cancel culture” but in this case he’s free to essentially force a man into hiding.')
