I am frustrated when I see this argument.<p><i>”Intellectual property is the oil of the 21 century. Look at the richest men a hundred years ago; they all made their money extracting natural resources or moving them around. All today&#x27;s richest men have made their money out of intellectual property.”</i><p>— Mark Getty<p>The root problem is that the Intellectual Monopoly system destroys the potential for democratic use and understanding of protocols - as well as everything else. Intellectual Monopoly means we are kept stupid because there are gatekeepers - usually people belonging to families with inherited wealth. The idea of the ‘Intellectual Property system’ is the newest means of production, whose function is to enclose and monopolize ideas, which should in fact belong to all children of the world. Especially when digital breaks the rules of economic theories, with it’s near-zero marginal cost of reproduction. So the modern Bougie both 1) parasitically extracts economic rents for something that has been made artificially scarce in the first place, as well as 2) unorganically stemming the rate of innovation - setting a limit on deeper cooperation and coherence&#x2F;alignment, and harmony. But this reality is obscured by the cultural myths of Magical Voluntarism, Meritocracy and more. We are gaslighting people by telling them they have ‘mental health issues”, when in fact the system has evolved to put a limit on their learning and growth, and which sucks them dry.<p>We need to get rid of closed corporate supply chains and move to Sensorica-type Open Value Networks that use the Resource Event Agent (REA) accounting system. There’s people working on implementing this using Holochain’s distributed data-integrity engine.<p>In using such a system (compared to an internal corporate network), we transparently measure the actual material scarcity of the wonderful resources our Mother Earth provides. And then we can both 1) democratically decide who gets to use which resources (and where, when, how and why, etc.), and 2) we don’t have to use the Intellectual Monopoly system to pretend that having a monopoly is what is needed for successful innovation.<p>What this leads to is a symphony of scalar gift economies.<p>We owe it to ourselves and our children.')
