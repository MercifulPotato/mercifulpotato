Then that stranger went and killed another person. Would you regret your decision?<p>No. Because I still would have made the best decision possible at the time given all available information. This is the same argument essentially as the death penalty question. Someone else&#x27;s violent act can never vindicate your own. That&#x27;s only valid in the case of immediate self defense. Although if you take this argument to it&#x27;s logical conclusion, which would be &quot;Kill a thousand dogs, or hang Hitler&quot;, I&#x27;d have to admit it becomes pretty indefensible. So the real moral choice probably lies somewhere in-between.<p>&gt;How do you choose to save a stranger&#x27;s life without knowing anything about them and what they&#x27;re like?<p>It&#x27;s faith in the fact that any single given human life has more intrinsic value than any number of any animals. I&#x27;m essentially putting myself in that situation. Would I be ok with dying to save a dog? No, never. And so I extend that to every other person. Obviously this only works with animals. Would I feel the same about a person I love instead? Absolutely not.')
