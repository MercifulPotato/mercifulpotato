Do you have at least one &quot;write&quot; state and one &quot;read&quot; state, so that the simulation can write during its update and the renderer can read the previous state independently? I think copying the write state to the read state would probably take some time in a Factorio &quot;gigafactory&quot;, while the renderer only has to access a tiny part of the state most of the time.')
