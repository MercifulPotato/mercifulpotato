I don&#x27;t care how big a cut apple takes off the appstore - it&#x27;s irrelevant what people &quot;think&quot; they should charge, because the cut is going to be determined by a market rate. But this market rate determination requires competition, and the lowest denominator competition is allowing installation from outside app store.')
