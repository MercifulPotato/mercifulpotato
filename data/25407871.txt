Usually, a moderate amount of abstraction works great. I&#x27;ve even done well with some really clever abstractions.<p>Abstraction can be seductive, because it can have a big payoff in <i>reducing</i> complexity. So it&#x27;s often hard to draw the line, particularly when working in a language with a type of abstraction I&#x27;ve not worked much with before.<p>Often the danger point comes when you understand how to use an abstraction competently, but you don&#x27;t yet have the experience needed to be an expert at it.')
