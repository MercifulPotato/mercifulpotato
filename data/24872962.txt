It used to be all white dudes or non-white dudes playing the white dude game. I think the diversity of people in visible traits has encouraged diversity in viewpoints and norms and whatever. It&#x27;s much easier to play your own game when it&#x27;s 1v1v1v1v1v1 instead of 4v1. Norms are softer. And that&#x27;s good.<p>There&#x27;s definitely some sort of anti-materialism cultural movement. I don&#x27;t know how to judge the instagram status game. It&#x27;s big, and growing, but it&#x27;s also totally optional. You don&#x27;t come off as a low status individual if you don&#x27;t even have an instagram account to the same degree as someone who walks in with a non-professional looking pair of shoes.<p>If nobody knows what my insta-status is (as a non user), and I don&#x27;t know what anyone else&#x27;s is... is it really a good measure of status or is it just kind its own thing? Aside from the top few percent of individuals who are basically professional social media players, I&#x27;m not sure insta-fame amounts to much more than being a guild master in a particularly popular MMORPG. Kind of cool but hardly universal.')
