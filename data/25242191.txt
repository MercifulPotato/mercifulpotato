Each address in the path would be encrypted such that only the immediately preceding router can read it.  That way, if an attacker intercepts a packet in transit, they can only determine the next hop address, not the final destination.<p>Yes, yes, this would add a massive amount of overhead and complexity, and it would probably take decades to get implemented.<p>But I&#x27;ve been wondering what the next step is after encrypted DNS.  Encrypted DNS prevents an attacker from knowing which domain name you&#x27;re connecting to, but they can still see the IP address, and if there&#x27;s only one site hosted at a given address, that&#x27;s all they need.  So to achieve privacy you need many unrelated sites to be hosted at the same IP, i.e. you need a big CDN.  But that risks overcentralization, and it means you have to trust the CDN.  What if there was a way to hide the IP address itself?')
