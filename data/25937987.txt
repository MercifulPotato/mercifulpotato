Ie, if you short at $20&#x2F;share, and want to limit to 100% losses (excluding premium), you could buy calls at $40. If the price skyrocketed past here, you have the calls.<p>There is obviously much more complex math to optimize this.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure that I believe the story that a large fund like this didn&#x27;t have some sort of protections in place (even if the WSB community couldn&#x27;t find them).<p>It&#x27;s also possible that they <i>did</i> have protection in place, but instead of using it to exit their position earlier chose to sell the protection for a quick gain (thinking that the price was going to drop again after the first jump).')
