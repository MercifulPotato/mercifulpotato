I&#x27;ve watched tens of hours of testimonies thus far, seen the evidence, reviewed the data myself, and there&#x27;s definitely something to all this.<p>The issue, is that the concerns are not being evaluated, both sides are not being interviewed, etc. We really need a trial. Unfortunately, that has not happened yet, in almost any of these &quot;hearings&quot;. The lawsuits are dismissed due to &quot;standing&quot; or procedural issues, not on the merits.')
