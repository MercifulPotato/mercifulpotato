The thing with C is the tool chain setup is 3&#x2F;4 the battle. It’s a huge LOE to go from nothing to a blinking led (the embedded hello world) with C. With micropython it’s 5 lines, drag&#x2F;drop a file, and reboot.<p>I appreciate C and I’ve learned a lot of things like peripheral clock multipliers and all the work that has to be done before you can even jump to main. However, I set out to make an altimeter heh.<p>Edit: oh and with C, writing your own device driver for every single thing is a pit of a pita too. There are open source drivers for some breakouts but they all seem to require serious hand fitting.')
