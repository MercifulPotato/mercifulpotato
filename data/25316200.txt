Education, treatment, and research needs to enable a nicotine reduction strategy were also addressed.<p>The Council on Scientific Affairs came to the following conclusions:<p>(a) gradually eliminating nicotine from cigarettes is technically feasible;<p>(b) a nicotine reduction strategy holds great promise in preventing adolescent tobacco addiction and assisting the millions of current cigarette smokers in their efforts to quit using tobacco products;<p>(c) potential problems such as compensatory over-smoking of denicotinised cigarettes and black market sales could be minimised by providing alternate forms of nicotine delivery with less or little risk to health, as part of expanded access to treatment; and<p>(d) such a strategy would need to be accompanied by relevant research and increased efforts to educate consumers and health professionals about tobacco and health.<p>[Edited for formatting]')
