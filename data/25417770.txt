Albert Einstein was an incredible physicist. I would trust none of them to handle economics.<p>You guys need to stop pretending that economics is 1. something really really hard that only the most brilliant economists can understand, 2. something fundamentally objective like the physics. It was in large part of history even referred to as political economy for crying out loud.<p>It is true that the study of economics is primarily concerned with the current system, not particulary imaginative with regards to any sort of alternative, and the incentives are in no way encouraging to challenge the current way of things, if anything the direct opposite. This state of affairs just can&#x27;t be ignored when evaluating the objective nature of a certain field of study.<p>&gt; including that it generates decent outcomes in many cases.<p>For the wealthy. Most of the world is still used as cheap labour for the privilege of the West.<p>&gt; Re: economics and crashes - I fail to see how the existence of crashes - which is predicted by many economic theories, be they mainstream or not - invalidates anything.<p>If a majority of the involved &quot;scientists&quot; are surprised that a crash shows up, it strongly suggests that it&#x27;s largely based on speculation and external motives rather than objective science.')
