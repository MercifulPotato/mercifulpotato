That&#x27;s a huge difference.<p>First, Apple wasn&#x27;t a supplier. If Silicon takes off, they could become a supplier.  Second, the reason they&#x27;re switching to Silicon is the same reason they switched from IBM to Intel - the chip suppliers didn&#x27;t react to the changing consumer landscape.<p>By making consumer devices, Apple is much more in tune with that landscape than IBM&#x2F;Intel is.  They can adapt chips much better and won&#x27;t be handcuffed by chip suppliers in the future.')
