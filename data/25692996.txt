This was &quot;next time&quot; so they followed through and banned it:<p>&gt; Future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account.[0]<p>I&#x27;m surprised more people aren&#x27;t bringing this up. Per them this only needed to violate &quot;Civic Integrity&quot; which per their explanation it looks like it does.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;twittersafety&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346970430062485505" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;twittersafety&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346970430062485505</a>')
