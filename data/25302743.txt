For example, we could look for demographic differences among professional lispers, hobbyist lispers, and curious onlookers. Or see if there are any industry trends.<p>It&#x27;s just that this Google doc reports these data in a way that&#x27;s too coarse-grained to support that kind of analysis, regardless of any bias concerns.')
