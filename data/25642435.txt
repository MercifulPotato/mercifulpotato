Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609824312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25642122, text='&gt; he refused to have that rock, paper, scissor match<p>What I thought was the funniest part (strangest) is that Moxie walked back to &quot;I&#x27;ll give you a suggestion of people and you don&#x27;t even have to have any of them on&quot; and Joe still treated it like Moxie could dictate who was going to be on the podcast. But what&#x27;s the difference between that and any other guest being like &quot;hey, you should check out ________!&quot; which happens all the time. It was literally a nothing bet. I do think Moxie forcing the week&#x27;s lineup is a bit much. A single person? Not that bad, but I could see it being used against Joe (though unlikely). But &quot;hey you should check these people out&quot; is nothing. Guests suggest guests all the time and so does his fanbase.<p>As far as Signal goes, they&#x27;ve almost completed every major feature I&#x27;ve wanted. Usernames look like they&#x27;re rolling out in a few months or less and group calling works (just needs to scale). Only issues I have are that sometimes there&#x27;s some latency (this seems to be more related to 1. specific peoples&#x27; phones&#x27; battery optimization settings and 2. when there are large upticks in user enrollment. So neither of these are that big of an issue for me) and I can&#x27;t use markdown (essentially a non-issue). Only things I want are fairly fluffy and features I would use fairly irregularly anyways. I don&#x27;t understand the distaste of UI and it hasn&#x27;t been properly explained to me yet. UI looks almost identical to WhatsApp except WA is far more busy in the background (which I actually dislike) ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
