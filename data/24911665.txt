Given how this mantra is applied today where &#x27;the other side&#x27; should not be heard from or platformed or is just plain evil, I&#x27;d rather hear both sides, even if that means I get to hear about creationism or climate change denial.<p>I don&#x27;t want the media or tech companies to be the arbiter on what is and isn&#x27;t reasonable to discuss. Having Jack Dorsey or some intern at some fact check org decide for me what is and isn&#x27;t reasonable is much worse than merely hearing from a creationist why creationism should be taught in science class.')
