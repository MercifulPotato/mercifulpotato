Apple&#x27;s cans are <i>Wireless</i> high quality headphones with Active Noise Cancellation, transparency mode, and seamless switching. The only thing they have in common with the ones you listed is &quot;Headphones&quot;.<p>This is all setting aside the fact that you are prejudging audio quality of a product nobody has reviewed.<p>I suspect there are a ton of people like me who are just fine with <i>good</i> sound and very interested in getting wireless noise cancelling headphones.')
