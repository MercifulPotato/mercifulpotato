Based on tracking info, the USPS had it on a truck within hours.  To Wichita.  It made it through the distribution center there and back on a truck within another few hours, where it showed up in Washington DC 6 days later.  And now I guess it&#x27;s heading to Baltimore.  Or at least I hope so.<p>My daughter sends books via media mail to a friend in suburban NYC.  For basically pocket change, they get there in 3 days or so.')
