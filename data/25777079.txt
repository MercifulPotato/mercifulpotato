I have this saying: all machine learning is just clever tricks and techniques until someone learns how to brute force the solution.<p>It&#x27;s the same adoption&#x2F;business technology tension that has existed since Frederick Taylor in the early 1900s or Vonnegut&#x27;s Player Piano concept where they propose taking a recorder to automated human-adverse tasks by recording their movements.  The hype is trying to replace people.  Real-world adoption seems to take place where machine learning complements human activity to do things humans are not good at, not replaces it.  It&#x27;s not making them dumber, it&#x27;s making them more enabled.<p>[reference]<p>In the early 1900’s Frederick Taylor called public attention to the problem of ‘national efficiency’ by proposing to eliminate ‘rule of thumb’ management techniques and replacing them with the principle of scientific management [157]. Scientific management reasons about the motions and activities of workers and states that wasted work can be eliminated through careful planning and optimization by managers. While Taylor was concerned about the inputs and outputs of manufacturing and material processes, computers and the information age brought about parallel concepts in the management and organization of information and its processes. Work efficiency could now be measured not by bricks or steel, but by their information flows.<p>F. W. Taylor, “Principles of Scientific Management”, Harper &amp; Row, New York,\nNY, 1911.')
