There is a clear definition of what it means to be impoverished.  In the US it&#x27;s income relative to dependents, [defined by HHS](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aspe.hhs.gov&#x2F;poverty-guidelines" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aspe.hhs.gov&#x2F;poverty-guidelines</a>).  TO say that someone isn&#x27;t impoverished because they are living rent-free (legally or illegally) or don&#x27;t have obligations to pay bills misses the point altogether; and quite frankly, is flat out insincere.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if the child moves back in with their parent and doesn&#x27;t have bills to pay.  I&#x27;m curious to know, what if the person that loses their job is 40 and moves in with their parents?  My point is, I don&#x27;t think it matters if it&#x27;s a child moving in to their parent&#x27;s second house -- they may never be able to recover from this, and that is the larger, systemic problem at hand.<p>How we, as a collective society, address issues pertaining to the poor, disenfranchised, forgotten, downtrodden, speaks volumes about our priorities and interests.   And I think, given the types of relief that has happened during this moment, and looking at how society answers this historically, we are not doing well.')
