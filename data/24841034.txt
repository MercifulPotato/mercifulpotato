What is the difference?<p>The leaders are mostly big tech, who have driven the step-change advances you describe. This, IMHO, was due to their pre-existing mastery of data. They already had a ton of well-organized data, because they were engineering cultures, and data was the lifeblood of their business (ads, search, shopping). Once ML&#x2F;AI came into the picture, it was full steam ahead.<p>Most others are (blind) followers, and cannot tease apart the engineering bit from the (data) science hype. They get fixated on the latter (data science and ML&#x2F;AI) and forget the engineering, or &quot;scale&quot; part.<p>The first question should not be about AI&#x2F;ML, but on the other hand, do you have solid (data) engineering where your data is easily accessible to any data scientist? By now it should be apparent that &quot;data is the new oil&quot; and will be useful even if you don&#x27;t plan to do deep learning.<p>If you don&#x27;t have solid (data) engineering and &quot;data at scale&quot; for anyone, anywhere, then your ML&#x2F;AI efforts are doomed.<p>Data first, only then ML&#x2F;AI.
