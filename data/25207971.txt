Item(by='bscphil', descendants=None, kids=[25208224], score=None, time=1606302197, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207800, text='&gt; Wild false equivalency.<p>My comparison is <i>intentionally</i> exaggerated. The post claims that it <i>doesn&#x27;t matter</i> what reason the doctor has for telling you a lie, that it&#x27;s just obviously wrong. I think this is ludicrous. If it&#x27;s sometimes permissible for a doctor to lie, then it might also be permissible for an economist to lie.<p>I don&#x27;t really follow the rest of what you&#x27;re claiming, perhaps because you&#x27;re responding to some point that I haven&#x27;t made. In particular you seem to have a bone to pick with economists, and this is very vague:<p>&gt; Markets react to actions determined not by the knowledge itself but by discrete reactions to the knowledge called thoughts.')
