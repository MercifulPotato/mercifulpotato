ZFS, on the other hand, diffs on a bits level so your penalty is just the changed portions of that paticular file.<p>2) Depending on your implementation, ZFS snapshots are immutable&#x2F;read-only ... so neither a misconfiguration nor ransomware&#x2F;mallory can destroy those backups if you lose your credentials.<p>Historically, people would create and maintain &quot;rsync snapshots&quot; inside their rsync.net accounts using &#x27;cp -al&#x27; and other unix commands run over SSH.[1]<p>After transitioning to ZFS, however, we encourage all customers to just do a &quot;dumb&quot; 1:1 rsync to us and let us maintain and rotate their preferred snapshot schedule (days&#x2F;weeks&#x2F;months&#x2F;quarters&#x2F;years).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rsync.net&#x2F;resources&#x2F;howto&#x2F;remote_commands.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rsync.net&#x2F;resources&#x2F;howto&#x2F;remote_commands.html</a>')
