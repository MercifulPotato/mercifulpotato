Item(by='4cao', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606968408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25283955, text='I&#x27;d classify 化 as a simple ideogram (part of group 2, called &quot;indicators&quot; in the article) because it conveys the abstract idea of &#x27;change&#x27; by showing one person upside down from the other. It isn&#x27;t a compound (&quot;combograph&quot;, group 3) to me because it doesn&#x27;t build upon the meaning of its individual components.<p>However, this is a fuzzy categorization. In the top-level comment I wrote, I listed 三 &#x27;three&#x27; as an example of an ideogram but it could be argued instead that it is a compound of three separate 一 &#x27;one&#x27; characters. Then there&#x27;s the character 廿 &#x27;twenty&#x27;, which consists of two 十 &#x27;ten&#x27; characters, that is probably better explained as a compound. So at a certain point it all becomes quite subjective.')
