I&#x27;d say one of the best things that &quot;deserves to be built&quot; is a user-friendly layer that generates Kubernetes configuration that can start simple (e.g. total boilerplate) and be configured by hand as you have deeper requirements. Additionally, build-steps (e.g. how do your containers get built) etc can&#x27;t be ignored. This all tallies up to me to about a day of engineering work to get a project setup with all the bells and whistles every time I want to start a new serious project on K8s. I definitely think Waypoint (or a similar product) could reduce this time to minutes, so long as I can customize more as the project evolves.')
