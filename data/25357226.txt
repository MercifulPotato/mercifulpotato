It can only do so through delegation which as we have seen with the deprecation of EV certificates (CAs no longer being trusted to establish the identity of legal persons) is not something that is easy to get right.<p>Public crypto can help carry the established trust. Say you track some developer&#x27;s work and the dev behaves consistently in a trustworthy manner, his signing key can be used to help carry this trust forward, so that after a while you don&#x27;t need to keep checking and just rely on the assumption that dev is probably honest going forward + crypto to verify you&#x27;re really using this developer&#x27;s output.<p>No need for delegation. Delegation doesn&#x27;t solve trust anyway, only identity verification.')
