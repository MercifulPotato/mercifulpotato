I outlined why this bug is something a lot of users could run into, and I even mention that I&#x27;m not necessarily holding it against them that it breaks, but specifically that they don&#x27;t even care to mention it breaking. After the first time, which was a big deal at the time, they should have put safeguards in place so that they could <i>notice</i> it happening. If the fault is with ABBYY, then I&#x27;m okay with Apple breaking it for the sake of internally improving Preview, and blame for the breakage lies with ABBYY. But I expect Apple to tell me â€“ because it happened before. That blame lies with Apple.<p>That is my reasoning, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s too high a bar for one of the richest companies on the planet, priding themselves in the details and &quot;it just works&quot;. You don&#x27;t have to agree with that, obviously. Calling me an ass for that is extremely rude and uncalled for, though. I was under the impression that this tone was actually not acceptable here.')
