In fact, I&#x27;d guess that more billionaires have made their fortunes in CA than any other place.<p>The grievance rhetoric has gone too far (and had awhile ago) when it&#x27;s used by billionaires.<p>There is also strong reactionary political rhetoric here, the premise that taxes on wealthy people are nearly criminal theft, and nobody would want to live someplace where they democratically invest in their community (i.e., pay taxes). There&#x27;s also the economic assumption that taxes, whatever their current level, are always too high; AFAIK, taxes on wealthy people are at historic lows.')
