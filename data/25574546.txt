Item(by='jessaustin', descendants=None, kids=[25575085], score=None, time=1609273960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574391, text='<i>Mcdonalds has chicken burgers.</i><p>The cheapest chicken sandwich at McDonald&#x27;s is slathered with mayonnaise. Of course one can specify that the mayonnaise be omitted, but then one is confronted with the fact that the factory-made chicken patty is fairly unpalatable by itself.<p>The main question about Subway is which is more disgusting: the food or the way they treat (especially immigrant) franchisees? I can&#x27;t think of a single item at Subway that qualifies as &quot;cheap&quot; either.<p>Non-millionaires who seek tasty and healthy food must learn to cook.')
