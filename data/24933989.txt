It&#x27;s happening for the same reason any bubble happens, artificially cheap credit financing a speculative boom.<p>Through government financed student loans, we make money available for any sort of educational pursuit; and unlike a loan for, say, opening a new restaurant, no business plan or market research is needed to convince a banker that the venture is a sound one.<p>So, the reason this is happening in a &quot;supposedly rational, maximally efficient — or close offer — market economy&quot; is contained in the first word of the description: <i>supposedly.</i><p>In truth, government loans <i>distort</i> and <i>destroy</i> a market economy. Cheap credit undermines rational planning.')
