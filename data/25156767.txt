E.g. the R-value of the stuff inside walls, which wouldn&#x27;t cover windows or gaps or lots of other things, or do they somehow measure the R-value of the house as a whole?<p>Every house and rental I&#x27;ve encountered so far has given me the monthly heating&#x2F;cooling cost up-front, which has so far been fairly accurate, assuming you hold at an area-normal temperature indoors.  And they&#x27;ve all been able to tell me the R-value of the insulation in the walls and roof or attic.  If ever it&#x27;s more than like $100 for a single-family home, you pretty much know the insulation is bad or terrible.')
