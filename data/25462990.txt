Plenty of games do miracles more on the same hardware. I don&#x27;t think the PS4 being old was the issue, I think it&#x27;s the mismanagement you touched on.<p>Even on the best PC you can get right now the game is just &quot;alright with a few bugs&quot; IMO. There is nothing about target platforms they could have done to crown themselves &quot;best video games company in the world&quot; with this game.')
