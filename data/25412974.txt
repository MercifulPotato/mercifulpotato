I have emails both categorized and tagged and still can&#x27;t find anything between the thousands of work emails I get a week from coworkers, mailing lists, and automated systems. Any search brings up dozens to thousands of results.<p>&gt; but for documents on my drive tags don&#x27;t seem like a great approach because at least on my machine even though tagging is an option, it&#x27;s not robust and reliable.<p>Not to mention that most users aren&#x27;t interested in tagging every file they have. I never tag files. My emails can get auto-tagged by mail rules, but I don&#x27;t have time to add tags to all of my files.')
