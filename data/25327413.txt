Here the situation is that all the linked-list nodes look the same and can be&#x2F;should be treated the same. The reason the first bit of code has to treat &quot;head&quot; differently is that head is the only node that the rest of the program keeps a pointer to. But that should be incidental, by doing the operation indirectly, you do things uniformly, <i>you should do things uniformly, since the linked list has a uniform structure</i>.<p>Here, it&#x27;s not much about combining cases overly cleverly, not leveraging &quot;while (x=y){...}&quot;-type stuff but removing what is an unnecessary kludge; that you have to treat head differently &#x27;cause it&#x27;s the value you happen to have and you need to update it while preserving it.')
