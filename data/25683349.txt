We used to partition our disks and assign space budgets to specific partition&#x2F;mounted directories.<p>It was to me a PITA, and juggling with partitions, redimensionning them because circumstances changed, moving files from one partition to another because it was getting saturated etc. were horrible.<p>Instead of having a tool handling that horror, thinking of disk space as a continuous resource and checking from time to time where that space go and if it needs cleaning is more manageable IMO.<p>I have the same mental model for money, and outside of very specific cases (mortgage accounts, kids account, professional expenses etc.) I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it partitioning at the account levels just for the sake of it.')
