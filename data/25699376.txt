We are fortunate that search is encouraging many people to adopt some SW protocol (via json-ld or similar).<p>We are also fortunate that we can do real inference, entity detection &amp; disambiguation these days. Perhaps one day we will have intelligent tools that all web publishers will have at their fingertips allowing them to press a button to confirm detected entities and relationships they present in their webpages (kind of like photos apps these days allow you to confirm known peoples faces). There will likely be an incentive for making their content easier to find. That would be awesome.<p>However, I do take his point that world views differ for a good reason. I hope we won&#x27;t be constrained by some limited ontology that these tools might present.')
