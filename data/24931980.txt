You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, really, but you&#x27;re clearly exploring vast areas of thought at the same time.<p>Remember, integers are integers are integers, because they represent the intrinsic &quot;whole quantity&quot; of something; this is as concrete as logic will get, the idea that there are &quot;ones&quot;, it&#x27;s pretty hard to imagine a universe that doesn&#x27;t have that.<p>Once you have integers, then you&#x27;re going to do math in an integer base; and making too high of a base has a diminishing value at at certain point, so it&#x27;s unlikely we&#x27;d see higher than maybe 60. Non-integer bases exist - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Non-integer_base_of_numeration" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Non-integer_base_of_numeration</a> - but it&#x27;s clear to me that I&#x27;m too stupid to use them, and so probably most other people are too. This tells me that it&#x27;s going to be a comparatively rare Many World that chooses to do this.<p>Choosing a number like 12 or 60 with a lot of divisors would have been nice. 1&#x2F;3 in base 12 is &quot;0.4&quot;, which is a lot nicer than 0.333... and would probably help make a lot of younger math education way easier.<p>Combining that with skipping &quot;degrees&quot; entirely and using radians from the start would probably have been wise choices. We&#x27;d have been much better equipped to divide things! I imagine a six-fingered being would have had an immediate advantage in that regard, but, alas.<p>Now, would some of those number constants look particularly different? Not really. Pi in base 12 is &quot;3.184809493B91866&quot;, for instance, so it doesn&#x27;t look like that would be much easier. E and other numbers similarly just end up with different expansions.<p>Remember, you can use whatever number base you want to, in this universe. The key is that it&#x27;s just a way your brain interprets the symbols to represent a quantity; don&#x27;t confuse the map for the territory. Five, the quality of having five whole entities, exists the same when it&#x27;s 101 in binary or 10 in base 5 or 11 in base 4; either way it&#x27;s all still just five, and so the right thing to do is to use the base system that most intuitively works for you so that it becomes transparent.')
