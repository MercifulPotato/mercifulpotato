This is no different from how the French revolution participants overthrew the government, just to form their own toxic regime that was worse than before.<p>&gt; Yarvin actually does not believe that. His whole project is more about not resisting the inevitable, which is that humans will organize in hierarchies no matter what. So itâ€™s better to not pretend otherwise and just be honest.<p>This is exactly what bothers me the most. You say &quot;just be honest&quot;, but are they? Like I mentioned, all they&#x27;re trying to do is break down the existing hierarchy and create a new one, while being the aristocrats of the new order. If they were truly honest to themselves, they wouldn&#x27;t sell the idea of sovereignty, because for the most people it would be no different. They would be ruled by these urbit real estate owners. In fact it&#x27;s worse than Facebook because at least Facebook can be regulated by the government (as it&#x27;s about to be done soon) if it abuses its power too much, whereas the whole premise of something like Urbit is that even the government cannot mess with the Urbit land owners. Talking about honesty and neglecting to address these issues is the ultimate dishonestly and hypocrisy. At the end of the day, what they and the urbit real estate owners want is for Urbit to go to moon and they make tons of easy money.')
