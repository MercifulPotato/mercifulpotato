I mean, chords are hard and kind of frustrating, but I think that&#x27;s true for everyone. Piano and fretted guitars have the bonus that you can&#x27;t be off pitch, as long as you hit the right one. Moving a pencil on a page is a lot different, you have to push down enough, but not too much, while making shapes in the right sequence, and you have to fit in the lines, etc, etc. UGH. Hitting the keys with the right strength is important for piano, but at a beginner level, just doing it not too hard is enough.')
