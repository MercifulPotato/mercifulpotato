Trump&#x27;s legitimate election in 2016 - see all the hysterical reactions like &quot;Not my president&quot; protests or urging faithless elector to vote for anyone else but trump route or &quot;Russia-gate&quot; (left&#x27;s Benghazi?) or the impeachment farce.

And then you see left&#x27;s contradictory messaging (&quot;illegal immigration has slowed down to a trickle&quot;) to thousands of children showing up on our borders.
