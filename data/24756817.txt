Item(by='peruvian', descendants=None, kids=[24756888], score=None, time=1602523289, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756617, text='&quot;Maker Days&quot; sound like a great idea but they don&#x27;t fit every company. At my place the eng department is far from the biggest team and we do a lot of cross-team work. No way the rest of the company (who do most of their work via meetings... somehow) would agree to have a day with no meetings at all.')
