I know crypto is hated on here but just as an anecdote, I&#x27;ve traded on a lot of exchanges in the last few years and I almost wince whenever I make a really great trade that 5 or 10x&#x27;s because as sure as the day is long inside of an hour my account will get frozen and I&#x27;ll have to submit documentation, answer a bunch of questions, or whatever else to get my account unfrozen and access to the funds. It&#x27;s almost like they&#x27;re saying thanks for your business and we don&#x27;t mind you getting lucky but don&#x27;t get <i>too</i> lucky.')
