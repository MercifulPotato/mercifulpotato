When many users are working with the files at the same time, there&#x27;s a lot of messaging going on in the backbone. If people are working in shared folders, that traffic goes visibly up.<p>Messaging between systems is hard. When things are async, it&#x27;s harder. When there&#x27;s async concurrency, it becomes spicy.<p>I&#x27;m managing a Nextcloud instance at the office. Even with this relatively mature state, it can bork itself pretty decently. Also, it has separation of responsibilities and a system admin is not an admin the traditional sense so, a lot of things are hidden between logs and other layers.<p>Complicating this further by adding microservices is a <i>brave</i> idea at least. We&#x27;re going to see what&#x27;s going to happen.<p>I hope they succeed but it&#x27;s not a piece of cake.')
