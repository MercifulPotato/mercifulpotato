What really happens is that they&#x27;d rather tear down a building after 100 years and build a completely different thing. Even skyscrapers generally get torn down in less than that.<p>There is some infrastructure (bridges, sewer systems, dams) that are supposed to last longer than that. Bridges are often torn down and replaced, and it&#x27;s probably more expensive than spending twice as much and having it last five times as long (again, spitballed numbers), but that&#x27;s what fits in budgets. They don&#x27;t want to discover that traffic patterns have changed and they need a different bridge, or no bridge at all and have to take it down.<p>That&#x27;s becoming a real problem for sewer systems, which in a lot of places are reaching expected lifespan, and it&#x27;s going to be ludicrously expensive to replace.<p>Incidentally, there are also reports that the Brutalist buildings are so overbuilt that they&#x27;re hard to get rid of, even when they&#x27;re bad (such as having insufficient ventilation). Gigantic piles of concrete will be there in 2,000 years, whether we want them or not.')
