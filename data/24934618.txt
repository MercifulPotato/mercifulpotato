The idea is that, because F(n+1) depends linearly on F(n) and F(n-1) (see the above definition), then we can write the previous system with the following (linear-algebraic) notation<p><pre><code>  [ F(n)   ] = [ 0 1 ] [ F(n-1) ]\n  [ F(n+1) ] = [ 1 1 ] [ F(n)   ].\n</code></pre>\nIf we write x(n+1) as the vector (F(n), F(n+1)), <i>i.e.</i>, first entry is F(n) and the second entry is F(n+1), and the matrix as A, then x(n+1) = Ax(n). (Note that A is the matrix whose entries are exactly the coefficients of the linear equation we gave above!)<p>In other words, we&#x27;ve reduced the problem down to the question of investigating the properties of the matrix A ! Now, the sum we were looking at, originally, can be written (in terms of x(n)) as the first entry of (note that x is a vector as we&#x27;ve defined it!)<p><pre><code>  x(2) + .1x(3) + .01x(4) + ... = x(2) + .1Ax(2) + .01 A Ax(3) + ... = x(2) + (.1A)x(2) + (.1A)^2 x(3) + ...\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s a slick proof (see [0]) that, if this sequence converges, then its result is given by the first entry of<p><pre><code>  (I - .1A)^(-1)x(2),\n</code></pre>\nwhich is exactly what the result gives. (I have changed the normalization a little bit for convenience, but it is the same proof :)<p>-----<p>[0] If<p><pre><code>  y + By + B^2y + ... = z converges, then we can multiply both sides by B to get\n\n  By + B^2y + ... = Bz\n</code></pre>\nBut, here&#x27;s the magic! Let&#x27;s subtract the first equation from the second to get<p><pre><code>  y = z - Bz = (I - B)z,\n</code></pre>\nso, multiplying by the inverse of B on both sides, we get:<p><pre><code>  y + By + B^2y + ... = z = (I - B)^(-1)y,\n</code></pre>\nas required!')
