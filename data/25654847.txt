Item(by='_ouml_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609910048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650224, text='Two months ago I bought a starter kit with some electronics: breadboards, LEDs, cables, transistors, resistors, etc...<p>My 8&#x2F;9yo daughter really got hooked, and since then I&#x27;ve bought all kinds of logic gates, switches, timers, flipflops etc...<p>I use the videos from Ben Eater as inspiration but I haven&#x27;t told my daughter that you can build a programmable CPU using this stuff. I don&#x27;t want to spoil the surprise.<p>After learning binary numbers, I asked her if she could build a circuit to add two digits. She designed her own version of a full adder, chained 4 of them together, and now has her own 4-bit calculator.<p>The cool thing is that she will explain it in detail to anybody who wants to listen. But she is also quickly discovering that modt people don&#x27;t know binary...<p>What I like most about this is that she is now hacking independently, and having here own ideas. At some point I might teach her some formulas, but she hasn&#x27;t shown interest there. And the occasional LED burning up isn&#x27;t going to make me bankrupt (-;<p>Tl;dr: breadboard electronics is cool, worked with my 9yo daughter')
