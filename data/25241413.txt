So I&#x27;m more ok with people taking drugs. But not fully ok, the issue&#x27;s too complex.<p>&gt; Besides this is about heroin.<p>It&#x27;s not. The damage done was most likely from a contaminant (see my note about MPTP) so not heroin. And if it was heroin it&#x27;s still not about heroin because I said, exactly in the post you replied to, &quot;Edit: none of this is about drugs or guns. It&#x27;s about common sense and thinking for yourself.&quot; What I <i>feel</i> like I&#x27;m getting is kneejerk unthinking reactions from anti-drugs people. I may be wrong.')
