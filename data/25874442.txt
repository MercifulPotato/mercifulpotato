I dunno.<p>For the last few months, below Youtube&#x27;s regular recommendations there&#x27;s been a selection of the <i>most scary</i> Covid headlines their algorithms could find. &quot;super deadly strain found ...&quot; &quot;vaccine side effects...&quot; &quot;scientists warn vaccine may not be effective...&quot;. I guess the recommendation engine discovered that fearmongering gets people to click, but it&#x27;s hard to take it seriously. Since it clearly only selects for the most alarming news, I assume that it lands far on the alarmist end of reality and therefore I should discount whatever it says.')
