Most safe rust wrapper libraries are built in two layers: 1. Map the api&#x27;s raw interface into raw rust types, usually with a simplistic code generator; this enables the bindings to closely track upstream api changes. 2. Use that raw interface to build a wrapper library that translates the api to use rustlike idioms and expose safe constructs.<p>This seems to be #1 only for now, which is fair because winapi is enormous. Also there may be many ways to expose a safe rust interface all with different tradeoffs, by leaving #2 open they don&#x27;t lock in a single strategy prematurely. That said I am looking forward to a safe wrapper as well.')
