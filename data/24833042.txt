To pass this test, you should be able to argue so persuasively and passionately for the other side that your text alone would pass for an argument proposed by someone who opposes your position.<p>The essay could have focused on just this one technique. The worst arguments I&#x27;ve witnessed and been part of lacked any attempt by either side to Steelman the opposing side&#x27;s position.<p>To take it to the next level, try actively arguing for the side you think has the weaker points. It can be a lot of fun, not to mention educational.')
