Item(by='flohofwoe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607264083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25323388, text='IMHO #include for making declarations visible to other compilation units is the one big feature where ditching the preprocessors makes sense, at least in C++ where headers contain both declarations and implementation code (it&#x27;s not as critical for C). Simply being able to include a file anywhere in the source is still useful (simply as a generic text-processing feature) so #include shouldn&#x27;t be removed if sharing declarations if solved differently (for instance through a module system).<p>Same with #define, no harm in adding actual constants to the language since it&#x27;s a simple, straightforward and expected feature. But that&#x27;s no reason getting rid of #define because that&#x27;s also useful as a catch-all text replacement which doesn&#x27;t work on the language-level (and that&#x27;s useful in many situations).')
