I find that for most things, I have a visual intuitive model to reason about things. But I have a hard time visualizing RF light. There aren’t any good videos out there of just a straight forward visualization of RF light. It’s all abstractions with a sine wave, but no visceral visualizations, rendered or otherwise. The closest thing I’ve found is thought emporium visualizing wifi.<p>And also, why can visible light pass through other visible light without causing interference? Why can’t they make visible light with an antenna? Why are large arrays of RF receivers not more widely used for small-scale RF imaging?')
