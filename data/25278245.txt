The problem is that the maliciousness that can exist with js can sometimes outweigh it&#x27;s usefulness.<p>Looking at HN, which uses js for voting, can be replaced with the olde-school form submission method (at increased page reloads etc), so clearly JS is doing us a favor.<p>But many sites we visit are consume only (blogs and news) and the rest are generally what we interact with only very infrequently (HN, fb, twitter). It&#x27;s a rare site that actively needs js (excluding all those react&#x2F;vue  architected sites) that doesn&#x27;t need human interaction on the first place (eg slack and chat sites that need streaming&#x2F;comet server responses)<p>Random thought: Maybe we could investigate a methodology of &quot;jit&quot; for js in response to human interaction. Browsers already do this to limit access to the clipboard functionality. That is, js will run only if the user clicks on a button, etc, but is otherwise dormant (even document.onload would be delayed until first click). Anything else would require permission to run. Of course, this would break the web as it exists now.')
