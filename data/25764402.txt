Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=[25766188], score=None, time=1610555991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25762953, text='&gt; I think as consumers we&#x27;re starting to get totally unrealistic expectations about what kinds of services small companies (ie. not behemouths like Google, Microsoft, Apple) should be able to provide to everyone for free.<p>The number of consumer services the average consumer actually pays for is very small.<p>Video services like Hulu and Netflix are the primary exception, but they benefitted greatly from being compared to $100+ cable TV packages. It&#x27;s easy to get people to transition from an expensive thing to a cheaper option.<p>It&#x27;s much more difficult to get people to switch from a free service to a paid service. YouTube is a good example of a platform that provides huge value and endless hours of video content to people, but selling people on the paid version of YouTube is a difficult battle. The outrage over the mere existence of YouTube premium on casual social sites like Reddit should be downright scary for anyone considering a Freemium service.<p>Dropbox gambled that the average consumer would outgrow their 10GB free account as they took more photos and videos with cell phones. That gamble was correct, but of course other providers swooped in to offer better targeted plans. I&#x27;ll take $3&#x2F;month iCloud with transparent integration over $10&#x2F;month Dropbox with a separate app.<p>Dropbox business angle is promising, but again it&#x27;s much easier for companies like Google and Microsoft to add storage plans to their existing office suites than it is for Dropbox to add office suites to their existing storage plans.<p>As a techie, I wish Dropbox had stayed as a small $3&#x2F;month for 100GB offering that did file sharing very well and nothing else. The latest apps get in the way more than they help, and I cancelled my paid plan because the core set of files I want to keep Dropbox-accessible is under 10GB. Bigger files go to other free services on an as-needed basis.')
