They announced layoffs shortly after I quit and Glassdoor was inundated with a flood of long, detailed reviews expressing concern and unhappiness around all the issues that had caused me to leave voluntarily. The company&#x27;s star rating dropped from 3.5ish to 3 and was trending down.<p>Then, mysteriously, within the space of a week, almost all of the negative reviews vanished from Glassdoor, and a lot of bland 4 star &quot;well there&#x27;s good and bad, some mistakes were made, but despite the past few months, overall it&#x27;s good&quot; appeared, pushing the handful of negative reviews that remained off the front page. I know from former colleagues that management had &quot;suggested&quot; staff write these sorts of reviews.<p>Now the company rating is higher than it was before the layoffs and I am completely disillusioned with not only that company, and Glassdoor, but the fakeness of the industry as a whole. It&#x27;s so disappointing that a site that originally felt like a useful resource for workers has become just yet another PR&#x2F;branding tool.')
