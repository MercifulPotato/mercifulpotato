I tried multiple times to get together a Google Music Family Plan, because I&#x27;d bought music and uploaded music and the radio feature was <i>so good.</i><p>They refused to allow me to pay them more, and refused to allow me to transfer my purchases to another account I verifiably own so I could then pay them more.<p>I <i>know</i> legacy GAFYD accounts don&#x27;t matter to Google, and I don&#x27;t expect them to, but it&#x27;d be nice to be able to transfer my stuff out. I know we like to point out who Google&#x27;s real customers are, but after a decade-and-a-half I&#x27;ve actually paid them real money for things, and shockingly would like to continue doing so.')
