I just like having so much <i>control</i> of having hardware at home, and I&#x27;ve got static IPs. But it costs to power and cool them, and they aren&#x27;t elastic like cloud&#x2F;IaaS. Having started the move to VPSs and finding them <i>very</i> good for the price, I&#x27;m now trying to wrap my head around &quot;cattle, not pets&quot;, but still with a micropreneur mindset. I think it&#x27;s still worth it, and my home office is getting quieter with every server I relocate to somebody else&#x27;s hardware.')
