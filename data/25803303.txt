Mixing concerns seemed like a terrible idea that would lead to ruin. And then I tried it, and realized it’s wonderful actually - that most of the time, when I changed some HTML, I had to update the corresponding JS anyway, and usually in a separate file (which at the time was jQuery or Angular 1). React put those things in one place, and writing components felt like writing functions.<p>The worst PHP code I’ve seen is the kind that mixed <i>database queries</i> with presentation, and that was just bonkers. Just a really truly awful mess.<p>For me, that was the “PHP” I envisioned and what I didn’t want to rehash with React, and I can confidently say that has worked out pretty well.')
