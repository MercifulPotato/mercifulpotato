Refreshing your skills here and making sure you&#x27;re comfortable with everything on this list will help you be confident that you can pretty much do the kinds of work available to you as a senior engineer. And if you are lacking in any of these, it almost certainly will show up when you&#x27;re trying to function in the role. I run into this every day with entry level engineers - they have to rely heavily on others and also have to spend a lot of time ramping up on exactly these kinds of things.<p>Put another way: if you did get hired for this role and managed to keep it, you&#x27;ll be a master at this stuff within a couple of years. This is because these skills are generally useful no matter what specifically you are doing.')
