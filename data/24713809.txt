Switching gives a clear advantage.<p>The rest of this post is an anecdote from the same class that this brought to mind, and is unrelated to the topic.  Maybe we can say it shows how good teachers engage their students or something, but really it’s just a good yarn.<p>We were learning about inelastic vs elastic collisions, and how an elastic collision has 2x the energy of an inelastic one.  The teacher asked for a volunteer, and a bright-eyed student rose to the occasion.  The teacher gave him some safety glasses and told him to lie down on the floor.<p>The teacher took the inelastic ball and said, “Okay, I’m gonna drop this on your forehead now, ready?”  PLONK.  “Ow.”<p>“Remember that feeling!  This is the elastic one, and it has the same mass, so it should hurt twice as much.”  PLONK.  “Ow.”<p>The teacher asked, “So, did the second one hurt more than the first?”  The rest of us anticipated the experimental confirmation of what we’d just learned about.<p>“...I couldn’t really tell the difference,” said the student.<p>“Yeah,” said the teacher, “I knew you wouldn’t.  I just wanted to see if you’d let me do it.”')
