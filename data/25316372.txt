Especially &quot;scripting&quot;.<p>&gt; So I doubt they boot up and run C in about 2 minutes.<p>It took me about 10 minutes into my intro to programming class in high school, starting from zero programming knowledge, to run hello world.<p>&gt; And if they manage after a while, they still don&#x27;t understand printf, as it already uses pointers. They don&#x27;t understand types. Etc.<p>You&#x27;re moving the goalposts. Why would they know all things? Those are language features and they don&#x27;t know the language. A C programmer doesn&#x27;t know the prototype chain.<p>&gt; because people coming to js and insist to write js code in C style or in java style<p>News flash. Everyone writes code in the idioms they already know, until they learn the language better.<p>What you&#x27;re saying boils down to &quot;JS programmers are some special class of people that are incapable of learning&quot;. Which is elitist nonsense.')
