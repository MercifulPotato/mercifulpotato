There&#x27;s clearly a market for, say, JRPGs, and that market is comprised of people who fully disagree with you.  Ultimately what you&#x27;re saying is &quot;there&#x27;s no need to make games I don&#x27;t like&quot;.<p>Personally, for what it&#x27;s worth, I love games where you neither generate nor are told stories, but rather where you <i>uncover</i> them.  Outer Wilds is the best recent example I know of-- the entire game is essentially a detective mystery&#x2F;archaeology expedition where you have to piece the story of the game together.  Similar DNA lives in games like Dark Souls and Myst, where the game lore is predetermined but not necessarily shoved in your face.')
