In uni I had this idea for a program that would triangulate where lightning struck by having multiple computers across campus listening for thunder, then measuring the difference in arrival times of the thunder. Like GPS in reverse.<p>Soon I realized I’d need the computers’ clocks to be as in-sync as possible, which in turn requires one-way latency calculations. I spent an hour diagramming with pencil and paper until I convinced myself it was mathematically impossible or I wasn’t clever enough to find the solution.<p>Looking back, I was more worried than I should’ve been about this (wired latencies are usually far less than 5ms, which for sound is ~1.5m) and less worried than I should’ve been about the fact that thunder isn’t anything close to a point source of sound.')
