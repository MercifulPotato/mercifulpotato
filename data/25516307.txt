Amazon is earning insane profits with FBA, at scale it is totally possible to not juts meet FBA prices but even getting close to Amazon&#x27;s internal FBA costs. That would give you quite a nice margin benefit. It would be harder to ramp operations down so Using FBA, you just stop sending to Amazon. That is not counting the overhead needed to manage your &quot;own&quot; logistics.')
