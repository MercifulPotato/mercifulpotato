The United States is a federation of separate legal jurisdictions (states). The House of Representatives has seats aligned with “one person, one vote” and the Senate is aligned with  “one state, one vote” in an attempt to balance these interests.<p>The obvious consequence is that federal legislation will only move forward when most states <i>and</i> most people are in agreement — which I think is the intended outcome. This is often framed as “rural voters have more influence” but this is over-simplified: you need agreement from <i>both</i> houses to legislate. Rural voters can’t push their agenda any more than urban voters, but less populous states effectively get a little extra <i>veto</i> authority.<p>Besides, states are quite free to exercise their authority and many have large, active governments. Californians may be happy with their state government, but I’m not sure many smaller states would agree that their large population entitles them to impose their will on other states.<p>The fact that this manifests in the electoral college is weird, but that’s a separate issue from the core argument.')
