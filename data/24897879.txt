As the original founder and CEO, I&#x27;ve been waiting for this day for a loooong time! \nI finally love my own app and use it on a daily basis (hopefully you will too).<p>We&#x27;ve already launched a long time ago but today we&#x27;re launching a new feature: Note taking, straight from your inbox.<p>We email you before every meeting with all the notes you&#x27;ve taken about the person you&#x27;re going to meet and you simply have to reply to the email to log a note! Making it the easiest way to build your database of notes about your contacts.<p>I know that there are tons of people who tried to build a personal CRM and that everyone has his opinion on how the &quot;right&quot; personal crm should work.<p>Personally, we&#x27;ve decided that:\n- it should be fully automated (sync with calendar and email)\n- super simple to use (no complex and clunky interface)\n- it should be magic (our app tells you who you&#x27;re losing touch with based on your data)<p>And you? What are you looking for in a personal crm?')
