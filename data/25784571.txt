We&#x27;d also hella hear about it because it would mean Tulsa would&#x27;ve been forcibly removed as a city!<p>This isn&#x27;t a speculation of malice, but I will say narratives like that were precisely the false and sometimes racist presumptions that had to be fought in that case! Oklahoma was claiming as soon as the land is declared Indian country, the tribes would let all the rapists and murderers out of the state prisons.')
