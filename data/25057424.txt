The other telemetry settings are just about what telemetry modules are enabled to collect telemetry data <i>locally</i> (which you still can view with about:telemetry, but will not get send when you disabled &quot;uploadEnabled&quot;). [1]<p>Disable &quot;datareporting.healthreport.uploadEnabled&quot; and Firefox will not send telemetry data around. But users cannot be expected to mess around in about:config, right? That why there is a checkbox in the Firefox preferences just for this. In the Privacy &amp; Security tab.<p>Also, when you create a fresh Firefox profile (e.g. when you use it for the first time), it will open their privacy policy page, with a somewhat hidden button that brings you straight to those checkboxes. I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s a bit hidden now by default, and they could do better there (and actually did better in the past, where there was a very visible popup asking you about this stuff).<p>As for &quot;they should test this!&quot;: Right, and they do have unit tests[2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org&#x2F;toolkit&#x2F;components&#x2F;telemetry&#x2F;internals&#x2F;preferences.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org&#x2F;toolkit&#x2F;components&#x2F;t...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchfox.org&#x2F;mozilla-central&#x2F;source&#x2F;toolkit&#x2F;components&#x2F;telemetry&#x2F;tests&#x2F;unit&#x2F;test_TelemetryReportingPolicy.js#146" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchfox.org&#x2F;mozilla-central&#x2F;source&#x2F;toolkit&#x2F;compone...</a>')
