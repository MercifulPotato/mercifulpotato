As in, if you say it &quot;yeeros&quot; some servers won&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, by &quot;jy-ros&quot; would be understood by all (but some will think you&#x27;re saying it wrong).<p>I think it&#x27;s a case where language is to communicate and you can&#x27;t be the &quot;correct&quot; person by verbalizing in a way others don&#x27;t understand.')
