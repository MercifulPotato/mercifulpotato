How can they if the law <i>clearly</i> states they cannot be prosecuted? If the law states that you cannot be fairly tried in that location, then to put them on trial would be a violation of rule of law. The people explicitly spoke through their representatives. If it was not specific or too specific, then the law needs to be changed by the legislature. This &#x27;interpreting&#x27; the law to the detriment of the defendant is generally bullshit. If you use the basis of reasonable doubt and innocent until proven guilty, then it should result in defendant being dismissed. You can&#x27;t expect people to telepathically know the law means something contrary to what it <i>literally</i> says.')
