One of my best travel hacks was to buy a &quot;key ring&quot; pocket sharpener. I found myself staying in Airbnbs (back when that was a thing) with terrible knives. It&#x27;s a pain to travel with your own knife through airport security though. But you can bring a sharpener and it makes a huge difference even with a poor quality knife.')
