Not all costs are technological, and similarly not all customer costs are direct. While aggregators exist, you can&#x27;t understand the market-distorting effects of monopoly without appreciating the entire picture of capital flows within the system from surrounding businesses to the monopolist.<p>The second order effects are at the heart of antitrust action. Monopolists distort markets in ways that force everyone to pay extra <i>even if they do not pay the monopolist directly.</i><p>For a trivial example, consider that dealing with SEO is a huge and expensive problem for any startup. If you don&#x27;t appear in listings - preferably by buying ad spend - you may as well not exist.<p>Someone has to pay for that, and those costs will be passed on to customers in most Internet transactions. How much they pay is strongly influenced by Google&#x27;s choices.<p>If search wasn&#x27;t a monopoly those costs would be lower because there would be competition.<p>This is far from the only example of a market-distorting effect that generates extra costs for businesses and customers because of an online monopoly.')
