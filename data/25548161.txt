Those saying running a dumb TV with a dongle is just as privacy invading are wrong. Some smart TV&#x27;s use content recognition to send back everything you watch to the manufacturer. Viewing times, gaming, music, air TV. They can see everything your screen can and it&#x27;s terrifying.<p>With dongles, they can only see what the dongle can. Not my gaming sessions or watching local games over the air.<p>Beware, some smart TV&#x27;s will also try to get an internet connection over HDMI.')
