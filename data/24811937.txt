The physics simply doesn&#x27;t agree that this was even remotely possible at the time.<p>Another commenter correctly pointed out that these claims would violate the diffraction limit by more than an order of magnitude, and that&#x27;s assuming zero atmospheric interference, which is absolutely not the case.<p>Why do you think film is relevant here? These satellites are not noise-limited like your phone vs. an SLR, they&#x27;re diffraction limited. This is an optical resolution limit that has nothing to do with the photon capture medium or the size of the photographic plate. The only way to do better is to increase the effective area (of the <i>mirror</i>, not the plate) or to decrease the effective wavelength.<p>They were not doing interferometry with these satellites, and certainly not the multi-axis interferometry you&#x27;d need to be able to resolve centimeter-thick lines in text.')
