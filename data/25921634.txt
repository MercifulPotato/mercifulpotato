Internet routing is also non-trivial (convergence has not been reached in years), and when a major link goes down it can take time for routes to stabilize.  Also keep in mind that the Internet itself was not down for most people who were affected by this; rather, connectivity between users and various services was affected.  So people could have continued torrenting, but their Zoom sessions would get dropped because connectivity to some data center was impacted.')
