Item(by='TrianguloY', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609013016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25542487, text='I would say &#x27;studying maths teachs you how to abstract problems&#x27; or &#x27;computer science usually cares for the results, not the method&#x27; but that has been said a lot in other comments (and it&#x27;s not exactly right).<p>Instead I will point an interesting fact I&#x27;ve noticed myself among my computer science classmates (from my second degree, I first did mathematics).<p>When you stumble around &#x27;maths&#x27; (which in classes it&#x27;s pretty common, to explain things using mathematical formulas, but in the real world it&#x27;s also common to have some explanations even in stack overflow using math expressions), in that situation other computer science students usually see them as something &#x27;strange&#x27;, something to be afraid of or reject by searching alternatives; whether myself and other math&#x2F;physics-students just don&#x27;t care, we are used to it (and most times it&#x27;s just a function)<p>My opinion is: you don&#x27;t need maths (99.99% of the time), but you also don&#x27;t need to be afraid of them and knowledge is very good for that.')
