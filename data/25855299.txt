Even if 30 percent of people lost jobs, they&#x27;re the minority. I think the money would have been better used as a weekly stipend for those on unemployment, or those who lost income at least. I certainly don&#x27;t need the 1800 bucks I got for my family of 3 on new year&#x27;s, for me it&#x27;s just money in the bank. I wish it could have gone to someone more needing, so maybe I&#x27;ll donate it, but it shouldn&#x27;t have even gone to me, is what I&#x27;m saying.')
