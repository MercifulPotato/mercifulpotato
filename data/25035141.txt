(I have a couple of examples in mind where this has happened.)<p>&gt; What&#x27;s the point of open source if companies just steal it, build billion dollar industries on top, and then lock everything down?<p>For folks who do not work 100% in OSS, there can be many points:<p>- The whole Github-as-resume thing makes it important to have public contributions (most people&#x27;s day job lives in private repos). To some extent, much of the industry needs OSS in lieu of effective employee screening processes.<p>- It&#x27;s a convenient way for big companies to exchange IP without formal bilateral agreements. Everyone else just benefits for free.<p>- Your line of work is X, but you built a crude project for Y. You open source it because you don&#x27;t actually care about area Y at all but hope your work could be useful for someone else.<p>- You write something for yourself and publish in the hopes that someone else will help you improve it for free. You&#x27;re looking for free work and&#x2F;or critique of your work. You don&#x27;t actually care if someone else makes a billion dollars on it because you weren&#x27;t interested in starting a business around it. Plus, you gain reputational points from having built it (consider Linus Torvalds&#x27;s ability to get work as a programmer as a result of having started Linux, for example).')
