Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[24853057], score=None, time=1603315694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24851355, text='&gt;Will be really interesting to see if anyone steps up to buy the content...<p>I would be surprised if anyone does.  The reason why Quibi was able to get so many creators onboard is twofold.  The first reason is they had a lot of money to spend.  The second reason is that the deals they signed were very friendly to creators.  Quibi got two years of exclusivity with the content, but they didn&#x27;t own it outright.  The creators could reedit the shows into more traditional formats and resell it after two years or even just give it away for free on Youtube and make whatever they can in ad revenue.  So while the content will likely resurface eventually, I can&#x27;t imagine many big players will want to pick up Quibi&#x27;s side of those original deals.')
