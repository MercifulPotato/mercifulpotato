He&#x27;s sold XRP worth $175m and owns $billions more. But it looks like he may be saved by the statute of limitations! He left in 2013 and a quick search indicates that the statute of limitations may be 5 years. It would be pretty crazy if this was all ruled illegal and he got to keep it all because the SEC took longer than 5 years to get in gear.<p>Will they go after Stellar next?')
