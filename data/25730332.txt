You might want it to have others, but that&#x27;s not the same as renting. If you don&#x27;t like it, buy something else.<p>You do get to do &quot;whatever you want&quot; with the device AS provided. You can stomp on it, melt in in a fire, or whatever, and Apple wont ask you for the device back. That&#x27;s a sale.<p>&quot;I wanted another version of the device, one that is unlocked, and Apple doesn&#x27;t sell me one&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean Apple doesn&#x27;t sell you what it says on the tin.<p>They&#x27;re selling iPhones, locks and all, not generic devices to have different OSes loaded.')
