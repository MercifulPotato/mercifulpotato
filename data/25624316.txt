AMD doesn&#x27;t have a great track record when it comes to these integrations.<p>AMD bought ATI while promising the same integration &quot;synergies&quot;. GPU style compute was going to be completely woven into the CPU - &quot;AMD Fusion&quot;. Sounds great - but they ended up with them being beaten to the CPU-with-integrated-GPU market by Intel by over a year (Intel Clarkdale launched January 2010, AMD Llano midway 2011). 14 years after the acquisition, AMD&#x27;s iGPU integration is not much different compared to any other iGPU integration, their raw performance lead is shrinking compared to Intel and they&#x27;re beaten by Apple. Radeon Technologies Group functionally operates independently within the company, and AMD won&#x27;t use their more performant new RDNA architecture in iGPUs for two years after its launch for some reason - even their 2021 APUs still use their 2017 Vega architecture (fundamentally based on 2012 GCN technology). In the intervening years they&#x27;ve screwed up their processor architecture and marketshare for by going all in on the terrible Bulldozer architecture that was designed around the broken promises of far reaching GPU integration.<p>Given all that the ATI acquisition might still have been worth it - in hindsight AMD needed a competent GPU architecture one way or another - but the mismanagement of this acquistion nearly killed the company. I hope better leadership can do something here but I&#x27;m not really holding my breath.')
