You could nit-pick on the effectiveness of individual methods but the broader point is clearly evident: technology, and our increasing use of it, has more potential to implement, test and refine new persuasive techniques at a scale never seen before in human history. The evidence for this is obvious.<p>It stands to reason that we need to draw lines around what appropriate persuasion looks like not because these new techniques are <i>definitely</i> abusing our freedoms but because they <i>might</i> and in theory <i>could</i>. The potential in itself should be enough to treat the role of technology seriously and consider what the boundaries should be.')
