However, these lawsuits are so without merit that they aren&#x27;t even surviving summary judgement, which is an amazingly low legal bar to clear. Saying you had video evidence of a poll worker brutally murdering anyone who voted for Trump would be sufficient justification to survive summary judgement, to give you an idea of just how low a bar it is.')
