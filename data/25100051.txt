It worked fine after 2 minutes of set-up, and then stopped working about 1-2 months in. The light still works with the regular switch, but I can&#x27;t get the connection back whatever I try, to turn it on&#x2F;off with my phone.<p>Definitely won&#x27;t be coming back to this until 5 or 10 years to see if the tech has reliably moved.')
