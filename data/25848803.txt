It has never caused me a problem I am aware of, and I don&#x27;t want to miss out on security patches, or even just bugfixes and perf improvements.<p>Heck, I actually just upgraded a MacBook that was still on 10.12, which was EOL&#x27;d. But I upgraded it <i>because</i> it was EOL&#x27;d, and wasn&#x27;t getting patch releases for security fixes, and I want those patch releases as soon as they are released!')
