It&#x27;s generally because there are two or more reasonable possible behaviors and which one is correct hasn&#x27;t yet been determined. In this particular case, there are subtleties because named tuples can be seen as ordered collections of values and as named associative structures. Deciding that kind of thing takes a lot of time and effort. If you feel that there is a preferred behavior that broadcasting over named tuples ought to have, it would be helpful to post that on GitHub.')
