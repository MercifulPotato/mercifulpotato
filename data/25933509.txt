Other things that don&#x27;t help (somewhat US specific):<p>1. Layer of indirection created by the entire insurance system, which at this point is clearly not a good model for healthcare. <i>Everyone</i> needs&#x2F;should have some amount of healthcare, so a system built entirely around the idea that only a minority of people should need to take advantage of the system is silly.<p>2.
