I told him the story of how Cisco Systems got its start by running bootleg versions of the TOPS-10 operating system on its very first routers.  Even with the overhead of emulation, Unix of that time simply didn&#x27;t have what it took to do the job under those hardware constraints.  Later, Cisco came clean to DEC.<p>The guy hadn&#x27;t heard that story, but he did remember that DEC got a really sweet deal on Cisco hardware.<p>A lot of ideas from DEC operating systems are due for resurrection.')
