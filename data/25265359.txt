This is the traditional definition.<p>However the normal everyday usage of inflation&#x2F;deflation talks about the &#x27;General Price Level&#x27;, usually measured with things like GDP Deflator, or  CPI. Some way of trying to measure the general price level. All of those measures are imperfect.<p>By the first definition, both Bitcoin and ETH are inflationary but only slightly so.<p>By the second definition it is very hard to say because we don&#x27;t really have a way to measure it.')
