Obama has admitted that he continued the drone strikes because he couldn&#x27;t afford to look soft on terrorism as a Democrat, for instance. No law compelled him to, just the court of public opinion. How would we get to the point where, instead, he couldn&#x27;t afford to look excited about bombing?<p>And, similarly, different countries have had wildly different rates of success at dealing with covid, but history will not remember Ardern or Phúc as a hero for the lives they saved, and it won&#x27;t remember any national leader who didn&#x27;t manage to do the same (Trump, Biden, or especially Löfven and Tegnell) as villains. It will remember Trump and Biden as leaders of a superpower, and it will remember, falsely, that covid surprised everyone and everyone dealt with it as best they could. Again, the incentives are bad. Why bother to try your hardest if people don&#x27;t mind if you fail and you get some temporary popularity from saying &quot;Everything is fine, go party&quot;?<p>People respond to incentives, and this applies to everything from national politics to, oh, workplace politics. Remember that Twitter banned Trump because enough of their employees finally had enough (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;16&#x2F;how-twitter-banned-trump&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;16&#x2F;how-twi...</a>) more than any policy reason per se. Companies listen to unions when having the unionized employees present enough of an incentive for management to listen. Companies listen to <i>non-unionized</i> employees under the same conditions, too. A union just makes things more formal.<p>The fact that Biden did not feel compelled to suspend all military activity and lock down the country immediately upon assuming the presidency is certainly a failure of our society. If you want to say it&#x27;s a personal failure, I (a Biden voter) will gladly join you. Let&#x27;s just make sure we keep saying it for every president.')
