Very small sample size, so it&#x27;s not clear how that compares to the Pfizer vaccine. That appears to cause severe enough fever on occasion (~0.1%) that &quot;who pays for the rare precautionary hospitalizations?&quot; could be a very a real issue in countries like the US without public health care. The % of temporary side effects reported is significantly more than most other vaccines.<p>As you say, the fevers are probably just temporary side effects of the immune response and the supermajority of people recover very quickly (~24hrs or less). But it is an issue that needs monitoring - the trials really aren&#x27;t <i>that</i> big, so it&#x27;ll take quite a bit more data to know if those vaccines are safer than covid itself for the not-at-risk population.')
