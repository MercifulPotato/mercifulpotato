I mean upfront, 10-year horizons during disruptive shifts absolutely can get a bit speculative. I don&#x27;t mean to make any hard predictions here. But there certainly seems to be a ton of capital floating around right now that could get redirected given the right incentives. Privately, there seem to be a significant number of people who could buy new cars but aren&#x27;t. Cars seem to last significantly longer these days [0, 1], and the burgeoning of EVs may itself act as a further deterrent. If minimum capex and TCO made major shifts, I could see that driving significantly faster replacement cycles temporarily until new market equilibrium and saturation was reached. Granted with some floors created by segments of the population who couldn&#x27;t handle the capex even if the opex was favorable as is so often the case.<p>But speaking of that there is the public side too. From what I can tell, a LOT of money continues to go into government subsidies of fossil fuels [2]. The politics will absolutely shift as the population shifts, and at some point it seems likely that &quot;why not put those tens of billions into &#x27;cash for clunkers&#x27; type schemes instead?&quot; is going to make it one or another platform. Or all the platforms competing with each other. Of course that applies only to certain countries that can afford it.<p>At any rate, it will be an interesting decade!<p>----<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;03&#x2F;18&#x2F;automobiles&#x2F;as-cars-are-kept-longer-200000-is-new-100000.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;03&#x2F;18&#x2F;automobiles&#x2F;as-cars-are-k...</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aarp.org&#x2F;auto&#x2F;trends-lifestyle&#x2F;info-2018&#x2F;how-long-do-cars-last.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aarp.org&#x2F;auto&#x2F;trends-lifestyle&#x2F;info-2018&#x2F;how-lon...</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;jamesellsmoor&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;15&#x2F;united-states-spend-ten-times-more-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-than-education&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;jamesellsmoor&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;15&#x2F;united...</a>')
