This is pretty much what an opensource is, don&#x27;t like GPL, go get some code not under it.<p>The much of the *BSD family whose pretty much only point of existence over GNU was its use of permissive license is there laying around, with their devs almost begging for somebody to take their code, and fund their work.<p>And still, how many of those companies went, and chose FreeBSD over Linux? Not many, very likely just single digits. Most continue skulking, squabbling, crying, facing lawsuits, lose money, face, but they still continue to bite the bitter fruit, which is Linux.<p>The simple truth is that they have no alternative to Linux, and they don&#x27;t have resources to make an OS of their own, or bring the numerous permissively licensed &quot;Linux killers&quot; to usable state.')
