Really liking it!<p>I think some of the other frameworks I’ve worked with in the past have too much of their own abstraction built in to the point that it’s difficult to understand the fundamentals of how the application is working. Fast API excludes unnecessary abstractions, makes it easy to use outside libraries, and feels a lot more intuitive. Less learning the docs and more coding.<p>Thanks to Tiangolo for your efforts!')
