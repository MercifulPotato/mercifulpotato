They fit well into hot sweaty climates. Lots of room for a cool breeze to blow through, lots of space for hot air to rise to the ceiling.<p>Also, if you build a full-scale Parthenon complete with giant gilded statue of Athena, I think it is pretty arguable that you are deliberately <i>inviting</i> that same spirit to dwell in your city. I would bet money there have been people performing rituals to various Greek gods in the Nashville Parthenon since its inception. Admittedly I may be biased by living in a city that&#x27;s been having parades in the honor of assorted Greek gods for the past hundred years or so; Mardi Gras is a heck of a thing.')
