The database is an incomprehensible mess, there&#x27;s a whole class of features we cannot implement because of this (lack of) architecture, business logic is all over the place (with a million ways to do the exact same thing), mostly in the clients, performance is bad because every client is doing all sorts of queries all the time, and training a new developer either takes months or doesn&#x27;t really work out at all - because who wants to read a decade&#x27;s worth of spaghetti code. I&#x27;ve been working on a way to fix this, but it takes a lot of time and effort. Also management still doesn&#x27;t understand the concept of &quot;overwhelming technical debt&quot;.<p>The only reason this has even been hanging by a thread for so long is that we only make software where the back-end and the clients are run on-premise in a separate network. Otherwise it would be a security nightmare as well.<p>This article is basically a set of instructions to get to where we are. It&#x27;s like saying that traffic lights are unnecessary because if you just floor it through an intersection, you&#x27;ll get to your destination much faster. And you know what, it might just work the first few times. Until you find out why these things exist in the first place.')
