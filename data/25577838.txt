I am guessing this isn’t a good thing.<p>It’s a link to a newsletter I create that contains javascript, tech and web developer links. It takes me a lot of time to prepare, and I think there is value there for others.<p>As far as I am aware self posts are allowed, so what makes this particular link not allowed?<p>Thanks,\nMark')
