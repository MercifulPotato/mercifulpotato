I learned this stuff a pretty long time ago!<p>Deciding <i>how</i> to cache is often much more complicated than writing the actual code, although the code can also be very complicated.<p>For any caching layer, you have to decide:<p>- storage? (on disk vs. in memory)<p>- host? (app server vs. database server vs. third-party like ElastiCache)<p>- what to cache? (DB query results and&#x2F;or rendered views and&#x2F;or DTOs)<p>- when to delete cache? (ex: row #12 was changed in the DB, so now I need to delete any cached data that should change because row #12 was an input for it)<p>- how to segment cache? (logged-in users may share some parts of cache, but not others)<p>- TTL for cache? (is it OK to just keep everything in memory forever, or does there need to be a time limit that will reduce the size of the cache?)<p>- max size for cache? (same issue as above, but the limit is the storage size instead of a proxy like time)<p>These seem like decent jumping off points:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alankent.me&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;server-side-caching-strategies-for-modern-web-applications&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alankent.me&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;server-side-caching-strategie...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalocean.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;web-caching-basics-terminology-http-headers-and-caching-strategies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalocean.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;web-caching...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;caching&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;caching&#x2F;</a>')
