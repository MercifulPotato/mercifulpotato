Will Travis CI be getting rid of free users? #<p>&gt; A. Travis CI will continue to offer a free tier for public or open-source repositories on travis-ci.com and will not be affected by the migration.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.travis-ci.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;migrate&#x2F;open-source-repository-migration#q-will-travis-ci-be-getting-rid-of-free-users" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.travis-ci.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;migrate&#x2F;open-source-reposito...</a><p>This would seem to be grossly misleading, if not simply wrong info?  There are still a bunch of travis users on travis community forums trying to figure out what&#x27;s going on and why travis-ci.org seems to have stopped working (also different from what the FAQ says), who don&#x27;t seem aware of the pricing change.<p>The first line of the document is &quot;On May 2nd, 2018 Travis CI announced that open source projects will be joining private projects on travis-ci.com!&quot;, which also includes this FAQ:<p>&gt; Q. Will there be lower concurrency for free accounts on travis-ci.org?<p>&gt; A. As part of the shift of infrastructure from .org to .com and needing to make sure all users have equal access to resources, free and open-source .org accounts will have concurrency reduced from 5 to 4 concurrent jobs. Concurrent jobs have not changed on .com, so please consider migrating your repositories as soon as possible if this is an issue.<p>So... that&#x27;s all not quite right, it turns out. They&#x27;re providing an FAQ about &quot;free accounts&quot; without saying <i>there no longer is no such thing as a free account</i>, and &quot;open source projects&quot; are &quot;joining private projects on travis-ci.com&quot; only in the sense they can choose to pay for the same plans as private projects.<p>It&#x27;s true that nobody owes us anything for free, and the free support for open source CI for the past 9 years has been a gift...<p>It&#x27;s also true that they are not being particularly transparent (an understatement; if they don&#x27;t fix that FAQ soon I&#x27;m just going to call it lying) or gracious in how they are handling this transition, for an open source community that has come to rely on them.')
