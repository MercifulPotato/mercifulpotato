That’s a common misconception, it’s tailored to individual states voting patterns.  Overall turnout consistently favors Democrats which doesn’t win every state, but control doesn’t require every state.<p>As to the extra voting in Texas. 2020 had an additional  + 1205300 Republican votes and + 1381258 Democratic votes in a solid red state which just hit 1&#x2F;2 of voting age population.  That’s 46.6% Republican and 53.4% Democrat and means those extra votes very much favored Democrats.  Project a 20% increase in turnout with that kind of margin and Texas is in dead even recount territory.<p>Of course any election where Texas is that close Democrats have already won by such a margin as to make possibility flipping Texas largely irrelevant.  Further, looking at these numbers it’s clear why targeted voter suppression becomes so significant.')
