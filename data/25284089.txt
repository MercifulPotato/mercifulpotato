How you might change the universe enough to cause a variation is a bigger question. Concentrating all the stars (mass) to one place might do it. Maybe not.<p>The flip side of that question is the larger and generally accepted as obvious statement: a constant with value &quot;x&quot; determines or reflects how the universe is as of <i>now</i>. The duration of that &quot;now&quot; is likely much longer than the earths entire existence.')
