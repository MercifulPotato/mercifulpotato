When I was a kid, just about everyone (including my parents) knew I had ADD&#x2F;ADHD, but never did anything about it.  Including myself.  It wasn&#x27;t until I lost a job because I was so easily distractable that I realized how much of a hold it had on my life.  Medication helps, but really only on making it easier to pry myself from distractions.<p>But this study clarifies so much of my behaviour and self-image from when I was a kid to now.  I bully myself fiercely, and never understood why I should be praised for high grades, when it was something expected of me.  That definitely extends to now, where I can finish&#x2F;deliver a product, but feel _nothing_ about it.  No sense of accomplishment, no relief that something&#x27;s shipped.  Nothing.  It stops me from taking on hobbies or really doing anything with the material that I learn.  Leads to regular burnout and cycles of depression.<p>The article references methylphenidate as a good drug for ADHD, specifically for motivation.  This makes me sad, because I&#x27;m on it, and not feeling very motivated.')
