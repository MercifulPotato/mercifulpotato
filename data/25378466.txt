You need extreme HDR capturing to accurately reproduce these effects, as they often play the largest part with bright, especially colored, light sources. I did work on flare simulation and while many effects can be modeled by a rather simple convolution (in the spectral space of course -- you cannot make a rainbow out of RGB straightforwardly), the problem is that kernels (PSFs, point spread functions) for these convolutions have very long tails and it&#x27;s the shape of these tails that gives most of the &#x27;natural&#x27; artistic feel.<p>The thing is, these tails become apparent only when you convolve with a very very bright source -- which on a typical 12-bit level linear raw image would amount to something like 10⁵-10⁶, i.e. needing 4-8 additional bits of HDR.<p>Here are some useful links on the topic of flare simulation, I believe bokeh has mahy similar aspects:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200119024053&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonwinder.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;simulation-of-lens-flare-in-the-human-eye&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200119024053&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonwinde...</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de&#x2F;hdr&#x2F;TemporalGlare&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de&#x2F;hdr&#x2F;TemporalGlare&#x2F;</a>')
