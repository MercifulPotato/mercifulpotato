What if I only invest in my predicted top 5, but the real top 1 is ranked 6 in my estimate?<p>If what matters is to reliably capture the top performers, then the perfect VC would get the top 5 with only 5 investments. But for imperfect VCs, it might be worth it to invest in 50 just to approach 100% chance of capturing these 5 top performers, the 45 others are just the cost of doing that.')
