There was a game were a gorilla threw an explosive banana on a city skyline. I think it was more a demo for the basic language than a game but it was awesome to 7 year old me when my dad let me use his work computer and play it. I learned that there was a file that controlled the game and it had easy to understand text in it like explosion_radius = 7. A few years later I wrote an &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; program that was just a few hundred if statements and input prompts on my dad&#x27;s brand new 286. It asked you questions and then responded, carrying on a very basic conversation. Thanks basic (and dad)')
