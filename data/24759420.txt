I think it&#x27;s useful to have a raw numbers audit of the costs in your life and to figure out if they&#x27;re worth it or they&#x27;re things you could eliminate. However, I think at some point you&#x27;re going to have to be okay with some &quot;inefficiency&quot; in your life, assuming you are doing okay financially, of course. Stressing about efficiency can take its toll on you mentally if you&#x27;re the kind of person who likes to maximize every little thing.')
