I was flying to the US for a job interview, so I ticked the box that said I was seeking work.  I was denied and missed my flight.  I&#x27;ve been told I will never be eligible for and ESTA again.  I got the job and am now on an E-3 visa, however if I ever want to visit and don&#x27;t have an E-3, I need to apply for a proper tourist visa.')
