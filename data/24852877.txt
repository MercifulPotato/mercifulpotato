So all spectrum allocation is damned?<p>I&#x27;d be happy enough to agree that auction design is hard (and I think really interesting) and that combining it with politics is also difficult. The issue here (which the author never states but I think would not be disagreeable to them) is that you have to be careful what you wish for: maximising revenue then misusing revenue won&#x27;t help. But that&#x27;s not the aauxtion&#x2F;economists fault any more than you&#x27;re mechanic is responsible for you intentionally crashing.')
