I&#x27;m assuming the 5 minutes time included decompressing it? It seems a bit weird to take so much time to allocate some objects in memory and possibly establish a few connections.<p>Anyway, can you share which kind of environment even a 5 minute deployment would be a problem? Most places I worked at it took a lot more than 5 minutes to actually implement the change that&#x27;s going to production, so deployment times were pretty much irrelevant overall.')
