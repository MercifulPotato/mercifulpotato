Despite what you&#x27;re trying to imply about them &quot;updating&quot; too often, my code from 2016 still works correctly against the newest versions of React. That&#x27;s pretty much the definition of stability to me.<p>&gt; the change was far less abrupt, and you can still use functional views if you want to<p>So you are hating on React because you don&#x27;t know this, but this exact optional progression has always been how they have introduced new features into React. Again - old code works with new React versions.<p>&gt; do we really need to ... expect them to know<p>True, this is a weakness, but the documentation is pretty explicit on this front. It&#x27;s not like there isn&#x27;t a big community around the library to address this.<p>Anyhow, I respect your points here, and concede that writing server-side code in Node is probably not what you want to do; I reach for tools like Hasura in this case regardless. With low-code backend tooling and React, I can promise you I can make a better website than with just Python no matter how much Django template wizardry one can muster.')
