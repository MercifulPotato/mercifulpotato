It sure wouldn&#x27;t be 100,100.  On what basis would you assert that 10 or 100 or 1000 people viewing the original was <i>better</i> than 100,000 viewing the enanced version?<p>And eventually the original gets lost?  What it if eventually gets lost <i>anyway</i>, and we don&#x27;t even have the enhanced version?')
