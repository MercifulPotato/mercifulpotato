I also love programing since being kid.<p>Now I am expert for hire, contractor, mercenary. Surely I try to read politics for my own benefit, is it for securing contract extension or jumping onto more interesting project within the organization. \nHowever I don&#x27;t have to play games to chase bonuses and perks - solid daily rate exceeds all that. No racing with goals or reviews - choose own path, trainings, conferences, transferable skills. No need to believe in management success propaganda - we do professional business, I sell my expertise they make use of it. Not volountieering my precious weekend time to make bosses happy - overtime? eventually, here is the rate.<p>A bit of ego and sales talk is needed too to get foot in the door and then sometimes  to convince them to hear your advice. I am there to help, get job done under agreed conditions and leave with more experience, grown reputation, and new contacts in my network.')
