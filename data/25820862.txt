Pointing the lack of &quot;judiciary or democratic supervision&quot;.<p>They are afraid that eventually, Twitter or Facebook is going to remove their conservative speech, if it rubs Twitter or Facebook employees the wrong way, and they&#x27;d be right. That&#x27;s exactly what is going to happen.<p>But I&#x27;d argue, why are they still flocking to thus promoting these platforms at first place? Promote open techs, open protocols so that anybody with any client can subscribe to their messages without being forced to go on Twitter and co... it exists, it&#x27;s called RSS, ActivePub... the tools of freedom are here and they don&#x27;t take much effort at all.<p>edit: I feel like people are missing my point or maybe I didn&#x27;t expressed it very well. Twitter and Facebook should be entitled to ban whomever they want on their platform, that&#x27;s not the point. The point is governments and politicians should start promoting open protocols and technologies for communication instead of voting law for fear of getting their &#x27;conservative&#x27; speech banned by these platforms they decided to speak on, often exclusively. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying.')
