The algorithm.<p>Not the algorithm. The algorithm is essentially the recipe. The algorithm is merge sort, or depth first search. It&#x27;s the contract the API gives you, more or less. &quot;This function does merge sort.&quot; But there are unlimited possible implementations of merge sort and each one is copyrightable. And one implementation doesn&#x27;t infringe the copyright of the other ones, even when they&#x27;re the same algorithm, but you have to write your own. Copyright doesn&#x27;t protect function, it protects works of authorship.')
