This can be a long, drawn-out process, and admittedly it relies on relative freedom and stability in the societies pursuing scientific research.<p>There are two fundamental attributes of science that allow for this, which I don&#x27;t believe are talked about enough:<p>1. Good, solid, scientific investigation is reproducible and thus is not impacted by priors. It doesn&#x27;t matter who performs the research, the same conclusion will be reached. Reproducibility means there is never a question of bias or discrimination.<p>2. All scientific inquiry requires fasifiability. If a hypothesis cannot be proven wrong, it is not scientific.<p>Meeting these two requirements is difficult, but also the reason science is regarded so highly in the modern world. By attaching these elements of rigor to the process, the conclusions become trustworthy. Stringently following that process, however, takes time, effort, and a meticulous nature. The reproducibility crisis is very real, and every member of the scientific community should be immensely concerned about it, as it erodes public trust in science and research as a whole. And make no mistake, that erosion can be weaponized to great effect against robust research used in policy making. In part, scientists are afraid if they call out the bad research and denounce poor practices, they will rock the boat and risk funding or be ostracized. But keeping your head down is a short term strategy, and doing so only serves to further jeopardize trust while lending credence to denialism.<p>I am not an active member of the community, but I certainly know many researches, and they all know there is a problem, and they all just  want to be left alone to focus on their work, hoping someone else will deal with it. Understandable, but sometimes more is required.')
