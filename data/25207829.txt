Scaleway has a shitty history of discontinuing products and pushing the migration work for you.<p>One example of this is C14. Even though they advertised it as a long-term archiving solution, they gave the product a 5-month discontinuation period after which they just delete your data. If you wanted to start using their new storage solution, you had to do the migration work by hand and then ask them to refund you so that they don&#x27;t invoice you twice.')
