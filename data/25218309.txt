It doesn&#x27;t get to set yield (that&#x27;s set at auction) but it has to set the bond payout to something.<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore doesn&#x27;t do anything about interest rates.  Neither does the equivalent institution in Hong Kong.<p>The policy lever in Singapore is the foreign exchange rate.  In Hong Kong, they more or less just fix the exchange rate to the USD.<p>Singapore happens to have lots of government debt for weird reasons.  Hong Kong has almost none.  (And you could easily imagine a version Singapore without government debt.)  So there wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be deposit rates or bond coupons to set at all.<p>In general, economies also don&#x27;t need central banks.  Many economies do just fine without them.<p>Good examples today are lots of smaller economies that just don&#x27;t bother with their own currencies, the process is commonly called &#x27;dollarisation&#x27;.  But historically we also had examples of successful large economies with privately issues means of payment and minimal government regulation.  The free banking episodes in eg Canada, Scotland or Australia are well documented.')
