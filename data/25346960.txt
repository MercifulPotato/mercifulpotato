They are extremely R&amp;D driven.<p>Volumes have been written about them so I&#x27;ll sum it up by saying that while they make some real overpriced crap at times... it is also true that over the last 50 years ago they have probably advanced home audio reproduction more than any other individual company.<p>Car audio, as well. Their role in car audio is extremely undereported, because a lot of Bose-engineer car audio is unbranded. But if you&#x27;re wondering how factory-installed car stereos went from &quot;sounding like clock radio speakers&quot; to &quot;honestly, fine&quot; in the past few decades, Bose is a big part of that answer.')
