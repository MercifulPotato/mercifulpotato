The downside is that they risk the creation of unreadable or overly magic code.<p>Python already is succinct and already has metaprogramming (although not to the extent of Lisp, as pointed out by the rationale). And we all know Python is slow, but the downsides of making it less readable through macros outweigh the upsides IMHO. Python is loved for being readable. Instead let&#x27;s improve on its general performance.')
