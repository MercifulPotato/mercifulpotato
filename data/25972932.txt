I imagine the very last concern of people deciding whether to move to another country in hopes of improving their family&#x27;s life is whether some random internet commenter understands them.<p>They did not call themselves slaves ... someone on HN did. The logic I cannot square is how someone can say these people are slaves with a straight face.<p>I don&#x27;t care what they do with their lives, if they want to illegally enter a racist facist hellhole where half the country are white supremacists that is their choice. What I object to is saying they are slaves because they voluntarily make this choice.')
