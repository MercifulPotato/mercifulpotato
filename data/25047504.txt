Unless you are sharing, the pictures you store are encrypted and stored on your own device (basically using your iCloud storage). That&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t incur a huge cost. However, we are planning to introduce premium features in the future including a cloud storage option for people who don&#x27;t have enough disk space on their device.')
