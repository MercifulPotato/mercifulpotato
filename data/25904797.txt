We also invited the pdoc3 author early on to collaborate under the only condition that he&#x27;d need to change his swastika avatar to something less offensive, but alas. :&#x2F;<p>Regarding the comparion to pdocs:<p><pre><code>  - We only support HTML output at the moment, pdocs does support Markdown.\n  - Type annotations are now a first class citizen in pdoc, including string forward references.\n  - 3.8 is a requirement for pdoc, but you can use it to document 3.5 code.\n  - pdoc now uses tox, mypy, flake8, GitHub Actions... and has 100% test coverage :)\n  - and we also have a Python API: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdoc.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;pdoc.html#pdoc\n</code></pre>\nOverall, I think we try to be a bit simpler compared to pdocs. For example, we use argparse instead of hug to not introduce additional dependencies, and we really focus on the &quot;generate standalone documentation&quot; use case. That being said, I can recommend pdocs just as well. :)')
