If we instead of “left” and “right” use the words “south arm” and “north arm”, then the mirror suddenly does not “flip” anything.<p>No dude. The mirror flips left and right Relative to you. The mirror ignores up and down relative to you. The paradox is real when thought of in these terms.<p>Truth be told the flip is neither left or right nor up and down. actually It is actually inside out on the z axis: towards you. Translational coordinates along the xy plane must be preserved and this is what causes the perceived left right flip.<p>The actuality is nothing was flipped along x or y, it was kept the same.<p>That&#x27;s what trips everyone up.')
