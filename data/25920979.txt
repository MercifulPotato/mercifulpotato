That&#x27;s awesome! I am 100% the target audience for that product, and until I saw that ad I had no clue it existed! To find a product like that I&#x27;d have to search for it, but I would never search for an entire new category of product that I didn&#x27;t know about.<p>Same thing for the fitness app I am using (BodBot, it is amazing!). I am quite literally healthier right now because of a targeted advertisement.<p>Was I aware of fitness apps before then? Sure. But the ad for BodBot was informative about what features differentiated it from the literally hundreds, if not thousands, of other competing apps.<p>Do most ads suck? Sure. Should ads be highly invasive? Nope. But interest tracking and basic targeting actually help me find products and services that I want to buy!<p>Facebook in particular, for all the things wrong with it (long list!) has some amazingly relevant ads that inform me of products that I never knew about.')
