Its old sequence had a hourly faster buzz which returned to normal at the beginning of the hour. It looked like this<p><pre><code>  X:59:00 - Buzzing gets faster.\n  (X+1):00:00 - Normal buzzing resumes.\n</code></pre>\nI think it served as a crude hourly sync signal for some systems until GLONASS came and provided atomic level sync. This also implies that there may be other non-human systems listening for this station.<p>It can be speculated that Russian Perimeter (Dead Hand) system [0] may be one of the listeners.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dead_Hand" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dead_Hand</a>')
