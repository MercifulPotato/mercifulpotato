A month ago I tried to install Windows 10 onto an old laptop SSD mounted in an enclosure and connected through USB so I could play a games with my brother online that was only available through the Windows store, but the installer literally refused to install to it because I was using the Home edition of Windows instead of Enterprise. I eventually found a solution through some freemium backup software that allowed copying an installation on a regular hard drive onto a USB, but weirdly the first software I tried that claimed to have this feature did not yield in the SSD being bootable, so I had to find something else that was able to do it properly. Given that Microsoft went out of their way to disable doing this directly in their installer, I wouldn&#x27;t be too surprised if it the workarounds continue to become more difficult or even impossible without paying for the Enterprise version (which is not something students should ever have to pay for).')
