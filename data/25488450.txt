There are a lot of people on here with a LOT of working experience who have seen this game play out over and over and are not dazzled by a handful of giants making it out anymore.<p>Yes, it’s probably better odds than <i>the literal lottery</i>. That does not say a lot. Anyhow, I’m happy you’re excited and am not going to convince you - clearly. Enjoy your weekend dude.')
