Every aspect of the interface including the icons are harder to understand.  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but them seem to lack context.<p>I get what the point is (i think).   Symbols like we see that indicate male vs female gendered bathrooms, the &#x27;Handicap parking&#x27; and others allow everybody (and i hope all&#x2F;most cultures) to instantly recognize what is being depicted.  I would be hard pressed to guess what half of these are trying to represent.')
