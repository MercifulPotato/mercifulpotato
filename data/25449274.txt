Item(by='hypnoticpancake', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608155529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25446522, text='I don&#x27;t know what your conversion rate is from &#x27;free&#x27; to &#x27;premium&#x27; to &#x27;pro&#x27;, I&#x27;d definitely argue against these SaaS pricing &#x27;expert&#x27; guidelines. $12&#x2F;yr - $60&#x2F;yr are what I like to call &#x27;support the dev&#x27; pricing, hey I like your product and $12&#x2F;yr is &lt; less than a coffee a few times a year, $60&#x2F;yr is a manageable expense for someone being a power user, $29&#x2F;month is $348&#x2F;yr, and while I see the benefit of your product I would never pay that for the features provided as a power user.  And this is my problem with a lot of businesses they go from $0 to $15&#x2F;month for their tiering, then $50&#x2F;month, then &quot;enterprise&quot;, for a product I like that I&#x27;m not using for business or something that I can&#x27;t live without that&#x27;s a hard sell ($10&#x2F;month+).<p>Now the approach I might suggest would be raise premium to $2&#x2F;month, if you buy for the year pay $12.  Premium, $6&#x2F;month, $60&#x2F;yr. enterprise really depends on how an enterprise uses the product, but $50&#x2F;month might be a little cheap, but again I really don&#x27;t see the use case for an enterprise (&gt;500 employees) for something like this.')
