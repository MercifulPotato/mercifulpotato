On the other hand, recompiling libinput in 2020 takes about as much time as taking out a credit card from your wallet and paying for another closed source macOS app.<p>I just timed myself doing it on a fresh vagrant VM, and it took me less than two minutes. One full minute was downloading and installing build dependencies, and that would normally be a few seconds as most people already have gcc.<p>The steps I took were:<p><pre><code>  sudo apt build-dep libinput\n  sudo apt install fakeroot\n  apt source libinput\n  cd libinput-1.12.6&#x2F;\n  grep -r tp_detect\n  vim src&#x2F;evdev-mt-touchpad.c\n  dpkg-buildpackage -b\n  sudo dpkg -i -O ..&#x2F;libinput*.deb\n</code></pre>\nOh and I&#x27;m tempted to argue that this is, in fact, a user experience we deserve. ThinkPads are used by many developers worldwide. Most of my friends at Red Hat have it. Last time I could check (2011), Google gave developers ThinkPads with Linux as one of the options. Any single one of us could have fixed this bug in one day, and then spend maybe another full day communicating with Peter to get the fix in shape and merged. Yet it still isn&#x27;t fixed.<p>Free software often is free as in beer, but the real point is that we can, and we should, participate. Throwing money through GitHub Sponsors is one option, but often the best way is to just roll your sleeves up and do the work.')
