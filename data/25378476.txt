As far as I know, it never got fixed. The feelings I would get when looking at cloud billing interfaces can be summed as: obfuscated, like a pawnshop, and caveat emptor. I kind of came to the conclusion that if the cloud giants are not fixing their billing interfaces, then just like Amazon not sending you the details of the items you ordered by email and thus causing you to use the app to help with primenesia, there is a &#x27;business&#x27; reason why the billing interfaces are generally incomprehensible.')
