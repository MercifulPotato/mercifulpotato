I wish more people and articles did this. I actually built Kontxt (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kontxt.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kontxt.io</a>) so everyone can add highlights to websites they visit or own, but it has more interactivity with inline comments, polls, mentions, tags, and smart navigation.<p>Please everyone, highlight everything! It&#x27;s so useful!')
