Item(by='Enginerrrd', descendants=None, kids=[25827925], score=None, time=1611010626, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25827561, text='This right here is the major difference between software and actual engineering.  I studied and got a 4 year accredited engineering degree and I have been working in civil engineering for 7 years, but, I am not YET an engineer.  I don&#x27;t yet have my license to independently verify and stamp designs.  I&#x27;ve passed most of the tests required to do so, but I&#x27;ve got another one to do.  In most jurisdictions in the US, there is a 4 year minimum training period AFTER school, where you must train and apprentice under an engineer before you can apply to take the tests.  They go through that application with a fine toothed comb.  To get authorization for that last test, I had to send in sealed recommendations from 4 different licensed engineers familiar with my work where any one of them has the opportunity to basically say &quot;no, this guy isn&#x27;t ready&quot; without my knowledge.<p>What is lacking is an understanding of the ethics, duty and responsibility to the public that is hammered into the conventional engineers on day one.  It starts with subtle things... In school, we had very strict standards for report formats.  If you screwed up something (like putting a figure title above a figure instead of below, or vice versa for a table) you got ZERO credit for that report, regardless of how much of your grade it counted for.  If you misreported the significant figures on a result? Zero credit.  Didn&#x27;t do an appropriate error analysis? Zero credit.<p>This isn&#x27;t just anal retentive BS though.  It teaches from the very beginning that failure to adhere to the code has serious ramifications.  It teaches you that when you, as an engineer with a duty to the public, report a figure as a result of your calculation, you had damn well better be right.  If you get it wrong, people can and do die.<p>In the real world, if I inappropriately call myself a &quot;Professional Engineer&quot; or a &quot;Structural Engineer&quot;, that&#x27;s straight up illegal.  I can lose the right to future licensure for something like that.  If as a P.E., you make a mistake, or perform work outside of your scope of knowledge, the licensing board WILL sanction you ruthlessly.  For minor things, they may just require you to re-mentor under an engineer and get all of your work reviewed before you stamp it.  For more serious things, you will lose your right to sign off on work at all.')
