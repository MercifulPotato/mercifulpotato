Take a sample every half period of a periodic signal like a sinusoidal wave. Your signal output will be constant or zero.<p>Take a digital sample(calculate a frame) of a wheel in a 3D game (draw the wheel at a specific position), each 30th or 60th of a second. The wheel will go backwards at some speeds(stroboscopic effect, a form of alias).')
