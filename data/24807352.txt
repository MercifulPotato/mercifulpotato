People are as well.<p>That may be true of trees and people but it is not true of internet communities. I think you&#x27;re making a category error. The confrontational style you&#x27;re talking about requires smaller, more cohesive environments to generate interesting outcomes. On a large, anonymous, open internet forum like HN, it just produces repetitive flamewar, then brain death, then heat death. Since the idea of HN is to be <i>interesting</i> (to the extent possible), we have no choice but to moderate this. I wish it were differentâ€”it would be a lot less work.<p>Usually when someone posts the sort of argument that you did, I have found that it&#x27;s possible to persuade them to follow the site guidelines once they understand that everything we do follows from trying to optimize for interestingness (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20optimiz%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20optimiz%20by:dang&amp;...</a>). It&#x27;s not about enforcing some tedious moral code. If you decide you buy that and want to use HN as intended in the future, you&#x27;re welcome to email hn@ycombinator.com and let us know.')
