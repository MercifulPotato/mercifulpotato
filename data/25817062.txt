Latimer&#x27;s terrarium is not a very good example IMAO.<p>Why?, because is the opposite of a landscape. There is not design or arrangement possible. The plant just will fill all the available volume and kill any other species in the bottle.<p>The plant inside that bottle is Tradescantia fluminensis. A South American weed that is popular indoors.

Is an invasive species in Australia and Europe that will be destroyed only by frost.')
