Those 0days were likely already in the hands of bad actors, too.<p>Finally, the reason he even discovered the original bug is because Apple accidentally once or twice forgot to strip function names from a binary. If this didn&#x27;t happen, that bug very likely would still be out there in the wild.<p>I&#x27;m not sure you understand how security research works.')
