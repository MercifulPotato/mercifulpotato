A professional telescope user is an astronomer—or a sniper. A professional typewriter user is a stenographer. A professional shoe user is an athlete.<p>In all these cases, it&#x27;s the quality and innovation in the tool, that&#x27;s holding these professionals back from being even better at their job than they already are.<p>Also, take special note of the case of the stenographer: <i>professionals</i> often require special professional variants of their tools, which trade off a longer learning curve for a higher productivity ceiling once learned. A stenographic keyboard takes years to learn, but all non-stenographic keyboards cap out at 150WPM, while stenographic keyboards allow those trained in their use to achieve 300+WPM.<p>And to make one more point: a professional <i>car driver</i> isn&#x27;t a race-car driver. A professional car driver is a <i>chauffeur</i>. Rolls-Royce&#x27;s cars aren&#x27;t famous for how luxurious they are to <i>drive</i>; they&#x27;re famous for having all the amenities needed by <i>professional drivers</i> — chauffeurs — to allow them to efficiently cater to their <i>clients&#x27;</i> needs. Limousines are the same kind of &quot;professional tools&quot; that stenographic keyboards are: they  increase <i>chauffeuring productivity</i>.<p>&gt; How did [video editing] become the default type of professional in the context of talking about computers?<p>Because <i>all</i> tech vloggers and <i>most</i> tech pundits — the people who review tech — edit videos as part of their jobs, of course ;)')
