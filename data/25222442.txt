Im mostly wondering about the standard fusion device questions such as: In the anticipated final device, i assume ion currents will have to be low enough to avoid interfering with the external field? How will charge balance be maintained between ion and electron species? What is the anticipated center of mass energy distrubution for the ions? Does the proposed focusing approach run afoul of the Liouville theorem?')
