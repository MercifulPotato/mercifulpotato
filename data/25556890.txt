Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=[25565105], score=None, time=1609132424, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25555031, text='&gt; I can see Kernel or Neuralink as one obvious example, but beyond that...<p>The thing is that Biohacking (Biopunk sub-genre) has been a long associated part of Cyberpunk lore. but the tech is still in its early infancy as its done in underground communities with very low to no budgets by disgruntled biologists who left the Industry, like myself. And often have way too much going on to focus on the immense struggle of bring something to Market.<p>I&#x27;m a Biohacker with borderline transhumanist leanings, but I prefer to focus on the diet and fitness based modifications&#x2F;alterations for longevity, cognitive enhancement and performance rather than actual physical implants for now because they are simply not there. But I&#x27;m entirely open to them and I think they will be common place.<p>But you should check out a few biohacker&#x2F;grinder events and documentaries online because their is definitely going to be growth in things like self-administered smart drugs that interface with interactive things like smart-clothing that are analyzing all kinds of bio-metrics in the next few years.<p>The CEO of Lululemon is a big player in that space and comes from &#x27;tactical&#x27; clothing for the &#x27;extreme sports&#x27; era in the 90s (snowboarding) at a time when when it was non-existent and thought to be absurd in most circles only to create an immense business model with the advent of things like X-games. The same thing with his yoga wear with Lulu lemon that struck it really well as more and more people were ditching the bar-scene after the 2008 financial crisis--its a really thought provoking business model and trajectory if I&#x27;m honest and I really don&#x27;t care much about fashion, let alone women&#x27;s clothing.<p>The issue with that kind of tech envisioned in the Cyberpunk genre, like most hardware, is that its likely going to need tons of investment so it falls to the centralized pitfall (Mega Corps) and is part of the dystopic lore; which is something I&#x27;d like to prevent as I think their is tons of potential for that beyond the low-hanging fruit non-sense from an Apple Watch. The maker-spaces at Caltech were a cool spot to see what some were developing, I&#x27;m sure Stanford and MIT has something similar.')
