FB didn&#x27;t &quot;do something wrong&quot;. They have repeatedly engaged in research without informed consent as op mentions. These are not isolated incidents, but rather Facebook&#x27;s modus operandi.<p>2. NYU uses volunteers to collect information on what Facebook ads are shown to them. A university project using volunteers to research on how people are targeted for political ads.<p>3. Facebook is trying to use its ToS so that its political targeting remains opaque.<p>I do not see any leaps here. I do not understand how a company such as Facebook has any moral authority to object about _anything_, much less about this research, but I&#x27;m open to hearing what I&#x27;m not understanding about your thought process.')
