Personally, as someone who spends at least half of every year traveling the world by bicycle, I find full-length expedition trousers like the Fjällräven Abisko to be the best clothing option. They are durable enough to withstand all the wear and tear of cycling all day and then walking through the bush to set up a campsite at day’s end. Plus they just protect you from the sun – wearing shorts while cycle-touring is way too much UV exposure.')
