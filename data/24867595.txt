But the authors of that letter to Nature and physicists in general need to be careful about promises, otherwise nobody is going to believe us in the future. And there is a tendency of promising a lot in order to get funding. And for the authors of the article to claim that &quot;A good example of a guaranteed result is dark matter.&quot; is just blatant lie. I wish there was an experiment that would for sure tell us what dark matter is. (I&#x27;m an astrophysicist myself)')
