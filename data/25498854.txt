For birds the lens length can never be long enough, and I think the Sigma range is in a great price point where it&#x27;s expensive enough to be good but you&#x27;re not paying more for marginal gains. Plus some of their latest lenses can be hooked up to a USB dock to allow you to customise them a bit, such as making micro-focus adjustments, which is really cool.')
