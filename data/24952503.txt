Stapledon at least had enormous ambition and unprecedented scope, though his writing reads like a poorly written encyclopedia.  I have nothing good to say about Lindsay.<p>Wells was great, though.. both readable and imaginative.  I hesitate to mention him and Lewis in the same breath, as I find absolutely nothing redeeming about Lewis&#x27; writing either, unless you like your conservative Christian propaganda laid on extra thick.')
