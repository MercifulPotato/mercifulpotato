My hi-fi amp generates quite a bit of heat but uses a massive heatsink along with vents all around the case to manage it. I do wonder, if the PS5 were simply a cuboid with a couple of larger (and quieter) fans, the kind of heavy duty heatsink it already has, plus plenty of vents around the case, whether that would work.<p>But, as you say, it comes back to dust, and those air vents would be the perfect route for that dust to enter the device, particularly if it&#x27;s sat on the carpet (which its form factor pretty much guarantees it will be in many homes).')
