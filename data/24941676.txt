I had seen afterwards that the author was active in the comments, but I notice the &quot;thank you&quot; comments sometimes, and it&#x27;s rarely obvious that the author is active here. These comments have some weird signalling feel to it, as if the intended recipient isn&#x27;t the person being thanked, but other people who are supposed to see that humble gratitude. People do strange things, or maybe I just imagine them to.<p>I don&#x27;t mind the down votes, I have hidden their effect and all counters to make sure I don&#x27;t get sad about down votes and don&#x27;t let my ego get inflated by up votes. Had you not mentioned it, I wouldn&#x27;t have known, but I&#x27;ll try to not let it ruin my day ;)')
