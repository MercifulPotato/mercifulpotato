I believe SOUL intends to be directly supported by various platforms, whereas Faust compiles to whatever kind of code runs on different platforms. So if you like Faust, you might end up compiling Faust to SOUL for some platforms.<p>Faust also has a more advanced syntax. SOUL basically looks like C, while Faust is more functional and designed from the ground up to represent graphs, as such it can look pretty alien. In particular, partial application in Faust is great for graphs but it also means there are 100 ways of writing a program.')
