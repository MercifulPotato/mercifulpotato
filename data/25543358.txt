Are all the lines privately owned and operated?<p>Also, as I&#x27;ve said before, the UK government does not care about the law. That&#x27;s why we were so enthusiastic to get involved in Iraq 2. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re still ignoring the ruling on prisoners voting (15 years later). The truth is, laws are just an excuse for governments about why they &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; do things people want. Don&#x27;t want to nationalise trains? Blame some obscure foreign law. Do want to play cowboy in the Middle East? Go for it!<p>And that&#x27;s without getting into why we never bother to try and enforce all these laws ourself? If DB are an illegal state company, why not say so in court? Instead we give them contracts, because we&#x27;re a law abiding country that ignores laws when awarding contracts to foreign entities but not domestic ones which is illegal!?')
