When I tried it, I had English selected and yet somehow it has characters that are _never_ used in English. That&#x27;s not necessarily an issue, but when non-English characters are easier to type than English characters, it decreases my typing speed significantly. I raised an issue about it and was quickly dismissed. I&#x27;ve stuck to SwiftKey since. I&#x27;ll have to try OpenBoard!')
