Item(by='seabird', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605714230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25135382, text='1.) You can&#x27;t just open up every driver. I say this as somebody who works on proprietary firmware and software that is basically the future of our company. We operate in a market with thin margins, our control strategies are our advantage, and divulging any info past the bare minimum concerning them would result in mass counterfeiting and ultimately the death of our company. A lot of hardware development is like this. I wish it were some other way, because I know some people would be over the moon with what it would enable, but most of the time it&#x27;s just not possible.<p>2.) I think you misunderstand what the Pinephone is -- if my memory serves me correctly, minus the modem blob, there is no need for reverse engineering, as the documentation for the hardware is available. You&#x27;re talking about sending good money after bad ideas while advocating <i>stopping</i> the thing that has a clear path to victory (starting from a clean slate with something that has real documentation) in favor of something else that has a negligible chance of ever happening (having source be released for drivers but not getting any documentation for it).')
