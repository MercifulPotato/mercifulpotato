This difference might be covered by total costs of ownership, but according to the nyt rent vs buy calculator, you&#x27;ll only be better off renting when looking at a time frame of less than ~5 years.<p>Greensboro, NC is on that list (which would fall in the more remote category) and the same still seems to apply. Not sure if my numbers are right, but a 2,000 sqft house from the 60s is being offered to rent for 1,500$, which is kind of ridiculous imho. Property value should be around 200k, with a monthly mortgage &lt;900$:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homedetails&#x2F;1603-Milan-Rd-Greensboro-NC-27410&#x2F;5935444_zpid&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homedetails&#x2F;1603-Milan-Rd-Greensboro-...</a>')
