It&#x27;s a waste of limited screen real estate, and means you don&#x27;t get to see as much of what you&#x27;re working on as you could. Suboptimal.<p>I use a tiling window manager at home, but when I&#x27;m at work I have to use a windows machine. I often use vim to do stuff and when I do I usually keep it to 80x24 or 80x48 (my preference is 80x24 unless what I&#x27;m working on has a lot of long function definitions). If I&#x27;m working out of a single vim window (which I&#x27;ve built my vimrc around to some extent), I don&#x27;t need to see a lot of info at the same time, so I can put that window at exactly the part of the (enormous these days) screen which is most amenable to my neck angle, and don&#x27;t have to jump around the screen much with my eyes, which helps me zone in. I&#x27;ll only go full screen if I have to analyze a huge CSV dump or something, where the lines are not kept to a sensible length, or occasionally when I use vimdiff (but even then I have my defaults set so that I don&#x27;t need more than 120 width to use a 2 way diff effectively). Spreading my info needlessly across the real estate feels less optimal to me I guess')
