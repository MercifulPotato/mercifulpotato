E.g. here is a pure gem [1]. This is a recording of a real analysis course from Rudin&#x27;s principles of mathematical analysis (aka Baby Rudin aka the architect of many beginning mathematics students&#x27; misery). Anyone that&#x27;s worked through this book knows the world of pain you&#x27;re about to enter. I&#x27;d love if there was a similar recording for say, Charles Pugh&#x27;s real mathematical analysis.  I mean he&#x27;s still alive, dunno if he still lectures from his book, but why not record one of those? It would be game changing for those who self-study.<p>Here&#x27;s another request:  Terrence Tao does a recording of a measure theory course.<p>Personally I find the Khan Academy, 3B1brown stuff to be a waste of time. It&#x27;s too elementary and cutesy.  That is not anything like what I&#x27;ve experienced real mathematics to be like.  It is a continuous painful struggle.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ab41LEw9oiI&amp;list=PLun8-Z_lTkC6qJF1sVh3_Hx7aL6FPd0IN&amp;index=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ab41LEw9oiI&amp;list=PLun8-Z_lTk...</a>')
