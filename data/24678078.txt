I observe broken web apps more often than desktop apps.<p>Browsers are incredibly complicated these days, the APIs they expose to developers are less stable than APIs exposed by operating systems. The internet between frontend and backend is a huge source of bugs (latency, end-point security, packet inspection in enterprise, public routers using custom web-based authorization forms). Some web apps collect their dependencies in runtime from all over the Internets and become broken when these third parties update something.<p>&gt; frictionless install<p>For mobile platforms or UWP it’s equally frictionless. Windows desktops have ClickOnce, and even with traditional MSI installers clicking “I agree-next-finish” only causes minimal amount of friction.<p>&gt; no gatekeepers platform<p>Right, on mobile that’s a very good reason :-(')
