Competent legal assistance is expensive, and building a defense is also expensive and time-consuming. So I wouldn&#x27;t say that an 85% conviction rate implies anything about the innocence of pre-trial prisoners. Moreover, I think it is dangerous to do so, lest it be a circular argument: why did you arrest him? He was guilty. Why was he guilty? Because I arrested him.')
