But I also think it is important to understand how this generalizes. The Holocaust is a vivid example of how authoritarianism inevitably leads to human rights abuses, both of a nation&#x27;s &quot;own&quot; people and often some Other selected by the authority as an enemy to get people to rally around. Learning about the Holocaust is not just a reminder that the Nazis were bad, but that <i>every</i> fascist or authoritarian government has that same potential which is why we must be vigilent against them.')
