Instead Id say you specifically. You specifically pretty much tried to said that the violence was justified.<p>Ex: you said this, which is a not so subtle attempt to justify the violence:<p>&quot;of the opinion that violence may be an acceptable response to injustice, well, there&#x27;s a whole lot more reason to believe that BLM protestors have justification for their claim of injustice &quot;.<p>&gt; well no, both sides aren&#x27;t the same<p>Specifically you, kinda do seem at least to be pretty similar to the &quot;other side&quot; actually, after rereading your comment, in that you attempted to imply that the violence actually was justified, and that it therefore &quot;may be acceptable&quot;.<p>Your comment was a pretty clear attempt to say that this violence could have a &quot;justification&quot; that would make it &quot;acceptable&quot;.')
