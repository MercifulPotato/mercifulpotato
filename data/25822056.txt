This appears to be a case of silent majority and vocal minority. Why is one side so fearful, and the other so fearless? Is democracy even possible in this condition?<p>This is the problem with censorship. First it’s about the people being censored. Then it’s about the people doing the censoring. Then it’s about the people that disagree with the people doing the censoring. And then everybody is afraid to disagree on anything. And then everybody has to actively agree with everything. And then nothing makes sense but everybody agrees on it, and nobody understands why.
