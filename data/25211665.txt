This is a big part of the plot of the book &quot;Gold Finch&quot; if you find it interesting.<p>Another very easy way to look at it, if you are a drug dealer wanting to move 10 Million dollars, that&#x27;s not very easy in cash even if its $100 bills.  A single painting could hold the same value and take up much less physical space.')
