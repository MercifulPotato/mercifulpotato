Sure, some people will be really happy with this, and I hope they enjoy them, but for most use cases there&#x27;s just so many better products out nowadays IMO.<p>Because of the GPU it&#x27;s not really suited to be positioned as an &quot;open source friendly&quot; design, and if that&#x27;s not important, GPD has a lot of really good products now. Most aren&#x27;t quite as small, granted, but I imagine a pinephone with a keyboard case would be a close match. The physical controls (especially for gaming) probably wouldn&#x27;t be as good, though...')
