There are sixteen times as many Bangladeshis, Sudanese, and Nigerians as there are Australians. And while Australia’s CO2 emissions are declining even as its economy keeps growing, emissions in Bangladesh are growing exponentially. Australia is a mature economy, while Bangladesh’s is currently doubling every decade, and it has many doublings to go before it reaches middle income status. That will come with huge increases in CO2 emissions.<p>Europe and North America now account for well under 40% of CO2 emissions and their emissions are shrinking: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;annual-co-emissions-by-region" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;annual-co-emissions-by-re...</a>. Emissions in the rest of the world, by contrast, are increasing exponentially. Within a decade or so, India alone will emit more CO2 than the EU.<p>The current CO2 budget for sticking to 1.5C is about 400 gigatons: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbonbrief.org&#x2F;analysis-why-the-ipcc-1-5c-report-expanded-the-carbon-budget" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbonbrief.org&#x2F;analysis-why-the-ipcc-1-5c-repor...</a>. North America and Europe could cut their emissions to zero tomorrow, and the rest of the world will easily blow through that within the next 20 years. China by itself will use up that whole budget by 2050 if not earlier.')
