I ran into issues with two native binaries that come bundled with it:<p>1. An inotify library for detecting file changes. In this case, IntelliJ detected that it didn&#x27;t have a binary for my architecture and just let me know it would be slower. Not a big deal.<p>2. The async profiler[0]. While available for other architectures, only x86_64 binaries are bundled with IntelliJ. And unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t detect this either; it just quietly failed to work.<p>Hopefully with this patch they&#x27;ve also fixed these issues on linux-aarch64.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jvm-profiling-tools&#x2F;async-profiler" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jvm-profiling-tools&#x2F;async-profiler</a>')
