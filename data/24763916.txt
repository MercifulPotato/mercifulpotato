But that knowledge is all based on experiences by others. From the way it talks (and generates poetry) you can tell that it is unable to synthesize new experiences. It can&#x27;t come up with a description (or metaphor) of human experience that it hasn&#x27;t been taught.<p>To be a convincing AI, you don&#x27;t just need to replicate descriptions of experience from memory, but actually have new experiences as well.<p>Meaning that the Chinese room, in order to be able to demonstrate &quot;understanding&quot;, will also require <i>other</i> inputs than just text. Otherwise it <i>can&#x27;t</i> really understand the world, because it only knows about the world from hear-say.')
