Item(by='audunw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611236717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25858395, text='&gt; Criticizing Bitcoin investment for speculation rings hollow when the majority of equity investment is speculation. Very few people invest with the intention of never selling.<p>That&#x27;s true. But there are plenty of investors who are conscious about what the investments are used for AS WELL. I mainly buy stocks in renewables and technology. A big part of that is that I feel like I know enough there to make informed investments that&#x27;ll generate some return. But it&#x27;s also because I want companies making renewable energy solutions to have access to capital, because I believe that what they&#x27;re doing is good for the world. As long as my returns are equal or better than interest in my savings account, I&#x27;m happy.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of people only focusing on pure speculation too. They serve a purpose in making stocks more liquid. But that alone is not the point of the stock market. If it was it&#x27;d be banned by now.<p>This is the main reason why I&#x27;m not buying BitCoin. I don&#x27;t see what good the money I&#x27;m putting in will do in the economy.')
