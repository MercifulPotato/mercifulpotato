I spent 3 hours trying to understand how to compile a patched mainline kernel -- need to learn about dracut, koji, fedpkg, rpmbuild -- and none of these tools are documented clearly on a central, official place, but can be found through googling, reading mailing lists, piecing stuff together from deprecated wiki pages.<p>COPR [2] is interesting, like PPA, with the worst user experience I&#x27;ve ever seen. The patched kernel I was interested about was already compiled by somebody, and available through COPR, but good luck finding which repo has an up-to-date version of the package you&#x27;re interested. The whole Fedora COPR site is more than useless.<p>I mean, the default experience was pretty good, but being the unstable branch of Red Hat means there&#x27;s a lot of breakage, every release changes something big and you&#x27;re constantly on the bleeding edge without the safety net of a top notch wiki like Arch Linux has.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fedoramagazine.org&#x2F;docker-and-fedora-32&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fedoramagazine.org&#x2F;docker-and-fedora-32&#x2F;</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;copr.fedorainfracloud.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;copr.fedorainfracloud.org&#x2F;</a>')
