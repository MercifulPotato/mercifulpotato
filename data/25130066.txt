It&#x27;s not perfect of course, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have many smarts about context (... good and bad.  I can write weird stuff easily, but it also turns &quot;recognition&quot; to &quot;hecognition&quot; like in that screenshot), but it&#x27;s much better than I&#x27;ve been able to get out of other devices.<p>For me, at least some of it is that the pen is more pen-like (&quot;hard&quot; rather than with a tip that depresses), and the sampling rate is much higher than e.g. a Surface.  I have a Surface device and I absolutely can&#x27;t stand writing on it - I have to write huge and slowly and lift a couple mm, or it screws up all over the place.  ipads are dramatically better, but they still sample slower AFAICT, and close many of my &quot;e&quot;s into &quot;c&quot;s and similar loss-of-detail.')
