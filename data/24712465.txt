There are a few that could make sense-- HK to Tokyo? Tokyo to Singapore?<p>The fuel requirements from the US to Asia are pretty intense, so I&#x27;m interested to see how they solve that issue.<p>Sonic booms haven&#x27;t always been illegal in the US (1973?). My dad grew up near O&#x27;hare, and he said you&#x27;d occasionally hear them when it was still a military base.
