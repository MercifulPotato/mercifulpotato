At least he could follow this up with some tweets that educate his audience about how these sorts of agreement &#x2F;should&#x2F; be drafted. But I suspect that he is just a drive-by critic and doesn&#x27;t have any insights into how they should be drafted.<p>And now I feel so snarky.. the man&#x27;s twitter profile says &quot;Old World Breaker&#x2F;New World Creator&quot; .. I could only dream of growing up to be this pretentious!')
