In particular, &quot; and ID that is freely available at no cost to all citizens&quot; is something that many states have failed to provide as part of their voter ID laws.<p>And the context surrounding these laws is relevant, because in many cases the discriminatory intent is plain as day. The assumptions you&#x27;re making about how universal photo ID requirements are in day to day life fall apart when you consider the specific demographics that have been targeted.<p>Taken together with the fact that these voter ID laws notionally address a problem that is only barely more than hypothetical, it&#x27;s impossible to see these laws as anything other than political grandstanding and attempted voter suppression. They are much worse than merely being a solution in search of a problem.<p>It is possible to present the general idea of voter ID requirements as a harmless, well-intended security measureâ€”as your comment attempts. But even the most cursory investigation into the specifics or history of voter ID in the US reveals that it is not harmless, does not solve a real problem, and is backed by malicious intentions. Which is why any &quot;innocent&quot; attempt to support the idea cannot be taken at face value. That well has been poisoned by an overwhelming volume of disingenuous propaganda.')
