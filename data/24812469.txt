It struck me as pretty ludicrous but I won&#x27;t say I wasn&#x27;t tempted.<p>At the time the P100D was the top-end model S, and cost ~Â£100k. It&#x27;s not a car I could realistically afford although I&#x27;m sure finance would have been approved[1], and they would simply have delivered it to my house. Then I could have driven it around for a week and just returned it: a car I had no intention of paying for in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s really not OK, but I imagine quite a few people have done it, so I can see why that might push them to a policy change, especially if baseline returns for other reasons - such as QC issues - were also high.<p>(One day I&#x27;d still really like a Tesla but even if I could afford the one I&#x27;d most want, for that kind of money an Audi RS6 or one of the AMG estates are more practical propositions. And then for about the same money as the Model 3 there&#x27;s the Volvo V60 hybrid, with 398bhp and plenty of load space. I do like Tesla so I really wish they did an estate&#x2F;station wagon. Wagons are extremely handy, especially with AWD, and especially for people like me who often make use of that cargo capacity but hate SUVs and trucks due to their bulk, and overall poor economy and driving dynamics. Still, I can understand that isn&#x27;t the way the market is going - shame though.)<p><i>[0] Honestly, I was also worried I might want to keep it, and would come up with all sorts of justifications as to why it obviously made sense for me to put myself in a hole for a car. I ride motorbikes. I know what it feels like to go from 0 to 60 in less than 2.5 seconds. I don&#x27;t need a Tesla for that, and bikes are a lot cheaper. But I was concerned that in the heat of the moment I might lose that perspective.</i><p><i>[1] I also worry about residual values at the end of any finance deal due to the batteries and, in general, Tesla&#x27;s reputation for dicey quality, high maintenance costs, and less than stellar reliability.</i>')
