A downturn in the urban center could very well mean a boon for other neighborhoods. I&#x27;m imagining a place like Arcata, Ca would become more desirable than living in the Bay Area for a professional, so they move. Sure, it means the coffee shop across the street from their old downtown office closes, and someone in their early 20&#x27;s cant find work in SF. But then that young person moves back to Arcata. They bring their indie band and contribute to the local culture. Having graduated few years later that young person runs into that same professional from across the street, they get around to talking and find a shoe in the door at that same formerly impenetrable wall of glass on the Bay&#x27;s skyline. The downfall of the urban center isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing if it means the economic and cultural boons of city life are spread to other wanting communities.')
