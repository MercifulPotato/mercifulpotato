This the fact. It doesn&#x27;t matter if its a animal or a human. An certainly doesn&#x27;t matter where it happens. You can kill something&#x2F;someone on purpose, by accident or &quot;involuntary on purpose&quot; like in self defense but that doesn&#x27;t change the killing part. You caused the death of something = you killed. Facts are neutral. I&#x27;m not saying chicks should or should not be killed whether inside the egg or outside. All I&#x27;m saying is that it is without any doubt killing, therefore the &quot;no-kill&quot; thing is a lie. Killing an embryo inside a human obviously is killing to. There is a special word for that but that doesn&#x27;t change the facts.<p>Also I assume with &quot;embryo&quot; you meant a &quot;human embryo&quot; so by definition it is already a living human (assuming its not a dead human embryo). Its a living humans it a early development state that we call embryo it will become a living humans fetus and so on unless it dies or gets killed. These are the facts, words have meanings and definitions. Thats why we can not kill SARS-CoV-2 with bleach because by definition viruses are not alive so we can not cause its death)')
