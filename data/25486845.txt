My understanding is that the basic approach for instructions without boundary tagging in L1I$ is to start decoding every byte in the stream in parallel, discard the ones that don&#x27;t make sense, and then later propagate boundary to boundary across the length of the fetch window.  Sort of similar to how a carry-bypass adder works.  This is expensive but not <i>that</i> expensive compared to other structures.<p>But it does mean that x86 designs tend to carefully balance the size of the decoders to other structures to make sure they&#x27;re not the binding constraint too often.  With ARM the approach seems to be more to make the front end 50% bigger than you think you need to be sure it&#x27;s never a problem and refill the front end buffers more quickly after a mispredict.')
