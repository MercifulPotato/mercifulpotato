Universe is hella-old, and really big. Ergo, incredibly rare stuff has happened basically infinitely many times. Life everywhere, etc.<p>Onlyâ€¦it&#x27;s actually not that old, we have some idea how big it is (not that big, just lots of space between atoms), and thanks to computer science, we&#x27;re pretty good at analyzing issues surrounding computation complexity.<p>And as it turns out, the DNA-to-protein pathway is much much much less likely that our initial hand waving made it seem.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it didn&#x27;t happen, I&#x27;m saying <i>with our current level of knowledge</i> we have no idea how. The math based around being old and big doesn&#x27;t work. So we need better math, more studies, etc. and less hand waving.')
