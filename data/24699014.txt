If I&#x27;m asleep or on a plane or something then it could be many hours before I even see an alert, by which time it&#x27;s probably too late. I&#x27;d prefer to be able to set up rules beforehand that <i>prevent</i> an unforeseen bill.<p>If the App Platform doesn&#x27;t have that feature, and it isn&#x27;t planned, that&#x27;s OK but I&#x27;d argue that isn&#x27;t really preventing a surprise bill as the marketing site claims. A warning isn&#x27;t quite the same as prevention.')
