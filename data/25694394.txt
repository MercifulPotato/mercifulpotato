There is no immutable law that SPX needs to keep growing 10%.<p>It has been outpacing GDP because increasingly, production is being concentrated in fewer, larger companies. So right now, they are growing. There are limits to that growth if GDP isn&#x27;t growing as well - there are only so many smaller companies you can put out of business.<p>This - investing into SPX, or VFIAX, or any other market aggregate - is a viable strategy in the face of unlimited growth. It&#x27;s a reasonable mid-term strategy. It&#x27;s entirely unclear that there will be unchecked economic growth for 40 years. In fact, there&#x27;s very good reason to assume there won&#x27;t.<p>As for &quot;get some portion to work higher yields&quot; - those yields carry risk. They&#x27;re not just making you more money, you stand a better chance to lose money, too. Which in turn means much less return, even if you manage to maintain 4%.<p>And to make matters worse, you&#x27;re timing dependent - if you&#x27;d invested $1M in 1999, you would&#x27;ve been back to $1M in 2012. Except, if you&#x27;d lived off it for those 13 years, you&#x27;d be down to half your initial investment, ~$480K.<p>FIRE is a high-risk strategy. I&#x27;m not saying it can&#x27;t work out, but over 40 years, there are a <i>lot</i> of things that can happen, and most FIRE proponents have very small safety margins. The crux is that that doesn&#x27;t seem particularly problematic in your 20s and 30s - worst case, you start again, right? Except &quot;start again&quot; in your 50s, 60s, 70s is a really sucky proposition.<p>Ultimately, everybody takes their own risks, but let&#x27;s not underplay those risks.')
