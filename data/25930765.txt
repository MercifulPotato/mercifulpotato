People like to think of the moment they upgrades from Ikea furniture to something else as a life milestone where they ascend to another social class, and once they have done that they get to look down on the classes that buy Ikea furniture.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s a whole list of supposed justifications, but most people&#x27;s &quot;upgrade&quot; furniture is the same mass-produced crap, but with some marketing to position it as for the class of people who are too good for ikea.  Restoration Hardware and Wayfair are making great money selling people what is essentially Ikea furniture plus a little bit of snobbery.')
