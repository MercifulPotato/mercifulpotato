What we are seeing recently is (mostly) consequence free speech. The trump camp has been able to make blatantly false claims without any accountability (mostly, there are some threats and actual defamation lawsuits now). The bar needs to be relatively high, but I think there needs to be more consequences, especially for public officials, in spreading blatantly false information.<p>We already have this in some places anyways, like courts. Why canâ€™t we apply this more stringently for government officials?')
