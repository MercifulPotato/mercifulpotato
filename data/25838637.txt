Is it possible the people that compose the FBI currently have different morals and viewpoints from the ones from 50 years ago? The organization known as the FBI is just a collection of people, and the members that make it up can change over time, it&#x27;s not an everlasting entity itself. Thus it seems unfair to say&#x2F;imply the FBI is being hypocritical in their message.')
