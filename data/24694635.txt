That&#x27;s what makes people mad.<p>Angular: I agree that angular is not dead, people can still use v1 if they want to. This does not count.<p>Hangouts: the new version has different pricing, different features, different name, different URL, different apps... this absolutely counts (and is one of the most egregious examples)<p>Password checkup: the extension worked fine, but they intentionally disabled it. Any references to it on the web now have to be updated to refer to password checkup in the browser. Anyone who knows how to use the extension has to relearn how to use it in the browser. This counts.<p>Google Photos Print: yes the original was stupid, but it was still a product and is now gone. This counts.<p>Shoelace: yeah this never really launched in the first place. This doesn&#x27;t count.<p>Google Chrome Apps: I mean really? Anything that requires rewriting parts of an app to make it work counts!<p>Dragonfly: this was never released, it doesn&#x27;t count. But it is important that people know about this, it is an example of Google quite blatantly being evil.')
