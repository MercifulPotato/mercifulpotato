When a 3000 sq ft house costs considerably less than your 1 bedroom apartment, you realize that your cost of living didn&#x27;t just drop by more than 20%, but that standard of living went way up.<p>The long-term play from tech companies suddenly going remote is that in 1 year or so, once a sizable portion of the workforce has relocated, the &quot;salary reduction&quot; to move out, will become a &quot;salary enhancement&quot; to live in SF. Then the conversation will be &quot;Look Matt, it really doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay you a premium just because you want to work SF. If you want to stay that&#x27;s fine, but we&#x27;ll be downgrading your pay to meet company standards.&quot;')
