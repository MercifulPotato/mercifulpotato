But as publisher it&#x27;s their right, and within their interest, to enforce it.  It&#x27;s not up to studios to unilaterally change it.<p>On Dec 13th, CPDR issued the tweet&#x2F;statement, &quot;For copies purchased digitally, please use the refund system of PSN or Xbox respectively.&quot;[0]<p>The next day at an investor call, investors asked them if they had a special refund agreement with Sony and Microsoft. They said they didn&#x27;t. [1]<p>Then the next public statement from either was Sony saying it&#x27;s removed.  The next statement from CPDR was to investors but was leaked, essentially saying they met with Sony and Sony told them it was being removed.[2] Oh, to  be a fly  on the wall for that meeting.<p>Microsoft has also said full refunds  for anyone who  requests, matching Sony.[3]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;CyberpunkGame&#x2F;status&#x2F;1338390123373801472&#x2F;photo&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;CyberpunkGame&#x2F;status&#x2F;1338390123373801472...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdprojekt.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads-en&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;call-transcript_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdprojekt.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads-en&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;c...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bankier.pl&#x2F;wiadomosc&#x2F;CD-PROJEKT-SA-Czasowe-wstrzymanie-dostepnosci-gry-Cyberpunk-2077-w-PlayStation-Store-8023177.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bankier.pl&#x2F;wiadomosc&#x2F;CD-PROJEKT-SA-Czasowe-wstrz...</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;XboxSupport&#x2F;status&#x2F;1339983452255498240" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;XboxSupport&#x2F;status&#x2F;1339983452255498240</a>')
