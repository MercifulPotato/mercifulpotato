Ok, TCP congestion control. What is congestion control?<p>- Why is congestion control important?<p>- What (types of) solutions exist?<p>- Why do we want to obtain a census of the solutions in the field?<p>- How have prior ones been obtained?<p>- How are IETF decisions guided&#x2F;impacted by these results?<p>I understand that these introductions are often annoying to write (and they are not appropriate for a presentation held among peers that all mostly know the answers to the above), but maybe someone could provide a quick summary so that laypeople like me can approach this publication? Or maybe there actually is an associated paper?')
