I get nearly zero bugs filed when people port it to esoteric platforms.<p>When randomly searching a while back, I found a blog post someone wrote about getting my project running on Arduino [1], something I had never tried. Turns out they just had to set some configuration flags and everything worked fine. They therefore filed zero bugs, and it resulted in zero activity for my project. They didn&#x27;t even tell me about it!<p>I was extremely pleased that it worked of course, but disappointed that my project continues to look like it&#x27;s dead. I imagine Google&#x27;s criticality score for my project is near zero.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thingforward.io&#x2F;techblog&#x2F;2017-08-03-compiling-ludocodempack-messagepack-for-arduino-avr.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thingforward.io&#x2F;techblog&#x2F;2017-08-03-compiling-lu...</a>')
