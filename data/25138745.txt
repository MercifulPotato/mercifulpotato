Portability can be describing compilation or evaluation&#x2F;interpretation.<p>Take your python example, you don&#x27;t just need the interpreter.  You also need any supporting infrastructure that the libraries used will need.  As a trite example, anything that reads from a camera will need a camera available to work.  Indeed, some will need specific cameras, if they don&#x27;t have a portability later.  :)<p>As such, portable goes across many layers and cannot be described at just the language level.  Not even at a runtime level.')
