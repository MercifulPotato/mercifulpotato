Item(by='beagle3', descendants=None, kids=[24651029], score=None, time=1601560693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24650729, text='Weird.<p>1) When I grew up, multiplication and the letter X were styled very differently in books so that that was never ever a confusion.<p>2) The switch to dot, was NOT to avoid ambiguity, but to shorten stuff (IIRC we did that when we learned order of operations and started solving simple equations - writing &quot;4 (dot) a&quot; instaed of &quot;4 (cross) a&quot; -- and then just &quot;4a&quot; but multiplications still appear often among parentheses - they were not ALL replaced with dot.<p>3) That&#x27;s simply wrong. It is a different operation; dot product reduces to multiplication among scalars -- but so does cross product. It&#x27;s okay to denote scalar product with either.<p>Granted, this might be dependent on the exact curriculum one studies through - but mine did NOT have a simplified one that was replaced - instead, it started with the most explicit one, and got simplified (with new, compatible notation that did not replace older one, only extended it) through the years. And it seems this was almost the case for you too.')
