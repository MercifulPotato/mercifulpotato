Voters can be asked for an ordinal preference order or for approval. 99% of voters have these and can explain their choices (which isn&#x27;t to say their choices are necessarily logical&#x2F;rational).<p>Voters do not as a rule have a mathematical score for a candidate, excluding the case where they score equivalently to Approval.<p>Take a candidate which you did not vote for but do not hate, is your score for the candidate 1, 2 or 3.141529? Can you give an explanation for your score and why it is that exact value and not a bit higher or lower?<p>Asking people for information they do not have (a mathematical score for each candidate) leads to GIGO - unless just about everyone does Approval, in which case Score&#x27;s just a more complicated, worse version of Approval.')
