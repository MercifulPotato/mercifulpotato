Outside of Florida, their votes do not make Hispanic votes in general swing toward republicans.<p>Hispanic votes for republicans may have increased this year, but they are still absolutely nowhere near 50&#x2F;50.<p>My understanding of the Epoch Times is that it&#x27;s run by anti-CCP Chinese, and not very representative of Asians in general.<p>Listing single individuals is not relevant when the topic is how a community votes.')
