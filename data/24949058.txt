Item(by='kmill', descendants=None, kids=[24949127, 24949129], score=None, time=1604117207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24948513, text='I&#x27;ve had lots of fun experimenting with JI, but I think you&#x27;re greatly understating the difficulty of using a scale like that for conventional music! Basic chords (like ii) are horribly out of tune due to the syntonic comma, and while you can retune things as you go (like a singer or string player would), it takes a lot of finesse -- the IV ii V I progression is tricky, and if you&#x27;re not careful you create a comma pump, transposing things down just a little bit by the end.<p>In practice, 5&#x2F;4 major thirds are at the very low end of acceptible major thirds, with the Pythagorean 81&#x2F;64 at the top. I find slightly sharper major thirds to sounds better generally [for western common practice harmony].<p>An interesting system, which I wish I&#x27;ve had more time experimenting with before suggesting it, is 55EDO, using a system where each whole tone is broken into nine equal parts; a five part interval is a major semitone and a four part interval a minor semitone. The major scale is made from whole tones and two major semitones. A C# is slightly flatter than a Db in this system, and you only have to worry about enharmonics (old meaning: futzing with the small distances between similar pitches) in complicated chord progressions.<p>Not suggesting not to try JI of course, I&#x27;d recommend experimenting with it (including the suggested 7-limit JI as well)!  Scales in the end can only be judged in the context of what you want to do with them -- they certainly all have tradeoffs.')
