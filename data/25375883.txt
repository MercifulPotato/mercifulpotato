IMO it&#x27;s really not worth it to get so tied up in a single companies tooling even if the developer experience is superficially nicer. C++ has all sorts of awful, but it&#x27;s familiar awful with mature tooling.<p>Admittedly the things I&#x27;ve worked on has been games and CAD systems so the internal data models and simulation are a lot more complicated than the UI, but I think that holds for a lot of apps.')
