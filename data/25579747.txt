In fact, it&#x27;s a US Federal government specific problem.<p>If you push responsibility from the Federal government to the states, each state has to work it out themselves. While the US is a republic of 50 states, there are some times where &quot;states rights&quot; should require them to work co-operatively to establish a standard for all 50 states.<p>The current administration, throughout the entire pandemic, has abdicated its responsibility to co-ordinate this. The fact that states were forming their own co-operative approaches (see NY&#x2F;NJ&#x2F;CT et al) demonstrates the issue.<p>Basically, the current administration castrated the CDC from performing its function, with political interference in what the CDC did and what the CDC announced.<p>The current vaccine distribution is effectively &quot;wholesale&quot; with 50 retailers and then the Federal government abdicates any further responsibility.')
