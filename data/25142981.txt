This one doesn&#x27;t clearly address the business value questions of one framework over the other. A startup that needs to build and sell a product shouldn&#x27;t care if a project is backed by Facebook (and if they do, seriously, what are they doing?). And some of the arguments are shallow and off base, like &quot;everything being JS,&quot; that wouldn&#x27;t be useful to any company actually wanting to make this comparison.<p>This is NOT a blog post I would use to assess these two libraries for a startup.')
