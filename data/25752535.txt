When we started using MS Teams, it worked really well to replace person to person chats, email etc..<p>But since it&#x27;s become commonplace, it&#x27;s become a crapbucket of stuff that I can&#x27;t find anything back in. I have too many channels, too many teams (and you can&#x27;t opt in to channels like you can on Slack, you have to join them all). And the search function is even worse than Outlook&#x27;s. It&#x27;s all just too unstructured. Even if I search for someone&#x27;s name plus a keyword I know it&#x27;s there it can&#x27;t find it back for me.<p>Such an app (not just Teams) is just not the right tool for everything related to communication, even though Microsoft is pushing it as exactly that.<p>A forum though is too &#x27;2000&#x27; for me. I would see more in a managed wiki, provided people can stomach working in a structured way. Enforcing that will be an issue but it will result in a beautiful oracle of information. I&#x27;ve seen it happen before (and I&#x27;ve seen it fail many more times, sadly).')
