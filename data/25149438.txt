Yes the benchmark numbers for the M1 are impressive, but I am curious to see non-benchmark, real-world workloads compared.  I&#x27;m reminded of a YouTube video (link below) in which the comparison was made between an $11,000 Mac Pro and a PC kit that also cost $11,000.  In this case the PC was rocking a Ryzen chip with 32 (or was it 64?) cores and smoked the Mac Pro on every benchmark.  But when comparing comparable workloads, like doing a final render on a large video project using Final Cut Pro on the Mac and Premiere Pro on the PC, the Mac Pro did narrowly edge the PC.  So I would be interested in seeing the M1 MBP do side-by-side, real-life workload tests like final-rendering a large video project, compiling a multi-gigabyte XCode project, applying a complex set of filters to an image, etc.  Benchmarking is nice to an extent but I think lacks real-world significance in this context.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jzT0-t-7-PA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jzT0-t-7-PA</a>')
