Realistically a 100 dollar graphics card would&#x27;ve sufficed for my usage (development). So it could&#x27;ve been built for $2400.<p>Depending on the context such a machine could be very cheap or very expensive, but even here in Mexico that&#x27;s about one month of an engineer&#x27;s salary, which I don&#x27;t find too outrageous for a primary tool which lasts for years.<p>Depending on your workload, the performance improvements could be very noticeable (running multiple VMs, compiling, and unit testing at the same time). It does open up faster workflows if you adjust to the new speed.')
