It made the front page here a while back (not posted by me), and it&#x27;s relevant here: you pay a one-time payment for permanent storage -- that&#x27;s right, your stuff will stay right there even if you&#x27;re &quot;inactive for 2 years&quot;.<p>(Disclosure: My company does some consulting work for Permanent.  When I received the notice today from Google of their storage policy change, I realized that the reason it sounded weird to me was that I&#x27;d gotten accustomed to Permanent&#x27;s model.)')
