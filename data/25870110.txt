That means they can’t be considered currencies, he said.<p>Yet the example of the central bank managed currencies is an exercise in constant inflation of the money supply. If Donovan&#x27;s observation were accurate, how can he explain humanity&#x27;s long history with monetary metals. Gold and silver are still regarded by some as the only legitimate forms of money.<p>Overbearing regulations are driving the use of cryptocurrency. Artificially low interest rates are driving speculation. Rampant money supply inflation is driving people to seek other ways to save.<p>It is almost as if this author is completely disconnected from reality. Legal tender laws, Gresham&#x27;s law and the cumbersome nature of many cryptocurrencies have more bearing on the currency people choose to transact with everyday.')
