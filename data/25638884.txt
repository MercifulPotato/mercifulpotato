Item(by='bachmeier', descendants=None, kids=[25640508, 25639756], score=None, time=1609797892, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25637922, text='Completely different type of work, but I once quit a new job at a factory after two days. First day, I arrive early to fill out the paperwork and watch the HR job safety video. Video finishes and I wait for the HR person to return. After a few minutes, I go look for her, but can&#x27;t find her so I go back to the video room.<p>Eventually someone else (upset) comes in and tells me that I&#x27;m supposed to be working rather than sitting there. I tell him I&#x27;m waiting for the HR lady to come back. &quot;She went home for the day.&quot; Okay, I have no idea what I&#x27;m supposed to be doing. Guy gets even more upset, takes me to the back room, points at one of the other workers, tells me to do what he&#x27;s doing, and then I never see him again.<p>The only time anyone talks to me is (a) to tell me every couple hours I&#x27;m doing something wrong, (b) tell me it&#x27;s break time, and (c) to shout at me for coming back from break two minutes early. (c) was my supervisor, and that was the only contact I had with him. When the second day was just like the first, I decided I didn&#x27;t need that job.')
