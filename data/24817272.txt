You learn and try to never repeat it. And share with others so hopefully they learn.<p>Ps. Don&#x27;t do knee-jerk late at night quick patches. For example don&#x27;t stop a database that has run out of disk space, try to migrate the data in memory first... And also do proper backup monitoring, and restores. Having 30 days of 0 byte backups is not that helpful. :)')
