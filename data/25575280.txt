I usually make a small point-form plan on a piece of paper, then go for a walk with the voice recorder. The act of walking seems to help a lot (see related [1] about that).<p>I&#x27;ve tried text-to-speech options, but what I find works best is to transcribe the audio myself (usually playback at 0.7x), since during the transcription process I can cleanup and improve the thoughts.<p>Honestly, without this trick I could have never been able to write books. The technical details and explanations are pretty standard (math books all have to cover the same topics), but the extra, intuition,  context, intros, and &quot;lead out&quot; text in conclusion&#x2F;discussion sections are super important to tie it all together, and these parts specifically come out much better when created using the spoken-then-transcribed since the tone comes out more conversational.<p>Try writing your next blog post through diction, you will see it&#x27;s great!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25543656" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25543656</a>')
