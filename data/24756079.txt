I haven&#x27;t used it in *monthts. But when I need it, it&#x27;s there. There&#x27;s car rental place about 500 meters walking distance from my home, but they aren&#x27;t open 24&#x2F;7. There is also a ride share car parked at about 1km from my home, but it&#x27;s only one car and if someone else took it I can&#x27;t use it.<p>These things only work when you know well in advance you&#x27;re going to use it and even then, they might not be available at peak times. There&#x27;s only so many ride share cars available, and if everyone wants to visit their parents on Christmas, there&#x27;s not enough of them. Car rental companies aren&#x27;t going to buy enough cars to cover their 5% peak use either.')
