It really opened my eyes and convinced me that, regardless of the cost, an ergonomic working environment is worth every penny.<p>So fast forward about two decades ... and I finally bought my first ergonomic chair...<p>It&#x27;s stunning how stubborn we can be, even when we know for certain that something is good for us.  I don&#x27;t even know why I put it off for so long.<p>All I can really say is, don&#x27;t be me.  Listen to comments like the one I&#x27;m replying to.  Get good equipment.  Your body will thank you later.<p>P.S. Self Rant: I was gonna write that the reason I put it off so long is that $1000 for a chair is a big number no matter how much I may believe in its benefit ... but then, the chair I ended up buying was like $500, delivered, with all the upgrades, because it was remanufactured and on a black friday sale.  Why didn&#x27;t I buy one sooner!? The hell is wrong with me?')
