You&#x27;ve got all the classic story tropes there (intra-&#x2F;inter-team rivalries, underdog&#x2F;favorite, hotshot newcomer&#x2F;grizzled veteran, rich vs poor, etc.)<p>- People are inherently intrigued by man + machine collaborations, kids too. I didn&#x27;t appreciate this until I hung around my friends&#x27; kids, and saw their amazement at any moving vehicle. Then I remembered, yes, I was once one of those kids.<p>With that said, I think F1 as a motorsport is pretty boring.<p>- If you&#x27;re in it for the racing, I&#x27;d rather watch Indycar, which has the same or better racing with open-wheeled cars at 1&#x2F;10th the price.<p>- If you&#x27;re in it to see car technology translate to your road car, probably should watch a GT series instead.<p>- If you&#x27;re in it for the technological innovation, none of those things get shared to viewers. As a data person, I would love to see how the sausage gets made, like how they translate learnings from the simulator to the real track, or the the trial &amp; error in tweaking their aero or engine configs, CFD, etc. But for obvious sporting reasons, they can&#x27;t. Like you can notice that Mclaren&#x27;s nose is different, you just don&#x27;t know why. Knowing why is the more interesting part IMO.')
