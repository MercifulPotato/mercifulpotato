Item(by='helen___keller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605199963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25068820, text='Ironically, despite how this article is both patently fictional and fairly dystopian, several of the premises actually do apply to me and many others: I own no house, no car, no appliances.<p>But no, rent isn&#x27;t free, I pay through the nose to live in a location where it&#x27;s possible to rely on transit (in non pandemic times, anyways). And I do hard work to pay that rent, I&#x27;m not sure what business meetings I could illegally sublet out my tiny living room to fetch over $3000 per month.<p>I do get things delivered, quite often (groceries weekly and sometimes restaurant meals). It&#x27;s absurdly expensive and once the pandemic is over I plan to cut the deliveries out of my life as much as I can (I cancelled prime in January and resubscribed in March, oops!)')
