It&#x27;s biggest claim to fame is that it produced the plutonium used in Fat Man, the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.<p>The problems there aren&#x27;t due to the normal radioactive waste produced in nuclear power plants, rather it&#x27;s due to the various materials used in weapons production and general nuclear research being mixed together in waste tanks.<p>While the waste from operating nuclear power plants certainly isn&#x27;t minimal, these days we can at least store it safely.  Of course, as Fukushima showed, us, there have been very bad assumptions made about the types of disasters nuclear power plants might face.')
