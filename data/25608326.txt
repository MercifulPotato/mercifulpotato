There are whole worlds of fantastic experience that this type of viewpoint is holding you back from experiencing.<p>Life can be very rough. It&#x27;s certainly not fair, that&#x27;s for sure. But there are many more possibilities and new perspectives waiting to be discovered and explored.<p>We are limited by our current frame of mind and past experience. If we strive to continually break through these barriers, we will never stop surprising ourselves at what we find and learn. The universe is a vast and incredible place.
