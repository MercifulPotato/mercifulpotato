The only thing they have in common is that theyre open source projects controlled by for-profit entities. The moment cooperation is no longer in their best interest they will stop.<p>In elastics case they were between a rock and a hard place. The world changed around that project and they got sherlocked. It happens. AWS has done it so many times its shocking they didnt anticipate it in the first place. Being venture backed sours the batch a lot faster.<p>The CentOS issue is unique. The maintainers gave control to the company that owned the <i>licensed</i> distribution of the software. Did they get a whole promise in return? Of course theyll cut support for it. Even in IBMs own portfolio its a conflict on a balance sheet alone. But its not the fault of enterprise open source. Open source works in this situation: there <i>will</i> be a fork just like centos was a fork of redhat.')
