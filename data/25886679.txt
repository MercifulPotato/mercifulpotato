Most people think black holes are 3D spheres, but they&#x27;re really 2D surfaces to their &quot;inhabitants&quot;.<p>I think that is more complicated. From what Susskind explains, the current understanding is that black holes have a dual nature, similarly to the idea of wave&#x2F;particle duality. Specifically, you can perform experiments that would see the event horizon of the black hole as a 2D surface which emits Hawking radiation; and you can perform experiments which will show the event horizon of the black hole is a completely unremarkable region of space. Importantly though, there is no way for an observer to notice both results, so there is no contradiction. The black hole is 1 thing to some observers, and 1 different thing to other observers, and the two can&#x27;t even communicate.<p>Even more specifically, to an observer that will never cross the event horizon, the event horizon is a surface emitting Hawking radiation. For an observer approaching and passing the event horizon, the event horizon emits no radiation and is a completely unremarkable region of space-time. The two observers of course can&#x27;t communicate, as the observer crossing the event horizon will never be able to send a signal outside again, and conversely, a signal sent from outside after they crossed the horizon will never reach them.<p>I would also note that our current theories do not permit any kind of structure to exist &quot;inside&quot; a black hole, which is a 0-volume point. If you mean &quot;inside the radius of the event horizon of a black hole&quot;, I believe matter would be observed falling quickly towards the center. A theory of quantum gravity may give us some idea of the structure of a black hole, but I personally doubt that it could be allowed to contain another universe.')
