Item(by='wpietri', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605637725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25124764, text='&gt;  I have to laugh when you say its replacing email.<p>Laugh all you like, but kids and the interns I&#x27;ve chatted with see email as something akin to how I feel about fax machines: not something they&#x27;d use by choice, but necessary for historical reasons. When I&#x27;ve been at organizations during a Slack adoption, email volume drops hugely; 50-80%, I&#x27;d guess. I&#x27;ve closed most of the mailing lists I used to run because they shifted to mediums better suited. Just this morning I had to FB message a few friends to get their current email addresses, which tells me a lot about who&#x27;s winning.<p>Yes, I agree there are times you don&#x27;t want things unsent. And there are times you do. There are a variety of ways to balance these concerns. But exactly none of them involves saying, &quot;Lo it was handed down to us by Postel the Wise, and none shall tamper with His choices.&quot;<p>Asking to unsend an email is a reasonable request. The answer could be yes or no given the circumstances, but it&#x27;s only an absurd question to people who have taken a 1980s technological choice and treat it as some sort of unalterable gospel. It reminds me of this Douglas Adams quote:<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies: 1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. 2. Anything that&#x27;s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. 3. Anything invented after you&#x27;re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.&quot;<p>Sure, I get that a lot of people were born after RFC 822, so it seems like the natural order. But the people who wrote the early RFCs weren&#x27;t thinking that way, and neither should we.')
