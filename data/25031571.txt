Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25031586, 25032779, 25034567, 25031622], score=None, time=1604897586, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25031443, text='&gt; With no shred evidence of voter fraud at any level<p>I feel like this is actually the most suspicious thing here. In a country of over 300 million, in one of the most contentious elections in living memory, <i>not one person</i> was found to have committed voter fraud? It seems more likely that we&#x27;re just terrible at detecting voter fraud rather than that there were literally zero instances of voter fraud anywhere.<p>Which implies we might need some better measures to detect it. The thing they were trying to do with dead voters is promising but has the obvious problem that there could have been legitimate ballots submitted, or unintentionally illegitimate ballots, if the death was recent etc. But the general idea seems to hold. Maybe we should add a few percent fictitious entries to the voter rolls and then see if any of them votes next time.<p>Anybody have any good ideas for how we could be detecting this, if it&#x27;s happening?<p>If it isn&#x27;t happening then having some measures in place like this would be good to point to as affirmative evidence that it isn&#x27;t rather than merely the absence of evidence that it is. And if it is happening, it would be good to know that too.')
