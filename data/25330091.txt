Item(by='lovehashbrowns', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607326356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25329704, text='&gt; Yes and no, I think if you build a quality product, people will try it, and if it works and is delightful, they&#x27;ll come back. Look at TikTok.<p>TikTok is different because you can work on maintaining an audience on something like Instagram and also at the same time try to build an audience on TikTok, even if their social networks are different.<p>If you are in a contract with Twitch, you cannot stream anywhere else. You are either staying on Twitch and your uses are staying where they are used to the community, or you go to another platform with a different community, different chat and chat emotes, different subscription system, etc.<p>What I often see cited from people not wanting to leave Twitch is the Twitch emotes and the way chat works on Twitch.<p>For example, Facebook isn&#x27;t anonymous so chat tends to be more serious and less meme-y.<p>Youtube has a far superior player with live rewind, takes less computer resources, and has access to far more viewers than Twitch; but it has an inferior chat with no Twitch emotes. So Twitch viewers are reluctant to make the switch full-time.<p>That said, YouTube has the best chance to take out Twitch. Google just needs to make a better chat and improve discoverability. Twitch streamers that switch to YouTube, either by choice or by force, can still make a living there.<p>To add: I know of one streamer that streams on Facebook for their income and streams on Twitch to maintain their old community there and to hopefully take more viewers to Facebook. But they are not gaining income from Twitch because they are not under contract. And that is a grind. It&#x27;s not something for the average person.')
