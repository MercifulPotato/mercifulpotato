Parler was a no-censorship social site, open to everyone. Extreme right-wing people flocked to it while very few people with other perspectives did. Parler being a hate site was not purely of their making, but rather a result of society&#x27;s bias toward silencing opposing views. We need more people like Daryl Davis (a black jass musician who has converted hundreds of KKK members through kindness and friendship and music) so that censorship seems less and less like a good idea.<p>I&#x27;m not surprised at the end result, but the effort to retain free speech was a valiant one. Forcing extremist views underground doesn&#x27;t silence them, it emboldens them and makes it harder to know what they&#x27;re up to. Not a good idea.')
