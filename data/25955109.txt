If stuff is being &#x27;drowned out&#x27; its because your trying to read all 500 pages of reviews?<p>To me, a much bigger problem is the fact that reviews on amazon are for totally different products then whats being sold (Sellers &#x27;recycle&#x27; pages and change the product being sold - allowing them to keep the reviews and ratings)<p>So basically - I have to read the reviews &#x27;most recent&#x27; first anyway..')
