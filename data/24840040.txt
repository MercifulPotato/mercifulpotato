It was tied to the OS.<p>A big feature of how chrome, firefox, and edge work today is that everyone updates to the latest version usually within days of their releases.<p>IE6 was still in use when IE7, IE8, and IE9 had been deployed for years with better rendering, CSS, and javascript support.  Primarily because a lot of websites and internal applications had stupid things like &quot;activex&quot; plugins required for proper usage.<p>To say that chrome is the new IE6 really misses out on how horrible the internet was during the heyday of IE6.  It&#x27;s fairly hard to come up with a website that works well in Chrome and not so well in Firefox.  Unless you are pulling out brand new CSS or JS features, you are very likely to get relatively consistent rendering between the two.')
