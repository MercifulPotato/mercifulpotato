I actually felt it. You should write a novel, lol.<p>Life priorities change, and it&#x27;s precisely due to time commitments, as you said. I wish more people at my age understood that. Tech time is infinite, you can dedicate a lifetime to it and not be done (look at Stallman). Personally, I&#x27;ve found that while I enjoyed some of it for personal interest, most of it was dictated by corporations. That mobile app you wanted to make? Gotta deal with Apple&#x27;s $90 yearly developer fee and have a mac to deploy (or deal with ugly expo). Work wants you to learn a new framework? Okay, do it but we&#x27;ve got a deadline in two weeks, so hurry up and learn it after work. Want a pay bump because you got lowballed and found out a newgrad was making the same as you with 5 yrs of experience under your belt? Study leetcode only to be lowballed by another company or have an even worse work-life culture.<p>I&#x27;ve found personal connections have always been a source of happiness to me; to this day I&#x27;ve fond memories of people I&#x27;ve been friends with since middle school, and I expect to have them when I die. Tech isn&#x27;t everything, and with the way things are going, can be detrimental to your mental and physical health. Live like a Stallman&#x2F;Carmack if it suits you, but most importantly, focus on you and your happiness! Time is a limited resource. Most people understand it more as they age (like me), but if you are one of the lucky ones who understood this early, I think you can make the most out of life!')
