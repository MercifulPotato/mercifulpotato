I live in a country with stronger social systems and there are countless interests that keep the pay as low as possible. You would not find a single person that says that nursing isn&#x27;t important.<p>As I said, you if you want to have a tech job, you currently almost can choose where to work. Men and women alike, so I cannot see that many barriers.<p>I don&#x27;t buy into the prestige argument at all, it feels far removed from reality. I didn&#x27;t pick my profession because of prestige and I don&#x27;t think many people do. This isn&#x27;t the showbusiness. Do you know what people with strong affinity to tech were called? Nerds. The good payrate is very recent, as are the gender discussions btw.')
