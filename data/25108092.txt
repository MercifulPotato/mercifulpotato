The moment you try to fact-check one person, you open a very large can of worms and become responsible for fact-checking everyone. Information is cheap and people post correct and incorrect facts all the time. Censorship does not scale.<p>The world is a dangerous place and it&#x27;s more scalable to teach future generations that they&#x27;ll run into good and bad information and that they should make decisions for themselves. Trying to censor all of the &quot;bad&quot; stuff is a huge can of worms and is not something huge platforms should even try to be doing. Let the mirror be black, and teach people how to scrub the dirt off.<p>When in doubt, err on the side of higher user agency.')
