Put it in no uncertain terms.<p>It always boils down to &quot;doing something I agree with&quot;, defining any perceived violation of ultimate personal freedom as aggression, leading to any retaliation to be &quot;justified&quot; as self defense, which is utterly morally bereft.<p>The pure and simple truth is that a society based solely on voluntary interaction is no society at all. Along with the benefits of being part of a society, there will always be obligations. You can act as if that doesn&#x27;t apply to you, but someone always has to pick up the bill or do the work and you can&#x27;t count on there always being a volunteer.<p>Libertarianism is a pie-in-the-sky utopian thought experiment ideology.')
