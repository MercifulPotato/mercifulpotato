I have 150TB (I am not average) and the max drive size I have is 8TB right now. Similarly, I&#x27;m about to set my dad up with a Synology which I&#x27;ll be putting 3x8TB for 16TB usable. I even offered to put in 16&#x27;s but he didn&#x27;t need the space and didn&#x27;t want to pay the extra to get it (especially since he can upgrade later if desired)')
