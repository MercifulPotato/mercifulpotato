But once an eel reaches the Sargasso Sea, it has, once again, found its way home. Under swirling blankets of seaweed, its eggs are fertilized. And with that, the eel is done, its story complete, and it dies.<p>I know this should be read more as poetry, but the existential resolve can be explained perfectly well: if an eel lacks it, it will never reproduce and its genes will be lost. Thus, only genes which guarantee that resolve are left in the pool.')
