There was no contraction in what I <i>meant</i>, but I didn&#x27;t express what I meant correctly.<p>They don&#x27;t conflict if the seasoning is already damaged (during cooking) before cleaning it. Cleaning with soap would not repair it at all (thus, reseasoning is required), whereas if you don&#x27;t use soap, the pan is reseasoned in the same step as drying it on the stove.<p>Part of the problem was that I was overloading the word &quot;reseasoning&quot; to also refer to doing it in an explicit step (ie, the wiping on&#x2F;off of oil) as well as the effect of rebuilding the layer of seasoning.<p>I&#x27;ve edited my post to hopefully be more clear.')
