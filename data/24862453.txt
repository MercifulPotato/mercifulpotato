For growth, capital tax rate shouldn&#x27;t affect you at all, since you&#x27;ll mostly target companies running at close to no revenue or even declaring losses, but growing very fast.<p>For dividend investment, it would, since the companies will have less profit post tax, but if you think about it holistically, that&#x27;s like the best thing to tax. You have a well established business, that&#x27;s no longer growing or doing so very slowly, and it is making excess money even after paying all its employees and expenses. It seems a very good place to take from and redistribute.<p>Think about the alternative sources of revenue for the government here? What could be better then that?')
