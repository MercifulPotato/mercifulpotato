Item(by='bmhin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602696932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24778536, text='&gt;  Inter-season gaps are bad enough in broadcast, but with season-bingeing they extend to &gt;11 months and that&#x27;s just not very attractive.<p>It&#x27;s also a completely different time frame for the binged show.  A weekly released 10 episode season that would have occupied your mental space for around two and half months before returning nine and half months later might now be something you engaged with for just two days before not thinking about it for a year.<p>There&#x27;s a reason so many streaming shows need to have season recaps, because in the year or two it takes for the next season you&#x27;ve completely lost all the story beats.  As you mentioned, I find myself wanting to rewatch the previous season(s) before a new one kicks off, but that becomes really onerous with 10+ hours per season.')
