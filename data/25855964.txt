Item(by='Caligatio', descendants=None, kids=[25856043], score=None, time=1611208744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25855455, text='I feel like distributing the non-free firmware on the installation media but only installing it with user confirmation (they can even have a short pop-up disclaimer about non-free software) is an easy compromise. The open source purists still end up with an install free of non-free software and those that need non-free software can successfully use Debian. Giving people the freedom of (easy) choice to install non-free software does not infringe on others&#x27; desire for a completely FOSS OS.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t frame this as an &quot;obsession&quot; with user conversion or retention; this is literally just making a product usable by a majority (I think?) of laptop users.')
