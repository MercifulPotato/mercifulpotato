It&#x27;s a lot more cost effective to amplify downstream than upstream, especially when most use cases are heavily asymmetric.<p>(I&#x27;d expect that only in the past year or so has upstream been a lot more heavily utilized, what with massively increased work-from-home due to the pandemic. Before then, the primary stressors of the network were things like streaming 4k60 video.<p>And I&#x27;ll be very surprised if any ISPs thought torrent uploads to be a use case worth optimizing for.)')
