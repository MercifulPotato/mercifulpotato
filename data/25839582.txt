Her TikTok channel? Her Twitter page?</i><p>Is this something we should care about though? I understand why individuals care about engagement, but why should society care that Taylor Swift gets more views on TikTok vs her personal website? If you think we should care about it, what about all the people that get essentially zero engagement despite having access to those platforms and having something worthwhile to share?')
