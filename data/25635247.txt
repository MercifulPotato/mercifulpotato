E.g. why not invest in amber, it&#x27;s probably one of the rarest things in the universe<p>and tons of other things are invested into: precious metals, commodities, etc. bitcoin is the first <i>digital</i> commodity, which can&#x27;t be inlated by some centralized authority.<p>&gt; is there ANY inherent guarantee<p>yes, bitcoin transaction is finite and irreversible as soon as signature is published via any possible information channel and sufficient number of blocks are found on top of the one that includes the transaction. you can morse-code it into ionosphere to be picked up by the receiver or you can flashlight it across north korean border, no internet required.<p>US regulation may prevent you from interacting within US jurisdiction, but that&#x27;s a different issue and precludes bitcoin being money about as much as US ban of certain drugs precludes them from getting people high.')
