Those aren&#x27;t relevant to my case, I live alone (which makes the loneliness worse).<p>Yes, kids needing to do school from home requires a lot of time and effort, my co-workers are struggling to get their work completed because of it. I&#x27;ve taken over some of their tasks to help them out.<p>Also if you are permanent WFH (which I am since I switched jobs in May), you set up your work environment differently. I rented a 2 bed room apartment so that I would have an &quot;office&quot; that I could close at the end of the day. If you live in the Bay Area generally you rent a shoe box of a place because you spend most of the time at work, that is not longer the case.')
