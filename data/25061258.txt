The guy from the Fat Head documentary showed that you can lose weight and become healthier on an all-McDonalds diet.<p>Also, the food pyramid (which, admittedly, is so incorrect that it should cause you to question any healthcare professional who quotes it) does include a small layer for fat, oil, sugar, and sweets, implying you can have them as an occasional treat but not all the time. No doctor is going to tell you to <i>never</i> eat at McDonalds, only to make it a rare treat.')
