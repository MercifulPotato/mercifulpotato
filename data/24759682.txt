There is a probabilistic value of pursuing those doors and a cost to the time spent doing so, and it&#x27;s fine to decide it is or isn&#x27;t worth it. I&#x27;d happily do side projects even if there was zero chance they&#x27;d help my career.<p>Two of the best engineers I&#x27;ve ever worked with did basically nothing on the side that resembled a technical side project. The worst engineer I ever worked with also did no side projects. And I knew brilliant engineers who were big into things like the Hacker Cup or aerial robotics, just for fun. It&#x27;s tempting to think that if we ourselves are competent, people who act similarly must also be competent. But the longer my career goes on, the less weight I place on seeing someone does or does not do side projects.')
