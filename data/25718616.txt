Item(by='bch', descendants=None, kids=[25718707], score=None, time=1610306950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25716014, text='&gt; You really shouldn&#x27;t buy a special oil just [for] seasoning your cast iron and carbon steel. It&#x27;s not necessary. Pick an oil with a high smoke point, a neutral taste, and plenty of easy availability. That&#x27;s often peanut. Avocado is great if you&#x27;re fancy.\nKeep a squirt bottle of oil on hand and make sure you&#x27;re using enough.<p>&gt; I had friends dedicate years to flax seed oil. They&#x27;re not happy about it, as they&#x27;ve got flaking to deal with.<p>I happen to have bought some flax oil specifically for seasoning my cast iron - you’re saying it’s <i>contraindicated</i> though? (So “you don’t need special oil, but _especially_ not these” (leaving only peanut and avocado))?<p>For the amount of times the word “science” is dropped there’s still a good amount of myth and legend associated with owning cast iron. Short of having my own double blind statically significant study and perhaps a microscope to observe the polymerization effects, I’m still flopping back&#x2F;forth a bit about what “the best” or at least not leaving a simple improvement on the table, is. What a journey.<p>Still worth the trouble, though. Cooking is fun, and cast iron is a good cooking tool.')
