As far as I know no cops were killed. Were any even seriously injured? I saw a news photo of a cop with a bruised shin where it was hit with a rock; another report mentioned a cop whose glove got burned by a firework.<p>The vast majority of the protestors in Portland were out during the day, and were peaceful and organized. There were undoubtedly some people who came out at night because they wanted to tussle with the cops, launch their fireworks at that federal building, and so on. My impression (again, second-hand, as an outsider) was that the cops (local and federal) did a terrible job of diffusing that energy.')
