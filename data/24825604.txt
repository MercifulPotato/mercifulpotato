In situation where partner is going home at irregular times? I cant imagine doing that and cant imaging expecting that.<p>&gt; And just from a general safety perspective—wife and baby go for a mid-day walk and a simple “hey you got your phone on you?” gives us both some piece of mind. She knows if she’s not back in some remotely realistic timeframe and doesn’t pick up her phone there’s someone that will come find her<p>I took huge amount of mid-day walks with kids and playground trips with kids and never ever needed someone to go find me. I did not needed husband to check how long I am away or anything like that. What exactly is &quot;realistic timeframe&quot; for walk with kid? For me, it could take anything between 20minutes and 4hours depending on weather, kids mood or my mood. But I did not needed husband to rescue me from dangers of local playground or park, like not once.<p>I am not outlier, I do not know a single woman with baby in real life who would need that level or control in order to have peaceful mind. All these &quot;realistic examples&quot; make me wonder whether people did not normalized huge amount anxiety for themselves. Or they are made up.')
