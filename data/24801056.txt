FB actually does have pretty good tools to limit what you see in your feed. Making use of the &quot;Hide this Post&quot; (or whatever it&#x27;s called) on my own FB feed has all but eliminated all political ads or any of the stuff in my feed that I&#x27;m not interested, i.e. anything that&#x27;s not about my friends&#x27; lives.  That functionality needs to be MUCH more prominent, IMHO.  The ease of sharing and retweeting also means that little or no effort is required to propagate whatever you come across.<p>Even without the algorithms, people will essentially do that work themselves.  There&#x27;s a reason Fox News, Breitbart, and these types of &quot;news&quot; sources are popular. People are comfortable when their beliefs are reinforced and not challenged. I don&#x27;t think this is a conscious action, but it happens nevertheless.<p>My anecdote here is my father-in-law.  He&#x27;s glued to Fox News, right wing podcasters, and the like.  He&#x27;s as up to date on every bit of news propagated by those sites as anyone I know that&#x27;s regularly on Facebook.')
