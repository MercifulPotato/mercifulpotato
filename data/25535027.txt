The gTLDs I listed are typically cheaper than .com registrations when I look on namecheap, but the governance of the original TLDs is definitely more regulated, except for that damn .org hijack attempt :(<p>However, if I want to have {my last name}.tld, is there any gTLD that would be unlikely to jack up the price? I actually have {my last name}.casa for this reason.<p>Unfortunately {my last name}.{com,org,net} were all registered when I was in diapers. I&#x27;m assuming that the land of gTLDs is the wild west of potential price shenanigans, but I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m wrong.')
