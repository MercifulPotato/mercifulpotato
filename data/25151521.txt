Different people have a very wide range of ideas, opinions and interests, so the natural thing would be clustering. You stick together with the people who share your ideas, and you don&#x27;t welcome other into your club. It&#x27;s OK because they have their clubs where you are not welcome and you understand that it&#x27;s OK as well. It&#x27;s like being on different sports teams. You compete, but you don&#x27;t hate each other. In civilized societies people also agree that some basic human needs are above the club&#x2F;clan mentality, so if your neighbor&#x27;s house catches fire, you call 911 even if you are ideological rivals.<p>Except, having multiple independent communities is a lost profit to the tech oligopoly. Everything must be centralized and automated as much as possible, so one minimum-wage moderator could handle a cluster of 10K users. The moderators also have to be replaceable, so there needs to be a common corporate standard applying to all communities. So now, instead of letting people find others based on the interest, and set their rules, you are forcing the same global average of rules on everybody. Of course, people will hate it.<p>It applies to the society in general as well. The economy where a handful of big players is telling people what to do, instead of forcing them to build mutual trust and work out business-driven relationships with each other, is making everyone miserable and increasing tensions.<p>Oh, and one more thing. If you let corporations choose one culture&#x2F;set of values, and force it on the society, it will be in there interest to pick the one that maximizes their profits and your dependence on them.')
