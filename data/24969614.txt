Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=[24970560, 24971856], score=None, time=1604333355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24968929, text='&gt; Possibly but itâ€™s interesting that so many Obama voters went for Trump.<p>They hoped for change (&quot;yes we can&quot;, &quot;change we need&quot;), but Obama failed to deliver as he was blocked by the Republican Senate for six years straight (thanks to &quot;Moscow Mitch&quot; McConnell). Trump and his &quot;we will drain the swamp for real this time&quot; message was exactly the right thing to offer to this voter group, <i>especially</i> as the Democrat candidate was Hillary Clinton - as &quot;establishment&quot; as one can be.<p>If there&#x27;s one thing that Obama and the then-Democrat leadership abysmally failed, it is that they did not use the House+Senate+Presidency tripe majority to actually enact change in the first two years. I bloody hope that the Democrats can gain the Senate and especially that Biden will have learned his lesson!')
