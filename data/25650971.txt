It did not help that we were right between east and west either.<p>Now we celebrate 14 years of being in the E.U., which helped a lot, although we mismanaged tens of billions (sorry E.U.), while we are still many years away from managing so much money correctly and without illegal shenanigans... Also around 17 years in the NATO, which helped a lot I&#x27;d say (see our neighbor Ukraine for the contrary; Moldova is also behind us by some 15 years, at least).<p>But, technologically, the new freedom brought us some very interesting 90&#x27;s and 2000&#x27;s, catapulting our internet speeds to number one (sometimes two) in Europe [1] due to our giant nation-wide interconnected LAN-party networks, fueled mainly by piracy (or lets call it &quot;hunger for information and everything that we missed before&quot;). But there is a long reddit post which explains those years much better: [2]. Today everybody and their parents have at least 100 Mbps. Our main ISP doesn&#x27;t include a 100 Mbps plan anymore anyway. Only 300 Mbps up. Even my parents in  a small poor city have fiber since 5 years. Welcome to Romania.<p>These generated a lot of English speaking young people, me included. Lots of us becoming very good at electronics or IT. Sadly, many self-educated IT engineers left for other countries. We even had a running joke (urban legend mainly) that the second language at Microsoft was Romanian, which of course is said by other countries too (e.g. India) but somehow everybody knows somebody at Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, etc. While many of us are still (thinking about) leaving, placing us 2nd after Syria when it comes to mass emigration, still... executing those two bastards was for the best.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;79y3efbig4551.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;79y3efbig4551.png</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;np.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;europe&#x2F;comments&#x2F;2ct58s&#x2F;average_internet_speed_in_eu_by_country&#x2F;cjiyt5n&#x2F;?context=3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;np.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;europe&#x2F;comments&#x2F;2ct58s&#x2F;average_inter...</a>')
