Item(by='kbenson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609184549, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562126, text='&gt; If I remember correctly they previously bundled icloud services where each user got a slice of storage on the cloud, so I could see them extending that model to a time slice of compute as well, hosted on some form of K8s. I think the previous model was too limited for most use cases, but itâ€™s not fundamentally broken.<p>The average Apple consumer customer can make plenty of use of cloud storage.  What use does the average user have for cloud compute resources?<p>Unless Apple starts offloading some processing to the cloud, and gives them some free, I&#x27;m not sure how regular users would use this, and offering it for free assuming the majority of people won&#x27;t use it is just asking for some popular app to come along that takes advantage of that and screws up the economics.  Not to mention people probably won&#x27;t be happy to have a limit and pay for overage use for stuff that is likely provided by free on other platforms (if Google Photos prettifies your photos for free and Apple does it through metered compute with some given free, that&#x27;s bad optics).')
