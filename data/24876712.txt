People rate the physical build quality of their products very high as well.<p>It seems that people like the benefits and features of Apple hardware enough to overlook the problems with self-repairability.<p>And regarding the app store, maybe because you&#x27;re in the industry you think it&#x27;s a generally big problem, because you&#x27;re affected.  But it&#x27;s a 1% privilege issue to most of the world.<p>It seems Apple is doing enough right that its value is climbing.')
