A shit ton air is needed to feed the compressor. A jet sacrifices efficiency to get as much mass thrown out the back as fast as possible.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s the other way round - a Jet gains efficiency the more air mass it can &#x27;process&#x27;, because larger mass means you need to throw it out at a lower velocity to get the same impulse from it. If you compare formulas for momentum and kinetic energy, which are, respectively:<p>p = m * v and e = 0.5 * m * v ^2<p>You will see that energy needed for higher velocities grows quadratically, while the momentum you get from it grows linearly.<p>basically that&#x27;s why we have Turbofan engines with high bypass rations, to increase efficiency of passenger Jets<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bypass_ratio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bypass_ratio</a>')
