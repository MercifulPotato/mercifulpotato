Is the claim that the Inca <i>didn’t</i> have a body of institutional knowledge and practice that was effective within their own context and material culture?<p>Saying this as a fan of military history, this sounds awfully reductive. I suppose you could argue that printing, or at least an extensive written record, makes it easier to retain and transmit knowledge, but that’s not quite the same claim.<p>Worth noting that in 18th c France, the artillery officers were essentially the only ones with any formal military education.')
