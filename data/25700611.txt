I&#x27;m not defending Turkey because I genuinely don&#x27;t know, but is there something they could do to alleviate the issue or are they cancelled for all eternity?  Is there something they&#x27;re doing now that&#x27;s related to the Armenian genocide that&#x27;s perpetuating the issue?  Should we still be mad at Mongolia for Genghis Khan&#x27;s infamous imperial violence?')
