And spend 5-years iteration to circumventing them.\nJava will have proper asynchronous management in 5 years, Go will have generics in 5 years, Rust will have a garbage collector variant in 5 years, Python and JavaScript will have full multithreading in 5 years.<p>In the end, no language is catching the whole problematic and solve it at once.\nSo there is a programming language fatigue.<p>PS: when I say that things happen within a timeframe of 5 years, it includes the time to deliver the feature in the language, and people to massively adopt it, and new developped  code to include it in mass.')
