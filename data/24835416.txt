Now you are classifying Stalin with finished elementary school at 16 and seminary studies as intelligentsia.<p>&gt; The key factor of being in inteligentsia was (from Wiki): &quot;people engaged in the complex mental labours&quot;.<p>Stalin was not engaged in the complex mental labors, outside of seminary he engaged in revolutionary politics basically.<p>The very same wikipedia has multiple definitions for inteligentsia - including specifically Russian one from pre-revolution I quoted. Which defines inteligentsia as people educated enough to engage in politics. Which does include Stalin and pretty much everyone else involved in Russian politics.<p>&gt; Tzar family or many of the old aristocratic families were not a member of intelligentsia and would probably be offended by the association. The higher classes didn&#x27;t do any labor.<p>I did not made that definition, wiki did.<p>Monarchy had more supporters then just Tzar and old aristocratic families. And again, old aristocratic families did actually engaged in ruling and leading. And then you have waste groups of lower aristocracy running smaller things.  The country was under constant internal conflict and pressure. They did not done labor, they did politics a lot.<p>And group of people who had don&#x27;t politics or who have been educated cant be reasonably reduced to &quot;Stalin vs Tsar&quot;. Somehow, people pushing for reforms (too little too late success, but still) don&#x27;t exist. Liberals dont exist. Capitalists dont exist or dont engage with politics. That is not even realistic. Monarchis trying for milder reforms dont exist.')
