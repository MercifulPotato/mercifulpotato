This makes it clear upfront that it&#x27;s inherently and deliberately subjective.<p>Then people understand what the CoC is: the project owners just moderating the project as they see fit. This is basically what all open source projects have done since forever. If others read the public list of moderation actions and disagree with the project owners&#x27; enforcement behavior (it being too lax or too strict or otherwise unfair or wrong), they can choose not to participate.<p>Trying to codify every possible violation into a set of explicit rules, or, worse, trying to codify good behavior, just leads to this sort of &quot;you technically violated this part here&quot; bludgeoning.')
