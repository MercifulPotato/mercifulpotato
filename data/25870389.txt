Not hosting them in News itself is as close as Google can get to not hosting them at all. Meanwhile the small independent French news publishers on Google News should get a nice boost without Old News to compete with.<p>How the French News groups don&#x27;t see this is beyond me, but there seems no limit to the level of stupid coming from European publishers. They probably even think they&#x27;ve finally won, and that News Showcase is a brilliant way to segment their premium content. It&#x27;s going to be interesting to see how this plays out, but my bet is Google just completely blindsided them - pass the popcorn.')
