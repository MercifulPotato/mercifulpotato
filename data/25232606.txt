People were willing to talk, but not necessarily on the record, or to be identified.  That is because they are fearful of reprisal, based on past experiences and observations.<p>That is the biggest challenge for people confronting systemic issues like racism, poverty, homelessness, or any number of topics.  It&#x27;s not enough for victims to stand up for themselves, because there is a <i>systemic</i> imbalance in the ability to pursue remedies through the courts or other means.  Getting justice in civil matters often boils down to the size of a victims pocket book (and especially in contrast to pocket books of the people or organizations that have made that person a victim).  There are so many individuals who have left the tech industry after experiencing bad behaviour, discrimination, and abuse, and any one of those people could be the next Hedy Lamarr or Philip Emeagwali, and the industry is worse for not having those people in it.<p>Again, as a community we do our peers a disservice by not trusting them when they say there is a problem, especially when they are so consistently proven right.')
