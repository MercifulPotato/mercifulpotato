Item(by='mijoharas', descendants=None, kids=[25077104, 25075627], score=None, time=1605216670, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25073038, text='Thought I&#x27;d weigh in here, since we moved from heroku to ec2 to aurora to RDS postgres, so I can probably speak to this a little more.<p>* ec2 self managed is easily the cheapest, we had a solid setup, with continuous backups and a read replica, if cost is a factor, it&#x27;s easily a winner. However, there is a _lot_ of knowledge that goes with it. When it comes down to it, you can pay someone else to handle that. This isn&#x27;t just the setup cost, you need to factor in ongoing maintenance (the number of people at my company that could have done complicated things with the instance was probably me and another engineer, and we didn&#x27;t want to be permanently on call for this) and general risk.<p>* EC2 did probably work out to between 1&#x2F;2 to 3&#x2F;4 (probably 2&#x2F;3) the price of the equivalent RDS (tough to say exactly, as I&#x27;d need to factor in all the ancillary costs that are more &quot;bundled together&quot; in RDS)<p>* RDS was much cheaper than aurora for our workload. (almost 1&#x2F;2 the price).<p>I think the main thing to remember, is that ec2 is much cheaper than RDS, but RDS is cheaper than engineers. With that, while we didn&#x27;t need to do anything complicated other than the migration, the risk and possible engineering time and bus factor didn&#x27;t feel worth it to stay on ec2.')
