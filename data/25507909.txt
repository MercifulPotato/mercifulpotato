Item(by='s0rce', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608654393, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504771, text='I&#x27;m really frustrated with the enormous field of view of most webcams. Many are 90+ degrees. My old 2012 Logitech C310 is 60 degrees. I want to show myself in the view, not my entire room&#x2F;house. I finally found a cheap AUSDOM AW635 which is 60 degrees on eBay. Image quality is acceptable for $20 and its manual focus which took a moment to dial in but is ncie since the focus doesn&#x27;t jump around during a call.<p>I&#x27;d buy a higher end webcam if they had adjustable FOV (without software, since the software doesn&#x27;t work across all OS&#x2F;programs).')
