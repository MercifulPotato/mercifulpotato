It was not talking about a daily or even weekly phenomena but seasonal one.<p>There is no summer which have had <i>no</i> winds, no winters that have had <i>no</i> insolation or vice versa. Instead of making up numbers, you can use a site like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solar-electric.com&#x2F;learning-center&#x2F;solar-insolation-maps.html&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solar-electric.com&#x2F;learning-center&#x2F;solar-insolat...</a>.<p>You&#x27;ll find that by comparing seasonal best case to seasonal worst case it is something like, on average, 50% difference.  It gets worse the closer you to get to the pole obviously.<p>Furthermore, surplus production does not go into dev&#x2F;null. Excess resources create markets, and there will be consumers that take advantage of cheaper surplus power (smelting, heavy industrial, desalination, hydrogen production, and whatever else anybody cooks up).')
