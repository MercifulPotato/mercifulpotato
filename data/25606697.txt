They&#x27;re there to protect the company.<p>This is absolutely correct.<p>However the next sentence reveals a curious mis-alignment in our culture at large:<p>&gt; Perhaps sometimes your interests align with the company but that&#x27;s just an accident.<p>It is <i>absolutely</i> in the interest of the company to not treat people like shit, from multiple vantage points ranging from selfishly not wanting to be embarrassed by their own misconduct, to more altruistic moral obligation.
