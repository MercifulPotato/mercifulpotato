One is more likely to fall into conversations about mundane topics with uneducated people than to stumble upon existential conversations with educated philosophers, even though the latter might produce a large corpus.</i><p>“Mundane people” is an entirely different segment than “raging identity politics <i>aficionados</i> complaining about their romantic life”.<p>The common man on the street will think nothing ill of the word being used as such, even when he be a blue collar construction worker, and will normally interpret it as intended.<p>I have never met such a raging identity politics <i>aficionado</i> in real life. I would assume not living in the U.S.A., where most of them seem to be centred, reduces my chances. But even there, it seems to be a rather small segment that is isolated to weblogs, as even newspaper columns do not seem to find it mainstream enough to dedicate segments to it.<p>I&#x27;d gander that if I were to find myself in New York and strike a conversation with a blue collar local and say something such as “<i>A beautiful city isn&#x27;t it? all these millions of men, working as an organized beehive.</i>”, that he&#x27;ll not interpret  me wrongly or even think much of it.')
