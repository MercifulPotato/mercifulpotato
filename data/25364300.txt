If a majority of the population simply doesn&#x27;t have the critical thinking and background knowledge necessary to weed out fake news, democracy simply can&#x27;t work. I would argue we&#x27;re there in the United States. Too much bias for us to recover from our current politics without very significant changes to our system and &#x2F; or the population.')
