At most, it&#x27;s helpful to track administrative minutiae. If you give something your full attention, tracking will seem like a non-sequitur.</i><p>There&#x27;s only so many things you can handle yourself. Todo lists are essentially the archetype of your second brain. They not only let you remember the non-urgent (but likely important) tasks, they also help you manage <i>multiple</i> urgent-and-important tasks, and in particular <i>large</i> urgent-and-important tasks. When such task is too big to fit in your head, you break it down into pieces digestible by your brain. A todo list lets you tackle bigger tasks, that break into more pieces, and&#x2F;or tackle more of such tasks.<p>&gt; <i>You can&#x27;t hack meaningful relationships other than by growing as a person, nor can you hack the strength to work on things that matter every day.</i><p>Hold my beer while I cross off the task of buying tickets to an event my wife wants to go to, because as much as I want to remember it, it&#x27;s one of those things that are both important for a meaningful relationship and too easy to slip out of one&#x27;s head under barrage of everyday churn.<p>&gt; <i>In a sense, the ultimate hack is to come to terms with your mortality and use this as an impulsion to focus on what really matters to you.</i><p>I wish this worked, but the brain adjusts and compensates even for <i>memento mori</i>.')
