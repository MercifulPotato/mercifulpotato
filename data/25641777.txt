But that was almost 4 years ago, and the type system has become a lot more capable. Including the template literal types as used in my dumb little non-negative int or in compile time JSON, SQL and GraphQL parsing. Which are still horrendous but a great deal less so than some of the hacks from 2027, and a lot easier to read.<p>It’s definitely not an ML type system, but I’d bet a dollar it takes more inspiration and guidance from F# than C#.')
