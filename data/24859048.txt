We need to get our priorities straight.<p>Priorities are definitely not straight in this country, but I&#x27;d bet 95% of those sold are going to be financed. Very few people have 100k liquid, and even fewer are willing to drop it on a car. Your point stands though, those people didn&#x27;t finance a 30k car and agree to pay 82k via convenient monthly payments over a number of years to end homelessness.<p>This brings up another point - why are massive new vehicles seen as such a status symbol in the US? 120 month loans on a rapidly depreciating asset are insane, same with rolling over debt from prior vehicles. Millions of people have 7+ year car loans which are holding them back from achieving economic stability. They won&#x27;t have positive equity in the vehicle until the last couple years of the loan, by which point their vehicle needs have likely changed and they&#x27;ve already gotten a different car.')
