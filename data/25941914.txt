They&#x27;re essentially just banding together on public information here. GameStop, Blackberry, Nokia, AMC, they&#x27;re all affected and I&#x27;m just counting days of developments here.<p>As for the financial incentive, it is _absolutely_ driving this behavior. The taste of cash. Most will of course lose money on this, but this is not my point. My point? There is a financial incentive! I&#x27;m not talking about morale or ethics, I&#x27;m talking about why I think this might be a watershed moment. The masses realizing this is at all possible.<p>Hell, throwing away cash on lotteries is also a terrible way to build fortunes, yet it&#x27;s a massive industry and lives are ruined over this as well.')
