When I was in junior high, high school, and at college, I taught a lecture or two regularly.  I was no teacher or professor, but I was a lecturer &#x2F; instructor, while I was going to school.  It says nothing.<p>&gt;THE COURT CASE IS LINKED IN TFA<p>If you look at the court case the only thing in it that is not hearsay is a dented bumper.  Furthermore, she was dismissed.  Because of a lack of evidence it never would have held a candle in court because it was all hearsay.<p>This is the problem with articles like this.  They defame people, and the average person who has no legal background eats it up as the wholesale truth.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re so insistent on defending if not a sexual predator then at least someone with highly questionable judgement.<p>Woo.. there is nothing in there that says she is a sexual predator.<p>&gt;And again, maybe all of this has little to do with the whistleblower stuff, but there is no question about whether or not it&#x27;s true that she had an inappropriate extramartial affair with a student, stalked him after he tried to end it and was fired over the whole ordeal.<p>It has nothing to do with the whistleblower stuff.  It has to do with how garbage the article is.  Falling for it is embarrassing.  The fact that articles like these today are legal, is a sad state of affairs.  In the US up until the 80s, articles like these would be against the law for hopefully obvious reason.')
