Consumers can&#x27;t cover the liability costs that come along with opening an electrical panel channeling a household&#x27;s mainline. The cost argument imagines 5% more cost for a few features to aid some simple maintenance. The off-the-shelf cost of those features could well be 5% more. But the support logistics, legal coverage, manual drafting, etc won&#x27;t be covered by that 5%.<p>The idea of repairing a washing machine is great. But our world is growing more complex by the day. The average individual is going to lose any hope of having even enough shallow expertise to crack into these devices without endangering themselves and others.
