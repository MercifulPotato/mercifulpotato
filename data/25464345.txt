Lower the cost of labor and you lower the cost of the good that is provided. Why not lower those costs to the minimum? &#x2F;s<p>Not sure why you feel that an &#x2F;s tag is necessary. Why not make your point in plain terms so people can read, understand, and respond?<p>&gt; Also, a wage laborer who opts out of the wage labor system will likely end up just as dead as a slave who tries to opt out of the slave system.<p>Yes, however one will be murdered for his refusal to be a slave, whereas one will starve to death or die of exposure for his failure to produce food and shelter. There is no equivalence between being murdered and the natural result of failing to work for food and shelter.<p>&gt;  The &quot;voluntariness&quot; of wage labor isn&#x27;t quite the panacea is seems to be,<p>Its not a &quot;panacea,&quot; merely a matter of basic human rights that someone should be allowed to choose where to work (or if they want to work at all).<p>&gt; when you realize many people are given the choice between one or more shitty jobs or no job at all.<p>They are given as many choices as there are other people offering deals.
