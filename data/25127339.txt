It doesn&#x27;t make upgrading any less possible than &quot;completely impossible&quot;, and probably (slightly) reduces the overall cost&#x2F;complexity of the board, slightly reducing the material cost&#x2F;impact.<p>FWIW, in the future I imagine most processors will look like the M1, with additional memory available over a serial bus like OMI, used in POWER10. The &quot;unified memory&quot; will effectively serve as a giant cache for the CPU&#x2F;GPU with slower peripheral memory used as a backing store.')
