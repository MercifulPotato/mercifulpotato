(YMMV, this is highly dependent on which country you are in). You don&#x27;t need to create accounts or register. You just need to know your phone number.<p>Having to give up your phone number and contacts is a feature for most people. They can instantly see that Marge from the office also uses WhatsApp so they can call&#x2F;message them using that instead of paying for calls and SMS.<p>The limitations of WhatsApp web are mostly due to it being end to end encrypted. The &quot;web client&quot; is basically just using the phone as a proxy. It _is_ possible to have E2E encryption and allow multiple separate clients, but it&#x27;s not a trivial problem to solve, thus most won&#x27;t do it. (Telegram&#x27;s E2E chats are device to device and not available on other clients than the one that initiated the connection.)<p>It&#x27;s still crap, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;d rather use anything else, but at least where I live, it has critical mass and is the de facto standard.')
