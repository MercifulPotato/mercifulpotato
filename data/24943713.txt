If you live in an authoritarian regime where people are willing to completely give up their lives then it is effective, but at that point you might argue are they still living or just existing like zombies? In all Western nations it didn&#x27;t matter if one took more stringent or more lenient actions, everyone had a first wave, everyone has a second wave. Nobody invented a testing regime, a track and trace regime which allows us to live normally, so what&#x27;s the point in taking those measures when they didn&#x27;t prevent a second wave for anyone?<p>&gt; Colouring the rules themselves as &quot;silly&quot; only reveals a bias in your argument<p>Fair point. Young generations have been taught for many decades now that we are not in this world together. Nobody pays off your debt. Nobody else will look after your health if you don&#x27;t do it yourself. Nobody will come and provide you shelter when you become homeless. Look at the most woke state in the USA - California - every woke person walks past homeless people and couldn&#x27;t are less. People who claim we are in this or in anything else together are selfish afraid human beings who want to control the population out of their own fear. The notion that we are in this together is wrong and that is the education that young people have been given for many years now. This is how it was in the last economic crisis, this is how it will be in this one too. So as far as I&#x27;m concerned COVID was nothing to me and my wife and it is not a threat to our family, so why should we care any longer about this? Other people&#x27;s problems is not our problem. Just like every woke Californian walks past homeless people and doesn&#x27;t care, I walk past the COVID death statistics and equally don&#x27;t care. Why am I the villain now?')
