I was fantasizing about a complete crazy thing lately. What if there was some small device that could turn energy into carbon capturing? Let says there was such a device, we could mount it onto every bicycle on this planet and every time people drive around it might be a bit more exhausting (good for your health!), but at the same time we would capture carbon from the air. Is this a crazy idea? I guess it is... But somehow I think it must be possible! If you know how to built it, let me know. I will sell it like crazy ;)')
