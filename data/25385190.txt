Item(by='humanrebar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607691412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384885, text='&gt; Why aren&#x27;t they being criticised?<p>Because newspapers have editorial boards, ombudsmen, and liability (in the form of libel) for what they print. Facebook has the conceit that it doesn&#x27;t have any perspective, that it&#x27;s just a carrier of speech of others. The concern is that Facebook (and YouTube and Twitter) already has preferences (such as for controversy over dry facts) and is developing more (curation through fact checking, etc.).<p>If Facebook came out and said, &quot;Yeah, we&#x27;re more or less like Readers Digest but for the internet&quot; I suspect they&#x27;ll still have detractors, but it will be more of the &quot;I don&#x27;t like reading Readers Digest&quot; variety, not of the &quot;Someone needs to break up Readers Digest!&quot; one. They might also lose accounts, too, because who wants to write for a paper with clear points of view and biases that work at cross purposes to their own?')
