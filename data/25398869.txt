First, it came out in April, when CFR in the USA was 6.2%, not 1.9%. So that alone would be enough to drive YLL of fatalities down close to my number.<p>&gt; &quot;used to construct a plausible scenario for the prevalence of combinations of LTCs among people who died from COVID-19 for the modelling presented here.&quot;<p>Second, the dataset used at the time to generate their synthetic data was weak. You can see it immediately in their bar charts, where they have mostly healthy 50-69 y.o. dying in their synthetic data, skewing their YLL to the right.<p>&gt; Your own link states that healthspan is not quantifiable, so your claim that it is 3.5y doesn&#x27;t make a whole lot of sense.<p>I provided a link to a &quot;conservative&quot; description of healthspan, but in the field people are more optimistic about it.<p>Very good questions you brought up though, thanks!')
