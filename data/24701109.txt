Whereas AWS&#x2F;GCP have pricing structures based on usage and you never know until the end of the month how much you owe, DO instead has defined &quot;you will pay $50&#x2F;mo for this regardless of if you do or do not use it&quot; and from what I&#x27;ve seen, many people really value and appreciate that, and specifically choose DO over AWS&#x2F;GCP because of that.<p>The pricing model for App Platform seems antithesis to that, though, which is interesting. DO is becoming more like AWS&#x2F;GCP with every feature release, which I don&#x27;t necessarily find to be a good thing.')
