Some of them were older editions of industry standard text books (Real-time rendering and PBRT first edition), but the library refused to take donations because they were &quot;technical books&quot;.  Granted a lot of them were really outdated 90s technical game programming books like &quot;Windows 95 Game SDK Strategy Guide&quot; and &quot;The Black Art of Windows Game Programming&quot;.')
