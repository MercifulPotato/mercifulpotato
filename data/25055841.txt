It&#x27;s spending its energy seriously talking about QAnon, and how the COVID pandemic is over, and and how there&#x27;s a vast liberal conspiracy that destroyed the integrity of this country&#x27;s elections, and how their president will think about whether or not he will step down if he were to lose the election.<p>These aren&#x27;t weird views held by a bunch of powerless cranks on the party&#x27;s fringe. This is the sort of stuff that the party bet the farm on this year, and <i>has largely paid off with the voters</i>.<p>In any sane world, an impartial observer would look at that, and conclude that it is all absolutely crazy. But we no longer live in a sane world, so there&#x27;s now no shortage of people apologizing for, cheerleading, or just ignoring that kind of behaviour <i>in their elected officials</i>.')
