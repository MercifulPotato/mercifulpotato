To me this looks like rather a corner case. E.g. I usually want to scale my MLE infrastructure independent  from the DB. To it seems much to pipe the Data into log like Kafka to compute the result, just because that is much easier to scale. Similarly for training it seem to be that using some files on an Objectstore as the input is usually much easier to scale.')
