It&#x27;s the default on Windows computers, and a lot of other search engines like Yahoo and DuckDuckGo use their data as well. It runs ads, so it&#x27;s probably profitable.<p>And it&#x27;s probably really good, this story as an example, to be in second place, when the first place runner is doing illegal things, under investigation in a dozen countries or more, and likely to face major repercussions going forwards. Being number two means you&#x27;re number one when the leader gets knocked out of the race.')
