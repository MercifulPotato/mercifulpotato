At worst there&#x27;s inconvenient things, and as you get deeper into FP you&#x27;ll wish F# had certain features, but all in all it&#x27;s an very sane and well designed language. I think the only thing that&#x27;s caused me any pain is the lack of type classes, and after doing a lot of MVU I wish lenses were a language level feature.')
