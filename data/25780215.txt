Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610649309, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775056, text='&gt; I do not have a problem with someone making a profit on those &quot;gifts&quot;<p>You seem to be assuming, though, that &quot;not being a registered nonprofit&quot; automatically <i>implies</i> that there&#x27;s some non-trivial probability that you&#x27;ll be profitable.<p>Every FOSS developer I&#x27;ve met who is accepting &quot;tips&quot; for their work, is not anywhere close to &quot;breaking even&quot; from those tips (insofar as you&#x27;d treat the FOSS project as its own business with its own balance sheet, rather than as a marque of the owner&#x27;s hypothetical individual-proprietorship IT consultancy.)<p>Sure, some of these are side-projects they do in addition to a full-time job, and therefore the self-employment-wages they get paid out for this effort are &quot;pure profit&quot; in the sense that they already make a living wage. But that would be <i>just as true</i> if they worked full-time for a business, and then worked as a part-time paid employee of a nonprofit.<p>Profitability of a FOSS-project-as-corporation, is what&#x27;s left over <i>after</i> you pay yourself (the sole employee) out at a working wage for all the labor you put in. As such, in legal terms, these side-projects almost always <i>would</i> qualify as non-profits.<p>FOSS developers aren&#x27;t YouTubers with a fanbase of millions and a platform where they can directly, incessantly plug their Patreon to that captive audience with embedded advertising. They&#x27;re just people publishing apps, where the app almost never event <i>hints</i> at the &quot;personal brand&quot; of the developer.<p>And so, I think a critical difficulty in the communication here, is that you might be imagining this thing on the wrong scale. We&#x27;re talking about <i>maybe</i> 200 people per year, sending the developer <i>maybe</i> $5 apiece. Not about individual transfers of hundreds&#x2F;thousands of dollars; nor about enough transfers to pay a living wage. That&#x27;s why it makes sense to call these monetary transfers &quot;tips&quot;, rather than &quot;funding.&quot;<p>And that&#x27;s also, partly, why people are so confused&#x2F;appalled — Apple and Google <i>do not</i> serve their own bottom lines by getting in the way of people &quot;donating&quot; to these FOSS projects. The labor-cost required to enforce this directive probably costs more than they&#x27;d ever make by taking a cut of these tips!<p>&gt; in exchange for actually going through that bureaucratic rigmarole to get registered<p>It&#x27;s not the &quot;rigmarole&quot; (labor), it&#x27;s the cost. A nonprofit corporation is still a <i>corporation</i> — and most FOSS developers, as individual proprietors, don&#x27;t receive enough in tips to actually be able to <i>afford</i> the fees involved in incorporating and registering a nonprofit.<p>(I mean, they can probably afford it <i>themselves</i>. But the hypothetical nonprofit that is the FOSS project can&#x27;t afford to pay for it out of its own treasury. I.e., incorporation would just put the FOSS project further &quot;in the hole&quot; in being revenue-negative, and therefore in being worth the developer&#x27;s time to contribute to.)<p>There&#x27;s a reason that governments allow individual proprietors to just &quot;do business&quot; without incorporating: it&#x27;s a fiscal stumbling-block that trips up the people governments most want to encourage to start businesses.<p>The same thing <i>should</i> be true for nonprofits&#x2F;charities, intuitively. Even if there is no legal recognition for &quot;individual proprietorship nonprofits&quot;, everyone <i>acts</i> like those are a thing. (They don&#x27;t expect their donations to be tax-deductible, but most people in the middle class don&#x27;t donate to formal nonprofits enough to realize &quot;donations&quot; are their own, tax-deductible, class of thing, separate from regular monetary gifts.)<p>And most of all, people expects <i>corporations</i> to go along with it — and most corporations <i>do</i> go along with it. Microsoft with Github Sponsors, etc. That&#x27;s why everyone is so up-in-arms that Apple and Google <i>aren&#x27;t</i> going along with it.<p>Of course, Apple and Google are technically, legally in the right — these are not donations. The problem is that common sense disagrees with the law: by common sense, these <i>should</i> be donations, tax-deductibility and all. If push came to shove, the law — not common sense — would be what bends. But nobody&#x27;s pushed that far yet.<p>&gt; Side note - as I wrote before, my local tax office would like to know who the money is going to<p>Is there some problem I&#x27;m not seeing, tax-wise, with sending small monetary gifts to <i>people you believe to be</i> individuals who are online acquaintances of yours (e.g. people you talked to on a forum once)?<p>If I want to send money to a FOSS developer, it&#x27;s because I view them as, effectively, an acquaintance. Someone I&#x27;d buy a beer at a conference. By &quot;donating&quot; to them, I&#x27;m just buying this acquaintance of mine a beer asynchronously.<p>Most people make small monetary transfers to individuals they aren&#x27;t <i>sure</i> of the identity of all the time. For example, buying hand-made jewelry at a pop-up street bazaar. There&#x27;s no &quot;business&quot; name — it&#x27;s just an individual proprietor — and you might never learn the proprietor&#x27;s name, either!<p>Because there are so many situations like this that can arise in every-day life, it&#x27;s never the job of private citizens to prevent money from being <i>unknowingly</i> laundered into the hands of trade-embargoed states or entities. It&#x27;s not your legal civic responsibility to avoid shopping at a store just because you <i>haven&#x27;t ruled it out</i> as being a money-laundering operation.<p>Instead, it&#x27;s the legal duty of <i>banks</i> and <i>payment processors</i> — with their fancy KYC&#x2F;AML databases — to do that: to identify the transfer recipient through network-analysis at point of fan-in. Money launderers aren&#x27;t fought by starving them of demand; they&#x27;re fought by <i>deplatforming</i> them from the financial system they depend on.<p>(That being said, if you were acting as your <i>own</i> payment processor, ala <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hawala" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hawala</a>, you might be on the hook at tax time.)')
