Item(by='ajuc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603182635, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24828264, text='You can play any system any way, and popularity of D&amp;D (especially online and in English-speaking countries) means that you&#x27;re more likely to find the 5% of D&amp;D players that want narrative-focused D&amp;D than the 50% of World of Darkness or Call of Cthulhu players who want narrative-focused games. But there&#x27;s enough of both to find someone on the internet.<p>Also systems come with setting and genre - if you like medieval fantasy and political intrigue Call of Cthulhu might not be for you (because it takes place in more modern times in real-world+ universe and it&#x27;s mostly focused on horror&#x2F;mystery). World of Darkness has a culture of focusing on narrative and acting over mechanics in this system, but it can be a little too &quot;emo&quot;&#x2F;&quot;existential horror&quot; for some people. Or maybe it&#x27;s my prejudice, I&#x27;ve never personally played it, just watched some games in the 90s.<p>If you don&#x27;t like crunchy mechanics there&#x27;s a very simple d6 system:<p>1 = you failed AND something bad happened<p>2 = you failed<p>3 = you failed BUT something good happened<p>4 = you succeeded BUT something bad happened<p>5 = you succeeded<p>6 = you succeeded AND something good happened<p>Your character sheet is just a table with free-form description of what you&#x27;re good at (you roll 2d6 and choose better result) and what you&#x27;re bad at (you roll 2d6 and choose worse result). DM can also give you more&#x2F;less dices depending on how hard something is to do.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much it - you can play it now :). I don&#x27;t remember what was the name of that system but it&#x27;s commonly played late-night at conventions - almost no setup required. And it tends to create games with little focus on combat.<p>Voice-acting is a matter of personal preference I think. I don&#x27;t usually do it and I&#x27;ve never had problems in games where some people did it and some didn&#x27;t.<p>Anyway - the key to having fun is to set expectations on the first session. Better to talk about it in advance than to waste time playing with people who want to have fun differently than you. The system is secondary (and you can always houserule stuff away if it&#x27;s too complex for you).')
