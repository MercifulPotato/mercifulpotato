The process registry is   more elaborate than a simple naming scheme in say Python or Java but really not much harder to use. However that controlled registry allows the process registry to become multi-node with minimal or no code changes for the clients. It’s comparable in power to but far simpler than Consul or etcd for finding services. I view micro services as fairly equivalent to Erlang actors as they both reinforce that state encapsulation. The same idea goes for mnesia or ETS which are comparable in power to Redis.')
