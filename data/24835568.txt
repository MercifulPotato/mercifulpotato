I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but clearly there are at least two routes to defending your trademark: ask people to &quot;license&quot; the trademark, or go to court over it. A site that clearly helps build up a brand should be a no-brainer for a free (or if the law does not allow, a Â£1) trademark agreement that ensures common sense things like &quot;the site should clearly state it&#x27;s unaffiliated&quot; (which it does) or &quot;the raspberry pi foundation should get first consideration if the site is ever sold&quot;.<p>I do hope Eben Upton weighs in on this, because whoever signed this off, it&#x27;s a bad decision all round. Blaming trademark law is just a dishonest get-out-of-jail-free that big corporations use to justify belligerent bad-faith dealing. I hope the Raspberry Pi Foundation can show that it&#x27;s different. This is not a good start.')
