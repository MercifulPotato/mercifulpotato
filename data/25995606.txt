It had ways been a high maintenance product with many liability issues and ultimately proven difficult to monetise. Not to mention feed aggregators as a whole has been in decline since so the demand is probably not even there.<p>None of those assertions match the public history: they rejected attempts to monetize Reader, it wasn&#x27;t getting much (if any) maintenance time, and the decline in demand was in no small part due to Google&#x27;s decision to kill the most popular product in that space hoping to boost Google+, providing no counterbalance to Facebook&#x27;s attempt to lock up the syndication market.<p>Gmail and Maps will not be cancelled because those sell a ton of advertising data. The Google products to worry about are the ones which don&#x27;t funnel data into their ad system.')
