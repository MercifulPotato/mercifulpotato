No, in fact they have the deepest pockets and will be the last ones standing regardless on what you do with twitter and such. They don&#x27;t need twitter, its focus on engagement just makes their efforts more cost effective. Cut that off and they&#x27;ll refocus on buying national and local TV networks or whatever else gets eyeballs and attention.')
