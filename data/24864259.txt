The keys would be smaller if they were simply <i>opinionated</i> and mandated a specific cipher, such as Ed25519 that uses much smaller keys.<p>Protocols like SAML, OpenID, and OAuth aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;re not protocols at all. They&#x27;re <i>protocol parts</i> thrown into a bag that everyone can pull whatever they like out of. They support way too many cryptographic primitives, and have far too many pluggable features.<p>Just <i>yesterday</i> I had to deal with an outage because a large enterprise ISV&#x27;s SAML implementation doesn&#x27;t support signing key rollover! You can have exactly one key only, which means after a key renewal all authentication breaks. You have to do big-bang coordinated rollouts.<p>That is <i>typical</i> of the kind of stuff I see in this space.<p>Everyone gets every part of these protocols <i>wrong</i>. Google does SAML wrong! Microsoft fixed one glaring security flaw in Azure AD, but neglected to back-port it to AD FS, because legacy on-prem security doesn&#x27;t matter, right?<p>If Google and Microsoft can&#x27;t get these things right, why are we working one yet more protocols that are <i>even more complex</i>!?')
