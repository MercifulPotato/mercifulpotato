I recently filed paperwork to form an LLC (my first) in anticipation of launching and perhaps trying my hand at fundraising on Kickstarter or elsewhere.<p>The project is called Learn with Grok (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GrokApp&#x2F;learn-with-grok" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GrokApp&#x2F;learn-with-grok</a>) and is a language learning application. Unlike existing applications, Grok is focused on people who have already studied a foreign language for years and are past beginner level content. Learn with Grok is focused on Critical Reading Skills and will tailor short story content to you at your proficiency level after taking a placement test. The more you read and do well on the quiz at the end of the short story, the more difficult content you can work towards to achieve mastery (or Grok!) a new language. You can hear what sentences sound like and see a translation on the spot if you struggle comprehending a sentence. Challenge yourself with a little content everyday.<p>This project is pre-launch and my first real try at creating a business. I work full-time and work on this nights and weekends while also balancing a machine learning grad program.')
