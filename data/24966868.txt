Nobody except my handful of friends cares about little ol’ me being on Twitter or not.<p>Hopefully, many more people care about widespread censorship.<p>If you’re using a censored platform with eyes wide open, that’s also totally fine; I wrote this because I considered myself an expert Twitter user and was myself terribly surprised that they had started censoring search.<p>I imagine most people that use the site are unaware of it, which is the only reason this post exists.')
