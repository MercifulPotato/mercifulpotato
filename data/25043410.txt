Demographic problems are not problems in a vacuum. Demographic decline is only an issue insofar as it prevents economic growth.<p>It turns out, the CPC is acutely aware of the issue, and considered it before putting the policy into place. The crucial fact is this one:<p>Over 25% of the Chinese population is employed in agriculture. However, only 2% of the American population is employed in agriculture.<p>This fact is the root cause of the demographic decline being planned and indeed wished for by the CPC. They, in effect, have a 20+% population surplus, that could be got rid of without a negative economic impact.<p>Therefore, the Chinese economy is very unlikely to implode because of the upcoming demographic shock, as it will not negatively impact economic growth and will thus not lead to issues with either the retirement system (China already has one of the lowest retirement ages), nor with economic growth.<p>This inscribes itself further in the process of proletarianization in which the Chinese economy is engaging in order to continue its development, as well as calculated so that the peak population will coincide with the carrying capacity of Chinese arable lands. The CCP are a lot of bad things, but they really aren&#x27;t idiots.<p>An issue that was not foreseen, however, is the gender imbalance that was created, but even that is not that bad of an issue - involuntary celibacy is significantly lower in China than, for example, the United States, and is actually one of the lowest in the world, but this is still a problem, especially for more long term relationships.<p>People have been clamouring for the imminent fall of China for this or that, but objectively I don&#x27;t see it happening.')
