I do see a path for better printing quality and overtime becoming indistinguishable from injection molding, but I do not see any path for beating a 15 second cycle time. Printing a coffee mug can take whopping 8 hours, depending on specifics of quality and the machine.<p>I feel like Injection Molding is far more amazing, interesting, intriguing and challenging process than 3D printing and yet, it gets zero media coverage. Before people respond to this - yes, I know the pros&#x2F;cons of 3D printing and it certainly has place in manufacturing processes. Just pointing out the media hype around 3D printing which I thought would die down after 2015 or so... but it continues to overwhelm news sources.<p>Edit: Goddamn it HN, why are you all responding to the pros&#x2F;cons of 3D printing? My complain is about <i>media coverage</i> and how click baity engagement metrics propelled 3D printing into this glorified do-all-world-changing-technology. It disproportionately gets attention, was just using injection-molding as a talking point. There are so many interesting manufacturing techniques. Every MBA exec wants their engineers to explore 3D-printing without knowing its downsides, thanks to the stupid media.')
