Item(by='biggermike', descendants=None, kids=[25509554], score=None, time=1608659049, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25507436, text='&gt; Policy-wise, I would like to capital gains reform and strict responsibility for congress when making financial decisions (eg no more &quot;borrowing&quot; from SS&#x2F;Medicare, pass a budget as required in the Constitution, etc).<p>I see this sentiment repeated often, but what does it mean exactly?  The government has borrowed from SS, for example, since its inception in the 1930s.  The entirety of SS assets are held in government debt and all efforts to diversify these assets have become politicized as &quot;privatizing SS&quot;.')
