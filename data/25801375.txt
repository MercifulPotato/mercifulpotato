In a democracy, everyone has notionally equal potential and responsibility for society&#x27;s improvement whether they are currently powerful or not. Power can be moved around if someone new is obviously a better wielder of it. The powerful have special responsibilities but &#x27;fixing&#x27; things isn&#x27;t one of them. That is a shared responsibility. The powerless also have a responsibility to talk, argue and come to agreement on how to improve things.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean when you say privilege. It is a very broad word. The powerful being privileged is something of a tautology, but the privileged are not necessarily powerful.')
