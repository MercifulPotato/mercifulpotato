Im in the second group and am taking it pretty well—I certainly don’t miss my 4+ hour per day commute, and I am dreading going back to having to be in the office. But I can also see how this is pretty much prison for people who decided to live in the city.<p>I never thought I’d like remote work or could be productive that way, but now I’m convinced. But I definitely need the private space to do it. I could never do this from a 400 sqft apartment.')
