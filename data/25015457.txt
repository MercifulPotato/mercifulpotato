I liked the ease with which you can set row&#x2F;column-level permissions.<p>However, REST is so much easier to build and query. Normal APIs use GET requests which are easy to cache in a cdn. GraphQL uses POST by default and to cache that you need to convert the request somewhere, either in the cdn or your web server.<p>At the end I realized I was just messing with it for a small project to learn it. It really isn&#x27;t worth it IMO. The problems it claims to solve can be solved with REST provided you understand the issues.')
