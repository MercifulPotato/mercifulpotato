This may be helpful in long-term, but not helpful for onboarding purposes.<p>On the other hand, if you can lower Kotlin to native code, it may be more natural to interact with (of course, there are still these nonsense of Java&#x27;s default UTF-16 string &lt;-&gt; Swift&#x27;s native UTF-8 string conversion).<p>Interoperability between high level languages are just hard. I am skeptical of either way, but I can see how it is more appealing to go from Kotlin to Swift direction.<p>On the other hand, data modeling and high-level data transformation doesn&#x27;t require all language features. It is possible to do such with a limited DSL that supports product &#x2F; sum types, some filter &#x2F; map &#x2F; flatmap &#x2F; zip, and boom, you now have your view models for UI rendering. As long as we&#x27;ve made up our mind on string UTF-16 &#x2F; 8 or have some performant library to do lazy transformation on these. We can go a long way on standardize business logic cross iOS &#x2F; Android platform.')
