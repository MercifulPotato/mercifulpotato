Using the extension, you can get all your data as a single JSON file. I&#x27;ve made the extension completely free and it doesn&#x27;t talk to any servers or send analytics data (as I am often touchy about browser extensions doing this...). It doesn&#x27;t take more than 5-15mins to run, depending on how much data you have and it has a real-time progress bar to communicate how much data is left to get.<p>For Firefox: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;replit-classroom-export-tool&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;replit-classr...</a><p>Tutorial: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MYZI_tX8Nog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MYZI_tX8Nog</a><p>If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to repl.it classroom, please check out <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codingrooms.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codingrooms.com&#x2F;</a> and you can also send us your export file and we&#x27;ll import all your data (with full feature parity) within 24-hours.
