I&#x27;ve just thought &quot;because he has something to sell&quot;! And sure, just a little later in the text:<p>&quot;Eshed provided more information in his newest book, The Universe Beyond the Horizon – conversations with Professor Haim Eshed&quot;<p>Knowing that, I also understand why he waited up to now: &quot;I have nothing to lose. I’ve received my degrees and awards.&quot; He is 87.<p>Ka-ching.<p>Humanity <i>is</i> ready for his book. Aren&#x27;t we lucky?<p>P.S. Two years ago there was a book Haim Eshed co-authored: &quot;Project Management of Technological Innovation&quot;, then, one year ago, he also co-authored &quot;Satellites and the New Space&quot;... This year  the world was really ready for... literally a book about Men in Black -- if we&#x27;re to believe the journalists! This latest one, the said &quot;conversations with&quot; is a book where he is being <i>interviewed</i> and <i>the writer interviewing him is Hagar Yanai</i>, the &quot;author of novels and fantasy books&quot; who received &quot;the Deborah Omer Prize for children and youth and three Geffen Prizes for Israeli fantasy&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hagar_Yanai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hagar_Yanai</a> I also wouldn&#x27;t mind telling her whatever she asked. And I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the journalists haven&#x27;t covered the whole story up to now, about what&#x27;s actually written in the book and how it came to be. I&#x27;d really like to read an interview with her about the book.')
