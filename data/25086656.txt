DoorDash will still face many regulatory challenges, but none of the points made in that parent statement are reflected in the S-1.<p>This type of statements and the type of people behind them are the only reason why startups are successful. On paper, two people in a garage have no chance against a multi-billion dollar conglomerate. Except that in many of those companies, there&#x27;s a dude walking around and sharing those wonderfully brutal views.<p>Let&#x27;s get very specific - why didn&#x27;t Amazon launch food delivery? Clearly, they are keeping an eye on the space and are trying to make Instacart&#x27;s life as difficult as possible. There&#x27;s a very good chance that there&#x27;s someone at Amazon who at some point said a bunch of rubbish about this idea and slowed down their expansion into this space, which is now going to be extremely expensive. But it will certainly come, and that dude will have cost his employer billions of dollars.<p>The same way that we drag people over the coals when their startups fail and burn millions of dollars, I think we should do the same with the people who cost their employers the same amount of money.')
