I had a Fitbit Ionic, their most expensive smartwatch at the time, and it was a somewhat helpful heartrate monitor. It had an SpO2 sensor built in which was advertised, but it didn&#x27;t work in the <i>years</i> I had the watch on my wrist, and only recently became an available feature, around when Apple added the same to theirs.<p>And Apple put an ECG machine on people&#x27;s wrists. Even my SO&#x27;s Watch SE, which lacks the fancier new sensors is lightyears beyond where Fitbit is.<p>And Google will destroy Fitbit.
