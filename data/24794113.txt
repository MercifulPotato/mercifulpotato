Sure, they would prefer people use CloudFormation&#x2F;CDK, but they still get vendor lock-in if they support Terraform. In fact, they&#x27;d probably get even more vendor lock-in. As it stands, the Terraform provider is full of annoying bugs. It&#x27;s still very usable, but if you dive deep, especially with newer AWS services, you&#x27;re in for some headaches.')
