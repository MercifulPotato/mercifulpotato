I know there are a lot of people on here much smarter than me. Hopefully someone here can educate or correct me.<p>My understanding about Linux cron and daylight savings changes, is that Linux will automatically adjust the runtime to account for the change in time between the UTC cron expression and the local timezone set in the OS.<p>It seems that AWS cron expressions do not make this compensation. I&#x27;m not sure why this is. Is this due to the AWS servers using UTC eventhough they are us-east, or that AWS has their own implementation that doesn&#x27;t handle this?<p>I see that the standard approach is to create a Lambda that runs during the time change to modify the cron expressions. That just seems clunky to me, especially if Linux already does this adjustment automatically.<p>I must me missing something. Anyone care to share their thoughts?')
