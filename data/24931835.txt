Item(by='TheOperator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603986880, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929338, text='&gt;I&#x27;m reading a lot of comments here saying that CoCs are categorically bad. Which absolutely isn&#x27;t what Jeremy is saying in this post, in fact he says just the opposite.<p>Him talking about supports a code of conduct was like listening to a shooting victim talking about how they support gun rights.  It&#x27;s like walking into his hospital room, him sitting up, and instantly going into a monologue about how the 2nd amendment protects us from tyranny.  It reminds one of the the &quot;Leopards eating faces&quot; meme.  If this post sold a code of conduct as a way to fight back against trumped up charges by being able to compare your behavior to stated rules, and expose arbitrariness, I think he might have actually made code of conducts sound like a great thing.  Yet instead be defended CoC&#x27;s by questioning the character of their critics with the line<p>&gt;the anti-CoC crowd might jump on this as an example of problems with codes of conduct more generally, or might point at this as part of “cancel culture” (a concept I vehemently disagree with, since what is referred to as “cancellation” is often just “facing consequences”).<p>That&#x27;s just such a bizarre and weird response given he did literally get cancelled regardless of if he likes it or not and is making a post arguing he&#x27;s not just &quot;facing consequences&quot;.  He&#x27;s like the person in the welfare lineup who thinks everybody around him is a lazy bum.')
