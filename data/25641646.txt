A lot of &quot;knowledge worker&quot; unions decide to do this, hoping it&#x27;s worth it for the institutional support they&#x27;ll get. Some grad student unions were formed under United Auto Workers in recent years, oddly enough. I&#x27;m not an organizer, and I don&#x27;t really have an informed opinion about whether it&#x27;s worth it.<p>One hopes that these old unions could be revived with a bunch of new membership. What I described above is how they are now, not how they have to be.<p>Worth noting also that even unions with totally screwed up leadership often have passionate and talented organizers with a lot of experience and institutional know-how at the lower levels, just like tech companies.')
