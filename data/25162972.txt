The next option is 500 grams which is 17 oz, at $6.67. 13 oz would probably be somewhere in the middle. And of course US prices have gone up since 2015.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uspsoig.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;document-library-files&#x2F;2015&#x2F;RARC-WP-16-003.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uspsoig.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;document-library...</a>')
