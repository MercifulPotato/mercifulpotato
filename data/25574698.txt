However, all signs point to it being properly handled (it&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s interest), so my advice to laymen is to not worry about it.<p>It&#x27;s true that even near-Earth space is crazy, crazy big so that the amount of volume occupied by debris is extremely tiny, but what&#x27;s <i>also</i> true is that debris is moving <i>fantastically</i> fast so that the volume &quot;effectively occupied&quot; by debris is only small rather than extremely tiny.  This cashes out in the empirical facts (which fit perfectly with our models) that there have been four unintended collisions between satellites and debris:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Satellite_collision" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Satellite_collision</a><p>These have all taken place in the past 25 year (despite &gt; 50 years of spaceflight) because the density is increasing.  If the density keeps increasing without the forthcoming mitigation efforts, the rate of unintentional collisions would keep rising to bad levels.')
