So I stopped doing all that and started focusing on just improving myself.<p>Some will use, in my opinion, bullshit justifications of &quot;oh, when I&#x27;m rich and powerful, I will use my influence to solve blah blah blah&quot; &quot;it&#x27;s more effective to be very wealthy and donate money to solve problems than volunteer in your spare time at a soup kitchen&quot; etc. I&#x27;ve met dozens of MBA types and otherwise that subscribe to this type of nonsense. Every one of them has been a megalomaniac. Maybe that&#x27;s what I am now, too, but if so I&#x27;m not pretending to be anything else.<p>To give an example, I don&#x27;t care what happened with GME and robinhood, though I am certain that AOC and her ilk will use this situation to justify raising taxes and regulations supposedly on the hedge funds but I&#x27;ll be eating a fair share of that too. It just means I need to increase my earnings and mitigate my risk&#x2F;exposure as much as I can. We can sit around and rail at the system but I am not a genius or super capable, I went to state school and wasn&#x27;t a great student; I have no real business telling everyone how to organize society. It&#x27;s fun to brainstorm about and that&#x27;s why I love HN but I&#x27;m just going to find the best path I can through this shit and hope for the best. If you&#x27;re anything like me, I advise you do the same.')
