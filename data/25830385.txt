I mentioned in another comment, but the model you are using the labels to build and the labelling process are related but not the same, they have different fundamental constraints and rely on different techniques. You can&#x27;t have a human in the loop to help you out in a live model as an example.<p>You are right there are a bunch of difficult problems this technique isn&#x27;t perfect for, but it actually can still help improve the efficiency of labelling a lot and when I do it I get the added bonus of understanding the dataset a lot better.')
