It is a transfer of power to whoever controls the machines. This centralising power can be abused in ways people can only imagine. Of course, people will give up what’s left of their control and power in the name of “safety and security”, they’ve been doing that since 9&#x2F;11. So much so that we have the term post-9&#x2F;11 to remind them to toe the line (and to kneel and take off their shoes).<p>Imagine for instance there is a bush fire and your centrally controlled car decides that the fire is fake news and prevents you from leaving since it’ll cause congestion on the roads. No different from Twitter banning the NY post story. Maybe they decide NY Post headquarters  is not a real place and refuse to navigate the car there.<p>Yeah we should implement some kind of social credit system so that people who do drugs can’t drive or take public transport. They’ve got that in the modern utopia of China right now.')
