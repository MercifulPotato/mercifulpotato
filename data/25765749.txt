Looks like OS X is around 16-17% of desktop operating system share though. So the ~82% of buyers still buying x86 are going to continue choosing between Intel and AMD.<p>Apple M1 has some people believing that suddenly everyone will stop buying x86 chips and buy Apple <i>unless</i> someone releases a competitive ARM based chip for Windows&#x2F;Linux. I&#x27;d like to see some evidence for that premise, though.<p>Apple&#x27;s messaging has always been &quot;better designed hardware + better software experience&quot;, and yet they still haven&#x27;t breached 20% market share. A CPU that increases battery life (and yes performs very well) but still can&#x27;t be bought with your Windows PC isn&#x27;t going to rapidly change the market share. It could erode it over time, but this is certainly just conjecture, not proof. Let&#x27;s revisit the conversation in 5 years and see what Apple, Intel and AMD have done, technologically, and what consumers have decided.')
