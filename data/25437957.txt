To make it run, you&#x27;d have to beg the author of the emulator to actually support your chip.<p>This is more than a silly, pedantic distinction; emulators are probably the way that &gt;95% of the current SNES playerbase runs the software, and they&#x27;re likely to remain that way â€¦ forever?  I don&#x27;t see the interest in running SNES games ever really going away, since they&#x27;re fun in a timeless way (like classic books&#x2F;film), so emulators that support it are likely to stick around for several centuries, barring civilizational collapse.  Actual hardware&#x27;s pretty close to dying out (the recent &quot;SNES Classic&quot; physical devices, afaik, are just neatly packaged emulators).<p>So I think it really does matter whether it runs in an emulator or not.<p>(Not to diminish the fairly awesome technical prowess of this hack)')
