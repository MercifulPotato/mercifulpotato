Meaning any science regarding people e.g. social sciences, psychology, behavioural studies - are effectively privatized.<p>Meaning, the paper of psychology grad-student who did a experiment and asked 200 people on campus is less valuable,  as the internal report of some fb-data scientists, who wrote a query and a filter and send the very same question into the production database.<p>So if a whole branch of the sciences is effectively privatized, why do we even pretend the outside branches are anything then a publicly subsidized hobby?<p>Why is there no real discussion about the moral problem of privatized sciences, selling the knowledge and advantage gained as manipulation lever to politicians?')
