I know I&#x27;ve been with teams that I had to drag through projects because they &quot;get paid the same&quot; whether or not it ever gets finished, and well-complemented teams where we forgot everything else while we built on each other&#x27;s achievements.<p>There&#x27;s selfish, winner takes all competition that creates winners and losers, and then there&#x27;s healthy, productive competition where everyone who engages comes out better off for challenging themselves against a peer.<p>And obviously, there has to be a culture that provides resources no matter the outcomes.
