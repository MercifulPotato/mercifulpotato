Lots of people (including me) actively report animal abuse channels which youtube seems to pay little regard to. This issue was reported by penguinz0, Officer Paw Patrol, PaymoneyWubby and various other youtubers before. In the mean time accounts like &#x27;Peluchin Entertainment&#x27; (kid that tortured and killed his cat and uploaded it to YT) is still up (it was banned after few months of internet outrage, but it&#x27;s up again).')
