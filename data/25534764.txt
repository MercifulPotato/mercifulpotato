I think most people work on Open Source because they _want_ to foster a community around their work and see it grow into a life of its own. In that regard its not surprising most Open Source projects offer free support initially and slowly try to incorporate other maintainers who also offer free support!<p>This is ideologically good, but I wonder if it is really sustainable.
