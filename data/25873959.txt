I&#x27;m not that pretty and not all that eager to share the interior of my dwelling.  I do however care about sound quality.  With my accent and mumbling I need all the help I can get.  Others reported that the camera in their phone beats most webcams, but what about the microphone(-array)?  The sound quality of phablets hasn&#x27;t quite won me over.  Is there anything better available, short of equipment for professional musicians?')
