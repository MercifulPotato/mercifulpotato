An http server serves files independent of the client&#x2F;user-agentâ€“that&#x27;s how the web works. If a work is published this way then that&#x27;s the expectation. If YouTube and the RIAA want it to work another way, then use a different protocol&#x2F;medium and put the content behind a login and limit access.<p>I&#x27;m not saying people should be free then to republish&#x2F;share copyrighted works. Just that we are free to use tools to retrieve files that have been served openly via the web.')
