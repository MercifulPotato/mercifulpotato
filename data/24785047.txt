I started with `three.js` about two years ago and a ton of documentation.  I didn&#x27;t write a sculpting tool, but I wrote a PoC for a tool that &quot;renders&quot; custom tessellated data, pan&#x2F;tilt&#x2F;zoom, by the documentation from their site in about a weeks&#x27; time[0].<p>[0] I do more back-end than front-end, but I did the PoC in React&#x2F;TypeScript with a kludge for the Canvas and a few ugly functions for handling loading&#x2F;camera positions.')
