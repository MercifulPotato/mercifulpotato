How do you expect to capture the carbon piece into a stable compound that can be buried without expending more energy? Please draw this chemical reaction out, along with energy balances and how endothermic it is.<p>If you read the article, you&#x27;d see:<p>&gt; Nowadays, Industrial production accounts for one-quarter of CO2  emissions from energy and industrial processes. With the demand for cement, steel and chemicals remaining strong to support a growing and increasingly urbanised global population, the future production of these materials will have to be more efficient and emit much less CO2 if governments want to meet their climate goals.<p>In other words, this technology is not targeted at capturing carbon that is burned for energy.')
