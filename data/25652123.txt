Item(by='runako', descendants=None, kids=[25652263], score=None, time=1609885879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652037, text='I&#x27;m strictly speaking of people who have been accused and not convicted. (Keep in mind that in the US, all of these people fall into the category &quot;innocent.&quot;)<p>From arrest to trial can easily be over a year. The simple fact is rich people like Sacks will not ever stay in jail during that period, while the poor and middle class often do (because they don&#x27;t have access to the money to pay bail). This is very clearly a two-tiered system.<p>To be clear: even facing a $1m or $5m bail, someone like Sacks would walk free the day after arrest and be free until convicted in court. This is simply not true for most people, who will sit in a cell for months to over a year waiting for trial. Where Sacks is innocent until proven guilty, poorer people are guilty until proven innocent (because they will have served time either way).<p>&gt; If you have deep pockets and you clearly wrong somebody then you have a very big target on your back. Any number of lawyers will be tripping over themselves to make justice is served.<p>This is naive thinking at best. Rich people are also a prime source of campaign donations. Nobody wants to impair a potential donor.')
