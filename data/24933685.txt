The way to determine causality here is through a combination of physical laws and controlled experimentation [1]. In fact, we have plenty of causal models (e.g. 1st principles physics-based models, or design-of-experiments models). Without these models, machines&#x2F;control systems&#x2F;etc would not work.<p>The trouble is, outside of these 1st-order effect dominant, deterministic environments, causality becomes much harder. In complex systems, stochasticity, nonlinearity, feedback loops and higher-order effects dominate. There&#x27;s also emergent behavior -- properties that are true in the small are not true in the large.<p>Consider a complex system like human society -- can we truly determine causality of broad interventions? Likely not in a first-order way like in the physical sciences. We can do it imperfectly through tools like causal inference (Rubin) which makes much more modest claims about the &quot;strength&quot; of effects (average causal effect). Randomized Controlled Tests (RCT) is another tool for making causal claims.<p>But in a complex world, 2nd, 3rd and higher order effects dominate and so the notion of root causes itself becomes ambiguous. Richard I. Cook once said &quot;post-accident attribution to a &#x27;root cause&#x27; is fundamentally wrong&quot;. Though humans are attracted to the idea of a chain of simple causes (which is why we have the myth of Mrs O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s cow kick over a lantern and starting the Great Chicago Fire of 1871), there&#x27;s typically no easily-identified root cause. First-order causal thinking assumes a Directed-Acyclic-Graph (DAG) idea of a causality chain which converge into a set of effects, but the reality is that such a DAG, if it can be represented, is likely to be infinitely complex in a complex environment.\nFirst-order causal thinking is an insufficient mental model in a complex environments.<p>Instead, I think instead of aiming for a deep understanding of epistemic causality (where we try to know and represent causality), it&#x27;s probably more useful to focus on instrumental causality (where we aim to know the main points of leverage that are effective in changing the system). I think we&#x27;ll likely get very far just by finding the knobs that have the most effect on the variables we would like to change (that don&#x27;t also simultaneously change variables that we wouldn&#x27;t want to change).<p>[1] to determine causality, we typically have to perturb the system -- determining causality through observational data is possible, e.g. via natural experiments, but there are many epistemic restrictions which limit the claims that can be made.')
