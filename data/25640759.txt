FB and Twitter can (and have) destroyed peoples lives in more ways than one.<p>Knowing about history can be important when evaluating and thinking about some of these ideas.  Most people I have seen posting comments to your comment are rehashing arguments that were at the core of the Cubby v. CompuServe some thirty years ago.<p>FB and Twitter MODERATE and control everything on their systems.  This places them in a position of responsibility.  While IANAL, I think I can say this is a case of legal precedent.  Are there cases that reverse or modify Cubby v. CompuServe?<p>For all their AI prowess they sure as heck seem to just suck at it when it comes to moderating for quality.
