Having been raised an atheist, my memories of my Catholic School recitations are imperfect but you are clearly correct.<p>The modern day &#x2F; ancient day distinction is akin to the difference between the <i>Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</i> and <i>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and The Kingdom of God</i>: it is obvious to adherents and invisible to those without.<p>Creating distinctions temporally does me no benefit. What has been can be once again. What was done to my great-grandparents can be done to me. The entities that did these things can revert to their atavistic forms. Except, except, except if they fix their forms forward. Something I will gladly accept.')
