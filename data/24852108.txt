I have my workflow integrated with starting on the internet with a &quot;clean slate&quot;. yes things take a bit longer being signed out but using a password manager mitigates this somewhat. I have never had a problem with resetting my config and have been using the design for at least 2 years worth of chrome updates (with a few &quot; resets&quot; of my safe config)')
