Without them, the system would collapse and they would lose their investment.<p>Bitcoin is a vehicle for transfering wealth from the FOMO ignorant crowd who shouldn&#x27;t be speculating on ponzi schemes. So many ruined lives because little guys bought into crypto, ICO, and other false hopes.<p>Bitcoin will bankrupt a lot more people I&#x27;m afraid.')
