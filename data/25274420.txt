The fact that this was gonna be an alpha test of new technology was clear from the start. Taping out with a modern PDK and open source tools just hasn&#x27;t been done before. Also, the caravel requirement has been known for at least three months. True the design wasn&#x27;t done yet and the details were sparse, but saying it was added two weeks before the tapeout deadline is disingenuous when it was announced at the start of the program. As for not taking your money to get your own tapeout, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be most happy to do so once they&#x27;ve worked out the kinks, which is exactly what they&#x27;re using the shuttle runs for.<p>(Not affiliated with the project in any way, just watching closely out of professional interest).')
