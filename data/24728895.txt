They&#x27;re really happy if you adopt things like Swift, Metal, SpriteKit etc, because then you&#x27;re unlikely to want to port to spend time to port to Android.<p>Where as if you use OpenGL ES 3.0 your game, for the most part, your game just works. (having done both). I&#x27;m not advocating for OpenGL (yuck), just saying it&#x27;s a real factor to use something portable vs not. Of course now-a-days most devs use an engine for which that&#x27;s already taken care of but it certainly wasn&#x27;t that way in the past when these types of complaints of lock-in came up for DirectX vs OpenGL and C# vs C&#x2F;C++ etc. They&#x27;re no less valid for Apple than Microsoft.')
