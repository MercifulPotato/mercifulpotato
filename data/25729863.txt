I hope I don&#x27;t do that myself but try to understand the matter and follow principles rather than sides.<p>What I&#x27;m surprised the most is that with these complex and not obvious questions (at least to me) people without any shadow of a doubt are certain that it is right for big tech to censor Trump, shut down parler and take political sides like it happened.<p>Maybe Trump is bad but at least i want to see his stupidity or his wrongdoing rather than other people to chew the news and feed me like im an infant.<p>To me these questions require philosophical debates and dialogue (even with myself) to understand f it is right for a company to impose their political worldview on their clients - I don&#x27;t feel it is right.<p>But if others take these positions very easily, to me that is an indication that they got these ideas from somebody else rather than thought them through.')
