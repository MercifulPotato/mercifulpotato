Some of the parts are available freely: I&#x27;m guessing not all are.<p>Manufacturing will need to be different as well if your pieces aren&#x27;t designed to be repaired in such a way: Who knows if this would be more environmentally friendly.<p>Not to mention that it is a skill, so a repair might not even repair it but break it further - but now we&#x27;ve made the tools and things on top of the furniture (that didn&#x27;t even use up scraps of wood, but caused them).')
