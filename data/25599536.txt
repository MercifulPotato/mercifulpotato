A user&#x27;s group memberships need only be evaluated once when they log on, with a refresh every few minutes at most.<p>Access control lists can be easily cached, and then most access checks can be performed entirely in-memory.<p>Instead of evaluating the full ACL every time, an additional trick is to take the cryptographic hash of the ACL and use that as a cache key. This both deduplicates the ACLs (which tend to be repetitive), and also allows (ACL,UserId) tuples to be efficiently cached.<p>This way, a page with even a hundred controls becomes effectively a hundred hashtable lookups the second time it is viewed, and even the first time it is opened the overhead is no more than a millisecond.<p>If turning off security makes a noticeable difference like you said, Atlassian has done <i>none</i> of these basic things. It indicates to me an incredible level of negligence.')
