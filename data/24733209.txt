That is still a big problem for personal transportation in cars, planes, trains, buses and whatever. But personal transportation is not the source of all CO2 generated. There are homes, in most parts of the northern hemisphere they have to be heated. Replacing all those heating systems before there normal end of life, is a huge additional amount of CO2 to blow into the air. Running the same heaters, ovens, cars with a CO2 neutral produced methane seems to be way more cost- and CO2-efficient, at least in the medium term.')
