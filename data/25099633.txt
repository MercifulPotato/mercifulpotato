Also, I&#x27;d rather enable applications from all sources permitted to be run because you already get prompted when running those for the first time (using `sudo spctl --master-disable` which is reversible). I do not download apps from random sources or use pirated stuff so I&#x27;m less willing to put up with that sort of restrictions. Also `AppCleaner` is something I think is a must-have on a system because of files being left over when an app is deleted.')
