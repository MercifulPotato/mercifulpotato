There is, and it&#x27;s _huge_, because light is actually quite slow and no tech can improve on that.<p>Makes me think people that say this have never played on a high end PC, which in turn has lower latency compared to a last gen console. And that&#x27;s considering the fact that even modern PC have a TON of latency. NVIDIA seems to be working towards that, thankfully.<p>I bet playing Quake 3 Arena multiplayer on Stadia would be noticeably worse that on a PC from 20 years ago.')
