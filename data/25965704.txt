Some ambitious kid, in some random corner of the world, is going to cut and paste it and sell it to some police dept as a &quot;Google&quot; profiler. It will work as badly as the police do, but now they just point at the app to cover their ass, cause you know Google said so Judge. Where it doesnt do what the cops want the kid will add &quot;features&quot; to make sure it does. Give it a year or two and the local PD will be happily be promoting it to everyone else for a decent commision ofcourse. &quot;Whistleblowers&quot; will get taken care off. VCs will step in to scale up ops. The price will be so cheap it will bankrupt most honest competition. Half the world will be using it soon enough and then ofcourse Palantir will step in and buy them. The billionaire founder will then strut around grooming the next gen, funding further mindlessness. And the same thing will repeat from Medicine to the Military, from Finance to Psychology all the while a clueless buffoon class of corporate programmed robots stand up and talk about how they are empowering the masses.<p>So how do we stop the cycle? Dont empower the masses. Just yet. Dont work for execs pushing such narratives. If you are in positions of authority sideline them. They dont know what they are doing. Scaling everything is a prime directive for these robots and they are too dumb and unimaginative to rewrite their own code let alone decide what is good for the population.')
