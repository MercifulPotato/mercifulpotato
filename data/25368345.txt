In the evenings&#x2F;nights when they have done all settlements, cleaned up the data and executed their batch jobs they can send you their view of things in the form of positions and transactions.<p>From there it&#x27;s easiest to start comparing positions and if they deviate then have the system match everything that has happened in both systems since they last matched in order to find the faulty transaction(s). After that you should be ready for the next business day, where you have to keep track of how the state is affected by your trades and other events during the day.<p>Then the cycle repeats.')
