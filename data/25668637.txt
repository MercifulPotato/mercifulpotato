He’d even break the highest constitutional law of the land if he could get away with it, and not relinquish power.\nHowever good thing we’ve respected and kept the 2nd amendment law of the land, so there is a force who will not allow him to break that law of the land.\nWeirdly enough though Trump is taking a play from the “who cares if we don’t follow the constitution” crowd.<p>Will the constitution lovers prove to be hypocrites, and be fine with breaking it here?\nWill those who have argued for unconstitutional laws to be passed via the Supreme Court be annoyed, when his newly elected scota judges reinterpret the constitution to let him remain president?<p>Let’s hope that he elected judges who take the constitution written as is so he is firmly booted out of his office without the government to back him Or else it smells like a civil war. Not the North and South this time, but probably rural vs city, across all states.\nThat is a scary thought.')
