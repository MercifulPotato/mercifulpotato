How about we ban unpaid time off?<p>Any barriers to work (i.e. regulation) just accelerates AI taking over all the jobs. Anything that drives up the cost of labour, just means more automation like self-serve kiosks or robo security guards today; and who knows what tomorrow.<p>If you want to solve societal inequality and provide a safety net, which is something I 100% back, do that through taxation + a universal basic income.')
