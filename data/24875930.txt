Unlike some others, my &#x27;migration&#x27; worked, but YT Music sucks.  Sorry to be blunt and short, but that&#x27;s how I best describe it.  It&#x27;s in every way worse than GPM for my use.  I legally buy songs, and just want to stream them.  YT Music is obsessed with, after playing an upload, playing random music with ads in it, rather than say, playing the next upload.  The only thing that works without much complaints is a playlist, so that&#x27;s good I guess.  I can&#x27;t even figure out if&#x2F;how I can purchase music from it, which is really annoying.')
