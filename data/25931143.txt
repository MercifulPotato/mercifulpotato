And I&#x27;d have to say: I&#x27;m still a misfit, social pariah, currently with no friends. Ironically the most respect (I mean this in the most basic sense of respect) I get from other humans is on here. But things were better when I was younger and worse now that I am 31.  I&#x27;m not misremembering having more friends when I had places to go and do things in person, I definitely did. And these days I find it increasingly difficult to talk to people who have ever shrinking attention spans. Why is meme speak becoming pervasive in spoken language? Even when I call my mother she can&#x27;t put down her Facebook or emails for a few minutes to talk. We used to be close. She says she has no time for anything. She&#x27;s a book publisher and doesn&#x27;t have time to read the one or two articles I send her every 6 months or so. Even when they are strictly about her field of work. She reads the first paragraph and says she got the &quot;gist&quot;, which means we can&#x27;t talk about it because she has no idea what the other 20 pages said, nor does she care because... well &quot;haven&#x27;t you seen the top reddit post today. I can&#x27;t believe (random person) said (random comment) to (random other person)&quot;<p>To me so many people have just become very boring. I mean what&#x27;s worth saying&#x2F;reading that takes 3-5 seconds, really? It&#x27;s not that I think the internet or online social communication is all bad, or course it&#x27;s not, but in my experience the bad does outweigh the good. And with suicide and depression rates rising beyond a standard deviation in gen z girls it&#x27;s hard to feel as if it were worse from them in the past.')
