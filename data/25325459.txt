When I started the project was a few scripts on github and it&#x27;s grown into a fully-fledged (excellent) product.  If you&#x27;re in the market for this I highly recommend you check them out.  You can get pretty far with the free plan, and the paid is priced just right ($3&#x2F;month right now) so that&#x27;s what I do to support them.<p>I have also used ImprovMX and had good success there, although I ended up leaving because the free plan was too limiting and the paid plan was too much ($10&#x2F;month last I checked).<p>Both services have great UX.  It&#x27;s hard to go wrong.  I&#x27;ll probably try out Mailway as well just for comparison.<p>Note I&#x27;m not affiliated in any way with forwardemail or ImprovMX, just a happy user.')
