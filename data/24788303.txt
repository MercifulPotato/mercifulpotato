I live glued to my Kobo e-book reader and love reading novels and non-fiction from 300 dpi e-ink screen.<p>However, e-ink lacks speed and color. The papers I read use a lot of color in diagrams and waiting for e-ink screen to refresh, reduce its color palette to accelerate and re-refresh to return its previous mode is both distracting and flow breaking for me.<p>Also, I use a lot of colors for different things on paper. Different highlighters for different stuff (yellow for &quot;further research&quot;, blue to &quot;remember this part&quot;), etc.<p>iPad with Good reader is almost as good as my workflow but this thing is heavy, backlit screens are eye-straining...<p>Since PDFs are not made for screens it&#x27;s also distracting to zoom and scroll too.<p>So we need another format (maybe ePub) for academic papers to read them effectively on digital devices.')
