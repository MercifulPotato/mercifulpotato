So espacially with all this worldwide awareness and fear I find it easy to imagine that there will be an increased afford to detect virsus leading to maybe one new virus in focus every few years keeping the whole system in an alarmed state (including all the &quot;special&quot; [reading the permanent] laws) active for the whole time. Generations growing up from now on may not even know the times before. Same as with the &quot;terror&quot; theme now. Every few month there are reports about terrorist attacks and the whole thing becomes a meme and is used to justify anything.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deutsch.medscape.com&#x2F;artikelansicht&#x2F;4908831" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deutsch.medscape.com&#x2F;artikelansicht&#x2F;4908831</a>')
