I’m pretty convinced the UK’s push to make all 18+ education a 3+ year university qualification was to improve employment figures for that age category. Bit of a long con, eg: go to uni to study early years development with 3 contact hours a week and once that’s the only way to become a nursery school teacher charge £9k a year for uni fees for a job that pays maybe £20k a year. I know so many 25 year olds who’s student loan interest rate is higher than the amount that is deducted from their pay check by the student loans co earning in the mid 30k region')
