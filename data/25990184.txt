Basketball for people who want it, games for people who want it, etc. If you want people join team building events, I don&#x27;t think the right approach is to mandate one thing, but to give people choices &amp; let people own their team building experience.<p>I also think the flip side of this is that management also has to understand that it&#x27;s fine if not every single team member contributes to every team building activity - my team had to give our manager that feedback recently.')
