This looks really cool. I&#x27;m probably not going to <i>need</i> a corneal transplant at this point (since my condition appears to have stabilized with age) but I&#x27;m definitely going to follow this. Even with correction the acuity in one of my eyes is very bad (like, can&#x27;t read 16 point font at arm&#x27;s length bad). Since this method takes the tissue rejection concern out of the equation I wonder if an &quot;elective&quot; corneal transplant might be an option down the road.')
