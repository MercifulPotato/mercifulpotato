I always stash articles into Pocket, Evernote and by the time I get around to them it feels more like a chore to get around reading them in order... I feel like making this into a book adds a little serendipity to the experience since I can just open to a random article.<p>A suggestion: maybe some auto tagging and ordering the articles by topic or source? It might not be that technically expensive to do + adds to the organization value? I hate when I browse my to-read list and I just find a sea of productivity or tech articles when I really just don&#x27;t want to see those that day.')
