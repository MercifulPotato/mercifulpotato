Item(by='Wowfunhappy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609878285, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25648413, text='&gt; Here in the northeast, it&#x27;s horrible in the winter when it&#x27;s dark by 4:30 pm. For a lot of people, it&#x27;s a huge life upgrade to change that to 5:30 pm.<p>Just to be clear, I live in New York City. It gets dark at 4:30 this time of year. I know how frustrating that is.<p>I just think getting up an hour earlier in the morning is clearly worse, and I think we&#x27;d all realize that if it happened. Others have posted some great studies in this thread, but really for me, the clearest evidence is that on days when people have the ability to sleep later, <i>that&#x27;s what they do.</i> They don&#x27;t care that they&#x27;re wasting sunlight, they stay up late at night and sleep late in the morning.<p>The numbers on the clock are arbitraryâ€”changing it only changes the time when people are <i>obligated</i> to wake up, for societal commitments. Our society is already too optimized for early risers, and late risers are paying the price. I don&#x27;t think we should make the problem worse just so we can shift around our hours of sunlight.')
