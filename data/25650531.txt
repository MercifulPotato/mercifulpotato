For a lot of people, it&#x27;s a huge life upgrade to change that to 5:30 pm.<p>Just to be clear, I live in New York City. It gets dark at 4:30 this time of year. I know how frustrating that is.<p>But I also think that if this bill passed, most would discover that getting up an hour earlier in the morning is clearly worse. Others have posted some great studies in this thread, but for me, the clearest evidence is still that on days when people have the <i>ability</i> to sleep later, <i>that&#x27;s what they do.</i> We stay up late on Friday evenings and sleep in late on Saturday mornings, without a care for all of the wasted Saturday daylight.<p>The numbers on a clock are arbitraryâ€”you can change them, but all you&#x27;re really changing are the societal commitments for which people are <i>obligated</i> to wake up. Our society is <i>already</i> too optimized for early risers, and late risers are paying the price. I don&#x27;t think we should make the problem even worse just so we can shift around a few hours of sunlight.')
