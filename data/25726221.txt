Missing a lot of convenient features. I used KDE instead which had all the features I expected plus some more that Windows didn&#x27;t have yet but totally should have.<p>I was always wondering why Gnome is so weird and broken. Why does it exist? Who uses it? I found out when I got my hands on first Macbook in my life. While KDE mirrors Windows, Gnome mirrored some version of MacOS. Using MacOS was as horrible for me as using Gnome. A lot of basic features that I took for granted in Windows and KDE were missing or hidden so weirdly that I couldn&#x27;t find them without googling. And I had to google each time I needed them because placement was so weird that my brain just refused to remember something this stupid. And yet some people used Macs, liked Macs, adjusted their daily routines to work with something that for me was missing basic functionality. And praising it! &quot;Of course! That&#x27;s how it works! That&#x27;s what the plunger is for! That&#x27;s completely intuitive!&quot;<p>M1 chip might be all the rage but I refuse to touch Mac again till their os gets decent free window manager and file manager as alternative. Same way I&#x27;m not touching Gnome.')
