I fail to see how replicas can help if your input comes from that many clients doing writes, each already having an internal pool.<p>I tried various other things, like an unlogged table on the input side, but nothing helped much.<p>I have tested with and without pgbouncer, and the case isn&#x27;t as clear cut as it seems. It helps a bit, but it adds complexity.<p>This complexity is not readily apparent, but you have to separately manage the userlist, you must not get your auth types out of sync (md5&#x2F;scram), and so on...<p>The only reason pgbouncer stays is that I don&#x27;t want to mess with it again, but it&#x27;s death by a thousand paper cuts, enough to complexify deployment and updates to a point where I&#x27;m thinking of calling it quit and using a different database in front of postgres.')
