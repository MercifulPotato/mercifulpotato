Mobile devices are the exact opposite of what you want for p2p to function smoothly. The devices are always going offline, they move around and acquire new IP addresses, they can&#x27;t run things in the background without significant battery drain. And probably most important: NAT and routing issues. This isn&#x27;t the &#x27;90s where two computers can just freely talk across the internet on any port they want to.<p>At the very minimum you would need a centralized discovery server. At that point you may as well scrap the whole idea anyway.')
