When you are the expert, people come to you for things. You communicate more, but that’s not what made you the expert.<p>I’d posit that attention and communication are both secondary to core competency in software development. My guess is that information synthesis and lateral thinking are the core competencies of great engineers. I don’t think you can get the information you need or as much lateral thinking without attention and communication, but that doesn’t mean they are the core competency.')
