Item(by='nmfisher', descendants=None, kids=[25628055], score=None, time=1609735261, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25627702, text='I&#x27;ll reiterate what I said the last time it came up on HN - this is exactly why I use Firebase, and why OP probably should have done the same.<p>It&#x27;s literally 15 minutes to configure&#x2F;integrate, and you&#x27;re done. You can then move on to building&#x2F;iterating on actual features that matter to customers.<p>Until you&#x27;ve proved you&#x27;re building something that people want to buy, your data layer only needs to do the absolute bare minimum (store some data). It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s not scaleable, performant, extensible, etc. 99.9% of the risk is that you fail because you&#x27;re <i>not building the right thing</i>, not that you fail because Firebase wasn&#x27;t appropriate.<p>You have a limited number of hours in every day, and they are much better spent building features side-by-side with customers. You won&#x27;t even know that Firebase is a bottleneck unless&#x2F;until your platform is successful, and at that point you&#x27;re in a good position to migrate&#x2F;rewrite&#x2F;whatever.<p>A couple of commenters smugly pointed out that they were contracted to fix Firebase issues later down the track, and that&#x27;s why they would stay away from Firebase in the first instance.<p>First up, there&#x27;s clear survivorship bias there - the fact is these businesses <i>survived</i> and were in a position to hire someone to upgrade their data layer. That&#x27;s meaningful in and of itself.<p>Second, don&#x27;t pay too much attention to people who have never bootstrapped anything from the ground-up. What works in a mature, stable, well-funded organization is <i>not</i> what works in a solo, early-stage startup that&#x27;s strapped for cash, time and equipment.')
