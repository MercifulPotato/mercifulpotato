I would go so far as to say it was a <i>necessary but not sufficient condition</i> for what occurred in the Eastern theatre of WW2.<p>Regarding religion, if the Bible &amp; Quran were explicitly pacifistic and forbade war (instead of glorifying it in certain instances), I believe the world would look quite different. If we accept this, then we accept that the specific contents of the doctrine do play an important causal role. Is it plausible to see Jain individuals becoming terrorists in support of a political objective? It seems rather dubious that that would happen.')
