[1]<p>The standard WiFi experience with their lower-tier all-in-one is terribad, which could easily be solved by buying a WiFi AP and plugging it into their box via Ethernet.<p>German ISPs do the same thing, by offering you the choice of a basic router or a Fritz!Box for a higher fee. In every instance I have seen, you&#x27;re better off selecting the cheapest device your ISP will provide, putting it into bridge mode, and using your own router&#x2F;AP via Ethernet.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.free.fr&#x2F;freebox&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.free.fr&#x2F;freebox&#x2F;</a>')
