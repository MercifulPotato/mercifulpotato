Item(by='clairity', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602540905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756635, text='the title is grossly inaccurate. this is an advertorial for the bone structure company&#x27;s pre-cut metal framing system, not about why prefab hasn&#x27;t taken over. it&#x27;s central reasoning that prefab is advantageous because there&#x27;s not enough construction labor is also misleading. in most places, construction labor much prefers bigger jobs and repeat clients, rather than the harder to deal with idiosyncratic, one-off homebuilder, leaving them with a perception of shortage (even the beginning anecdote mentions getting multiple bids on a project, which wouldn&#x27;t happen amidst a shortage).<p>bone structure pre-cuts the steel framing for each project because it&#x27;s not nearly as easy to deal with on-site as wood framing. it&#x27;s also not cheaper, because wood framing is relatively available everywhere, flexible, reconfigurable on the fly, and easy to manipulate, unlike steel framing.<p>and as others have noted, framing is a small fraction of home construction, and these walls must be put together on site, so it&#x27;s an overreach to even consider this prefab. it&#x27;s just pre-cut.<p>that said, it&#x27;d be great to see more prefab systems, even just embellished boxes, to accelerate housing construction in tight markets, and ones like LA where homelessness is an already widespread and growing problem.')
