They are getting good efficiency numbers and have the toolkit to produce a ton of different EV models quite quickly.  And there is no question VW is good at building cars.<p>The real question is can VW figure out software before Tesla can figure out car manufacturing.  Model Y sharing a large number of components with Model 3 is a decent start, but MEB is generations ahead on component and engineering sharing.  Tesla was able to get out Model Y ahead of schedule, another good sign.<p>Tesla&#x27;s software development is pretty mature (though as an owner I&#x27;d say they are too willing to ship immature capabilities).<p>Building a mature software engineering capability is not easy (which is why Ford has brought in so much former QNX&#x2F;Blackberry talent for Mach E).  Neither is building out a global manufacturing footprint that consistently delivers high volume and low defect counts.')
