Now I just assume I’m below average.<p>&gt; It serves me well. I listen more. I ask a lot of questions. I’ve stopped thinking others are stupid. I assume most people are smarter than me.<p>&gt; To assume you’re below average is to admit you’re still learning. You focus on what you need to improve, not your past accomplishments.<p>I dunno, I&#x27;m not convinced this is what &quot;assuming you&#x27;re below average&quot; really looks like. At least not all of it.<p>When I think I&#x27;m below average I go along with decisions I disagree with; &quot;that&#x27;s not the strategy I&#x27;d go for but you&#x27;re the person who actually knows our customers&quot; or &quot;that&#x27;s not the architecture I&#x27;d implement but you have more experience with these things&quot;. When I think I&#x27;m above average, I&#x27;ll push back harder. It would be nice to get everyone on the same page, ask questions until either I&#x27;m convinced or they are, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s always realistic.<p>What does Derek do in situations like that?')
