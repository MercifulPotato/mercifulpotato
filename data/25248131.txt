Why must we treat adults as children<p>I am suggesting the opposite. Rather than treat adults as children and censoring what they can and can not see. I am suggesting we give them the skills to critically analyze input they receive.<p>&gt; that we have been entrusted with, and that it is our responsibility to give them &#x27;mental medicine&#x27;? What makes our thinking superior to others&#x27; that we need to lord over them in this way?<p>Why provide any education at all then? As a society it is our responsibility to skill the next generation with the skills they need to operate in our society. I believe critical thinking skills is one of these required skills.<p>&gt; I believe that these ideals are bottom-up. We form governments that align with the ideals of the people, not the other way around<p>I agree with this. But to get the best form of government we need educated and intelligent citizens.<p>&gt; If the people out of choice or ignorance no longer care about the ideals of liberal democracy, who are we to force them onto others?<p>We really are fucked then aren&#x27;t we. I kind of like living in a liberal democracy. If we throw our current system out due to ignorance I am very confident what comes next will not be superior. I&#x27;m not willing to accept that as path we take.')
