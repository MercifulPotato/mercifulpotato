This is because the command and control associated with an ABM is much simpler. I don&#x27;t need to worry so much about operating after nuclear weapons have already gone off. I don&#x27;t have to worry about making sure that the fire order comes from the president. See target, be sure it is a target, shoot the target.<p>This doesn&#x27;t get into virtual attrition. You may have previously targeted 1-2 nukes at different places. But now you don&#x27;t know which ones will actually get intercepted. So you have to send enough warheads to make sure one gets through, or give up on the target.')
