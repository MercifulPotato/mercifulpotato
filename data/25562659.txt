It&#x27;s a steep learning curve to climb for something that doesn&#x27;t really relate to any prior computing experience a typical student could be expected to have today.<p>The teaching time will go down if they stick with this - they&#x27;ll learn what the common errors are, what the common conceptual misunderstandings are, and how best to present the material to their students.  The 1 on 1 tutoring they did this quarter (hopefully) will have given them a lot of insight into what the student experience is like.<p>It looks like they mostly learned a lot about teaching, and how their educational system in particular works.  If they&#x27;re hoping to keep working in the educational space these two things alone will make their time worthwhile.<p>Anyways, it&#x27;s a really interesting article by people who are both passionate about and new to teaching - it&#x27;s a fun read.')
