If you live in other countries you don&#x27;t have the same rights. Companies usually build export systems for GDPR and similar so technically it&#x27;s possible, but there is more reluctance to spend (human) time on such requests when it&#x27;s not absolutely neccessary.<p>As European users the best approach is likely to write a letter, directed at their data protection officer (they&#x27;re required by law to assign one) and add proof you own the account, by whatever data you used to sign up (e.g. copy of passport doesn&#x27;t help because you probably didn&#x27;t use that to sign up). Even then expect delays, I think they have 4 weeks to reply, and multiple attempt. I&#x27;ve read the first-hand story of somebody going throught the steps with Amazon and it took several months.')
