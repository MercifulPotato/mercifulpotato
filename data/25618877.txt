The more complicated you make the diagnoses and more specific the criteria, the more difficult it becomes to engage with the concept.<p>For the average smartphone user, the criteria for identifying potentially detrimental smartphone addiction needs to be as simple as possible.<p>&gt; But if I described the above as “they were on their phone for 7 hours straight” it sounds unhealthy, even though it’s the same.<p>Being on your phone for 7 hours straight is not healthy, regardless of what you&#x27;re doing. Much better to do work and research on a proper screen that you&#x27;re not holding 9 inches from your face, and much better to sit with proper posture instead of craning your neck at a smartphone.<p>The problem with trying to divide everything into ultra-specific categories is that addicts are very good at rationalizing away their problems. For example, someone addicted to social media might justify it as keeping up with their social life, and someone addicted to 24&#x2F;7 news headlines would justify it as keeping up with current events. Give enough leeway, and an addict can easily justify away 90% of their smartphone usage as beneficial, all while letting a smartphone take away from other, healthier activities in their life.')
