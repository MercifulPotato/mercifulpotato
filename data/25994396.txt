Warm Mist humidifiers work by boiling water. This has the downside of... well... boiling hot water hanging around the area. But otherwise, these are the simplest and are only ~$20 or $30.<p>2. Cool Mist humidifiers try to get around the boiling water issue. Since they humidify at room-temperatures, they&#x27;re a lot more efficient... but now bacteria &#x2F; mold is growing constantly. You can somewhat fix that with chemicals &#x2F; filters &#x2F; whatever, but now those filters need to be cleaned, or those chemicals need to be replaced on the regular.<p>In both circumstances: minerals in the water will harden into &#x27;slag&#x27;. More so in warm-mist humidifiers actually (because boiling water separates water from minerals very naturally). Cool-mist humidifiers often carry the slag into the air, forming &quot;white dust&quot; all over your furniture.<p>The slag dissolves with vinegar in ~20 minutes or so (unless its been building up for a while). But its never an easy job to clean.<p>I prefer my warm-mist humidifier. Centralize the slag into one spot and clean it with vinegar every few weeks. Better than dusting off all my furniture in the room.')
