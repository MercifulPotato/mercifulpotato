Item(by='ashtonkem', descendants=None, kids=[25528255], score=None, time=1608768841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25522560, text='&gt; I provide a counter example where severe social consequences, effectively suppress speech.<p>You listed a crime that might happen, and then asserted that therefore we need more laws to protect speech. I find the argument unpersuasive, for reasons I have already provided.<p>As an aside, I find the hyperbole tiresome. &quot;What if someone gets lynched?&quot; is half a step away from &quot;think of the children&quot; in its triteness, and it&#x27;s a really quick way to make these conversations go off the rail.<p>&gt; Your claim that &quot;not free from consequences&quot; by the letter of the law while legally correct, is ironically, the polar opposite of what freedom of speech actually is.<p>And what, pray tell, do you recommend when the &quot;social consequences&quot; of free speech are also speech? Would you suppress the speech of &quot;the mob&quot; for the sake of the original speaker? Would you force people to associate with those they find noxious against their wills? If so, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re nearly as pro free speech as you think you are. If not, then I&#x27;m not really sure what you&#x27;re actually advocating for, aside from generally being angry at Twitter.')
