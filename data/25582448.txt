He is kind of a black sheep in the high-energy physics world. He has a  PhD in physics from Harvard, so he certainly has the credentials but his academic career stalled&#x2F;never took off, so after some post-docs he took a job at Columbia teaching mathematics and maintaining the computer network of the department. A fact that has not passed unnoticed by his &quot;enemies&quot;(many string theorists),so they use that to mock him and dismiss his not entirely unreasonable criticism of ST. That shows you that eminent physicists can be as tribalistic, petty and emotional as a stereotypical  14 year old girl.')
