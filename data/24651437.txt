Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=[24652099, 24651476], score=None, time=1601563614, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24651261, text='The USB Consortium’s licensing strategy is to restrict what people can label with the USB logo, by holding trademark over that logo. You then have to work out an arrangement with them, in order for your hardware to proclaim itself as USB-compatible by using the logo. This is their “in” to ensure you’re doing USB correctly.<p>The Nintendo charging port is not labelled with a USB logo. It’s fundamentally <i>not a USB-C port</i>. It doesn’t make any <i>claim</i> to obey any standard. The USB Consortium was not involved; nor do they have a legal right to <i>get</i> involved, if Nintendo has no interest in putting that USB logo on their product.<p>Interestingly (to me), this seems to be a central point in Nintendo’s business model: they don’t do licensing fees, if they can at-all help it. They’re willing to break compatibility with some standard, if that’s what it takes to avoid having to pay someone a fee for every unit sold. That’s not exactly why the GameCube’s discs aren’t mini-DVDs (that’s more a DRM thing); but it <i>is</i> why none of their peripherals so far have had a Bluetooth logo on them, despite being <i>in essence</i> Bluetooth peripherals (but ones that sit in a separate Bluetooth “namespace” such that you need a customized Bluetooth driver to talk to them; presumably because putting those devices into the regular Bluetooth namespace would involve doing something that infringes on the Bluetooth Special Interest Group’s IP.) It’s also, way back when, why Nintendo dropped the deal with Sony to make the Nintendo PlayStation — they didn’t want to have to pay the licensing fees for printing CD-ROMs!')
