I do agree with him that it&#x27;s largely a Ponzi scheme that will absolutely continue its cycle of boom and bust, but his &quot;money&quot; argument feels exceedingly weak.<p>I very rarely hear the bitcoin crowd claiming anything around bitcoin as money, but more like gold; a store of value that is admittedly difficult to move around. You can&#x27;t pay your taxes in <i>any</i> asset that isn&#x27;t money. The government isn&#x27;t going to take a bar of gold (or if they will, I certainly don&#x27;t know how to give it to them), and they definitely won&#x27;t take your Micky Mantle baseball card or Rembrandt painting unless you&#x27;ve gotten so far down the hole that they&#x27;ve got people liquidating those things to wring the money out of them to pay your debt. There are a lot of things that represent monetary value that definitively aren&#x27;t money and can&#x27;t be used as such, but that doesn&#x27;t negate their value.')
