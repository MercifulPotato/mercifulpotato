I often start thinking about the problems again immediately on waking, and typically find that is the most productive period in terms of breakthroughs and making mental connections.<p>I put &#x27;nap&#x27; in quotes because I don&#x27;t set an alarm (unless there is specific need to), and for me that usually means a 2 hour sleep! I figure that is made up of 90 mins of one sleep cycle, and some time either side for falling asleep and waking.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sleep_cycle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sleep_cycle</a><p>All made possible by pandemic working from home.')
