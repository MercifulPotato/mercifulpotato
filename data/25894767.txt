But using it when doing routine stuff with dd is a pretty good idea too.<p>It’s too bad that macOS and FreeBSD hasn’t anything similar to my knowledge. And since I use both of these operating systems so much, and so often for things involving dd, I think in my case I don’t gain much from doing by-id for dd on Linux unfortunately.')
