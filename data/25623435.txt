Then the boost&#x2F;frequency&#x2F;voltage envelope it chooses to operate in under sustained load is different.<p>IMO, shopping by performance&#x2F;watt makes sense.  Shopping by TDP doesn&#x27;t.  (Especially since there is no comparing the AMD and Intel TDP numbers as they&#x27;re defined differently; neither is the maximum the processor can draw, and Intel significantly exceeds the specified TDP on normal workloads).')
