Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=[25546161], score=None, time=1609011761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25544774, text='This is one of those myths that just needs to die.<p>&quot;Put the good tires on the back&quot; is a terribly inaccurate rule of thumb.  Whether you want the good tires on the rear or the front is gonna depend on how the vehicle handles.  Most modern mom-mobile type crossover are so biased toward under-steer (usually from a combination of rear weight and stiff front sway bar) that they need all the help they can get up front and putting the better two tires on the rear is just wasting traction because that end was never going to break traction anyway.<p>Also, Firestone happily puts fronts only on my junk.')
