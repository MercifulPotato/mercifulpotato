Arc4Random uses the system entropy pool, so it&#x27;s non-deterministic from a user perspective.<p>In a more direct sense, yes. If you&#x27;re allowed to keep secrets (like internal state), it&#x27;s possible to produce random numbers algorithmically for certain (weak) definitions of random, even with a deterministic machine. A simple example of this would be sequential bits of a normal number. As you strengthen your definition of randomness you pretty quickly get into non-computable territory though.')
