But does this still hold true when films and music have moved to streaming that pays artists ridiculously little and there is no longer much interest in buying physical media among the younger generations? (Even the chance for musicians to make money from touring is gone for at least 2020–2021).<p>Once books go into a streaming model that allows you to read as much as you like for a low monthly cost, very few people are going to buy the physical book. So, it looks like authors will have to just be content with that fraction of a cent per read in perpetuity, and making the book practically free isn’t really creating a market by which authors can make a living from their work.')
