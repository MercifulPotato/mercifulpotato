I like the style options for the maps but their reverse geo lookup and local search performed poorly vs google maps.<p>Pins dropped down the street from actual address and search results don&#x27;t narrow in accurately using POI and city&#x2F;state - for example &quot;Chipotle Parker Colorado&quot; rather than showing the 3 chipotles in Parker, CO lists:<p>- the city &quot;Parker, CO&quot;<p>- Parker street in Pueblo, CO<p>- childrens hospital therapy center in Parker, CO<p>It just doesn&#x27;t match the behavior our users have - probably because they have been trained how to search using google and google maps.<p>I am guessing the main use for mapbox is actually custom tiles and custom datasets but anyone using it as a replacement for google maps I&#x27;d love to hear if you were able to solve this without too much trouble. We preferred their API, sdks, and pricing over google maps but just couldn&#x27;t get the results we wanted.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.mapbox.com&#x2F;search-playground&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.mapbox.com&#x2F;search-playground&#x2F;</a>')
