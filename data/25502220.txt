Using pure functions for business logic (and also using simple data structures instead of, say, classes and encapsulation) seems to generally makes the code more simple and maintainable in the long run.<p>&gt; Of course the qualifier is &quot;mostly&quot;: this isn&#x27;t a dogma. Writing a 100% functional system (&quot;going vegan&quot;, if you will) often requires you to jump through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need.<p>Also this. Sometimes going fully functional makes things much more difficult, so a little of &quot;impurity&quot; is also fine.')
