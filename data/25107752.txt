RCEP puts a lot of pressure on India either way though. It&#x27;s kind of interesting how India decided that free trade with 30% of the world is less valuable than protecting its manufacturing from china. If India adopted the chinese model (what americans call &quot;cheating&quot;), it could probably compete against china even with a free trade arrangement, but they&#x27;re probably not going to do that.')
