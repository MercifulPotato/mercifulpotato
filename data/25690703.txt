I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to learn much in ML if it weren&#x27;t for people who write and visualize and make the methods accessible to non-experts. In my case, as with many others, it was the writing and videos of Andrew Ng, Karpathy, Chris Olah, Nando de Freitas, Sebastian Ruder, Andrew Trask, and Denny Britz amongst others. Accessible content like this goes a long way in building the confidence to further pursue the topic and not be intimidated by the steep learning curve. It fill me with joy that you&#x27;ve found some of my work helpful.<p>Thanks for digging up the screenshot. Exploring contextualize word embeddings is truly fascinating.
