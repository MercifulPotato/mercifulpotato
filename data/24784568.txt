There&#x27;s a non-trivial amount of people in this country (and on this website, it seems) who think Trump is, literally not metaphorically, an agent of the Kremlin. Are those people a threat to democracy? I certainly don&#x27;t think so. I think they&#x27;re idiots, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re literally threatening democracy.<p>&gt;Injecting completely false information into the public discourse is a direct attack on democracy.<p>The line you are drawing here is very very close to accusing people who share false information of treason. Are we sure we want to walk up to that line? I&#x27;m not. I think it&#x27;s frankly pretty silly. It&#x27;s also interesting that you assume there is some neutral arbiter that can decide what is &quot;real&quot; and what is &quot;true&quot; and what is &quot;fact&quot; (all different things, btw).<p>&gt;The only way democracy can work is if voters are making decisions based on real world information.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting that you think this was ever the state of democracy, and not the status quo.')
