Have you ever <i>been</i> to the Bay Area?<p>Yes.  Emphatically yes it is the case companies spend trillions of dollars unnecessarily.<p>We&#x27;ve seen this with people who didn&#x27;t know how to build microservices and farcical &quot;LMNOP&quot; [1] type services that might as well be a joke.  We&#x27;ve seen it with gigantically-valued unicorns that over-engineered tons of crap and hired too many people and still can&#x27;t make a profit.  We&#x27;ve seen it with CMOs and massively overpriced marketing technology because budgets and statuses are related.  We&#x27;ll see it with tons more iterations of this exact same affluenza.<p>The history of our industry is that the margins on software are so good that people can afford to do crazy nonsense.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?reload=9&amp;v=y8OnoxKotPQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?reload=9&amp;v=y8OnoxKotPQ</a>')
