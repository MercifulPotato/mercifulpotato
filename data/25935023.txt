Then why is it so expensive?  Seems like if it is so expensive, that will create, if not jobs, lots of person-hours of work, which is effectively jobs. Ok, so the jobs may be out of the country, such as manufacturers of equipment, but still. It takes labor to make it happen, and that is jobs.<p>I&#x27;m not one to advocate for doing things just to create jobs, but that statement seemed disingenuous.')
