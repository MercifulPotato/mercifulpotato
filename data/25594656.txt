Jira is one of the alternatives we&#x27;re investigating, because several staff have used it in other jobs. I also used it for a brief time, and I was not in love with it. I often felt like it was arguing with me.<p>There are <i>so many</i> systems out there. Right now we&#x27;re also evaluating YouTrack from JetBrains and OpenProject.org (which is a fork of a fork of RedMine).<p>We don&#x27;t want to have to move again any time soon, so while we&#x27;re evaluating features we&#x27;re also trying to predict stability and viability. To that end, when available, I&#x27;m including in our evaluation notes 1) when the company making the system started; 2) when the system was launched; 3) how many staff the company has.<p>JetBrains started in 2000, YouTrack launched in 2009, and they have over 900 employees. OpenProject launched in 2012. Both seem to be stable and under active development.<p>ClickUp has a lot of features and <i>looks</i> nice (we haven&#x27;t dug into it yet). But they launched in 2017, and raised Series A funding in June 2020. So they&#x27;re young. That doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re <i>bad</i>. It just means they&#x27;re less known, and have not proved long-term viability. On the plus side, it also means they don&#x27;t have the 18 years of cruft in the system that Jira (launched in 2002) seems to have.<p>In my experience the right project management system can really help developers, so I always want to hear everybody&#x27;s experiences, good and bad.')
