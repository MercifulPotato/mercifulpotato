If rejecting neutrality is the cause, then it stands to reason that we can cure the problem in part or in full by embracing neutrality again.</i><p>I don’t fully understand your point here as it relates to the other poster’s comment. Are you saying that “we should embrace neutrality” in this context by entertaining the idea that it’s not raining outside when it clearly is? I don’t think that’s a solution.')
