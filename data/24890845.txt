The correct design is probably something like isolation by default but optional (ie, allowing sharing).<p>I&#x27;m not really convinced it was.  Frankly, Wayland does a great job handling the tasks I want my display server to handle.  I don&#x27;t have to wade into config files every time I plug in a new HID, or a new monitor, and my touch pad is a joy to use.<p>I think how screen sharing works is actually very dependent on the system in question ( I want a different set of prompts on my desktop from my laptop from my server), and that leaving that complexity out of the display server was a rough, but correct, decision.<p>That said, I&#x27;m with you - I held off on Wayland for a long time because screen sharing and screen recording just weren&#x27;t there.  At least for me, Pipewire is now a working solution.  I won&#x27;t go back to X.')
