Right now the M1 stands at a score of 8000 Vs Threadripper&#x27;s 25000. The comparison I am sure is not just about comparing benchmark scores, but is there a prediction possible given that the M1 is at a 24W TDP whereas the threadripper has a 280W TDP (A 3x change in the benchmarks alongside a 10x change in TDP)<p>Does Qualcomm or Samsung have a M1 beater in their kitty?')
