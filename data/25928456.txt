The older it gets, the more likely it is to have been broken. For your grandparents (and the folks they passed it on to), it means: You were able to have space for the table all the years, and didn&#x27;t move into a place where it didn&#x27;t fit. It means it didn&#x27;t have accidents. Do you have chairs that came with it - or did they break too (very common)? If you do have the chairs, are they sturdy enough for a child to climb on and wiggle in? (many aren&#x27;t).<p>It means they didn&#x27;t have a fire or break the table when moving it (if they moved over the years).<p>It means they could wax it and so could everyone else. It means they could do repairs when needed.  It means that it didn&#x27;t rot despite waxing.<p>It means that you (and&#x2F;or other family members) also had a space for it: If you bought an old piece used, it meant that there was an avenue to sell it.<p>And a bunch of things like that. 90 year old furniture isn&#x27;t the norm, and can hardly be used to verify that older things are made better (and besides, they had some cheap stuff too).')
