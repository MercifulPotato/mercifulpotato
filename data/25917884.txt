We should want elections contested legally, in the courts, no matter what the whacked out crazy or inherently false claims there might be. That&#x27;s what the courts are there for and it&#x27;s really IMO why they are a third branch, not a subsidiary, of the government. Let the lawsuits go forward. Let the courts decide on their merits, so we have finality and case law for the future. IMHO it was a mistake for the Supreme Court not to hear the Texas lawsuit. It almost certainly was not going to prevail, but by summarily declining to even hear the case, it undermines the judiciaries independence.')
