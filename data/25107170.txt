Just look at the nonsense and disagreement about abortion. There are so many arbitrary standards people use to advocate for allowing or forbidding abortions at various ages. In my country, they recently adjusted the legal age by a few weeks, from one arbitrary number to anther arbitrary number. Curiously, I&#x27;ve only met one person who advocated for &quot;post-partum&quot; abortion. I think most people simply refuse to allow themselves to consider that because they aren&#x27;t making any attempt at being ethical and only want to reinforce their own culture or demonstrate to their peers that they&#x27;re &quot;good&quot; people.')
