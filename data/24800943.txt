Used to have ice on the inside of my windows every morning in the winter, in my corner bedroom in our Iowa farmhouse. Before remodelling to a ranch-style, it was 2-story with <i>no heat whatsoever</i> in the upstairs where the kids&#x27; bedrooms were. We slept 3 to a bed with huge comforters. Even after the remodel, still ice on the windows. No heat got to my corner of the house.<p>And cold water - got a water heater (I don&#x27;t remember when) but not enough capacity for 8 people. As a child I resisted bathing as long as I could get away with it. As a youngest, I was last in line for the hot water.<p>But not so much with the food. Iowa farm - always good fresh food available. So that was fine.')
