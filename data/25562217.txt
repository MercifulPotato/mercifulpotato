They announced their intention do so almost immediately after the first ARM64 phone, but the process took several months because it had to be merged with a duplicate backend developed by others.<p>I think it is likely that support for these instructions will be upstreamed to LLVM, and the teams involved in this monumental transition (which was announced like ~50 days ago) simply didn&#x27;t put it at the highest priority on the list of things that developers need to know to get their apps working on Day 1.<p>A fair criticism is that some of the more technical documentation, such as on the Mach-O ABI, have disappeared from Apple&#x27;s developer site, or been relegated to an unsearchable archive[2], so it&#x27;s very reasonable to be skeptical of ISA extensions ever being documented there.<p>The developer site has <i>always</i> sucked though, and it seems to me they&#x27;ve declared bankruptcy and are rebuilding it on machine-generated docs and WWDC content for app developers.
