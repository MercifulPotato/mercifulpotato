GNOME does this, so all toolkits must use CSDs if they wanna work on the most popular Wayland compositor.<p>Incidentally, that&#x27;s hell for all the simple libraries out there which just exist to get a GL window on the screen. GLFW, GLEW, SDL, etc. all have to implement CSDs now if they wanna work with Wayland. It also means that it&#x27;s no longer feasible to just make a Linux application which uses the windowing system directly; everything must use a huge toolkit now.<p>EDIT: To clarify, I don&#x27;t think this is an issue with Wayland, but with GNOME. There&#x27;s no reason it couldn&#x27;t have supported SSDs like every other Wayland compositor. But as it stands, it hurts the Wayland ecosystem.')
