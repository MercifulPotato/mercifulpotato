Some areas in Orange County have blocks before cross walks, or cross walks only on one side of the street so you had to make the right decision a block ago about which side of the street to be on! Strip malls seemed designed to have people drive the 1k feet between businesses rather than having accessible walking. With city planning focused on driving you start to realize why pedestrians can behave so badly?<p>If you&#x27;re talking specifically about urban cities, I still bet Japan&#x2F;Germany have been urban planning for sidewalks which encourages &quot;good behavior&quot;.')
