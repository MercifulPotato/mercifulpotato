What do you really know, about where that power&#x2F;wealth mostly comes from? Because last time I checked, it actually depends in almost every aspect on what the rest of the world thinks of the USA (including, not in the least important part, it&#x27;s currency).<p>I&#x27;m even pretty sure that you would be surprised (probably even shocked) if you know how much business the USA does mostly covertly (if not clandestine) abroad, and what amounts of money are involved in that.<p>This is what I can tell you with a pretty good degree of certainty: during the last decade or so, plenty of the less-than-savory project, run by the USA abroad, have either dried up or been exposed&#x2F;dismantled&#x2F;destroyed. I have personally seen several of those go bust.<p>Less clear, and also with ant causation would be hard to prove, it did &quot;miraculously&quot; coincide with the USA ramping up their anti-Russia rhetoric.<p>Even a bigger step into speculative territory, one might even suspect that at least some of the turmoil at home in the USA, may have something to do with their most criminal elite no longer being as capable of getting their &quot;fix&quot; abroad, having to resort to exploiting the local population.<p>Either way though, I&#x27;m pretty convinced that most Americans overestimate how their economy has much intrinsic value .. if anything, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more or less already bankrupt. Which is probably why we see all these wars, in order to prevent some key players from ditching the Dollar as trade&#x2F;reserve currency. But that&#x27;s all borrowed time.')
