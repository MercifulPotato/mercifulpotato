Even the lowest paid worker in Sweden get more vacation and parental leave than you can even dream of in the US (No need to reply with your personal exception). That was achieved through the hard work of the labour movement.<p>How do you explain the following discrepancies if unions are indeed only serving themselves:<p>* The vast differences in labour benefits between Western Europe and the US.<p>* The vast resources US corporations spend on spreading anti-union sentiment and direct union busting (I mean, come one, corporate altruism to help the workers avoid union fees or what?).<p>Unsurprisingly this whole thread is a swamp of comments that passes off unions in truly the worst propaganda caricature there is.')
