Every ARM system is different and they are all lacking the heritage of public documentation that the PC has. In other words, it&#x27;s not about performance but freedom. I doubt Apple will ever release as much detailed information on its own chips as Intel and AMD have.<p>x86 is plenty fast anyway, and still wins on code density in single-threaded scalar (i.e. NOT using the vector units) branchy code of the sort commonly found in average applications.')
