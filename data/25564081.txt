Why isn&#x27;t there anything like that for event-driven, message-based systems? If there&#x27;s a message bus in your architecture, it&#x27;s usually just a pipe-shaped widget on a diagram. There&#x27;s dozens of tools that can describe and API down to the finest detail, like swagger&#x2F;openapi, uml, C4. We have infrastructure as code (helm charts, etc).<p>In all of them the events and message buses are kind of an afterthought. Everything seems geared towards request-response systems, and nothing adequately deals with the range of event systems and message flows.')
