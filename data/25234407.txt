They are petty nonsense.<p>&gt; * Everyone hates ads.<p>Yet ads are everywhere.<p>&gt; since there is too much competition that doesn&#x27;t rely on ad revenue<p>What competition? What is the challenge to google search, youtube, chrome, etc?<p>&gt; and too many companies trying to block ads.<p>Is that a joke? Google&#x27;s problem is too many companies want to buy ads. But ads are never going to disappear. Actually, ads are only going to increase on the internet. More video ads especially.<p>&gt; * Google doesn&#x27;t have a solid revenue stream besides ads.<p>If you&#x27;re argument is ads are going to disappear, then I guess you have a point.<p>&gt;  EVERYONE freakin hates ads<p>Right. And the article said the same nonsense you are saying. But it said that in 2017 and guess what? Turns out the article was wrong.<p>You just have 1 point. Nobody likes ads. Duh. But if that mattered, google wouldn&#x27;t even exist.')
