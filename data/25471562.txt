I definitely think he had a real shot, perhaps not the favorite but definitely a strong contender. He&#x27;s been a name in his region for so long that I don&#x27;t think recognition would be a huge problem (even before he went to congress he was in the Michigan house) and the fundraising numbers I shared just don&#x27;t make sense if he truly had no chance. But impossible to say what would have happened, so I guess we&#x27;ll have to wait and see when he does decide to run for something else.')
