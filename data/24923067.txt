There are some things coming out with Rocm and other niche things, but most people in ML already have enough work dealing with model and framework problems that using experimental AMD support is probably a no go.<p>_If_ AMD has made a sufficiently powerful GPU, that will add a lot of incentive to ML frameworks to support it.  But it&#x27;s going to have to be a big difference, I imagine.<p>Given how active AMD is in open source work, I&#x27;m a little surprised they haven&#x27;t been throwing developers at ML frameworks.')
