Both these help explain the underpinnings of Docker and I guess Kubernetes now too. Turtles all the way up. I&#x27;m just mentioning this since these are still some of my most popular videos and still the core tech under the hood.<p>A personal note here too. cgroups were invented at Google in the early 2000&#x27;s. If you&#x27;re using search today, gmail, docs, maps, etc. You&#x27;re using cgroups. It sounds simple but this tech really powered a whole wave of innovation&#x2F;startups&#x2F;projects that almost everyone interacts with on a daily basis. Either through touching a Google service or interacting with anyone using Docker or Kubernetes (running on cgroups&#x2F;namespaces). Pretty impressive.<p>#14 - Introduction to Linux Control Groups (Cgroups)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sysadmincasts.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;14-introduction-to-linux-control-groups-cgroups" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sysadmincasts.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;14-introduction-to-linux-...</a><p>#24 - Introduction to Containers on Linux using LXC<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sysadmincasts.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;24-introduction-to-containers-on-linux-using-lxc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sysadmincasts.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;24-introduction-to-contai...</a>')
