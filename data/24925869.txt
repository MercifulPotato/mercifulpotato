I do not want the long term unemployed weighing in on our governance.<p>&gt;pregnancy that year<p>Already covered<p>&gt;international travel but still a citizen<p>If you&#x27;re not present and contributing to a society, in my view, you should absolutely not have a say in the governance of that society. In fact, I find the idea abhorrent.<p>&gt;As soon as you start pointing to reasons that a government can&#x2F; can&#x27;t take away your power to vote you are screwed as a populace.<p>Not really. Our species has survived and thrived for tens of thousands of years before widespread &quot;voting&quot; became available. The free-for-all in terms of access to voting is <i>very</i> modern, and <i>very</i> Western.<p>The modern West is, coincidentally enough, now in a freefall downward spiral from which it likely won&#x27;t recover. We&#x27;ve went from high trust, well functioning societies where one person could go out to work in a blue collar job and support a family, to a very low trust society now hanging on to false premises like a house of cards, where even two people working full time can struggle to put food on the table.<p>Screwed as a populace? We&#x27;re already frogs in the pot and that <i>is with</i> this fancy &quot;everyone gets a say&quot; notion in place.<p>&gt;Not that i have much faith in the voting system anyways cause&#x27; who knows how they count the votes anyways.<p>My lack of faith in the voting system is that some entity, barely through puberty, highly influence-able, no skin in the game and therefore nothing to lose, can be told by some troglodyte celebrity to go vote for their (the celebrity&#x27;s) candidate of choice and <i>that vote</i> is exactly equal to that of someone who contributes to society and invests their time in keeping on top of the issues that society faces.<p>Sorry, but when it comes to <i>governing a society</i> in the name of preserving and advancing its wellbeing, the above is nothing more than a joke and a cruel one at that.')
