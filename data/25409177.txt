Take my eyes off the screen.<p>Since the pandemic forced me to work from home, I take this hourly opportunity to get in 30-50 pushups every hour. Also helps with water intake. And takes my mind off the urge to take a tea or coffee break. But now that I think of it, I could&#x27;ve done the same in office.<p>Having flux installed also helps.<p>You need to reduce the time you are looking at the screen continuously.
