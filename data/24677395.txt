Demonstrating what SGML&#x2F;XML is actually designed for: encoding and authoring semistructured text. This can&#x27;t be overstated in discussions like these where use cases for config formats, service payload formats, and actual text authoring are all thrown into the same basket when they shouldn&#x27;t.<p>Btw: you can parse and canonicalize this new config file format into markup using the same SGML mechanism you&#x27;d be using for CSVs like &#x2F;etc&#x2F;passwd, namely short references<p>Btw2: you can skip&#x2F;ignore markup declarations in XML, including whole declaration sets (DTDs) since these can be recognized using plain greedy regexpes, though you can&#x27;t ignore entity declarations when actually used in your XML body text')
