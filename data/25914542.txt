The government feigns that they can’t do anything.  And that everything is the result of the market. Meanwhile, they easily pass bills to increase their own pay, or find magic money to pay for their military wars.<p>And then, after screwing up the 2008 crisis, they stopped building homes. And the homes that were foreclosed on, they allowed the rich corporations to buy them up for pennies on the dollar.<p>You call this a real estate market? It’s a god damned scam!<p>So what does that leave us with?  Millennials that have a lot of student loans, low pay for decades, and now, they can’t even buy a home.<p>How wonderful it is that a dilapidated entry level home is now $700,000.  Good luck paying for that, when you couldn’t even afford to pay for a $500,000 home.<p>Families are delayed. Marriages are delayed. Kids? Good luck even affording to pay for a family, with your $800,000+ mortgage.<p>Thanks America. You f*cked us. But sure, your rich buddies are even richer.')
