These agreements would override any terms a member accidentally agrees to with respect to that party unless the member explicitly informs the association that they are negotiating their own agreement.<p>This would provide a way for consumers to collectively negotiate these contracts in their own interest while still allowing companies to create specific non-trivial contracts that properly manage the expected relationship.<p>This has the desirable property that it supports heterogeneous solutions and encourages competition amongst contract negotiators to negotiate better terms or ones that more closely align with the interests of their members.')
