Capitalism is simply an economic system where the means of production are privately owned. Growth is not a requirement or even feature of capitalism. Being able to own companies, property and hold currency are all features of capitalism. If you are trying to say &quot;infinite growth is unsustainable&quot; that stands on it&#x27;s own and is worth discussing.')
