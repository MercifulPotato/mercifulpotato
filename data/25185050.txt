But it&#x27;s worth pointing out that when&#x2F;if a project outgrows JS, there are more options than just C&#x2F;C++. The smaller community&#x2F;ecosystem doesn&#x27;t matter nearly as much in embedded, at least for libraries. I&#x27;ve found all the Nim libraries I&#x27;ve needed or wrapped C SDK ones, and the debugger is the standard C one. Rust is similar, and more productive than C for many people once you get familiar with it. Though yes, you&#x27;ve got to be willing to figure out things in both. Overall it&#x27;s good to see more options.')
