Hell, they&#x27;ll even have an easier time doing so, since they&#x27;re (ostensibly) using that land productively (and if not, they absolutely should be) and thus be more able to internalize that opportunity cost they&#x27;ve imposed on others.<p>And if they can&#x27;t produce enough to internalize that opportunity cost, then all the more reason for someone else to be given the opportunity to do so.')
