Or a 9&#x2F;11-truther. If someone says something that disagrees with your beliefs, you don&#x27;t think &quot;Maybe what I&#x27;ve believed so far is wrong?&quot;, you think &quot;They&#x27;re also part of the lie!&quot;.<p>Do you think this is a good way of persuading people to question themselves?<p>&gt; I saw your fellow conspiracy theorists&#x27;s YouTube analysis of the &quot;thumbdrive hand-off&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I appreciate being associated with whoever but thank you for watching the video.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not even clear it&#x27;s a thumbdrive in her hand.<p>Ok, perhaps. What else was she attempting to steal from the election building?<p>&gt; And the logic leap is incredible. How does this &quot;hand-off&quot; mean election fraud?<p>For some reason, votes are stored on removable storage media. There&#x27;s no incredible leap of logic to understand that sneaking one of these drives out and modifying it or losing it without affecting the chain of custody or being seen would be a component of vote fraud. This appears to be that, therefore when someone asks for video evidence that suggests there might have been vote fraud, here is an example. But if you don&#x27;t care about election integrity then its probably super boring anyway so don&#x27;t fret yourself.<p>&gt;  Did you watch another video of someone on the Internet saying &quot;It means this, it can mean this&quot;, etc, and if so, why hasn&#x27;t it been investigated?<p>No, its pretty obvious what the logical implications are. And I don&#x27;t know why it hasn&#x27;t been investigated, probably because the voting system isn&#x27;t even set up to defend against this type of fraud.<p>thanks for the link, very interesting.')
