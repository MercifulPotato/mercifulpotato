US growth will not resume until energy production does. With shale seemingly spent, nuclear too scary for most, and fusion perpetually 10 years off, growth is unlikely. The US will continue to &quot;print&quot; oil by printing dollars (h&#x2F;t to Luke Gromen), care of Saudi Arabia, until it can&#x27;t. The US will do anything and everything to ensure this continues, history is proof of that. When the US finally fails there will be a war. Not like Vietnam or Iraq or Afghanistan. A very, very bad war. And the winner will determine monetary policy for the next century or so.')
