I also usually notice little issues like that. So while 5k is probably better, I personally don’t think I’m missing out on much. At least, I wouldn’t say 5k is an absolute requirement to enjoy higher DPI. The price difference is pretty big too, with solid 27” 4k monitors around half the price of 5k.')
