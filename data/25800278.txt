JSX is <i>itself</i> a data structure, not interpolated strings and values. That makes it closer to hyperscript. But it doesn’t necessarily return anything or have a runtime value at all.<p>The problems you cite are exactly what I meant to say are its strengths. Because it’s entirely undefined syntax that only corresponds to data, it can be used as a general purpose macro for anything from React.createElement to defining a web component to defining an output for a CLI to defining a test or an API endpoint or anything at all. It’s a general purpose DSL, and the fact that it looks like HTML&#x2F;XML is just convenient for its most common usage.')
