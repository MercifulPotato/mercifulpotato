The tldr is that the most reasonable interpretation of events is that the 737 Max without MCAS is not certifiable without MCAS (or at least a better thought out modification to the control feel system). There is no particular requirement for aircraft on the same type certificate to &quot;handle&quot; the same way. For an extreme example look at the Cessna 500 series. The CJ4 has a note in its pilot operations hand book that it is high performance and is basically at the limit of what a single pilot can handle.')
