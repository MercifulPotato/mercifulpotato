As noted in a sibling, Apple has released ISA extensions before. If the architecture is decoding to uops anyway the addition of x86 helper instructions may not affect the architecture much at all (or may even be implemented in microcode). Further, the comparison between Rosetta 1 and 2 may not necessarily apply, as the switch to intel was (arguably) a more substantial perf increase over POWER.')
