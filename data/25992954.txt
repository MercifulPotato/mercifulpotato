It&#x27;s cargo cult management by the very definition: they see the other people doing the correct incantations and bounty fall upon them. Clearly, we just need to utter those same incantations and we&#x27;ll have the success they did.<p>And I&#x27;d further counter that: yeah, actually, you and your company ARE special. Every company is. There is no One True Way of running a business, or any individual aspect of that business. Everyone&#x27;s triangulating around resources, people, industry, corporate vision, etc. If anything I&#x27;d say the argument that &quot;you are not special&quot; is the fallacy, as it leads directly to the kind of cargo-culting that you see so many failed companies do.<p>Finally, when we see successful companies, how often is it because they just mimicked what everyone else was doing? Not very frequently, as it turns out. Well-behaved companies seldom make history.')
