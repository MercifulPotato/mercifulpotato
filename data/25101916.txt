I am not sure if I&#x27;d chose to build a shopping cart on Serverless just yet (Next.js&#x27; recent forays  notwithstanding), but for something that is stateless (like content distribution, capturing metrics and logs, serving static webpages)...oh, is it a breeze.<p>That said, I see many promising upstarts <i>and</i> incumbents in the space trying to make stateful Serverless easier by the day.
