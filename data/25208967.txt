Item(by='segfaultbuserr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606310895, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25208554, text='I played many hours with AI Dungeon&#x27;s GPT-3 based &quot;Dungeon&quot; model, instructing it to write sci-fi fan-fics. Its output never ceased to amaze me. It&#x27;s junk by the standard of high literature, obviously. Yet, when you consider the number of bad fan-fics in existence, I&#x27;d say GPT-3 probably ranks high in a relative comparison, at least two order-of-magnitude better than my creativity (since its training data already included a huge collections of fictions, including web fan-fics and numerous text adventure games, and the job of GPT-3 is mixing and rewriting them, it shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise).<p>I&#x27;m never a fan of the &quot;AI&quot; hype, but GPT-3 decidedly changed my mind. If I can be attracted to read, for hours, the meaningless stories generated by a mindless language model in an experimental stage - still, with a quality arguably outperforms many unskilled humans, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m convinced that there are lots of promising applications of machine learning (for better or worse), even if it&#x27;s only capable of feeding low-quality content to the people. 1984 got it right.')
