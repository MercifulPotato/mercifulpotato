Additionally being able to have multiple spreadsheets within a workbook is a nice way of organizing your configuration data. Beats the pants off other serialized data formats (depending on your use case) and I find it to be preferable to using ‘code as configuration’, especially because non-developer users can edit it.<p>EDIT: Link to ExcelProvider <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fsprojects.github.io&#x2F;ExcelProvider&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fsprojects.github.io&#x2F;ExcelProvider&#x2F;</a>')
