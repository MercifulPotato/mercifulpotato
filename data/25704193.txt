Item(by='fapjacks', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610222970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25699404, text='I agree with you on the surface, but in reading your comment, I&#x27;m reminded of feeling exactly the same way after Trump was elected, just in the opposite sense. And thinking about it, this was the same sense I had about things after Obama and even way back with Dubya. The internet really is a communications revolution. I keep saying that we are under assault, our attention spans attrited by the manufacturers of mass media products for clicks (and by our friends and neighbors who are engaging in this kind of feedback loop), and as I mentioned in another comment, it&#x27;s difficult to separate myself from it and view it objectively. But in talking with you here and others elsewhere, it&#x27;s clear to me that this is a pervasive issue across time, and I feel strongly that the internet as it exists today and the culture we have as a result simply can&#x27;t continue. Whether that means that some sort of regulation which turns social media into television controlled by a few select entities, or culture shifting and people lose trust in the information they see online, I can&#x27;t say, but this level of mass media sensationalism is clearly unsustainable politically. The most powerful political factions have built and maintained their power on the basis of appearing stable to their supporters, and Twitter has (perhaps unknowingly or shortsightedly) sent a message <i>loud and clear</i> to every political faction on the planet. Anybody with real power has every incentive to destroy that kind of political influence. I&#x27;d pay a lot of money to watch a documentary on Twitter&#x27;s reasoning through this decision.')
