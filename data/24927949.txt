Item(by='Corrado', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603954072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24927913, text='A quote from the article states &quot;election officials alone are “legally and morally responsible to our citizens” and said Facebook has “no such accountability.”&quot;  Do these states also reject the &quot;Rock the Vote&quot; campaign that MTV promoted back in the 90&#x27;s?  I&#x27;m guessing there are countless other organizations that are encouraging voting and voting registration.  I get emails almost daily about it.  Are these states also seeking to quell those movements as well?<p>Could Facebook be on the right side of morality this time?  Is there any downside to getting people registered to vote?  Could Facebook influence people to register as one party over another?')
