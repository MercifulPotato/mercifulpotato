The new tensorflow_macos fork of TensorFlow 2.4 leverages ML Compute to enable machine learning libraries to take full advantage of not only the CPU, but also the GPU in both M1- and Intel-powered Macs for dramatically faster training performance.\n</code></pre>\nSo, looks like it&#x27;s faster on both Intel &amp; M1, but the M1 MBP has a much faster GPU than the Intel MBP')
