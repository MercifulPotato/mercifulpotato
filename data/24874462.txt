It&#x27;s tedious but sending patches over email is definitely one way to make it work without relying on a single system. You can also have and push to or fetch from multiple servers with your client, which can be other developer&#x27;s own servers, or a server reachable over Tor as a hidden service, etc. It&#x27;s very flexible if you want to go that path.')
