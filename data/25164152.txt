Great hardware + Fedora, not had any issues.<p>It&#x27;s really sad that &gt;= 2016 models have problems getting Linux running properly (wifi, audio driver issues etc) and I don&#x27;t hold much hope about getting anything other than MacOS running on these new M1 based Macs.<p>The key differentiator for me has been the i3 window manager over anything else, I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to a non-tiling window manager!')
