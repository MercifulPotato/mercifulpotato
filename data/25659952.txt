This is practically his signature policy. You can argue the policy isn&#x27;t in effective or isn&#x27;t sincere, but to say that corruption isn&#x27;t formally frowned upon us just wrong.<p>No, sorry, saying that it isn&#x27;t sincere IS the same as saying corruption isn&#x27;t formally frowned upon. And &quot;anti-corruption&quot; is the euphemism used by many authoritarian regimes to remove political opponents, which I&#x27;m sure is what is really happening under Dictator Pooh-Bear.')
