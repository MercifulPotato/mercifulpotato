We&#x27;re nearly at our physical limits. When this is ceiling is hit, we&#x27;ll start seeing numerous more competition enter the fray. This is because the research part will be too large for one company to innovate itself out of (TSMC will be the first to hit the ceiling and the competition will reach the same ceiling in a short time. Together, they may advance our scientific understanding but I think governments would need to get aggressively involved). This is afundamental scientific limitation. There is <i>no emerging research</i> that will overcome this problem (zero theoretical research that can be used for engineering the manufacturing needed for the next advancements).<p>3D transistors are next but that&#x27;s not growth at an exponential curve. We&#x27;re looking at a linear growth future for a while.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m 33 and I expect within the next 6-15 years that we&#x27;ll hit this limit and be at this limit for most of my working career unless we start seeing some seriously massive investment to unearth more advanced physics that we can implement at the pico-level. If you disagree, I&#x27;d love to hear what you think that will allow Moore to continue because I&#x27;ve read numerous studies and essentially all have zero tangible implementations.')
