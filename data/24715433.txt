Seems that you&#x27;re equating my statement to saying that 13% of the tech jobs should go to African Americans which is far from what I&#x27;m saying.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that the proportions should always match if all citizens are receiving equal opportunities.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine a theoretical population somewhere where 80% of the people are white and 20% are black. \nLet&#x27;s say 50% of all the population studies some tech related career and following one of your examples 10% of the population studies odontology. Let&#x27;s assume the rest of the population studies or prepares for something else. Let&#x27;s assume for a minute that unemployment is at 0%.<p>Then 40% of tech employed population should be white, 10% should be black.<p>8% of the employed dentists are white. 2% are black.<p>The rest of the employed population is 32% white and 8% black.<p>That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s all what I&#x27;m saying. I&#x27;m not even remotely trying or interested to argue politics here. I&#x27;m telling you in plain layman&#x27;s terms that populations should downscale proportionally in an organized, civilized society.<p>You&#x27;re talking about whether or not this is a problem in other industries, and honestly I couldn&#x27;t care less about that for the sake of this argument. I&#x27;m just telling you how society should work if it was unbiased and logical, not whether or not this works with whatever belief system or preconceptions of race or professional competency you have (or anyone has).')
