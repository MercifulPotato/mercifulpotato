You need some degree of mathematical understanding in order for physics to have a meaningful impact.<p>What meaningful impact would, say, quantum chromodynamics have on the life of anyone other than a theoretical physicist? I don&#x27;t see how more widespread education about these things would affect the field of physics itself, since any version taught to the masses would have to be extremely boiled down.')
