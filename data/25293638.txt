It&#x27;s barely even possible to do widely desired protocol upgrades; anything more is simply out of the question. The scarcity is <i>far</i> more secure than any fiat currency.<p>I think it would actually be easier to increase the supply of gold via asteroid mining than to increase the Bitcoin supply. That doesn&#x27;t require consensus and will probably happen someday.')
