Item(by='Thorrez', descendants=None, kids=[24978178], score=None, time=1604392798, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24975458, text='&gt; someone steals your laptop<p>I wonder how well the non-repudiation would actually hold up in that scenario. If you self host your mail server, the attacker could possibly steal your private key and forge the emails. So you might actually have repudiation. Or does DKIM have a timestamp? If not the attacker can simply send an email from your laptop and get it signed by your mailserver. Thus another route for claiming repudiation.')
