Also despite being criminal investigators they refuse to state he did anything wrong. I assure you that that means they couldn&#x27;t find a comma out of place. And if a single person can subvert an entire government department why bother having one at all ?<p>Furthermore I don&#x27;t entirely get blaming this on Oxycontin. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s predecessors were any less addictive ... Morfine is famous for being both heavily addictive and very successful (and is in fact not very different from Oxycontin), as are all the more famous psychoactive drugs (that are even heavily used on children, and do lead to addiction) like Oxazepam and Ritalin.<p>There is the further compounding factor that when used as a &quot;fix&quot; for real problems (like a spine that needs surgery) any pain relief medication, regardless of what it is, will trigger extreme addiction symptoms ... For example, I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of having gall stones. Now let me assure you, I am not addicted to anything and morfine doesn&#x27;t actually help much in that case, but when it makes the difference from being in constant pain so severe it takes away any and all focus (and sleep) to getting 2-3h of sleep before the pain resumes and sometimes even finishing 10 pages in a book before curling up in pain for the 20th time that day ... 2-3 days of that (needed for booking operating theatre) and you&#x27;re ready to kill for it. I hate what morfine does to you, especially after finding out Diclovenac would have essentially stopped the pain for real (by relaxing the muscle that was tearing itself with billirubin crystals, it&#x27;s not even technically pain relief), I mean I would have had severe leakage after eating anything with a bit of fat in it, but no pain. Let&#x27;s hope I know associate opioids with the pain I felt back then. The last thing I ate before the first real pain hit was strawberries. I <i>still</i> (~5 years later) freeze when I see strawberries in the supermarket and feel terrified. I have to use a lot of willpower to go on. And yes, I&#x27;ve forced myself to eat some, it doesn&#x27;t help.<p>If you&#x27;re in need of real medical help (but, say, misdiagnosed or unable to pay), this situation can last for years or decades. But of course real medical help requires days to months of attention from real experts, but pain relief any quack can easily do. You cannot take away severe pain relief and put nothing in it&#x27;s place ... I mean what&#x27;s the patient to do ? Kill themselves ? (Which, by the way, seems to have increased dramatically when the opioid crisis started getting fought, so clearly that&#x27;s one answer that&#x27;s actually used).<p>And yes, Oxycontin (and Rilatin) takes away your ability to think deeply in a similar way to alcohol. But even a strong dose will not have more effect than mild drunkenness. One might wonder why (especially cheap) alcohol is kept available if you take offence at strong pain relief.')
