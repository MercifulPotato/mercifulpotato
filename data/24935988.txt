The government immediately issued a notice that once a residence is constructed by such developers and is ready-to-occupy, property tax and utility bills (for water) has to be paid for it whether it is occupied or not. Thus builders stopped building in excess or holding on to it to cut supply and artifically raise demand (and thus prices).')
