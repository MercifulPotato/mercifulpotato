OpenWRT does it wonderfully, but OpenWRT is only a great choice if you’re a rather technical user and can be around to upgrade it&#x2F;futz with it as needed. Ubiquiti doesn’t have support yet (I think the edge router has some custom packages you can install, but these aren’t official last I checked).<p>Eero does support this, and is my current recommendation, but it is worth noting that Eero is locking features behind a subscription plan that costs up to 10$ a month. Want adblocking, a feature that other routers are now adding for free? You have to pay. I seriously doubt this plan is ever going to work for them, but keep it in mind. I’m guessing it’ll eventually morph into a “sign in with your Amazon Prime account” style thing for bonus features&#x2F;selling your DNS&#x2F;tracking data to Amazon, but who knows.<p>Thus, I think Eero is a great stopgap for the next 1-2 years until Ubiquiti stabilizes their Amplifi line and&#x2F;or finally adds CAKE to the Unifi stuff.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bufferbloat.net&#x2F;projects&#x2F;codel&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cake&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bufferbloat.net&#x2F;projects&#x2F;codel&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cake&#x2F;</a>')
