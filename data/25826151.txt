There is no such doubts about AWS nor Azure. It is too unfortunate for GCP that ARM popped these couple of years - Google has to decide right now and that is already pretty late whether they are going to invest a bunch of billions in having [competitive] ARM in the GCP. It is not just a matter of getting an ARM license and printing the chips, it is whole stack optimization to get those &quot;40% faster at 20% cheaper&quot; (as claimed by AMZN and with such improvements even native platforms of large slow BigCo-s like ours will probably move to support ARM while x86 will become more like PowerPC &quot;supported too&quot;). I think the Google management wouldn&#x27;t risk venturing into ARM, at least not to the scale needed.')
