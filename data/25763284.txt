Item(by='hiq', descendants=None, kids=[25764495], score=None, time=1610552263, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760733, text='&gt; there&#x27;s very often not a single clearly superior move<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not clear to human players or current engines, but that does not mean it doesn&#x27;t exist, and indeed the theorem mentioned above states that at least one player has an optimal strategy (either forcing a draw or winning). Obviously, that does not necessarily mean that we&#x27;ll ever be able to design an engine that can compute this strategy in a reasonable time.<p>I just think that OP meant something other than the usual definition of &quot;solved&quot;, maybe they meant that engines are plateauing, but as others have pointed out, there is also little evidence for that for now.')
