I’ve never heard of this podcast so I didn’t know if “Lex Fridman” was the author of the site or the host of the podcast.  In fact, if it weren’t for the HN article title, I wouldn’t have immediately understood it was about a podcast at all - it’s not mentioned until half way down the page.<p>Just a brief sentence or two at the top to give context would help immensely.')
