If you can&#x27;t admit when you&#x27;re wrong or you lose your mind when peer reviewed, you are going to find yourself in more trouble than working correctly in a team setting. It also allows you to question your own code to confirm if it&#x27;s the existing code or yours (usually whatever is new is broken, not always, but usually there&#x27;s a high probability). I have had coworkers that have lacked simple humility and self-destruct verbally when you question their code, and I&#x27;ve heard of coworkers having worked with people that will never admit to their code being wrong until you point to the exact line and the change they need done to fix the issue.<p>You waste more time defending something that will always need updates and fixes than you do getting things done when you lack humility. It is something I learned early on and I hope more developers learn it.<p>I will take a &#x27;good enough&#x27; dev with a wonderful personality over an above and beyond developer with the most toxic personality any day of the week, unless I&#x27;m under an extremely tight deadline. A toxic developer can poison a whole team and ruin their productivity.')
