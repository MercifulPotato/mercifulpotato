If you define it as &quot;Have a job that pays a lot&quot; then clearly there are loads of other companies that pay well, so you don&#x27;t need to join a FAANG to have that. Likewise for building big things that lots of people use. Lots of companies do that. If you define success as having a notable impact on the work you do then I&#x27;d contend that you&#x27;re <i>less</i> likely to be successful by joining a FAANG - you might be a brilliant cog in the huge machine, but no one is going to notice your output simply because you&#x27;re surrounded by similarly accomplished people.<p>Further to that, some people will actually believe you&#x27;re a worse person <i>morally</i> for joining a surveillance capitalism business. That could well damage your chances of success in other aspects of life like finding a partner or making friends.<p>tl;dr No, and you might actually be harming your chances of success by joining one.')
