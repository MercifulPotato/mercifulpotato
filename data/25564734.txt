I went up there over the summer and it was noticeably cooler than the garage where the access is. This is in the summer in Texas.<p>They also put their HVAC into the attic and the entire house is insulated with spray foam, so the attic only a few degrees warmer than the house below it.<p>I need to ask them what the energy bills were but I imagine they were low enough to prevent complaint.')
