I frankly didn’t even know how well the pay was before they made the offer. I applied there because Facebook products have been incredibly useful in my life and that of my friends&#x2F;family...most of my life’s opportunities in the last 15 years came through Facebook.\n2. I was of course aware that the company also makes mistakes but my attitude going in was that I wanted to be part of making things better\n3. Looking back at my 5 years there I got everything I wanted and then some. I got to work with amazing like minded peers...people that would show up everyday to do better. I found that really inspiring! As a result my baseline for excellence has been pushed upward dramatically!\n4. Individuals have all the impact and power there! Management generally took a more passive approach. Their main job is to provide resources and not to tell people how to do their jobs (within reasonable limits).\n5. About the bad headlines: in the first couple years I made the effort to internally research every bad story I read in the media...but not a single time was I able to confirm the headlines and allegations. Every single time it turned out that the media was mischaracterizing or misrepresenting what actually happened. The picture that emerged for me over time was that the media was incredibly incompetent when it came to tech and how to piece together information they had...and frankly just looked for things that supported their narrative\n6. That’s not to say that we didn’t make mistakes or that there wasn’t problems...but I have yet to find the media writing about that in a way that advances the conversation or informs people.\n7. But you will easily find people who didn’t like it there and I get it...it’s not for everyone')
