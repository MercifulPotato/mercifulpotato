I&#x27;ve already learned one set of commands for all that, why learn a second, less general set of commands?<p>I have started using stashes in one <i>very</i> specific case:<p>1.  I realize I&#x27;m on the wrong branch\n2.  I&#x27;ve made no commits\n3.  The right branch has changes to files I&#x27;ve modified<p><pre><code>    git stash push\n    git checkout -b newbranch upstream&#x2F;right\n    git stash apply\n    ...verify...\n    git stash list\n    git stash drop [id]\n</code></pre>\nCareful and safe, but not actually much faster than my old workflow, and I haven&#x27;t the foggiest idea how to fix things up with stash if I&#x27;ve made several commits, if that&#x27;s even a thing.<p><pre><code>    git checkout -b dead&#x2F;wrong\n    git add -A .\n    git commit -m &quot;WIP&quot;\n    git checkout -b newbranch\n    git rebase --onto upstream&#x2F;right upstream&#x2F;wrong\n    ...verify...\n    # optional\n    # git branch -D dead&#x2F;wrong\n    # git reset --soft HEAD~1\n</code></pre>\nDepending on if you count the optional commands, that&#x27;s one more or one less command.  &quot;Those aren&#x27;t optional!&quot; you might say - but yes, they are.  I&#x27;ll often merely amend my WIP commit into a real one instead of resetting.  I&#x27;ll often keep dead branches long term - perhaps some of my work relied on things that haven&#x27;t landed on upstream&#x2F;right yet, and can&#x27;t be brought over sanely until upstream&#x2F;wrong lands on upstream&#x2F;right, or just for peace of mind that I might&#x27;ve forgotten something.  Good dead branch names makes this less painful than... <i>numbered</i> stashes?  Eww, gross.')
