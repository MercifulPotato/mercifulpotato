Item(by='johnsonjo', descendants=None, kids=[24892688], score=None, time=1603684162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24882480, text='I&#x27;ve been using pandoc a lot recently for converting DRM free epubs into plain text and then piping that into Mac&#x27;s say command generally then I pipe that to ffmpeg and output the file to mp3 for compressions sake. say is a text-to-speech program. Obviously I only use the audio output for myself. But, I find mac&#x27;s Books app useful for the audio because you can set the speed up to 2x the original. (I&#x27;m sure the say command also has some similar settings too.) I even set up my own Automator task to do most the work for me. I am so thankful to those who made pandoc though it has come in handy time and time again. I used it for tons of my school papers back when I was in school and now it&#x27;s my go to document converter.<p>EDIT:\nI&#x27;ve also used this workflow for reading RFCs for OAuth and such. It&#x27;s just basically a small curl piped to say away. Sometimes if I feel like reading an article I&#x27;ll add a readability like cli tool piped between the curl and say commands. Unix is awesome!')
