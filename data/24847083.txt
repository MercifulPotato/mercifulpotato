They&#x27;re always under far more scrutiny than liberals, because over 90% of journalists are liberal and they don&#x27;t cover Democrats the same way. They spent 3 years on a fake Russian scandal against Trump. Spent $50 million+ and wasted the nation&#x27;s time based on some DNC paid for propaganda hit piece by a washed up ex-MI6 agent.<p>This is a great example of what happens when you uncritically seek out information which satisfies your political biases without thinking about it critically. I’m sure you do believe what you wrote above because people you trust have told you to do so, but wishing doesn’t mean that it’s true.<p>For example, do you really expect anyone to believe there’s a global “the media” with uniform beliefs spanning everyone from the BBC and NPR to Fox News and The Guardian? Want to try using evidence to show that, say, journalists were covering for Hillary Clinton during the previous election? (Or for the amusing belief that they’re covering for Biden now by totally not covering this other than all of the hundreds of stories running about it?)<p>Your mischaracterization of the Russia investigation similarly shows that you’re only reading sources friendly to the subjects.
