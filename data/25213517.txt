It also looked at things like timezone, screen resolution, battery charge level etc So they could determine if it was &#x27;you&#x27; who was using the captcha, soon after, in a separate session (even on a different device!)<p>I&#x27;d bet a good amount that they store that along with all the other personally identifying info they have on you (and google of course has a massive amount of that); which is basically why after a single reCAPTCHA solve, you wont see them prompt you again for ages - they know who you are.')
