I see you made the calcluation when you made your decision.<p>It&#x27;s a shame really because I believe nuclear power has great promise in benefitting society.<p>Too bad the moonshot level investment in nuclear went towards military ends (france in 80&#x27;s excepted).  And too bad funding is dependent on political whim.<p>Although solar and wind is working, I worry that might be a &quot;save ourselves rich&quot; strategy.<p>When you look at this table:<p><pre><code>  material              energy density mj&#x2F;kg\n  Uranium               22,394,000,000\n  Diesel fuel           38.6\n  Lithium-ion battery  2.63\n</code></pre>\nI think it would be nice to think about the benefits of growth on the high end not just savings on the low end.  I believe making energy available in ever-increasing plentiful quantities at low (to zero) cost would really change the world.')
