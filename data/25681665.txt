I don&#x27;t think my body can tolerate this much longer. If we were to switch the coal power plants to nuclear energy, I&#x27;d jump up and down like a little girl. A small risk of second Chernobyl seems just fine in comparison to this. I&#x27;d be fine with a risk of nuclear explosion with no chance to escape, honestly.')
