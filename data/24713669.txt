The worst because it was uncomfortable and built like a horse cart, everything in this brand new, very expensive mercedes creaked, rattled and squeaked. I&#x27;ve been back to the garage so many times for &quot;minor&quot; fixes just to make the car usable I nearly ended up hating it after the first year, then kind of ended up learning to live it and started enjoying it more. Which brings me to the other side - I loved the way it drove, it was like the extension of my mind and my body, it was like glued to the road and like a rocket if you wanted it to be.<p>So yeah, I totally 100% get how you can simultaneously love and hate a car, especially if it&#x27;s an expensive one.')
