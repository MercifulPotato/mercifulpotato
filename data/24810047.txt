It doesn’t seem crazy to gamble that this will eventually be restricted heavily, particularly in Europe, and thus that it will become more expensive (fossil fuel ships aren’t going away anytime soon, but we could definitely see greatly increased standards).<p>The article does concentrate on CO2, but I suspect that’s not the real story here.')
