(Is part of why DbC is so useful is because it&#x27;s an extremely concise way to write assertions?)<p>I&#x27;d love static typing systems if they allowed for DbC-style type declarations.  There are times when the thing I need to use isn&#x27;t a generic int, or even a short int, but an integer  three or more.  That&#x27;s also type information, just not type information based on the shape of the data in memory.  I&#x27;ve never seen a type system that can make those determinations at compile time, even when working with literal numbers in source code.')
