Most people don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to know all of the technical features of a URL; they just need to be able to use it as an <i>address</i> and recognize basic features like the hostname.<p>Street addresses are a good analogy. Most people understand the basics easily even though physical addresses are <i>far more complex</i>[2] than URLs!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7694919" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7694919</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7695735" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7695735</a>')
