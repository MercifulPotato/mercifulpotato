It is a piracy hub, 90% of it is illegal with regards to copyright, the rest is fueled by predatory business practices. If it was mainstream media, it would have been sued to oblivion, or, like YouTube, forced to adopt aggressive anti-piracy measures.<p>And, maybe there is a little bit of child porn on PornHub, it is bound to happen since users can upload anything. I could probably upload child porn on YouTube if I wanted to, that would be short lived and it would get me into trouble but I can probably get a few hundred views before it gets caught. But the thing is, I never stumbled upon it. In fact, I pretty much only get illegally uploaded content from legitimate studios or &quot;PornHub originals&quot;.<p>That anti-sex work groups attack PornHub is ironic. It would be like being against the record industry and attacking The Pirate Bay.')
