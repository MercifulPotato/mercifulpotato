The &quot;inability to count votes&quot; in many of the swing states this year was due to their Republican legislatures refusing to pass legislation allowing for the absentee ballots to be counted as they arrived, leading to a backlog after the election that they thought would make it easier to challenge these votes in court or to raise doubt about the outcome of the election.  As we do every year, we will count all the votes, and each county and state will do their final canvass and report the results by the legally mandated deadline.')
