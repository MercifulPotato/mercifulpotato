Antagonized opponents do not need debate. They are not listening to arguments. They are arguing to show their loyalty to their own side and the science shows this. They are not trying to find a new position or willing to change their mind and the science shows this as well.<p>This naive belief that &quot;we should have more debate!!&quot; will solve our problem must be put to rest. Instead, make the two sides go bowling together, or to a picnic. Then we&#x27;ll see real change.')
