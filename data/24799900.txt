Item(by='throwaway316943', descendants=None, kids=[24800004], score=None, time=1602849434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24797638, text='Forgive my limited knowledge of biochemistry but isn’t the gist of it that nucleotides code for and combine to form amino acids which when put in certain sequences form enzymes and proteins whose structure then enables some function so it is much like the paper tape model of a computer except instead of paper with holes in it you have a polymer with a few types of “hooks” that allows it to fold into an origami machine that can manipulate or join with other bits of paper to do things? This is different from programming a computer which relies on reading instructions from such a tape but only in that the computer and its functions&#x2F;actuators are made of tape. It may be a strained metaphor but it is how I conceptualize it. Please correct me if I’m wrong.')
