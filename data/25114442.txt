However, the discussion in this thread swerved very strongly away from vaccines (and the related thoughts, emotions, and feelings about vaccination) and veered towards coronavirus, its impact on society, and people&#x27;s behaviors re:covid.<p>It was only at that point (I think the thread had about 200 comments or so) that I added my 2cents. Ideally, this whole thread should have been ONLY about vaccination.')
