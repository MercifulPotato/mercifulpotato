If they were under the AGPL or say a new better GPL which patches the problems with GPLv3 then those companies that have destroyed the open web would have at least had to buy the work or do it themselves.  Even if that doesn&#x27;t have a huge impact on the state of things, at least project maintainers can say that they are not contributing to it.')
