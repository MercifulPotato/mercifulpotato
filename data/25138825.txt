Suppose Person A says something, and Person B thinks another colleague, Person C, <i>might</i> find offensive.<p>That alone may be enough to offend Person B. They feel Person A may be creating an uncomfortable environment, intentional or not. Person C may not even be actually offended, but other people of Person C&#x27;s {race,sex,etc} have been offended by similar statements. How people apply judgment is an individual process.<p>Should we care about how any of these people feel? Is Person {A,B,C} right or wrong to feel how they do? We can&#x27;t control how other people feel about things, but we can try our best as individuals to promote welcoming environments, but recognize we are human and won&#x27;t always get it right.')
