Item(by='Syonyk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612058012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969272, text='(Solar Shed guy here, I currently have 5kW of panel hung on my office, 10kWh of lead acid, 2kW of inverter, etc)<p>Unclear as to what you mean &quot;off-grid for 24 hours&quot; - do you need to be off-grid 24&#x2F;7, or simply run a 2kW device for 24h after the power grid goes down?<p>Both are quite expensive, the second somewhat less so than the first (though still very expensive).  You can probably do the second for under US$10k, probably not the first.<p>And depending on the use case, the suggestion of &quot;Use a generator...&quot; is very, very much the cheapest option for short term use.<p>Taking both options here, and going with hardware I would trust to do the job:<p>If you want to run a 2kW load for 24h after the grid goes down, are OK with charging from the grid, and simply need a really long term, high capacity UPS for infrequent use, your best bet will be something like an Aims Power inverter&#x2F;charger or similar.  I would go with minimum a 24V system for this, and for 2kW, you really should be up at 48V.  Yes, I know there are 5kW 12V inverters, and, no, you really don&#x27;t want to be dorking around with hundreds of amps if you can avoid it.<p>A 4kW Aims Power inverter&#x2F;charger will comfortably run a 2kW load, and will charge the battery bank afterwards.  At 48V, you&#x27;ll need a minimum of 1000Ah at a 20 hour rate, and will probably want 1250-1500Ah.  If you can at all avoid parallel strings with lead acid, do so.  A bunch of battery strings in parallel just guarantees early death, because they won&#x27;t charge equally over time.<p>You could use a Trojan SPRE 02 1255 or SIND 06 1225 to build a single string that would run the load, as long as they&#x27;re warm.  This will almost certainly be cheaper than lithium unless you&#x27;ve got a good source of scrap cells and want to build your own.  However, this is really hard on the cells (running them down to 80+% depth of discharge), and they won&#x27;t last more than a few years if they&#x27;re getting cycled like that daily.  If it&#x27;s infrequent use, have a ball, it&#x27;ll be fine.<p>Now, if you want to do it with solar, it becomes a harder question.  How long does it really need to run, and do you care about a generator?  &quot;Sun is not a problem here&quot; is a common claim, rarely backed by data.  You never get clouds or storms?  With well aimed panels, in winter, you may only have 6h of usable sun (unless you&#x27;re using trackers) to generate your 48kWh daily use (plus some overhead for charging), so you&#x27;re looking at about 10-12kWh, &#x2F;minimum&#x2F; - and realistically, if you want to ride through cloudy days, you&#x27;ll need far more.  Or, you have to have an automatic generator start.  Another option would be to have far more battery capacity so you can ride through a few more days, but then you run into the problem of having to have enough solar to recharge it.  Practically, for fixed panels, to ride through winter, you&#x27;re looking at 20-30kW of panel hung.<p>Something like a string of SIND 02 2450 would get you around 115kWh nameplate of battery, which might be overkill, but you won&#x27;t drain it too deeply with normal overnight use, and you have capacity for two days of &quot;no solar input&quot; with the pack capacity.  The pack will be 3.25 tons, give or take, but still cheaper than a similar capacity in lithium.<p>I would estimate a system cost in the US$50k-US$75k range in materials if you do it yourself, easily $100k if you&#x27;re having someone else do it.<p>The right answer here is to either connect to the power grid, or figure out a way to reduce your loads when there&#x27;s no sun.  Running a 2kW on solar, 24&#x2F;7, is doable, but it&#x27;s a very, very expensive project.')
