For one, we could easily verify the vaccines of those countries with independent testing here or there, we don&#x27;t have to &quot;trust&quot; their development method and testing.<p>Not to mention we seemed to have no problem trusting their drugs and vaccines (Chinese ones) for decades. Suddenly we don&#x27;t?<p>It&#x27;s the trade war with China and the pressure on Russia (to just give in and open up to western companies&#x2F;demands like in the Yeltsin era).<p>The rest are excuses for gullible citizens.')
