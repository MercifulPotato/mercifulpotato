On 2) I believe that I’ve adequately addressed your concerns — I acknowledge &#x2F;Plato&#x2F; specifically in my reply as shown in your link and my critique on &quot;Ancient theories&quot; is covered in a previous post. The last point overlaps with the 2nd point and I have found no criticisms to the contrary in your answers.<p>On semantics and pendantry of terms I’m disinterested — we could debate all day and I could argue that the very term &quot;Division of Labour&quot; originated in Adam Smith’s work [1] and therefore isn’t the same as specialization. Such a debate would neither be useful nor productive.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;division%20of%20labor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;division%20of%20l...</a>')
