That means everything I just enumerated and more must be retained every time a query is run against my data or auction is ran to advertise to me.<p>What&#x27;s that about a short list? Sorry, I may not have been clear, if you&#x27;re using 1 data point or 1x10e999 I have the right to know every single one. I have the right to know the inferences drawn about me and how advertisers can target me. If companies aren&#x27;t retiring data they are reckless and auditable records for every customer should help to rectify that imbalance. Likewise, if a model cannot be explained, proven mathematically, and reproduced then it&#x27;s bad computer science. I&#x27;m sorry if this seems offensive but I&#x27;m sick of the whole move fast and break things when innocent people keep getting hurt or companies fleeced of their advertising dollars.<p>Either this stuff can be explained in reverse (so consumers know what privacy they&#x27;ve sacrificed, and advertisers know they&#x27;re not being fleeced) or it can&#x27;t and there&#x27;s sketchy or bad computer science at work.')
