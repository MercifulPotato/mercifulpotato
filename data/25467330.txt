Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608301412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465882, text='&gt; when it comes to country like Kazakhstan or any other smaller country, everyone seem to become powerful and create sanctions.<p>It&#x27;s because Kazakhstan tries to man-in-the-middle attack all their citizens by making them install a government-issued root certificate, which is easy to defend against. (Just don&#x27;t trust the certificate.) If they used an IP-based blocklist to filter all traffic (like China), that would be much harder to counter.<p>As for sanctions, I haven&#x27;t seen any proposed against Kazakhstan over their human-rights record (including suppression of their own Uyghur minority).')
