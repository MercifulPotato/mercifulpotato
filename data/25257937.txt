And no, Android&#x27;s mock location feature doesn&#x27;t work, because apps can check if the feature is enabled or not<p>- The ability to fake IMEI, phone number, contact list, installed apps, and other identifying data<p>- Ability to generate fake IMU, proximity, temperature, barometer, and all other sensor data that could conceivably be used for fingerprinting')
