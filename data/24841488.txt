I&#x27;ve used Linux full time on the desktop, laptop, and on the server for over 10 years now and I have a better experience there than mac (which I had to use on my work machine for 6 months due to employer <i>only</i> allowing macs).<p>Of course everything is not perfect, but that wasn&#x27;t true in mac either.
