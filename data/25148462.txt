They&#x27;re trying to teach my youngest how to subtract with carry. Now I taught her the column method about a year ago but she&#x27;s not allowed to use that suddenly due to a new idea they have. Not a single one of the children understood it so the teacher went back to column method a couple of days later having pissed the time on that attempt out of the window. This sort of stuff happens very regularly.<p>Fashion is exactly it. I feel like they experiment on them rather than use established methods.')
