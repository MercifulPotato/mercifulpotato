The two main topics here (in my view) are 1. Twitter&#x27;s response to Substack and how this move will impact the two companies and 2. the fact that some of Substack&#x27;s most prominent users are writers who are refugees from other platforms (Andrew Sullivan from New York magazine, Bari Weiss from the New York Times etc.) who left because of the suppression-of-unpopular-speech trends that Twitter is now famous for.<p>So Revue is what, Substack minus fees plus twitter viewpoint-enforcement? In any event I think this topic (censorship) at least bears discussion and I encourage users here not to downvote the discussion in the name of &quot;suppressing right wingers&quot; or similar. Twitter <i>does not just ban right wingers</i>. Take a look at the list of prominent people banned from twitter[0], it includes people such as Talib Kweli, Zuby (both rappers), &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; creator Graham Linehan, numerous political satire accounts, numerous feminists, and numerous artists and others for death threats towards such potential victims as &quot;the Planters mascot Mr. Peanut,&quot; &quot;a dead mosquito&quot; and &quot;the country Austria&quot; (issued by an Austrian artist).<p>If you have strong contrary views, you are probably in the danger zone for getting a twitter suspension or ban if someone wants to make a point of reporting you. Censorship should definitely be part of this discussion of Revue.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Twitter_suspensions#List_of_notable_suspensions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Twitter_suspensions#List_of_no...</a>')
