It&#x27;s a roundabout way of simply printing money directly<p>If a bond need to be realised the government switch on the money printer and hands it out (though it&#x27;s not really a printer, since it&#x27;s all digital). If they hadn&#x27;t issued the bond they could simply create the exact same amount of money and have the exact same amount of &quot;national debt&quot;. Sure it&#x27;s called interest rates, but from the government&#x27;s side of the table it makes no difference<p>The government can print infinite money at any time and there is literally no difference in the taxes needed, the level of national debt, or the government&#x27;s ability to fund welfare whether they issue bonds or not. Bonds are a plan for how much the government expects to print in the future, not loans that requires taxes to be paid<p>It&#x27;s your choice to put me in some box belonging to a &quot;side&quot;. I don&#x27;t see myself that way and you telling me which side I belong to is not really going to change that. It does however make me sad to read your message. I think the world already has too much conflict and the only way I can see out of it is with dialogue, openness, and empathy<p>Putting people in boxes, on a &quot;side&quot;, or assigning them a label prevents all of those and will only create more conflict and more frustration<p>I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re scared of the concepts in MTT, since you&#x27;re comparing it to the tobacco industry.<p>My personal experience is that understanding people you disagree with is the best way to move past being scared. I hope you make a choice for yourself to approach disagreement in a more constructive way for your own sake<p>I&#x27;m fine with you having a different worldview than me, but I&#x27;m not really interested in hearing what you have to say if it&#x27;s not done in a respectful dialogue, so I&#x27;m not interested in discussing this further with you')
