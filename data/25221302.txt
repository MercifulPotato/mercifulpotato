Same problems with the old Surface RT with the ARM chip, backward compat with existing software made the whole experience difficult for almost all folks. As for SPX with Windows 10 on ARM, you can&#x27;t use any 64bit app and existing x86 32-bit apps were incredibly slow and not reliable (look at photoshop for an example). 64-bit emulation support is coming next year[^1]. Many of their development tools are not native either, some folks are still waiting for MS to ship Visual Studio to ARM [^2], .NET 5 was just shipped a week ago with some basic ARM support but no WPF for ARM until next year.<p>The difference here is Apple has a very fast x86 translation layer called Rosetta 2 that can run almost all Intel apps at 80% or so of the native M1 performance. Most folks don&#x27;t even notice the difference. Windows 10 on ARM (SPX) had to emulate it at all time, with massive performance regressions.<p>What Apple has done is a complete transition that includes both hardware&#x2F;software to ARM at the same time. All of their apps including development tools (Xcode) were native, huge number of macOS devs already shipped native support on day 1 or within the first week and Rosetta 2 made waiting for native support okay.<p>And that&#x27;s just the software. The hardware? Super fast, long battery life, fanless in MBA, very quiet fan in MB and more. For a lot of people, it&#x27;s a complete experience that worked out for them.<p>Note, not all developers are going to be ready for this, there&#x27;s no docker support, some tooling will take awhile to update but they&#x27;re going at much faster pace than MS at this point.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;9&#x2F;30&#x2F;21495510&#x2F;microsoft-windows-on-arm-x64-app-emulation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;9&#x2F;30&#x2F;21495510&#x2F;microsoft-window...</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;visualstudio&#x2F;install&#x2F;visual-studio-on-arm-devices?view=vs-2019#:~:text=Visual%20Studio%20is%20only%20supported%20on%20devices%20using,emulation%20on%20ARM%2C%20which%20Visual%20Studio%20can%20run" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;visualstudio&#x2F;install&#x2F;visual...</a>.')
