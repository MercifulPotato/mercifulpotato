That&#x27;s partially a good thing (Salesforce isn&#x27;t making them worse) but also a bad thing because Salesforce doesn&#x27;t seem to be making them any <i>better</i> either. Pricing is the biggest thing, despite running on AWS and AWS prices dropping pretty steadily but Heroku&#x27;s pricing seems to have held firm. Their offerings don&#x27;t seem to have changed much over the years either, you don&#x27;t hear about them in the news much, you don&#x27;t hear a lot of customer stories or companies talking about using Heroku... it just seems stagnant, which in the world of cloud computing is not great.<p>It&#x27;s hard to tell if Salesforce has been a positive for Heroku for keeping it alive, or a negative for mismanaging the company, since we don&#x27;t know what they would have done if they stayed independent and had to actually compete. But I&#x27;m pretty sure if they were still independent and had to compete in the market with only the features they have right now, they would likely be out of business. There&#x27;s very little reason to choose Heroku these days, and I say that as someone who has code running in production on Heroku&#x27;s platform.')
