Not as crazy as it sounds - people joke about being tired&#x2F;sleep-deprived, unmotivated, and (more to the point) various negative emotional states all the time in a business environment. Others laugh because they&#x27;ve been there. Perhaps all the more so if you phrase it in an unexpectedly precise, analytical way using big words. If someone says &quot;Right now I would prefer a silica-rich intertidal environment in a tropical latitude&quot; I would probably laugh. That&#x27;s a trivial example but you get the idea.<p>Not saying &quot;This is how it is,&quot; but rather &quot;It&#x27;s possible.&quot; Also keep in mind that we&#x27;re only getting (ironically) one side of it&#x2F;one person&#x27;s experience with this blog post, and will likely never know what was in the mind of the one who chuckled.')
