Any decent programmer can ask technical questions, but great interviewers will do everything in their power to help you stay relaxed and calm while you answer them.<p>When you get too stressed, your creativity then your memory stop working properly. So its simply impossible to fairly assess the technical skills of a candidate while they&#x27;re on their way to a panic attack. Knowing how to keep people calm is rarely on the job description, but its an essential skill of any good interviewer.')
