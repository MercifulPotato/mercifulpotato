You don&#x27;t really think Apple added those EULA terms for MacStadium now right? They were clearly added for AWS! MacStadium just happens to be happy that there&#x27;s crystal-clear red lines.<p>These rules are 100% down to Apple, absolutely nothing to do with AWS and MacStadium in terms of decision-making.<p>Apple don&#x27;t want the perceived value of their machines to become lower, want to make sure there&#x27;s no possibility of performance issues due to multiple tenancy, and want to make sure this doesn&#x27;t become a way for people to have a personal Mac without having a Mac.<p>Maybe in another year or two, assuming nothing came out of this which Apple didn&#x27;t like, they might loosen the rules slightly.')
