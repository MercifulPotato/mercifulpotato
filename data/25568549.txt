I like Apple laptops but they&#x27;re not great in terms of repairability, extensibility, modularity and openness.<p>There are some non-Apple laptops with much better displays BTW, even Lenovo ships 500 nit displays and wide-color gamut ones with some their laptops nowadays. Dell and other manufacturers ship OLED display with some of their gaming laptops, which far outperform any Apple laptop display.<p>Regarding Aluminium vs. hardened plastic &#x2F; titanium I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just a style question, I have never had any issues with my Thinkpads and they&#x27;re way more resistant to scratching than Apple laptops (a poor colleage of mine badly scratched his new Macbook with his steel wrist watch only days after receiving it).<p>Regarding upgradability I prefer being able to extend RAM and hard disk as well as easily replace the battery, again Apple is a poor choice in regard to that.<p>Regarding repairability Apple actively keeps me from being able to repair my machine, take e.g. a look at Louis Rossmans&#x27; Youtube channel to learn about some of the crazy stuff Apple does to keep independent repair shops out of the game. Again nothing that I want to encourage.<p>That said the introduction of the M1 chips is pretty great, I plan to buy a Macbook Air as my second laptop for office work, I&#x27;ll keep developing on a Thinkpad with Linux though.')
