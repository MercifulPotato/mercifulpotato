Server CPUs are core for core clocked much lower than consumer chips, cooling and power are huge issues.<p>If you can fit 500-1000 mediocre arm cores in the same space as 128 x86 cores at half the power&#x2F;heat, it absolutely makes sense for something like Azure.  They don&#x27;t have to beat Intel&#x2F;AMD on a core for core basis as long as they can compete on compute&#x2F;space&#x2F;power requirements horizontally.<p>It&#x27;s not the best option for some loads, but is a good enough option for enough loads that the diversification can really work out.  There&#x27;s plenty of software&#x2F;systems&#x2F;services that don&#x27;t need x86 per core performance and a single ARM core is enough per node.')
