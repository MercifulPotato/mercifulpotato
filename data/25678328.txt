I experience the exact same problems OP describes with three MB Pro laptops since 2018. More than 7000 bucks down the drain not calculating the 2100 for repairs.<p>The company I work for had 1-2 percent of devices in repair every week.<p>Not sure if this is just a strange coincidence, but I know of at least one other company in our town with the same scope of the described problem.<p>I know this isn&#x27;t a popular sentiment with some people, but from experience, I am done with Apple after 28 years of experience. My first was a beautiful Macintosh Classic I still have. Together with a SE 30. Somehow I miss my pre 2018 Macbook Pro.')
