And in my experience, people who say that never take me up on my offer to buy their equity from that at valuations significantly higher than 0 $.<p>Having spent a decent chunk of my career at startups, I think a better mindset is:<p>1) Never value your options as if they were worth the preferred price, but at a significant discount (exact discount size depends on company and stage)<p>2) Approach working at a startup like the financial investment it is. Ask for all the data on growth and revenue you can get (Last fundraising round&#x27;s pitch deck is good, if it was fairly recent).')
