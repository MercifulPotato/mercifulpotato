Item(by='ivraatiems', descendants=None, kids=[25918844], score=None, time=1611679457, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25917209, text='&gt; It wasn&#x27;t politically correct to vote Brexit, so nobody mentioned it and just voted.<p>I&#x27;m sure this is part of what I experienced, but we asked a lot of people and there wasn&#x27;t much noncommittal &quot;not sures&quot; or anything. It was a lot of flat &quot;no ways.&quot;<p>&gt; I&#x27;d take a business &#x2F; economic hit over having a political end economic entity rule my country, especially one which contains countries that are ticking bombs with no hope to recover.<p>I&#x27;ve heard this line of reasoning before, and it&#x27;s never quite made sense to me. The EU is an enormous area populated mostly with economies that are doing relatively fine. They&#x27;re not <i>all</i> going to be fine all the time. Britain hasn&#x27;t always been economically super healthy - the 1970s, when it joined the EU, were a pretty poor period in its economic history - and it still got the benefit of being in the EU. I don&#x27;t want my state to secede from the Union because other states elsewhere have problems I don&#x27;t have (though obviously plenty of people have felt that way throughout history).<p>It just feels like a lot of &quot;I help mine and only mine&quot; over &quot;we all help each other,&quot; where &quot;mine&quot; means &quot;people who are in the same geographical region as me, roughly speaking, with some exceptions.&quot; Who we decide to care about or not all feels really arbitrary, just as borders between countries are pretty arbitrary.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you personally are selfish, or that British people are selfish, but it does feel like a deeply self-serving and frankly misguided impulse. Britain and so much of the world are as peaceful and prosperous as they are today is because of a safe, peaceful global environment based on mutual assistance. (That&#x27;s not to say things haven&#x27;t gotten worse in the last ~10 years - just that for as bad as things are in this downturn now, they were <i>so much worse</i> in the not-too-distant past.)')
