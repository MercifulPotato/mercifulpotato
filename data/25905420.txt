Which would be true. The person would have not felt better in any way because the data is gone, and would not have learned something either.<p>Does the person feel worse because of my comment? Don&#x27;t think so. Either he already new and agrees with &#x27;Yes, d* it should have done that, you&#x27;re right&#x27; - what I felt someone said this to me - or he learned something. Perhaps if getting kicked hard enough he will not skip backups next time.<p>Does he feel bad? Sure.<p>Does anyone think about the people who he dragged down with him because he didn&#x27;t have backups which would have been something he is paid for but didn&#x27;t - do risking the jobs of everyone around him.<p>When consulting the FIRST thing I ask:<p>DO YOU HAVE BACKUPS FOR YOUR AWS&#x2F;GOOGLE&#x2F;... DATA?<p>And if not do it now - although the usually answer is: This is the cloud I don&#x27;t need backups because they backup the data&#x2F;redundancy&#x2F;S3&#x2F;... What about someone deleting it? By accident or itention? What about you getting sued by A&#x2F;G&#x2F;MS&#x2F;...? What if they kick you of like XXX (Parler, ...)?<p>Most do backups to a another provider the same day.<p>Not having backups if you&#x27;re the one responsible is not the same as getting cancer or being hit by a car. It&#x27;s you&#x27;ve screwed up very badly endangering many other people.')
