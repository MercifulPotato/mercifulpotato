This takes the form of colorless liquid at room temperature.<p>Dimethylphosphite is ideal because the phosphorous and hydrogen atoms are bonded to each other and close enough to interact while also capable of being manipulated independently.<p>To ensure that the radio signals from the hydrogen and phosphorus atoms are strong enough to pick up, a huge number of molecules must be used, about 10^15 of them. That requires a few drops of liquid, which sit in a small vial in the middle of the powerful magnetic field.<p><i>The technique is well understood and has long been used to make medical images of the body.</i><p>Indeed, the first quantum computers built in the 1990s used exactly the same approach.&quot;')
