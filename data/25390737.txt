This is why inclusive laws are so important. We don&#x27;t have many now, and they&#x27;re under constant threat.<p>People in the democratic party are beginning to come to terms with the fact they&#x27;ve had a cancerous brand issue since Bill Clinton, which Hillary further damaged. I don&#x27;t know what to say of the Republican party who&#x27;ve fallen into lockstep with trumps criminal behavior.<p>Either we live in a country with laws and punishments for the criminals or we don&#x27;t. Trump&#x27;s made it unequivocally clear, on the world stage, that our law enforcement is prohibited from doing much besides abuse the human rights of immigrants (to his bases celebrations no less), round up junkies or put the occasional symbolic head on a spike. In a situation like this I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s going to be rational discourse that solves these problems. While I&#x27;d love to sit down and have rational conversations about politics with people from the other side, I&#x27;m afraid that many people are incapable of admitting that they&#x27;re wrong, at least not before they&#x27;ve tried everything else. It&#x27;s a movie trope and a saying for a reason.')
