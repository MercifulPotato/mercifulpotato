People trust the healthcare system since we &quot;pay&quot; 0$ for access. (pay in quotes since obviously taxes are significantly higher)<p>And Drs. I know are great at listening! I&#x27;d honestly go as far as to say they listen too much at times; I don&#x27;t tell a mechanic how to do his job, it&#x27;s not my place to tell a Dr. how to fix me since I have literal 0 understanding of the human body.<p>Again, maybe its a socialized medicine vs privatized medicine problem, but it absolutely boggles my mind the level of distrust in what should be a respected profession.<p>My comments aren&#x27;t meant to disparage, but point out that colloquial evidence is not a substitute for research and the scientific method. I will call baloney on people who spew it.')
