Why will you have swap on container nodes?   IMO, the idea with container management is to get predictability with resources.  If you have 8gb on a node, you know that the containers get 8gb. You might not be able to tell exactly how based on how it&#x27;s configured, but you know once they collectively use 8gb, that&#x27;s it.  Swap is going to mess up things really bad in ways you can&#x27;t even predict.')
