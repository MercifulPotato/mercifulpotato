By, like, a hundred years. I&#x27;ll take that.<p>Obviously the bigger risk to Australia et al is reintroduction from other countries. So Australia&#x27;s borders will continue to require 14 days of quarantine until there is a good enough vaccine. However, New Zealand has now seen three re-introductions, and they have managed to suppress them just fine so far. So if this is what delaying the inevitable looks like, I&#x27;ll take it too. Seems like it can be delayed an awfully long time.<p>Maintaining quarantine at borders is an option, if a country decides they want to do it. Australia decided it wanted to. I see no reason why this can&#x27;t be sustained indefinitely, it&#x27;s merely a matter of how long Australia is willing to have a border quarantine system in place (which comes with all kinds of costs due to reduced international travel).<p>There&#x27;s no epidemiological reason the virus can&#x27;t be suppressed and kept out of a given region. The only remaining question is how soon we expect a vaccine such that this isolation is worth it in the long run. If a vaccine never comes then it is not a viable strategy, otherwise, it does seem like a good call.<p>Just want to remind you that I&#x27;m writing this from Australia where there is practically no virus in the community and are freedoms are increasing rather than decreasing. I don&#x27;t expect there&#x27;ll be widespread COVID in Australia ever again, as we&#x27;ve gotten quite good at suppressing small outbreaks now.')
