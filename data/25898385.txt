Most of folks like you don&#x27;t just act like you don&#x27;t fear not existing, but you actively don&#x27;t understand how OTHERS can fear it.<p>Which makes me think one of two things: 1) The type of person who can be comfortable and this pragmatic about it is the kind of cold unfeeling unempathetic person that I simply could never be, or 2) Your cold detached pragmatic attitude is <i>ITSELF</i> a coping strategy for dealing with mortality. I dwell in the fear of not existing. You deal with it by pretending it&#x27;s not even something worth burning an ounce of energy on.<p>If I&#x27;m wrong, then I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;d love to see you explain that you understand the fear, and then explain why you personally believe it&#x27;s something you can make peace with. But every explanation I&#x27;ve heard so far I just haven&#x27;t been able to follow.<p>My consciousness and awareness is all I have. When that ends, so will every dream, fantasy, feeling, emotion, hope, aspiration, joy, fear, sadness, idea, invention, and creative outlet I&#x27;ve ever had. And I won&#x27;t have any more after that. That is objectively terrifying.<p>Just because it&#x27;s inescapable doesn&#x27;t make it any less disturbing.')
