There should be one risk pool either nation or state wide and within that everybody can get insurance for the same price. It would reduce a lot of administrative effort in companies (why does my employer have to worry about my health insurance but not my car insurance?) and allow people to change jobs without worrying about health care. Religious  employers also couldn&#x27;t  control things like birth control because health insurance would be none of their business.')
