Many people want to talk in the public (or at least town) square, which trends strongly towards a few providers (where everybody is), which establishes de facto global free speech limits via those provider&#x27;s policies.<p>And &quot;moving to another service&quot; isn&#x27;t a feasible redress.<p>Do we want to live in a world where conservatives only read ConservaPedia, and liberals read LibPedia? Or one where they&#x27;re exposed to each other&#x27;s ideas and share some facts?<p>&gt;&gt; <i>the first amendment only applies to the government for a reason. [...] The number of people you can reach by shouting in a town square isn&#x27;t very high, that&#x27;s why the government can allow any kind of crank to do it. If you can reach millions...bad things would happen.</i><p>I&#x27;ll assume that&#x27;s the reason you were referring to? If so, we disagree on the intent of the First Amendment.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about audience reach, so much as relative power: government has historically had controls not available to private companies.<p>Yet in modern times, Facebook &#x2F; Twitter &#x2F; Youtube have as much or more control over their platforms, which are as bigger or bigger than the largest First Amendment-covered venue.<p>So while Facebook or Google can&#x27;t send the FBI to your door, they can effectively disappear your idea &#x2F; product from their ecosystems, and there are very few checks on that power, particularly when ranking algorithms are allowed to be shielded from public scrutiny.')
