The point I was trying to make was that the web applications that are slick are taking over the world. Being polished and easy to use is a big advantage, and IMHO there&#x27;s been a lot more progress on this front in web development recently than in native applications.<p>In contrast, the mobile platforms are far too much style-over-substance and have glaring usability problems as a result.<p>Most desktop applications haven&#x27;t really changed their basic form for decades, they just show up with flat icons and kindergarten levels of bright colours these days. That does mean here is a level of consistency and familiarity, which is valuable. However, it also means most of them aren&#x27;t benefitting from decades of further experience and research in UI design and from newer UI patterns coming out of that experience that have proved to be effective in other contexts.')
