Not only some texts have been verified, they have a former business partner going on record, verifying the messages along the way. What else do you want? People involved in the threads are claiming the messages to be true. What else do you want?<p>And, by the way, I could care less for the video and photographic content of that laptop, to me that content is irrelevant --actually, I feel sorry for Joe Biden and I can&#x27;t imagine how hard it must be to have a son who is a drug addict and a man child. But shouldn&#x27;t that also corroborate the validity of the laptop content? Why isn&#x27;t the media all over it?<p>And, please, let&#x27;s not pretend that several Trump stories came from anonymous sources with no audio or text evidence. And the mainstream media danced all over it. For instance, the (supposedly) anonymous senior administration who was part of the resistance. Not only did the NYT run stories on his unverified accounts (no audio&#x2F;text&#x2F;video to back it up), they also wrote a book with his accounts. And we just learned that this senior admin wasn&#x27;t senior after all. How can you really read thsoe stories and not come way perplexed by the blatant bias? I understand why people hate Trump, but is it worth to abandon journalism standards? Where do we go from here?')
