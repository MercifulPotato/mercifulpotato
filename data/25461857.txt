It certainly wasn&#x27;t for folks like Seth Lloyd, Joi Ito, Marvin Minsky, Steven Pinker, Stephen Kosslyn, Benedict Gross, Martin Nowak, Larry Summers, Larry Summers&#x27; wife, and countless others.  Some even sent the convicted child rapist personally signed thank-you notes like MIT president Rafael Reif.<p>I know that I would not have taken his money, as well as most of my colleagues who took very unpleasant jobs in industry because they could not obtain funding the &quot;old-fashioned way,&quot; which is by earning it through applying for primarily government-funded research grants that are subject to a peer-review process.<p>This is not to say that all of the research that government is funding is worth taxpayer money, or that there is enough money to fund the work that really needs to get done, for example in the medical domain.<p>My suggestion to Mr. Reif though is very simple:  instead of taking money from convicted child rapists, why not try spending the billions that your university already receives from taxpayers more responsibly, especially at places like MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which he should know a thing or two about since he became president of MIT for his role in the cover-up of missile defense research fraud at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which some observers believe led Susan Hockfield to unexpectedly resign from her position as president of MIT when the university was forced to enter into a settlement agreement with MIT Prof. Postol under the threat of facing potential criminal obstruction of justice charges, the terms of which are still sealed to this day.')
