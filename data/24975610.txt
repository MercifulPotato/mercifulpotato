The first question the hiring manager asked me on the phone? &quot;What editor do you use?&quot;  This same hiring manager was out sick for my interview (I did not learn this until I arrived at the office), and never responded when I pinged him a week later.  The whole process left me with a sour taste and I would caution other people not to have their time wasted similarly.')
