Perhaps it is wasted. If you give it to people you know need it locally, you can have immediate results. Why push for the former?&quot;<p>If I&#x27;ve understood you correctly, that&#x27;s a totally valid question, and it&#x27;s one I think about quite a bit. I could, for instance, really focus on helping people in my immediate area. I could buy a lot of meals for a lot of people.<p>But ultimately, I think I can achieve more by organizing. If I can spend some money on mutual aid to help out some folks locally, and spend some on building coalitions and participating in collective action, I think I ultimately achieve more.')
