I can pretty much see my future right now, and I don&#x27;t really like it. Like everyone else around me I&#x27;ll probably go into SWE or (more likely with a math background) finance, as is extremely popular at my college. While these jobs do interest me, I don&#x27;t really want to be a SWE day-to-day. I really like making things and while I always have really enjoy programming, I&#x27;d like to use it as more of a tool to solve problems that I find interesting, not really for developing large software. I think a job as a quant or something at a finance firm would be interesting, but they&#x27;re incredibly competitive. I don&#x27;t really see myself going to grad school, and I don&#x27;t really consider academia an option. I don&#x27;t exactly know what an answer to this question looks like but, what realistic career paths are there for someone like me? I&#x27;d really like to consider starting my own business &#x2F; being self-employed but I&#x27;m not sure how realistic this is. Are there any books, resources you&#x27;d recommend?<p>TLDR: what career options besides finance and software engineering do I have as a cs major?<p>Thanks!')
