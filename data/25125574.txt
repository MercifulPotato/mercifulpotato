I hope it leads to bold new things.<p>It also produces an interesting coherence:<p>Google + MS -&gt; Blink<p>Apple -&gt; Webkit<p>Linux -&gt; Servo<p>All the main OSs now have their own web rendering engine.<p>The 00s saw anti-trust against MS for this practice (ok, for the rigid way MS forced their engine onto their users)... but today the market has coalesced around the same core idea, cementing the notion that general purpose OSs need a web rendering engine.<p>Might this pave the way for a better cross-platform UI development? Rather than shipping Electron to every device for every app, apps might leverage the web renderer tied to the OS?<p>I&#x27;m just wondering out loud. I was actually hoping we&#x27;d collectively move back towards native apps with better cross-platform tools, rather than integrating web apps deeper into OSs (even tho&#x27; I&#x27;m a web developer by trade and stand to gain from this).')
