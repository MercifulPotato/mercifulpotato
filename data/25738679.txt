Item(by='jjoonathan', descendants=None, kids=[25739965], score=None, time=1610404901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25736714, text='Well I&#x27;ve played it and I love it.<p>I&#x27;ll agree with parts of what you said. If you want in-depth crafting, this isn&#x27;t the game. If you want a sandbox, this isn&#x27;t the game. If you want an immersive sim, this isn&#x27;t the game.<p>If you want hacking, this is the game. I don&#x27;t mean the hacking mini-game, which is still better than most, I mean the fact that every major skill tree can be ruthlessly exploited by learning its rules, and on higher difficulty you&#x27;re basically forced to do this. Many reviewers call it broken, but the incentive landscape is both steep and similar across different skill trees which makes me think it&#x27;s intentional. In any case, sniffing through the rulebook looking for exploitables and gleefully exploiting the shit out of them is The Hacking Experience as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Doom Eternal wants you to learn quickscopes and weapon-switching, CP2077 wants you to learn RTFM and exponential growth. It&#x27;s not as visceral and it&#x27;s much easier to cheat, but if you play it honestly then the thrill is quite comparable when your plan snaps together and you go from &quot;struggling asthmatic&quot; to &quot;cyber-god&quot; or &quot;machete-king&quot; or even &quot;discount doomslayer.&quot;<p>The character writing is on point. CP2077 puts more effort and personality into throwaway characters than most AAAs put into supporting characters, and it really shows in side missions and replays. The Witcher 3 was in its own class for having meaningful side-missions and while CP2077 doesn&#x27;t exceed it, it&#x27;s a positive outlier in the right direction. When someone who hasn&#x27;t played the game calls the side-quests unimaginative, it comes across as lazy and inauthentic virtue signaling. If someone came to that opinion first-hand I&#x27;d agree to disagree.<p>The endings are a highlight. No, they don&#x27;t have a combinatorial number of AI-written endings that respect every possible permutation of choices, but anyone who expects that in a 2020 game is delusional. In 2020, if you want quality endings you can either have a large number of short endings (Prey) or a small number of fully fleshed out endings. CP2077 does the latter and does it very well. It is now my go-to positive example in that regard, the polar opposite of Mass Effect 3.<p>On PC, the bugs weren&#x27;t bad and the graphics were good enough to give me a handful of &quot;ambiance moments.&quot;<p>I enjoyed CP2077 and since I kept my expectations under control that&#x27;s enough to stop me from going online and flaming it.')
