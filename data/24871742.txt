You can transform elements using exact numerical values in some contexts, but sometimes you just get a drag handle and can&#x27;t be precise. You can put tables in a document as standalone frames, but you can&#x27;t include them within your text story so they reflow properly. This is basic stuff for graphics and DTP software respectively, yet Affinity can&#x27;t do them.<p>But then again, for a very long time very basic search and replace options were missing in InDesign, so as I said before, it&#x27;s not as if Adobe&#x27;s software hasn&#x27;t had its share of bizarre limitations over the years as well.')
