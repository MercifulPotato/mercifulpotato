Lesser articles have been called out on HN... why not this one?<p>I never liked trump and especially hated him after his  speech right before the Capitol riot that incited that national embarrassment. I really want to see those bastards that paraded the confederate flag inside the Capitol rot in prison for every and all charges that apply. However, I won&#x27;t agree to make him a proverbial martyr either. That&#x27;ll just fan those flames some more. I want to see the stupidity end entirely, not just publicly.<p>If all it took was to boot him from social media, then that would make him some damned smart evil genius all these years, dont you think? Or, and here&#x27;s my theory, he&#x27;s a guy with good entertainment skills and knows how to pick out disenfranchised groups and spin them in his favor. All this disinformation also comes from it being &quot;secret knowledge&quot; or &quot;things THEY dont want you to know&quot;. Any form of suppression only gives that mentality a dangerous positive feedback loop.<p>Look, if you think open, honest discussions are a bad thing, then theres nothing here. Every line about logical fallacies, discourse and spreading of knowledge is bunk and a waste of time. A centralized, authoritative group is the only practical alternative. Deciding what is factual without the need for further discussion or testing, because they did all the leg work and we dont need to see the data or counter points. Multiple sources with multiple viewpoints stating their case is a failed concept.<p>I just think it&#x27;s funny that everyone woke up that big tech has too much power. Now their PR companies are trying to spin it to show they should have even more power. And people are going to agree with it because of wanting to hate. Gotta love it.<p>In response to the holocaust denial line. Yea, there are holocaust deniers. Not a single one is told to shut up anymore in the last few decades. Their arguments are heard, then they are shot down through fair discourse. Anyone who witnesses these arguments can easily see who is right and who is wrong. Hasn&#x27;t really been much of an issue since then. Sure there are a few idiots, but they&#x27;re ignored by individual choice, not by systemic suppression.')
