I can&#x27;t recall seeing a single team there that was properly sized and wouldn&#x27;t function better with half the team and an eighth of the process.<p>There&#x27;s a good argument to be made that a big chunk of the value of an engineer to Google is strategic, simply that they \nare locked up and aren&#x27;t working at FB, Amazon, Apple or Microsoft. I was never at a high enough level to have a view into the data that would confirm that, but it certainly felt like even if you weren&#x27;t particularly productive in the environment everyone up the ladder was perfectly happy to let you malinger on the payroll forever, as long as you weren&#x27;t so bad that you did damage to someone&#x27;s pristine art project of a codebase. So maybe inability to fire isn&#x27;t really such an issue - even now, seeing anyone fired at Google, let alone an old timer, is extraordinarily rare.')
