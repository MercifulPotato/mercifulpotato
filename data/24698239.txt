Another is breathing issues.<p>When it gets bad for me, I make extreme noises every so often when I sit down, or when I need to take a big breath of air, etc etc Eating can be exhausting - both because you’re spending energy chewing etc, but also you’re not able to breathe as much...<p>I agree with you, that since it coincided with lockdown, people out of jobs, not being active etc, then it could sometimes be misdiagnosed, but it’s very different and pretty easily spotted.')
