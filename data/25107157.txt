Seriously? You act like two columns is somehow ridiculous, but magazines and newspapers also all use multiple columns. You only see single columns on narrow formats like handheld books (most paperbacks). A tablet is large enough to show an entirely page at once at a reasonable font size and you want two columns for that. If anything the technological restriction issue is that it was hard to make a two column typewriter so typed, instead of typeset, documents often have a humorously large single column. (Even on a phone it just isn&#x27;t difficult enough to read that it deserves such hate.)')
