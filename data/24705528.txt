Even if you&#x27;re hiring assistants for the &quot;best researchers in the world&quot; -- which, let&#x27;s be honest, are all doing the &quot;10 years and retire&quot; game at FAIR&#x2F;Google&#x2F;etc. anyways these days -- there are just unimaginably many qualified candidates.<p>Even killing the H1B program entirely wouldn&#x27;t directly effect the ability of universities to recruit research&#x2F;teaching assistants.<p>Consider if any US trucking line could hire literally anyone in the world.
