For example, picture a surface. At any point on the surface, there is a plane of vectors tangent to that surface. It&#x27;s unnatural to describe the vectors there in terms of a 2x1 matrix, since that requires the choice of a basis of the tangent space. And if you try to choose a basis of the tangent space, you&#x27;d probably want it to vary continuously from one point on the surface to the next, but that&#x27;s not possible to do on many surfaces, such as a sphere, thanks to the Hairy Ball Theorem.
