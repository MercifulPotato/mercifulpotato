When they altered the strength of connections between these inhibitory neurons in their model, the researchers could change how well the model performed on the working memory test as well as the timescale of the pertinent neurons.<p>Neuroscience is so laughably primitive. Imagine saying you were close to understanding computers because you know which capacitors you really can’t cut out. It’s just absurd how little actual knowledge of the mind we have, as opposed to anatomical facts or behavioral generalizations.')
