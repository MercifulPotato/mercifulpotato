Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609901881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25642752, text='When we came back, it was the period where (if you arrived in the evening), you&#x27;d spend the first night in a government hotel, and then 13 nights in any hotel that would take you.  At 2 a.m. in the government hotel, we discovered a problem with our booking the next day.  We called up one hotel&#x27;s front desk at 3 a.m., and the poor guy on duty told us they accepted quarantine guests.  We kept trying to get our original booking problem ironed out for the next 6 hours, but eventually gave up at 9 a.m.<p>Luckily, we gave the second hotel&#x27;s front desk a second call at 9 a.m. to double-check they accepted quarantine guests before making our online booking.  The day shift guy who came in told us that they didn&#x27;t accept quarantine guests.<p>Now, it&#x27;s a bit better organized, with an official government list of all acceptable quarantine hotels.  Though, prices have gone up significantly for those few hotels.  When we arrived, there was a government list, but it was just a subset of all hotels accepting quarantine guests, and of course prices shot up and vacancies vanished for those hotels on the government list.')
