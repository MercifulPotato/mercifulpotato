It&#x27;s also probabilistic, so the higher your probability for recovery has to be, the larger it gets. Assuming you don&#x27;t actually know an strict upper bound on the symmetric difference size before reconciliation, PinSketch of course also becomes probabilistic.<p>On the other hand, IBLT is very fast (and linear in the capacity; PinSketch is quadratic in the capacity).<p>A data structure for set lookups? Sounds like a Bloom filter. If you want it deterministic, just send the set in sorter order say? I don&#x27;t think there is much fancy possible here.')
