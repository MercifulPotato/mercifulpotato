Spent about 25 hours.<p>- I had maybe 5 hard crashes.<p>- Had to walk through doors frequently (I guess they had opened but still showed on screen as closed).<p>- Got into the car while crouched in one sequence which breaks progression so you have to reload your last checkpoint and get into the car standing to progress.<p>- HDR is unusable.<p>- Had to disable all graphical extras (blur, grain) or it looked really messy.<p>- While driving lights didn’t enable quick enough so that I was driving into darkness as lights turned on after I had passed through.<p>Those are the main issues I had. Besides that there were constant minor graphical issues.<p>The story was enjoyable enough that I finished it, largely skipping side quests. Once they have the issues worked out or I have a new console I’ll go back and enjoy the world a bit more.<p>Worth pointing out I mainly play sports games and only casually. I don’t have the kind of expectations a lot of people would have had for this game and just on bugs alone I would say it should not have shipped. It’s an mid level beta release at best.')
