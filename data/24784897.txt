This is exactly what we were hoping HackerStash could do :)<p>At face value &#x27;points&#x27; can lead to distorted incentives, but we&#x27;re working hard to ensure that altruistic behaviour is most rewarded. Second to altruism is evidencing clear progress in your own project, with some big features coming in the next few weeks to support that. In fact I&#x27;d say the later is our current weakness but not for lack of attention, just we&#x27;ve decided we&#x27;ll learn and iterate faster with more eyeballs on the product, users in the contest etc.<p>Thanks so much for the feedback, also glad to hear you like the UI!')
