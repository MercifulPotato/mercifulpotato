Often it says &quot;the camera is blinded&quot; (e.g. when the sun is shining at it), often there&#x27;s rain on the lens... So I&#x27;d argue Tesla&#x27;s cameras are much worse for driving under all conditions vs. the human eye.   I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s enough redundancy for depth perception either.  I tend to agree with the argument that humans prove it&#x27;s possible to drive with just visual sensors but Tesla&#x27;s sensors, for better or worse, are not equivalent.<p>Then there&#x27;s the part about the brain being what gets the sensor data and interprets it.  I doubt Tesla&#x27;s computer has  all the capabilities of a human brain.<p>Driving behind a boat trailer, it&#x27;s clear to me it&#x27;s a boat, but Tesla&#x27;s computer is confused.  Bicycles can be a little iffy as well.  In general the way the car perceives the world seems subpar to how a human does, by far.<p>I&#x27;m a fan of the car, I&#x27;m mostly a fan of Tesla&#x2F;Elon, but I don&#x27;t think these cars with this technology are ever gonna be truly autonomous so they can drive with no human intervention... IMHO.')
