Here we have a gigantic company making silly money paying employees silly money (mostly) and able to do so under the freedoms and protection of the US. And yet they go out of their way to pander to their employees about not supporting the very government and system that let them make so many billions. Oh the spoiled rich kid sad irony. So sick of all these self-righteous antics.')
