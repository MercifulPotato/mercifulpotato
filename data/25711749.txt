Title: This measure shall be known and may be cited as the &quot;California Marriage Protection Act.&quot;<p>&gt; SECTION 2.

I tend to not be confident asserting when someone is or isn&#x27;t a dick and add the word &quot;probably&quot; unnecessarily.<p>Edit 2: I&#x27;m sorry for my earlier comments. To clarify, I also think it&#x27;s overreacting when people oppose interracial marriage. I&#x27;m all for people supporting discrimination. People should be allowed to be shitty shitbags and anyone who thinks it&#x27;s bad is overreacting.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2008_California_Proposition_8#Full_text" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2008_California_Proposition_8#...</a>')
