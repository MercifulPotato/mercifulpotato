It was fun to joke around and talk quant stuff in some of the comment threads before it devolved into pure memes.<p>Recently, I commented on a few of the front-page threads to correct some misinformation. They banned my account within minutes. They don&#x27;t want to see any comments that don&#x27;t support the pump.<p>At this point, they&#x27;re heavily moderating the sub to only allow posts and comments that glorify $GME. The only allowable content is that which insinuates anyone who buys $GME is about to get extremely wealthy, or that everyone buying $GME is sticking it to Wall Street.<p>The situation has gone from funny to scary as Redditors are pouring money into $GME with expectations of getting rich and taking down Wall Street at the same time. Subreddit moderators have no interest in letting any comments through that might spoil the party before the early $GME buyers can exit their positions.')
