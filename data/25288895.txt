You are projecting criticism of the commenters onto google; it hasn&#x27;t been stablished that google fired her because she was difficult or made them look bad. There is indeed a scenario where that is the case, but there are others where Google is right to fire her without undermining their ethical position; to say otherwise is to say that she is infallible, an attribute usually reserved to religious groups. If she wants some non faith based support, she should be transparent about the terms of the email where she put forward conditions to the company.')
