Item(by='cranekam', descendants=None, kids=[25232753], score=None, time=1606495539, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229949, text='I agree with the overall sentiment — who is this for? — but:<p>&gt; carbon fibre frames are prohibitively expensive and the market for them serves very involved, often professional or semi-pro cyclists whose performance bottlenecks are imposed by the bike instead of themselves.<p>just isn&#x27;t true. Many hobbyist&#x2F;amateur&#x2F;weekend warrior-type cyclist ride carbon bikes. They can be had at lowish prices (my first was £1000) to multiples of the price of this Lemond ebike. Almost all owners of such bikes are limited by their own ability, not the bike.<p>It&#x27;s probably fair to assume a lightweight, high quality ebike would be pricey. Perhaps being carbon adds a bit more to the price but the material choice alone isn&#x27;t totally ridiculous.<p>&gt; High-performance rims and tyres but only one chain ring.<p>Single-ring setups with a wide-range rear cassette are actually a pretty good choice for a commuter bike. Less maintenance, less weight. A double chainring setup likely offers smaller gaps between gears but likely a comparable overall range from lowest to highest. On a commuter bike simplicity wins.<p>I guess ultimately this bike is some combination of publicity stunt and Veblen good. I can&#x27;t imagine Lemond anticipates selling many of them.')
