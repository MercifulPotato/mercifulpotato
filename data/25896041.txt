I&#x27;d agree that, in general, they&#x27;re legally safe and clear, but when you&#x27;re talking to the legal department of a company, it is not about whether they&#x27;re clearly defined. The actual worry is whether a patent troll or a more litigious competitor can sue the s out of your company and extract millions upon millions of either legal costs or settlements. Yes, you _might_ win, but it will still cost you and courts are known to not always be deterministic in their decisions. So once your out of the &quot;thrown out without a second thought&quot;-cleanliness, corporate legal will not be happy.')
