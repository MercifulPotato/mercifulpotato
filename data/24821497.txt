In short rust has memory management, and so can better function as a library language, similar to how Java did back in the 90&#x27;s. Rich&#x27;s quote below.<p>&gt;&gt; And it is a big problem. I think the lack of garbage collection really impeded C++ in one of its design objectives, which is: it was supposed to be a library language. All the original design stuff and any time you heard Stroustrup talk about it, it is like, &quot;C++ is going to be a library language&quot;. But it only ever ended up being a parochial library language. Every shop had a library, but there were not a library, and still are not a lot of libraries, that go between places, because of this problem.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matthiasn&#x2F;talk-transcripts&#x2F;blob&#x2F;ccc4a017294f6b6abdf62f47aa41298f93250af6&#x2F;Hickey_Rich&#x2F;AreWeThereYet-mostly-text.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matthiasn&#x2F;talk-transcripts&#x2F;blob&#x2F;ccc4a0172...</a>')
