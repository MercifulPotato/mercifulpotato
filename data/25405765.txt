There are lots of reasons this doesn’t hold.<p>&gt;&gt; saying they&#x27;re less likely to commit crimes is a speculative inference<p>It is also undisputed though. We’ve always known illegal immigrants avoid making the kind of trouble that risks run ins with the law (i.e. there are far fewer “safe” crimes for them to commit) because the penalties are deportation.')
