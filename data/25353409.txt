I also made this observation.  So many time I&#x27;ll be talking to another dev about macOS v. linux for example, and they&#x27;ll say something like, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to have to compile my kernel&quot; or they&#x27;ll describe something that makes it clear they haven&#x27;t tried any Linux distro in a <i>long</i> time.  I&#x27;ll usually ask, &quot;when was the last time you tried it?&quot; and at that point they&#x27;ll usually realize what they&#x27;re doing and say something like, &quot;It&#x27;s been probably 15 years, maybe things are better now?&quot;<p>Yes, things are better.
