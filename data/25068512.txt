Basically, repaving the highway, while there’s cars driving on it. Apple has done this a few times before (but we don’t talk about Copland in polite company), so I <i>know</i> it will end well.<p>I think their new architecture will be awesome. Personally, I look forward to being able to debug iOS Bluetooth apps in the simulator, and I think some of the new form factors will be pretty cool.<p>But I can’t help but notice the current dearth of AAA apps that are already universal.<p>A transition like this is a <i>big</i> deal; especially if you have an app with thousands of function points, as it requires a complete, top-to-bottom re-test of every one.<p>In the unlikely case that you won’t find issues, it will still take a long time. Also, most companies won’t bet the farm on prerelease hardware; instead, using it to solve issues. They will still need to test against the release hardware before signing off for general distribution.<p>Also, I have a couple of eGPUs that I use. I don’t think the new architecture plays well with them.<p>I’m hoping that the next gen will obviate the need for them. They are a pain.')
