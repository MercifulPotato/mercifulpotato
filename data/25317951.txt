You are getting a lot of advice from autodidacts here that is well-intentioned but, in my view, unproductive.<p>First, as a general heuristic, if there&#x27;s some topic (in philosophy or otherwise) you want to learn, find syllabuses of courses in that subject at good universities and figure out what books they use.<p>If you do this for philosophy courses, you will find either anthologies of (contemporary) articles, or modern textbooks like Jaegwon Kim&#x27;s <i>Philosophy of Mind</i>. At a high level, these more or less follow the same format (after perhaps some historical prologue). A reasonable view is presented, then in the next chapter (or essay) an important objection is discussed. This goes on for a while until you understand the strengths and weaknesses of various positions. At the end, you may favor one or another, but rarely is there is a clear winner.<p>Note that philosophy is distinct from the history of philosophy. If you care about what is true, and not the historical development of ideas, there&#x27;s not much point in reading things written before, say, 1900, or even 1950. So no Hume or Hegel or whatever. In general these texts are poorly written and  unclear compared to modern ones. And of course, they can&#x27;t treat the developments that have taken place in the intervening years. Consider an analogy: you would not read Newton&#x27;s original manuscripts to learn calculus.<p>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is a good reference work, but it presents mainly literature overviews, not pedagogical essays. Again, you wouldn&#x27;t read an encyclopedia to learn math; it is similarly unwise here.<p>You write about developing models that address &quot;the bigger questions of life,&quot; and &quot;a personal philosophy.&quot; This is not something that contemporary academic philosophy talks much about, at least in the broad sense. But, in this direction, you might enjoy &quot;Six Myths About the Good Life: Thinking About What Has Value&quot; by Joel Kupperman. There&#x27;s a good review of the book here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ndpr.nd.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;six-myths-about-the-good-life-thinking-about-what-has-value&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ndpr.nd.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;six-myths-about-the-good-life-think...</a>.')
