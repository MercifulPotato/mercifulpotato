The point is if these crimes were handled lightly, they would occur more often.<p>We can go all the way down to the animal kingdom. Lions don&#x27;t usually attack hippos because they know there can be harsh punishment in failure. Otherwise said attacks would be frequent. Just as I don&#x27;t drink and drive recklessly because I know there can be severe consequences.<p>Frankly I believe the only way to reduce prison population is through education and opportunity BEFORE crimes happen but keep current punitive laws because they serve to protect the law abiding hard working citizen and to disincentivize crimes.')
