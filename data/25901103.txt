There&#x27;s not conclusive evidence it can&#x27;t, but the FDA says: &quot;The observed frequency of reported Bellâ€™s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;covid-vaccine-bells-palsy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;covid-vaccine-bells-palsy&#x2F;</a><p>(Please do correct me if I&#x27;m out of date and there&#x27;s anything showing statistical significance, but I don&#x27;t see anything new from a quick Google.)<p>When you vaccinate a lot of people, some of them will develop medical problems that would have developed regardless of the vaccine.
