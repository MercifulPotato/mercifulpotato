Item(by='D13Fd', descendants=None, kids=[25875911], score=None, time=1611335932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25871149, text='It seems that some people&#x27;s problem with ยง 230 is that it permits a publisher to filter content without also risking liability for the content.<p>&quot;Get rid of ยง 230&quot; is a backwards way to solve the problem that they have. They don&#x27;t actually want publishers to be liable for the content on their sites (which would, if anything, lead to greatly increased censorship and filtering). They want to STOP companies from censoring what the companies deem misinformation or otherwise offensive content.<p>In other words, they want the law to be &quot;if you control a channel for speech, you are not permitted to censor or filter out what you view as misinformation, incitements to violence, or otherwise offensive content.&quot;<p>Again, this has no support in the free speech rights of the first amendment. In fact, it could be viewed as contrary to free speech, since the government would be forcing people and corporations to carry content on their websites that those people or corporations do not agree with and&#x2F;or find offensive.')
