I figured it&#x27;d me smart to have a pair of archive disks that spend most of their life powered down and unwritable, to give me some chance of recovering from a cryptolocker type malware attack. So I have two big drives plugged into a pair wifi controllable power points, and some cron jobs that wake each them up late Sunday night (well, very early Monday morning) on alternate weeks, then rsyncs my Time Machine backups (stored on an always-on RAID1 pair) to the archive drive-of-the-week.<p>Of course the early POC cron jobs didn&#x27;t do a sufficiently good job of checking error&#x2F;return codes and rsync task completion, so occasionally my setup would indeed &quot;involve pulling the physical power plug&quot; on my hard drives... (I wasn&#x27;t _too_ careful, since this would always happen on the alternating second backup of my Time Machine backup. While I got some file corruption in my archive drives, it couldn&#x27;t have caused data loss unless both the original data _and_ the Time Machine backup also corrupted at the same time.)')
