In Ye Olde Times, Apple would go on their own and ask themselves &quot;how can we make an improvement in the lives of our customers?&quot;... the answer were iconic, <i>revolutionary</i> products (iPod, iPhone, earpods) that outright created entire device classes.<p>Now? The only thing in focus is rent extraction - App Store cuts -, recurring revenue and vertical integration. Anything not contributing to that gets atrophied (documentation, as mentioned, or Apple Server) or put on life support (essentially the whole rest of the ecosystem, including for all too many years pro-level hardware). Innovation? Why should Apple take the risk and improve their core product with features that won&#x27;t get used? They&#x27;re letting third party devs pick up the slack and buy up or clone the most successful things.<p>They&#x27;re still better than Microsoft as they discovered that people are willing to pay a <i>hefty</i> premium for devices that have security and privacy first class members at the priority scheduling for new features (especially compared to the utter shitshow that Google has allowed Android to become by not cracking down on vendors), but innovation that doesn&#x27;t give them a direct cash profit simply does not happen any more.')
