Then you could make it wireless and battery free simply by using the computers mic and perhaps a simplified version of these methods, as the challenge would be reduced by the more distinct key sounds. It wouldn&#x27;t really need much of the key signal electronics either. More a thought experiment than a practical device I suspect!<p>Presumably the trick would be finding a non-annoying way for the sounds to differ (perhaps if it was beyond human hearing). Of course it would be totally insecure, so not safe for Twitch videos without redacting the audio (but a tool could know what to remove that detail too)')
