It seems to be the closest to Nolly, and from a cursory look it seems people generally like it better. I suppose I&#x27;ll have to get the trials for both to compare<p>I had never heard of GGD&#x27;s IR loader, seems awesome! Definitely on the list of things to buy now<p>Feel free to drop a link to the album you made with the nolly plugin, I&#x27;d love to take a listen')
