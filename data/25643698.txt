And product marketing and placement has absolutely no affect on how one think something taste is good or bad. It does however remind anyone next time the walk into store they should buy coke, which does affect sales number. But not taste difference.<p>My 7 years old nephew hasn&#x27;t watched a single Coca Cola coke in his life time, but he prefer coke over Pepsi. While my friends daughter ( and her mum ) prefer Pepsi.')
