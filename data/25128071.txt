They&#x27;re dumb as a rock when it comes to anything outside of their field, because their field has vacuumed up all of their mental energy over the decades.<p>By comparison, I&#x27;m pretty mediocre at what I do because I read widely, follow the news, and have elaborate political discussions for fun. By their standard, I&#x27;m dumb as a rock because I&#x27;m up late reading about the Soviets in Afghanistan, instead of yet another journal article.<p>Time is finite, and it&#x27;s all a big compromise.')
