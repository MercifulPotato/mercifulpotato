It seems hysterical in itself to not just assume we&#x27;re in a politically polarized climate and certain topics of discourse easily earn you close friends and&#x2F;or committed enemies - something that can make any group dynamic fall apart.<p>&gt;Also it&#x27;s not necessarily harassment to call out people if they are not doing their jobs. It&#x27;s just very (almost pathetically) petty.<p>Entirely agree! I do think social media has had a tendency to allow people to indulge in their worst sides without much consequence in the case of doxxing and, well, harassment by mass-reaching out to personal lines of contact. That&#x27;s really distinct in my eyes from filing a complaint to their public employer for the public perception of their public statements.')
