I do high power rocketry for a hobby so i haven&#x27;t been able to attend launches but that&#x27;s about it. I don&#x27;t get to eat out but my wife and I both have been wanting to stop eating out for a while. I&#x27;ve always been wfh so no change there either. Kids are home more doing school through zoom but that&#x27;s not a big deal either. :shrug:')
