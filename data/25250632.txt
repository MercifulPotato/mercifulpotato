It’s like McKinsey but nerdier (and maybe with more scruples).<p>Most of the time, we’re explicitly hired to keep things quiet. We rarely advertise clients, much less engagement outcomes.<p>But be sure most revenues come from long lasting relationships. In some cases, decades old relationships. And unlike what some commenter said, revenues are growing double digits % YoY, despite BCG being over 50yo (McKinsey is almost 100yo)<p>So I guess MC delivers at least for those singing the check.')
