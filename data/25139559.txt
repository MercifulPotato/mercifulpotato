I&#x27;ve bought three new cars financed, and every time the finance person puts my info in and gets finance &quot;offers&quot; from 4-5 big banks plus their in-house financing, and just lets me pick the one with the best rate -- usually most of the finance offers are under 5%, with the best one being under 1%. One time I went to one of the offering banks directly and got a worse rate than they offered me through the dealer! Maybe they&#x27;re making commission on the sale but it can&#x27;t be much.')
