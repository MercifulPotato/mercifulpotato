I already can designate family member or my fiancee as a beneficiary in most accounts that handle all my money, but there is much more to that I&#x27;d like them to be able to access if I suddenly died or became incapable of accessing it, or giving them access.<p>My dad is in his mid to late 60s and often will remind me what his passwords are based around for most of his online accounts in the event he can&#x27;t get into them and my mom needs to. I think he tells her and my sister this too, but it&#x27;d be better to have successor roles for Email and other important accounts that don&#x27;t have benefactors setup. More legal too, as technically if he passed and I accessed certain accounts it could cause legal issues if I ever did something like transfer funds or use his email to claim I was him for verification to another site.')
