This is true whether you you&#x27;re in-office or remote. So no, you can&#x27;t be a full time employee of both companies.<p>&gt; And if the employer can&#x27;t tell if that&#x27;s the case, surely that&#x27;s a problem in any case? What&#x27;s the difference if the extra time is spent on another job or watching Netflix?<p>That&#x27;s a problem of your time not being utilised well. The sudden move to remote this year means that this has happened at <i>a lot</i> of companies and they haven&#x27;t been able to respond well quickly enough. But to think that you can keep that Netflix time slot indefinitely, or that you can fill it with a second FAANG job is absurd.<p>Don&#x27;t assume that your employer is dumb. If you can spend only half of your time on the job and brag about it online, what&#x27;s stopping your company from laying off half of your team?<p>I also imagine that these kinds of discussions are infuriating to the people who were already remote pre-COVID and were working the hours they are supposed to. They had a great thing going on but if suddenly everyone else moves to remote and a bunch of people are slacking off, remote work suddenly look less viable from an employer&#x27;s point of view, not more.<p>&gt; WFH revolution<p>It&#x27;s not a revolution. It&#x27;s an involuntary experiment, and we don&#x27;t know what the results will be and which companies and employees it will work well for.')
