In summary: the issue is that if everything else about Newtonâ€™s model was right <i>except</i> that gravity was delayed, orbits would be wrong. But, actually, it turns out, as Einstein theorized and later evidence supported, everything (well, enough) else about Newton&#x27;s model turns out to be wrong, too.')
