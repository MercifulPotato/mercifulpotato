The context switch costs should be abundantly clear. Especially if you add in some travel time.<p>Multitasking relies on tricks and effort to actually work. Not even computers get to multitask (until you add more cores). Context switching is still required. Even going from user to kernel space involves some cost.<p>Listening to music, chewing gum and walking is only multitasking because these are using complementary or different &quot;cores&quot;. Real multitasking requires independent pathways. Try reading three books at the same time. Or drinking coca-cola and some fine wine. This is my usual challenge for multitaskers. The books and the drinks wont fully be appreciated if you attempt them via simultaneous multitasking. The context switch isnâ€™t trivial and if not properly done always has negative outcomes.<p>Especially the coke and wine combination. Nasty.')
