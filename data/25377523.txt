I admit that I&#x27;m a bit dismayed that so many of the top comments on this thread (on a website that&#x27;s all about sharing ideas re: technology startups, no less) are basically just a gripe session.<p>Virtually everything I&#x27;ve heard from people who have actual, personal interactions with the AirBnB founders is positive, and especially that their interactions were inspiring - that is, the AirBnB founders inspired people around them to do better work. I just think that&#x27;s an amazing quality and something I&#x27;m so grateful for when I find it.<p>Sure, I may have my own gripes about AirBnB, but I can certainly appreciate the unique combination of talent in the founders that made their success possible.')
