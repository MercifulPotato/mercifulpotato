Item(by='jakehop', descendants=None, kids=[24723327], score=None, time=1602186841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24722878, text='&quot;This incredible range will be achieved through efficency improvements rather than just a bigger battery pack.&quot;<p>What an interesting statement! &quot;Bigger&quot; – compared to what? A Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD? That can do around 296 miles (EPA&#x2F;Highway) – so the Mercedes-Benz will need to be 2,5x as efficient.<p>The drag coefficient is one area that could be improved. C(d) for the Model 3 is 0.23, which is pretty good for a production car. Lower than that and you are in experimental territory – which is probably how this project might end up for Mercedes-Benz.<p>Not bad, because these types of projects usually teach us something new. But not good, since this will be another &quot;promise&quot; broken, due to this inflationary PR-approach.')
