Item(by='lemax', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605651943, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25130141, text='Open Street Map is a nice analogy for what could work. Aside from the open source maintenance of the map, there&#x27;s also tons of corporate help in the background. Companies that are delivering OSM as a service or relying on it for their own services have an interest in making it better. MapBox, for example, apparently pays tons of people a salary who are contributing upstream to Open Street Map. If we can get an Apple&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;Other players collab maybe a venerable alternative can actually be built.')
