It will still have plenty of loopholes for companies to take advantage of in one way or another and will still allow abuses.  Furthermore, the current economic situation of many white collar workers working from home for a year or more is likely making many employers rethink their stance on pay levels for local workers and opportunities to off&#x2F;near-shore work that&#x27;s being done remotely anyway.  In short, I think this overhaul might help improve job security and pay for some workers in some industries, but overall it&#x27;s not a great solution if those are your goals.')
