I didn&#x27;t have an Amiga, but rather an ST.  The ST also had proportional scroll bars and for years, I could not understand why the major platforms (Windows, MacOS) did not.  It was a pet peeve that really bothered me when I would sit down to use someone&#x27;s Mac or PC of the time.<p>I should have realized it could be worse.  With the modern era&#x27;s &quot;mobile first&quot; UX regime, we now have many desktop experiences that hide the scrollbars entirely—revealing them only on interaction—wholly removing any at-a-glance utility we enjoyed from proportional bars.')
