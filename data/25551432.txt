Item(by='croissants', descendants=None, kids=[25551661], score=None, time=1609081033, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25550313, text='&gt; She married the poet Ted Hughes and moved around frequently during their short marriage.<p>My understanding is that Ted Hughes&#x27; contribution to Plath&#x27;s mental health went beyond &quot;mov[ing] around frequently during their short marriage&quot; [1].<p>&gt; In 2017, previously unpublished letters written by Plath between 18 February 1960 and 4 February 1963 accuse Hughes of physically abusing her months before she miscarried their second child in 1961.<p>Hughes also began an affair with another woman, Assia Wevill, in 1962 and (apparently) had a kid with her in 1965. Plath knew about the former and committed suicide in 1963. <i>Wevill</i> also killed herself as well as her child with Hughes in 1969 after, you guessed it, &quot;Hughes began affairs with Brenda Hedden, a married acquaintance who frequented their home, and Carol Orchard, a nurse 20 years his junior, whom he would later marry in 1970&quot; [2].<p>It might be too reductive to say Hughes just drove two women to suicide, but it seems like we can be confident that he had, uh, extensive personal failings?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ted_Hughes#Death_of_Sylvia_Plath" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ted_Hughes#Death_of_Sylvia_Pla...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Assia_Wevill#Ted_Hughes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Assia_Wevill#Ted_Hughes</a>')
