Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603184823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24832121, text='&gt; You&#x27;re describing the fragmentation problem<p>That&#x27;s a real problem, but actually I wasn&#x27;t describing it.<p>What I&#x27;m describing is how I found Slack difficult to work usefully with to a significant degree, compared with other platforms I&#x27;ve used.<p>Therefore, when evaluating its effect on community growth, it&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;use Slack nowadays to grow an open source community&quot;, because it acts as a significant repulsive barrier towards some of us (who are relevant to that community), even if it&#x27;s attractive towards others.<p>It&#x27;s not so much fragmentation as functionality; and those might be solved if there was better federation between systems to allow a broader range of tools.<p>The reason this is not just fragmentation is illustrated by my result with the Rust &amp; Go communities: After trying out the Slack channels, and finding myself only dropping in once a month or so for a peek due to the tool being clunky, I lost the motivation to go looking for other fragmented sub-communities until I&#x27;d eventually find a &quot;good&quot; one.  As a result I haven&#x27;t gotten involved in any, despite the initial interest.  I&#x27;m too busy with other things, and other communities.  So I&#x27;ll just passively consume the product now for a while, until reasons to put in the effort come up again.  And I&#x27;m someone who is actively interested in the projects as a PLI person.  Just an anecdote, but I think this repulsion effect is not great for open source community building.')
