Samsonite, American something... (traveler??), and.... a bunch of bit players that don’t have their own stores, commercialized branding with billboards and full-page ads, etc.<p>The word monopoly means one. Mono = One.<p>All this crying and hubris about Apple being a monopoly. It’s Apple, Android&#x2F;Google, Microsoft, and some heavy hitting wanna-be companys.<p>Want your Windows Phone back? Go get it. Caterpillar makes amazing Android phones. Blackberry is pumping out some nice keyboard based phones. There are privacy-based phones with manual off switches. There are Linux phones. There are many bit players. I have the new Nokia 3310 too. Lots of but players and a few big ones.<p>Why everyone keeps meaning about “monopoly” is disturbing. Half the time, it mostly sounds like a cesspool of burnt out developers just jealous they didn’t come up with some of this modern stuff first.<p>There is no monopoly. Not even close. Even when the Windows Phone was a major player, not enough people wanted it to warrant Microsoft to continue selling it. What do you want? Government forced third options and funded by taxpayers? Did Microsoft have the right to discontinue it — or not? It’s not Apple and Google’s fault that consumers mostly chose to avoid the Windows Phone. I personally think it was a smart decision by Microsoft to get out of that market back then (and they should have done it sooner) and focus more on Azure, Office 365, and Windows O&#x2F;S - along with GitHub and VSC, etc., all of which they’ve been firing on all 8 cylinders lately.')
