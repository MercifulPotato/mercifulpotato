They were all canceled of course.<p>Out of all of them, EasyJet was the only company that let me have an instant refund on their website. Most of the others made me call them (I was on the Alitalia line for 90 minutes, after hours of being flatout rejected from the call queue), some I had to issue a chargeback, and some refunded me in November. One I’m still waiting.<p>I also booked the Bernina Express and the only refund option is to show up at one of their stations in Switzerland I guess.<p>This is to say that most travel companies operate in a similar non-automated fashion because that’s what makes them the most money. EasyJet is far from the exception.')
