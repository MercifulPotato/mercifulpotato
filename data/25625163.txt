The endgame will be perfect monopoly - one global player in every niche of our daily existence. Slowly force-feeding us a diet of whatever is most profitable (whatever service encompasses the most dysfunction in exchange for money).<p>Off the top of my head, a better system might be one that seeks to eliminate dysfunction instead of profiting from it. Web browsers could provide short links to all websites by using a hashing function instead of an encrypted refcount. They could remove as many identifying bits as possible (like cookies). I like the direction that Apple and others are going, preserving less user data and letting less spill between unrelated websites.<p>The question of what all these advertisers will do once they&#x27;re not allowed to track us is a big one. But my guess is that targeted advertising is not needed in the first place. They did just fine (arguably better) with demographics in the centuries before tech revealed our personal browsing histories.')
