This statement is so hyperbolic.<p>- Pho in general in the US is pretty close to Pho in Ho Chi Minh. i.e. Turtle Tower doing Chicken Pho is pretty good and close.<p>- Dim sum is dim sum. The places in Chinatown serve a Ha Gau or Siu Mai and largely the same in Hong Kong... how is it not authentic?<p>- Japanese... Nigiri, sashimi is.... authentic? To say there&#x27;s zero authentic Japanese seems too. Seriously, sashimi how is it not authentic? It&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; a piece of cut fish.<p>If you&#x27;re speaking about <i>quality</i> then 100% I agree. The quality&#x2F;etc... is not nearly as amazing as the origin locations, but the flavors aren&#x27;t drastically different.<p>Come to Singapore where all foods have sugar added which considerably changes the flavor profile.<p>To claim zero authentic in SF...<p>[EDIT]\nTo qualify my side - authenticity should be a very low bar, which should be ingredients, quantity and process should match to generally create a similar flavor profile.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t matter who, where, what the place looks like.')
