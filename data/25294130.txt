The theory is that the fundamentals of the security are reflected in it&#x27;s price movements, so reading its price action is roughly analogous to reading news relevant to the instrument. Also it&#x27;s not really about looking at the &quot;shapes of candles.&quot; That&#x27;s a frankly primitive approach to technical analysis, and one of the biggest reasons that people keep drawing comparisons to astrology, numerology, divination, etc..')
