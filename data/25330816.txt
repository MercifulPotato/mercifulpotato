Before the transaction, you have 1000 USD and 0 Eth. In the old block chain, the transaction goes through, your wallet has 1 Eth, and theirs has 0. In the forked block chain, their wallet has 1 Eth, your has 0. However, regardless of which block chain you choose to believe in, they have the 1000 dollars.<p>So if the forked chain becomes accepted, then they have 1000 USD and 1 Eth, while you have 0 dollars and 0 Eth, and you&#x27;re never going to make the mistake of trusting a cryptocurrency ever again.')
