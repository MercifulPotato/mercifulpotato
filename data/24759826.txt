The Internet isn&#x27;t vulnerable to it as a whole, just specific endpoints.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is fixable for single endpoints: if you want to tell everyone something different, but there are millions coming per second, you&#x27;re not going to succeed, be it in real life or a webserver.<p>So the answer seems to be: avoid centralizing too much, and pick existing, DDOS-resistant protocols whenever you can.')
