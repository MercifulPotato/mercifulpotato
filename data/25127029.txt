We have twin 2 year olds and a 5 year old.  There&#x27;s been periods of time where there&#x27;s crying (by at least one of them) for most of the day.  When you&#x27;re 1 on 3 at these sorts of ages it&#x27;s inevitable.  When 1 starts crying in the car and the other 2 start crying because the crying is too loud, there&#x27;s not much you can do but laugh about it.<p>Take solace in the fact that kids cry over ridiculous stuff.  For 20 minutes.  Because, for example, you peeled their orange for them.')
