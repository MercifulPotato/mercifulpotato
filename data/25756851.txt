There are minimum competency standards that are enforced by law, it is unlawful in almost all circumstances for a non-certified person to perform any maintenance or repair on a certified aircraft, and, crucially, an aircraft cannot return to service unless a certified mechanic signs off on the repair.  Not the CEO of the company that owns the airplane, not some middle manager, only the expert (mechanic and, sometimes, inspector) can sign off on returning the plane to service.<p>Without that kind of legal cover, management can and will steamroll over anybody who is impeding their initiative of the day.')
