Intel certainly has resources, but they&#x27;d also be competing against Apple, nVidia, and some other heavy hitters. Additionally, I doubt the TSMC would have much incentive to de-prioritize the needs of a valued customer (AMD) against a competitor in the semiconductor space who will likely switch back to their own fabs as soon as they&#x27;re competitive (if they ever are).')
