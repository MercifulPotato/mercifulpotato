In the original comment there is a link to a demo created by Kyrix: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wildfire.kyrixdemo.live&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wildfire.kyrixdemo.live&#x2F;</a>   Are you looking for a different type of demo?<p>2. Honest answer: we are very understaffed academics who also need to write papers and theses. We want to convert to TS, that is just one item on the wish list.<p>3. We want everyone to be able to spin up a Kyrix app <i>on their laptop</i> using 3 CLI commands (you can try, instructions are in the README). With a backend and a database comes the cost of complex installation. Docker helps make everyone&#x27;s dev environment consistent so it&#x27;s easier to troubleshoot.')
