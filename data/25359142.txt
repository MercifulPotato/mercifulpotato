As in, trying to save some crucial time in a rush, by focusing on testing just the things that were specifically worked on, instead of running it through the entire test suite (or QA dept) before deploying. If something comes up, user feedback will certainly bubble through quickly enough and can be worked on. Which, to be perfectly frank, often does work out just fine.')
