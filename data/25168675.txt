Why is 25.68 precise enough and not 25.682393. Especially, since it is given in the abstract, and not in some kind of in detail supplement.<p>&gt;  If I am later trying to make a model to get the best estimate of &lt;stat&gt; by looking at a bunch of other people&#x27;s measurements I will get a more accurate answer if more digits are contained.<p>But that is exactly what I doubt: that level of accuracy is not there. You predict a number that has been observed for a sample size of 35. If you now add sample #36, you will almost certainly get a different number. The (round-about, I did not calculate it in any way) two floating point digits are not accurate, they are chance. And a model predicting 25.72 would be no better than one predicting 25.94.')
