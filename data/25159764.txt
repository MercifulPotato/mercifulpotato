Oh, and that&#x27;s !==&quot;<p>(edit) I&#x27;ll additionally qualify my comment, from a mathematics background I can casually scan a handwritten &quot;!=&quot; which is the same as the ligature, but I just cannot retrain my adult brain to accept the ligature version which is the same as the handwritten one.  Brain plasticity I suppose.')
