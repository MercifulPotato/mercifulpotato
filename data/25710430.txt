I found that a lot of neck pain stemmed from improper neck angles while viewing my dual monitor workstation. And I would be so numb to sensation that I would stay in the incorrect pose for hours, leading to pain when I got up from work.<p>After some months of yoga, I am much more clearly able to recognise within minutes as soon as my neck is in any improper angle and fix it \n rather than letting it pain me after hours')
