It&#x27;s a guttural response to unfair treatment.<p>I think that what should be sought is another &quot;Section 231&quot; that makes banning users from platforms must go through the justice system, just like if you wanted to ban someone from the town square.<p>This gives platforms a scapegoat, &quot;the government won&#x27;t let me&quot;, but still allows the platform to do things like not list &quot;bad&quot; people in the &quot;discover&quot; feed and make better mute&#x2F;ignore features<p>Unilateral and permanent banning just creates more problems')
