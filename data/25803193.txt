If the modem is not doing this (can the OP log into it in someway to see logs?), then it is acting as a &#x27;non-ideal&#x27; DHCP client.<p>Until this is sorted out, try rebooting the modem an an &#x27;odd&#x27; hour that will not disrupt you during the day. This is no guarantee though: the DHCP server may remember the old&#x2F;current DHCP lease and simply re-issue it with the same expiration time.<p>I&#x27;m on DSL&#x2F;PPPoE, so this may not apply, but: my Asus router has a setting that allows it to automatically reboot. I do this at ~04h00 to get a new IP every day so help with privacy concerns. I generally surf with cookies disabled, so these two things help with the low-hanging fruit of simple tracking techniques. (My DSL modem is bridged.)')
