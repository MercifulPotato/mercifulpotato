The change of ownership meant that those trademarks had to be renegotiated, and it ended up with BMW getting the rights to those. Ultimately, the old Rolls-Royce Motors is what is now VW&#x27;s Bentley division (Bentley having been the &quot;entry level&quot; marquee!), whereas BMW&#x27;s modern Rolls-Royce company has no such heritage.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rolls-Royce_Motor_Cars#History" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rolls-Royce_Motor_Cars#History</a> has a bunch of history of the current VW&#x2F;BMW split.')
