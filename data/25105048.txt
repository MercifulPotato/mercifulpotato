Or maybe the censorship is perfectly fine as long itâ€™s our team mindset.<p>Or maybe, just maybe, you do not have the monopoly opinion on what &quot;free speech&quot; is and is not. In all of the examples given, excepting the Thai Hotel case, free speech is still assured. You can still offer your opinions freely, but no publisher is <i>required</i> to publish them. And, having published them, no other punter is <i>required</i> to accept them, and specifically accept them without quarrel.<p>Perhaps what you are seeing is actually free speech in all its glory! The &#x27;anti-free speech people&#x27; have a right to speak their opinions just as you do. The fact they exist is proof that free speech exists, as it certainly seems that you would rather they did not voice their opinions.<p>Remember, freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences!')
