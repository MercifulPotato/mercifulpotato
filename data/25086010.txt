Socialized gains (this kind of vaccine doesn&#x27;t <i>primarily</i> protect the healthy individual receiving it) and private losses at their finest.<p>This argument is literally &quot;it&#x27;s okay to kill people as long as it&#x27;s for the common good&quot;. Fuck subhuman collectivist scum who believe this. I&#x27;d have marginally more respect for a society which openly admitted this belief and acted upon it directly by strictly quarantining the infected and vulnerable; at least then they&#x27;d be evil but helping as opposed to evil and not helping.')
