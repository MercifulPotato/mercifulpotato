And if you are interested in traffic generation like that your entries probably have at least one image placed somewhere and the necessary HTML tags to use them set up.<p>When the article has no image it seems more useful, with the image insertion feature you have there :)<p>I took a moment to understand that the form changes the background of the generated image, because the first entry of mine I tried already had an image, so I did not get what `background` was referencing.<p>To just offer to download the image then might be not enough. Many authors won&#x27;t know how to embed them as an image used by social networks. Not sure how to solve that without going the plugin route, a smaller step could be presenting the needed html, or showing a guide how to use the generated image with some popular blog engines?')
