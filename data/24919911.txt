Advising people to not seek mental health care because of social acceptance is a valid concern since the consequences are real and critical. In 1952 Alan Turing admitted to performing homosexual acts and was subsequently charged with gross indecency - he was punished for sharing his secret. What do you think would happen if someone pursued mental health care to resolve a deviance in 2020?<p>&quot;Hello Bob, I&#x27;m quite happy you&#x27;ve come to seek help with your problem... but first constable Alice would like to have a word with you. Oh, and I&#x27;m afraid you won&#x27;t be allowed to leave the country or own a firearm; plus I&#x27;ve already spoken to your employer and he &quot;suggests&quot; you take a permanent leave of absence to resolve these issues. No worries Bob, just doing my job! Hm? Your girlfriend and friends dumped you after finding out? That&#x27;s a shame, Bob.&quot;<p>If you want to act like there are no downsides to these solutions then I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re being particularly naive. By all means fight for the right to have these people not discriminated against but don&#x27;t mislead people by suggesting that you&#x27;ve already won the war when you clearly have not. Some lack the fortitude and recruiting them through disingenuous advertising is unethical.')
