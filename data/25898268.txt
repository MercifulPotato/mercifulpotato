It requires absolutely zero extra effort to stay in touch to exactly the same degree, see all the photos, send all the messages you want, with dozens and hundreds of other global services that all your contacts, even tech-phobic grandma, already can super easily interact with.<p>I have never had a Facebook account, yet I still keep in touch with all the many contacts in my network from high school, college, past jobs, global extended family, immediate family, OSS project acquaintances, etc. etc. - all with zero Facebook.<p>This utterly false myth that Facebook is necessary, or even the slightest bit important or even useful, to keep in touch very closely with all the photos, comments, etc., really needs to die.<p>You can completely delete Facebook on a whim right now, and 100% of all that stuff is just as immediately, easily achievable right away with zero loss or deficiency from removing Facebook.')
