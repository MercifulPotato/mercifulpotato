Think about this way.  One share of Amazon costs $3,292.23.  If someone gathers $3,300 and offers to buy that share at that price, Jeff Bezos&#x27;s wealth just went up $424,000,000.  But it&#x27;s not like he took $424MM from anyone.  And he wouldn&#x27;t actually be able to get that $424MM, because if he started selling his shares, there would need to be enough people with $424MM more than they had before that want to buy it.<p>At that level of wealth, most of the money doesn&#x27;t actually exist.  It just represents control.  It&#x27;s basically created from nothing.')
