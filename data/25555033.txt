I am lucky that my wife&#x27;s family really welcome me even though my family background, not only that we are foreigners, but also not quite a good background to have. Due to my family&#x27;s side financial situation, both families from Indonesia and Japan never met each other physically, only through skype, maybe one or two times and we are in our 3rd year of the marriage. Pretty much I went to get married on my own, in Japan, without any side of my family coming. We just spent a nice dinner.<p>Maybe your wife isn&#x27;t ready yet to see your family. My wife, being raised in a clean 1st world country, still is not used to the living condition when we visit Indonesia. It is understandable, so most likely we will retire in Japan instead of Indonesia one day.<p>As immigrants we already accepted our way of life. We will grow older, and our kids too, without being able to grow together with their contemporaries within the family circle.<p>I understand what you say about staying here you might end up having a meaningless life. Trust me, I thought about it a lot too. Hence that&#x27;s why I set some things straight with my wife. Who knows what will happen in the future, but I said we gonna work here for a while, maybe until kids go to college, and we gonna go back to Japan. We decide that we aren&#x27;t taking any long and expensive mortgage, but if possible, only 10 year mortgage. 10 years is a short time. Once we finish that mortgage, we can do whatever we want, and see where to go next.<p>Again, it is too far to think of the future, but my current plan gives me and my wife hope and goal to aim to. We&#x27;ll enjoy the journey while we are here.')
