Item(by='Viliam1234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607635435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25369222, text='It also depends on personal experience.<p>Before we had kids, I told my wife about my dream to save a lot of money and retire early. She told me she couldn&#x27;t respect a man who doesn&#x27;t have a job. &quot;Even if he already made so much money that he can take care of himself and his family for the rest of his life without having to work another day?&quot; She admitted that it was probably an irrational preference, but this was simply how she feels. The ideal man enjoys working full-time, no matter what. Even a desire to work part-time is a turnoff.<p>A few years later, having small kids, I asked her again whether she would respect me less if I took a part-time job and spent more time taking care of the kids and household. Now she said that as long as we would still have enough money, it would be great.<p>(It remains only hypothetical, because I don&#x27;t know any employer offering part-time jobs with hourly salary similar to what I make now. And I don&#x27;t want to work 1&#x2F;2 time for 1&#x2F;4 money; I&#x27;d rather save some money now, and maybe later take a sabatical between two jobs.)<p>I am not sure the society is a sufficient explanation here. We disrespect the unemployed, that&#x27;s true, but we respect rich people without asking how much they work. I don&#x27;t think that a rich entrepreneur or politician would be turned down by women after admitting that he actually works 15 hours a week.<p>Maybe it is a function of age and experience. When you are young and childless, your world is only fun and work, so &quot;I wish I could spend less time at work&quot; translates as &quot;I wish to only have fun all week long&quot;, which of course sounds like bad news about a potential husband. Only later you realize that things like taking care of kids and household are also valuable, and they compete for time with the job.<p>You seem to blame patriarchy for this (you didn&#x27;t use the word, but you said &quot;society predominantly run by another gender&quot;). Ironically, seems to me that feminism plays its part here, too. (Not too surprising; horseshoe theory, etc.) If your political goal is to get women into all kinds of jobs, you need to brainwash them that a career is something intrinsically desirable, as opposed to merely something you do in order to pay your bills. Many young women are thrilled about their dreams of a future career, and then of course a man dreaming about early retirement simply has incompatible values. It takes a few years of work experience to realize that the career isn&#x27;t what you imagined it to be during university.')
