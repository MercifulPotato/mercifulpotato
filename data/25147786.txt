And I&#x27;m unsurprised that it wasn&#x27;t done with maximum tact and local sensitivity.<p>But our civilisation does require large-scale infrastructure. Dams, railways, airports, highways. I doubt any of these have ever been built without compulsory purchase of land.<p>In fact, I think the legislation needed to do this was first designed for building canals. And it was controversial because it obviously clashed with property rights, which in the 18th C were pretty absolute. But if each guy who owns 5 acres right at a critical spot can hold the whole 100-mile project hostage, then it can never be built.<p>Growing food just doesn&#x27;t have the same demand. It is completely routine to farm two patches of land separated by someone else&#x27;s house, no big deal.')
