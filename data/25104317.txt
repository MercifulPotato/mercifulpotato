It was all very basic. The only complexity was that the ethernet run was across the whole building and 3 stories from the 3rd story computer room to the first story utility room.<p>The day came when it was time to test it out. All the Ethernet lights came on, but throughput was on the order of less than a few kbps. I let the project manager know that something was wrong with the cabling.<p>He got back to me a week later. The electrician who ran the line ran out mid way and used wire nuts to splice another length of cable. The fix was to simply terminate each end correctly on a splice connector. IIRC they might have even just re-ran one single length.<p>But the instinct not to trust electricians to run CAT5&#x2F;6 was 101% correct!')
