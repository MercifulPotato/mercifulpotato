Significantly less-bad things to you than imprisonment&#x2F;asset seizure&#x2F;execution, BUT they are not required to follow due process and are not answerable to anyone but themselves if they do something bad to you. They can also provide substantial amounts of incriminating evidence to the government (the ones who can execute you) and technically a warrant is not required. If the cops go to Google and ask for info about you that is stored on Google&#x27;s computers, and Google gives it to them without a warrant, your rights as a US citizen have not been violated.')
