My wife recently waited nearly half an hour for a “drive up” delivery where she had to check in with an app. Apparently the message didn’t make it to the store, and when she called half way into her wait she wasn’t greeted with consolation, but derision for not understanding the failure points in this workflow.<p>It seems that the inflexible workflows of data processing have crept into meatspace, eliminating autonomy from workers job function. This has come at the huge expense of perceived customer service. As an engineer who has long worked with IT teams creating workflows for creators and business people, I see the same non-empathetic, user-hostile interactions well known in internal tools become the standard way to interact with businesses of all sizes. Broken interactions that previously would be worked around now leave customer service reps stumped and with no recourse except the most blunt choices.<p>This may be best for the bottom line, but we’ve lost some humanity in the process. I fear that the margins to return to some previously organic interaction would be so high that it would be impossible to scale and compete. Boutique shops still offer this service, but often charge accordingly and without the ability to maintain in person interactions at the moment, I worry there won’t be many left when pandemic subsides.')
