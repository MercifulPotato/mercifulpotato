You make some interesting points. But I will be honest with you: I also used to think like you, in these long convoluted ways where I was trying to explain everything I saw via programming and all sorts of mathematical extrapolations, and I for a time I believed my own b<i></i><i></i>it. But then I realised: it was all c<i></i>p and youthful arrogance.<p>In a nutshell, you are nitpicking. You can always define an arbitrary scale at which nothing matters: you used time in your rabbit example very effectively to discount the usefulness of the &quot;rabbit category&quot;. Or you used these XX males as a counter example to a rigid definition of gender. You even yourself realise that this way of thinking is completely useless as you yourself say that the category of species is extremely useful:<p>&gt; So strictly logically speaking, this definition is useless. Nevertheless, the concept of species is clearly a useful concept that helps us communicate things about the real world. How do we explain this?<p>I can explain this for you: you are thinking life is logical and &quot;discreet&quot; because you are a programmer and this is what you were taught. It is not: life is... continuous! Like the integral: each point has measure 0 but when you &quot;add&quot; a transfinite amount of 0 measure points you get... non-zero area! This resolves your rabbit paradox: each generation of rabbit is a point with measure 0 since its &quot;difference&quot; is so small with the generation before and after that it we can model it as 0...<p>Or second model: Rabbit_n = 0.9999 * Rabbit_{n+1}<p>After 100 generations: similarity is already 0.99<p>After 1000 generations: similarity is 0.90<p>After 10000 generations: similarity is 0.36<p>Tadaa: problem solved. So don&#x27;t think so hard about this, use your common sense and realise that most people are men and most people are women and a few edge cases do not matter for practical purposes. And this is the crux of the matter: we need to make decisions. Hence we do what you very well describe: we categorise the particle soup around us and we act. So the usefulness of categories&#x2F;abstractions CAN ONLY EVER BE MEASURED BY THEIR USEFULNESS FOR DECISION MAKING (sorry for caps I but want to emphasize). When I say decision making I mean almost everything: from deciding what sandwich to eat to deciding on how to prove Fermat&#x27;s last theorem. If categories help you to do things, they are useful. End of story (for me, you can go write a book about this, make sure to send me a free copy).<p>Finally, this is also all bs so don&#x27;t take it too seriously: I am a person on the internet.')
