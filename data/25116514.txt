Even if you can&#x27;t keep 6 feet of distance, the likelihood of contracting it from 3 seconds of outdoor exposure is negligible. CDC guidelines for when someone is exposed are closer than 6 feet for 15 minutes. Clearly people are wearing masks in some situations to make a point, not to make a difference.')
