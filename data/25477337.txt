Item(by='redis_mlc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608385454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475550, text='&gt; The people they follow cannot play popular music because of DMCA take downs.<p>Just to clarify ...<p>Almost all of the Youtube takedowns are not DMCA. They&#x27;re Youtube policy takedowns. But even then, music takedowns are pretty rare, since usually those videos are &quot;demonetized&quot;, meaning the channel doesn&#x27;t get paid, but the &quot;registered&quot; rightsholders are.<p>I put &quot;registered&quot; in quotes because usually the registration database is private and unverified, and correcting it to get paid is nearly impossible. (Getty Images does the same thing with photo rights - just use &quot;Getty&quot; as the owner placeholder.)')
