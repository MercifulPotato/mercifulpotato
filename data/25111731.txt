I guess the trick would be how would you (the attacker) know which filters are being used &#x2F; which are expensive?<p>If they&#x27;re only using the Snort standard filters, that would be one thing, but Cloudflare or similar services which might actually use this hardware would probably also have a completely custom rule set.  So could you somehow detect experimentally what packets trigger the expensive rules?  Perhaps some kind of fuzzing attack could do that.')
