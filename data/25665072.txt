What ate it?<p>The lack of market pressure allowed the quantity of unnecessary&#x2F;unwanted services to expand as the quality decreased (because people are still forced to pay for a failing educational system, bad teachers are shielded from accountability, and anyone who wants to pay for private education must pay twice).<p>&gt; Answer: market pressures.<p>If you don&#x27;t respond to the market telling you that you cost too much and provide too little, you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised when you&#x27;re unable to produce what you consume on the market and become dependent on additional assistance.<p>&gt; Not some elites thinking a dumber populace is easier to control and wishing a weaker educational system into existence.<p>Can you provide some source substantiating your denial of this historical assertion?<p>&gt; Free market is good at optimizing for behaviors that yield immediate, short-term profit. Good education is very hard to price, with profits following the actions by many decades.<p>Free market is also good at optimizing for means of production that deliver commodities and goods over the long term. The limitation is that the owner of the capital must have a long term vision he wishes to accomplish with his capital. Coercive systems decouple the vision-seer from the capital-owner by permitting the vision-seer to realize his vision by expropriating the necessary resources from individuals who do not share that vision. This replaces the impediment of needing a coincidence of capital and vision with the perverse incentives and moral hazards associated with expropriation.<p>&gt; I fully expect that making education governed by the market directly would make it settle on even stranger proxies in lieu of delivering proper education.<p>Only as far as the people paying for the education approved those proxy results.<p>&gt; free market for commodity labor doesn&#x27;t equal happy labor, but rather unhappy labor living on minimum wage.<p>a free market wouldn&#x27;t have a minimum wage by definition.')
