The impact of long-form well-written essays like this is huge, and fits perfectly with the theme of the essay itself about helping others succeed at scale.<p>I like the personal notes included a ton, e.g. mentioning that he has struggled with depression personally, which I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed, even if naively so.
