Diffraction makes things a lot harder, and some phone lenses are indeed essentially diffraction limted<p>Secondly, I&#x27;m actually comparing resolution at fixed FoV, not a fixed focal length.<p>Again, the sensor size doesn&#x27;t matter, what matters is the focal length. The focal length of an iPhone main lens isn&#x27;t 10mm, the sensor size is 8.5mm but the focal length is actually around 5mm. You find the theoretical maximum linear resolution is more around 300-400 lp&#x2F;mm. If you run the numbers, at f&#x2F;1.6 the airy disk diameter is already bigger than the pixel pitch (2.11 microns airy disk and 1.7 micron pixel pitch). The resolution is already being seriously degraded by diffraction, although it&#x27;s not completely diffraction yet. Lens aberrations make it even worse, of course. All in all, realistically the resolution is pretty much at its limit.<p>If you work at this regime where the linear resolution is close to equal to the airy disk, you start having a type of abberation where changing the wavelength of the system causes a change in the resolution, which can&#x27;t be fixed. So pretty much in practice you can&#x27;t really exceed the resolution we see now even in perfect light with a perfect lens, because you start having unavoidable abberrations that are very significant to the image.')
