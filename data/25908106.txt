The other day a member of the US government (I think it was Ted Cruz? I can&#x27;t find it at the moment) wrote a tweet that implied he thought the Paris Climate agreement only affected the citizens of Paris. Something as factually &quot;write&#x2F;wrong&quot; as that should be able to be contested and held accountable to being &quot;wrong&quot;<p>That being said, I agree with you that this will not be used as intended and will undoubtedly lead to more confusion and confirmation bias from all sides. Using crowd-sourced knowledge in this manner leads to the assumption that &quot;what the majority thinks is right is factual,&quot; and I&#x27;m reminded it was once &quot;fact&quot; that the sun rotated around the Earth')
