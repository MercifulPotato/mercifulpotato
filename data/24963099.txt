The reality is bitcoin still suffers from a scaling flaw, one that appears to be unfixable.  The workaround is to layer any entirely new protocol on Bitcoin, Lightning.  It has been 4 years in deployment.  It is couldn&#x27;t be said to be successfully deployed as Lightning&#x27;s creators have noticed bugs that make it unsuitable for prime time.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@antoine.riard&#x2F;why-we-may-fail-lightning-ee3692de1a55" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@antoine.riard&#x2F;why-we-may-fail-lightning-...</a><p>I&#x27;m no expert, but they don&#x27;t appear to be bugs that run as deep as bitcoin&#x27;s scaling flaw, however they do require changed to both bitcoin and Lightning to fix.  And implementing the fix is bogged down by the need to keep the patient alive and functional during the operation.  The serious mistakes created by a &quot;moving fast and break things&quot; doesn&#x27;t work for this style of project.<p>And for &quot;why&quot; bitcoin &#x2F; Lightning isn&#x27;t working splendidly after all this time, I think it&#x27;s fair to say creating a functional digital currency that is secure and scales infinitely turned out to be far harder than anybody imagined, and I&#x27;d say far harder than anybody could have possibly predicted.')
