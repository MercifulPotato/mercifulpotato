Item(by='wyldfire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609882334, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650511, text='&gt; It seems so amazing to me that Microsoft saw the ARM opportunity with Windows RT, released 8 years back but somehow managed to not succeed with a stellar ARM laptop story.<p>It&#x27;s definitely not a stellar ARM laptop story, but the ARM laptops have been at market for years prior to the ARM Macbook release.  Not porting Chrome for the initial release was a huge blunder IMO.  No one wants to use Edge.  Having a chip with performance parity targeted at Intel&#x27;s i5 might have been a mistake, too.<p>But (while admittedly not as stellar as M1 Macbook) we have options: the Envy X2, Yoga&#x2F;Flex 5G, Surface Pro X, Galaxy Book S.<p>The M1 validates Microsoft&#x27;s strategy to embrace ARM.  Hopefully the third-party software devs are able to port their software in order to make this transition easier.<p>Qualcomm stopped their own CPU design a while back and if they&#x27;d have kept that going then perhaps there would be a better competitor to the M1.  Or maybe they just need to drop in a better reference design from ARM?')
