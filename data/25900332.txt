From a policy perspective, what is driving the shutdowns is the negative effects when healthcare is overloaded, and that healthcare overloading is a clear consequence of uncontrolled community spread.<p>If(as?) vaccination disrupts community spread, that should reduce reported cases and hospital occupancy. When those numbers are low, that will trigger relaxation of restrictions where I live (and I expect in other places as well).<p>I think there would still be a desire to vaccinate to herd immunity, but given the limited supply of vaccines, it would probably be best to prioritize vaccine use where there&#x27;s community spread over building herd immunity in other areas.')
