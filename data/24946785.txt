We welcome you. :)<p>For those who don&#x27;t know - we have a full App Automation platform that runs on serverless tech. We automatically handle auth to your favourite APIs and easily handle webhook setup and signing. Apps can be published open source and shared with the community. We&#x27;re easy for non-developers to get started with (folks more on the business operations side can get started via our Apps [1]) and everything you work with is ultimately code.<p>We&#x27;re definitely not a &quot;consumer solution&quot; and if you&#x27;re looking for something self-hosted we&#x27;re happy to suggest alternatives. We run in the cloud but have a pretty sophisticated system that supports version controls, rollbacks, CI (dev vs. prod) and a whole ton of other neat features.<p>We have a pretty permissive free tier for developers, but what we really focus on bringing to the table is professional &amp; team tooling around automation which is what we charge for. We don&#x27;t charge by # of automations, steps, or anything like that -- just access to organization-level tooling that allows you to more easily collaborate with a broader team.<p>Happy to answer questions if you have any! (We just launched officially on July 7th, so if you haven&#x27;t heard of us yet -- that&#x27;s why.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autocode.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autocode.com&#x2F;</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autocode.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autocode.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;</a>')
