I&#x27;ve done quite a few over the years for fun, and most involve a significant amount more work than simply saying &quot;measure EM, done!&quot; Some of these do take significant effort to get working, especially if you have a simple understanding of physics, electronics, noise, or measurement.<p>No comments on all your claims on how simple you think defense is?<p>I&#x27;m guessing that if you really think one simply says &quot;Faraday cage!&quot; and all EM is solved, or one says &quot;Sound proofing!&quot; and all vibration is blocked, then you also may not understand the value in having the detailed nuances of each of these things worked out.<p>So this stuff seems useless to you. There are plenty of groups getting paid to do stuff that seems trivial to people that honestly don&#x27;t understand the nuances. And in this space the nuances make a big difference.<p>And, as others pointed out - this is useful to plenty of people as a starting point for stuff they want to do. Knowing that 1980&#x27;s CRT emanations were leaking does not give someone new to the field the ability to read RAM noise.')
