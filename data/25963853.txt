I&#x27;m on year 5 of working remotely.<p>Working in software I definitely think most companies are fine with remote individual contributors, and that it has been shown to work effectively.<p>If the company is setup for majority distributed communication (slack, wikis, ticket tracker, etc), then I even think tech team leads can be remote.<p>That seems to be the limit though unless the company is remote first or close to it.  I haven&#x27;t seen any remote employees in Sr. Management roles.  Although Sr. Management at the company I&#x27;m working for have been working from home, I think when things are back to &#x27;normal&#x27; the expectation is that they will be in the office again, although I&#x27;ll be curious to see if they work from home one or two days a week.<p>YMMV')
