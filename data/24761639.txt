For starters I&#x27;d move the most useless keys to the index finger home row positions, perhaps pipe and backtick. Then I&#x27;d invert the sense of shift, so you have to hold it to type anything lowercase. I&#x27;d take all the most common two-letter sequences and I&#x27;d move those letters under the weakest finger. So T H E O A R S and N replace the punctuation keys on the right side. This should make it a real hassle to type &quot;the&quot;, especially considering that you&#x27;ll be holding down shift, which should itself be somewhere hard to reach, such as where 6 usually goes.')
