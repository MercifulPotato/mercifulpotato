You are wondering about ill effect of <i>decriminalization</i> of drug users - most people including me cannot fathom why the heck should <i>users</i> be criminalized. This policy is pure evil, didn&#x27;t make any real measurable benefit to society, just filled US prisons with normal citizens who like to smoke weed or maybe do some psychedelics from time to time (clue, in country like Switzerland, around 10% of population smokes regularly and nobody really cares, its not causing any harm to society). Its great if you run a private prison or have shares of it though.<p>I go one step beyond and argue that soft drugs should be legal and limits should be same as for alcohol - if cigarettes and alcohol are legal, so should be weed and its variants. Or ban them all if you want to be properly fair and scientific and brace yourself for mass riots. Of course no politician would do that, thats suicide.')
