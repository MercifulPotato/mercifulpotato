Victims == patients.<p>In your analogies of rape&#x2F;murder, the (almost) equivalent would be if there was a doorman at an apartment building who was supposed to verify the identity of everyone entering the building, but failed to do so, letting the unauthorized perpetrator into the building and thus allowing the victim to be raped&#x2F;murdered.
