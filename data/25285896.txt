This happens all the time. For example, electrical engineering has <i>f</i>, <i>ω</i>, and <i>s</i>, all only differing by basic factors of 2<i>π</i> or <i>i</i>.<p>As far as I can tell, the main reason this gets done is to give commonly recurring quantities single symbols, to reduce errors in lengthy calculations.
