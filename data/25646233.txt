This takes time and skill - ideally you&#x27;d need two or three people that are capable of fixing problems with the install. (one ill, one on vacation, one available). This is something that detracts from the actual work you&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;m very much an ops person and I actually like tinkering with a gitlab install - it&#x27;s just so many moving parts that I prefer not to run this for my company since it would eat a substantial chunk of my time just caring for this.')
