Also, building the index may not even be possible while your application is running, because postgresql and other RDBMS have inadequate facilities for throttling index construction such that it doesn&#x27;t harm the online workload. You might have to build indexes at midnight on Sundays, or even take your whole system offline. It can be a nightmare.<p>This isn&#x27;t just a problem for SQL databases. Terrible-but-popular NoSQL systems like MongoDB also rely heavily on indexes while providing zero or few safety features that will prevent the index build from wrecking the online workload.<p>I personally prefer databases that simply do not have indexes, like bigtable, because they require more forethought from data and application architects, leading to fundamentally better systems.')
