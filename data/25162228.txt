Item(by='StillBored', descendants=None, kids=[25162648], score=None, time=1605891075, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25161738, text='I guess I have to read the full paper, because reading the link does nothing to clear up what is going on.<p>From reading the link I get, change orders cost money (duh!) and that there are a lot of change orders, particularly to older designs due to &quot;changing regulation&quot;. Cause presumably before starting construction the older design has been mitigated to deal with newer regulations.<p>Which from my own biases, seems to mean that courts&#x2F;etc are stepping in and modifying the regulations during construction and that costs a sh*tload. Otherwise the builders are negligent, or simply that it took 30 years to get approval for the plans, but now its a catch 22 because they are outdated.')
