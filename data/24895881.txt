I&#x27;m Bill Woodcock, the eponymous &quot;woody&quot; of &quot;woodynet.&quot;  And executive director of PCH, and chairman of Quad9&#x27;s board.  They are three separate corporations, which exist for different reasons, and under different tax regulations (PCH and Quad9 are public-benefit not-for-profits, whereas WoodyNet exists to pay taxes on taxable transactions and keep the non-profits&#x27; books clean), but they&#x27;re very closely related.<p>In this case, you&#x27;re seeing WoodyNet IPs and IN-ADDRs because WoodyNet is giving transit to the Quad9 anycast instance you&#x27;re talking to.<p>I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions you may have about how all this works.<p>I&#x27;d also note that round-robining between two different organizations with radically different privacy practices and security services...  um...  might not make the most sense?  Depending what your goal is, of course.  Again, happy to talk about any of this, just let me know if I (or any of the Quad9 or PCH folks) can be of help.<p><pre><code>         -Bill</code></pre>')
