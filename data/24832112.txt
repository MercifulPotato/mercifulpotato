You can subdivide people&#x27;s struggles further.<p>For example, women and men experience the world differently.\nBlack people and white people experience the world differently with what sort of things they can take for granted and things that other people will assume about them.<p>And it goes further.<p>A white woman and a black woman, though both women, will each experience life a bit differently. A black woman and a black man, too!<p>And even further,<p>A gay black woman will experience life differently and have a different, more specific set of struggles than a straight black woman.<p>Basically, it&#x27;s not just ethnicity, not just gender, not just sexuality, not just [insert method of subdividing people that can be imagined] that changes a person&#x27;s experiences and struggles in the world, but the collection of all of them that changes their experiences of the world and the sorts of privileges and prejudices, etc, they experience.')
