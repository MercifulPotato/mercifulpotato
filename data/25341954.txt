It said that the energy stars burn is a small part (&lt;1%?) of what they contain in total mass&#x2F;energy, so it might make sense and harvest that energy later. (The paper did not explain a method for efficient matter&#x2F;energy conversion but I <i>think</i> black holes can do that?)<p>That paper didn&#x27;t fully convince me but it&#x27;s one of very few arguments that tries to  address what I think is the core issue. (At least a few species will want as much energy as they can get.)')
