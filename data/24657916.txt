Get more people involved, so that they can take some of the load off of the maintainer. You suggest that they aren&#x27;t capable of running the projects they created entirely out of love for the craft, and were handling well enough, without help only because DO&#x27;s marketing stunt might probably cause burnout.<p>Did I get it right or did I misintepret something?<p>&gt; Stop whining of how hard the life of an OSS maintainer is and invite others to help you out.<p>Are <i>you</i> a maintainer? How many of them have you offered to help with the spam? And don&#x27;t you think there are better contributions you could make if it weren&#x27;t for the deluge?')
