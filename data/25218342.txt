Item(by='noisy_boy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606382820, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25214845, text='&gt; It wasnâ€™t even that slow. Something like a quarter-second lag when you opened a dropdown or clicked a button. But it made things so unpleasant that nobody wanted to touch it.<p>Considering the no. of fields on that form, with that kind of lag, I&#x27;ll be ditching it too. I mean most of it is check-boxes; just replicate the damn thing on html. Though without knowing more about the setup, I would guess that hardware with terrible input is also involved.')
