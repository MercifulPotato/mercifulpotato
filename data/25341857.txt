Really there at least three attributes that I see in this statement that I don&#x27;t typically see in utterings of our bureaucrats:<p>1) I actually get the sense of outright honesty from this statement.  Not some overly messsaged, PR driven&#x2F;reviewed statement by some spokes-hole.  I actually think this statement is really what this guy believes... a public statement that even expresses some vulnerability.  Despite the subject, very refreshing and I&#x27;d be more likely to listen seriously to what he has to say in future.<p>2) Struggling with right and good uses of power and seeing not using one&#x27;s power as itself a public good.  Good heavens... this guy should run for President!  I expect I&#x27;d disagree with much of his politics, but I&#x27;d vote for him just for having such thoughts and expect the nation would be better off no matter his other leanings.<p>3) Questioning the mandates, their effectiveness, and whether they might be causing more harm than good.  And not doing so from some artificial posturing to show &quot;the right politics&quot;, but honest, genuine questioning.<p>Whether you agree or not... I wish more of our public officials were this thoughtful on critical issues such as face us in this pandemic.')
