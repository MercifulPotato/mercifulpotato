Clearly if I don&#x27;t trust that network provided DNS server I&#x27;ll tunnel everything out to a trusted network, or I could specify a DOH.<p>I have no practical issue with DOH if it were implemented at the OS level and had standards around how to distribute recommended settings (just like my dhcp server distributes a recommended gateway, recommended ntp server, recommended tftp boot server, etc).')
