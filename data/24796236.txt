I don&#x27;t think this was available at the time, and there were very few examples of a Zettelkasten online, too.<p>Now, seeing the original, I... still don&#x27;t know the right way to operate a system like this. Instead I took the core concept of keeping notes as atomic as possible and use that with linking as many notes as possible together to form new ideas. And that&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t worry with weird file names or the &quot;correct&quot; way that things should be linked together. Obsidian.md has been a great help with that, but any Wiki software will do the trick.<p>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m free of the old mentality I had. I spent 95% of my time trying to figure out the perfect system and how to operate it rather than writing. Now I just write.')
