That&#x27;s been disallowed on both sites since day 1.<p>&gt;I came up with the original concept of 8chan while on a psychedelic mushroom trip. I was past the peak and was on the tail end of the trip, and I just decided to browse 4chan because that&#x27;s what I did when sober. I was still tripping pretty bad though so I kept seeing these fractal patterns and I wrote down the words &quot;infinite chan&quot; to remember for later.<p>&gt;The next day, I was able to put into words more of what the site would be like. I was inspired partly by the admin of 4chon.net, savetheinternet, who routinely refused to make requested boards for users. I wondered what it would be like if there were a Reddit-style imageboard where anyone could make a board without express admin approval, and began hacking on the imageboard engine I knew best to make it a reality: vichan. I decided to expire boards after inactivity so that it didn&#x27;t get full of dead boards like Reddit does with dead subreddits, and released version 1 of 8chan two days later.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowyourmeme.com&#x2F;editorials&#x2F;interviews&#x2F;qa-with-fredrick-brennan-of-8chan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowyourmeme.com&#x2F;editorials&#x2F;interviews&#x2F;qa-with-fredr...</a>')
