Item(by='cubano', descendants=None, kids=[25641210], score=None, time=1609810598, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640169, text='Hiring, by definition, is mostly discrimination.<p>Otherwise, people would just hire the first person you received a resume from who had the solid qualifications and experience you needed.<p>But no...of course that&#x27;s not what happens.  Managers go through the Kabuki dance with the potential employee just trying to find a small &quot;chink in the armor&quot; to quickly disqualify them.<p>It&#x27;s called the &quot;initial screen&quot; of course, and the whole point is to find something to &quot;discriminate&quot; against and eliminate the candidate.  Please PLEASE do NOT reply to this message saying &quot;oh discriminating is the wrong term I&#x27;m simply EVALUATING blah blah blah&quot; Yes whatever you like to call it the end result is exactly the same.<p>Then, of course, the whole team does the same sort of &quot;don&#x27;t call it discrimination but if we notice some trait we don&#x27;t like, we don&#x27;t hire them&quot; thing again.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s their age, or hair, or the clothes they wear, or the way they talked, or didn&#x27;t talk.  Maybe even sometimes, because the person is broke and hungry and they came off wrong, because of course, they don&#x27;t have any income, or took a risk in their lives that didn&#x27;t pan out, or perhaps even had to take care of a dying parent for a while, and now have to struggle to come up with an explanation on why they weren&#x27;t working for that time.<p>Maybe they even had a felony 20 years ago when they were totally different people...heaven forbid they did THAT because, of course, NO ONE in our amazing Foobar company EVER did anything illegal and didn&#x27;t get caught!<p>So that&#x27;s really just only a matter of bad luck, but yet it&#x27;s an absolute KoD with getting hired these days.<p>What rarely ever happens, oddly enough, is to ask candidates to prove their programming skills with either a sample project or a trial period. This would seem like a very logical thing to do and it confounds me why it&#x27;s not used more...and even if it is and the person aces the tests, if anything is found, well, <i>discriminating</i> about the candidate, well, we just cannot even take a chance on hiring them.<p>And even though almost 25% of all &quot;sure-fire&quot; hires won&#x27;t work out and will be gone in a year[0], and there are literally a million tech jobs[1] that need to be filled this year, <i>we just cannot even take a chance on hiring them</i> rings over and over in the offices of the hiring managers. THAT...of all things to rant about, is the thing that baffles and frustrates me more than anything...<p>How can anyone ever prove they they can become a valuable part of the team if no one will ever give them a chance?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techrepublic.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;software-had-the-highest-job-turnover-rate-of-any-industry-in-2017&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techrepublic.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;software-had-the-highes...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.hackerrank.com&#x2F;unlocking-trapped-engineers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.hackerrank.com&#x2F;unlocking-trapped-engineers&#x2F;</a>')
