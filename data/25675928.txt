Sure, the mob is not as well trained as professionals, but when you consider the number of vets with some military experience, the fairly large numbers of militia organizations which provide amateur levels of training in both virtual and real contexts, and the high availability of training materials (military manuals etc), it&#x27;s smart to assume that any given mob will contain some people who know what they&#x27;re doing and are able to direct others.')
