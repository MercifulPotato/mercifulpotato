It&#x27;s a very old-world view of solving the problem of open source capacity. A better tool would instead try to find and encourage new resources (new contributors), whereas stalebot drives them away, and so kinda cuts the project off at the knees<p>imho, in the short-term, it rescues the cognitive and emotional resources of current contributors, but (in the long-term) drives future contributors away through promoting lack of care and by encouraging maintainers to not interact with them.')
