Just to make up an example: Before WalMart a dollar is used 10 times before leaving, after WalMart a dollar is used 2 times.<p>What&#x27;s that measure called?<p>And that&#x27;s microeconomics, right? If it&#x27;s important for microeconomics, why isn&#x27;t it important for macro too?<p>Also:<p>Big money has to chase big investments. Probably because of transaction costs and limited attention.<p>So while there&#x27;s innumerable small opportunities, they remain uncapitalized.<p>How do we (society) get these things done? Find a way to scale up. Empower more people to make more investments. So instead of a billion dollar fund looking at 10 large investments, we have 1,000 million dollar funds looking at 10,000 modest investments.')
