What were the expected results? Did they expect an explosive landing?<p>Was it just an experiment with unpredictable result so they did not want to reveal that to FAA?<p>Do they think that they are at par with NASA and that any poor outcome can be waved as national experiment!<p>If I had to guess, I would say that it was an open ended experiment where they could not get approval for a launch so they avoided seeking approvals by playing it dumb and now they have the data that they wanted.<p>I would be wary of this company because they will experiment with human life believing that they are just another NASA but with even less regulatory boundaries.')
