If you live in a HOA and don&#x27;t care about the governance of that HOA then you are a slave to the HOA. The HOA may be a benevolent dictator or a malevolent one but you are their slave.<p>edit: The same applies to government except you don&#x27;t generally get the choice to not live under a government (or the cost of moving is massive). As I see it, over longer periods of time being a slave is unpleasant even if it can be cushy in the short term.')
