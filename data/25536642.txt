I think short lived certs and automated cert management are a better fix versus certs that never expire (for that issue).<p>If you don&#x27;t have an expiry then you&#x27;d need to keep certificate revocations around forever, so your CRL grows without bound. Currently the certificate revocation list can remove expired certificates as clients won&#x27;t use them. There&#x27;s also lots of clients that don&#x27;t check CRLs. Those clients would be forever vulnerable to a stolen certificate if we removed expiry.<p>Imagine if you inherited the infrastructure for a company where the previous admin created certs, lost track of them, and used questionable methods for securing them. I believe you&#x27;d struggle to find and revoke every previously issued certificate. The expiry ensures that gets cleaned up, eventually.<p>I don&#x27;t have a good solution to the Nokia Symbian problem. I suspect if the device only supports SHA-1 then there are other unpatched security issues. Does anyone know if that&#x27;s the case? If so, this seems more like a support and patching issue.')
