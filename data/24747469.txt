There&#x27;s a guy in front of me at the repair desk who is holding a carbon fiber bottle cage. The tech is looking at it, because it&#x27;s cracked. He tells the guy that he probably overtightened the bolt holding it on (&quot;very easy to do on the carbon cages&quot;) and suggests that he just puts a metal (even titanium!) washer between the bolt and cage, and everything will be OK.<p>Guy says &quot;yeah, but the extra weight of the washer that would mean that it was pointless to buy the lightest possible cage&quot;<p>I interrupt and ask the Guy if he ever adds slightly too much powder to his energy drink when going out for a ride.<p>&#x2F;badaboom')
