It&#x27;s that it has a tracing GC that tries to automagically fix those cycles for you. So in C++, if you get a cycle, the destructors do not run at all - which is pretty noticeable. In Python, they run &quot;sometime later&quot;, so programmers are less inclined to fix the cycles (indeed, many aren&#x27;t even aware that it&#x27;s a problem).<p>But if you provide a non-deterministic mechanism on top of refcounting to break the cycles, and destructors aren&#x27;t consistently deterministic already, why even bother with refcounting at all?')
