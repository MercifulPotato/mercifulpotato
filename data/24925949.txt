We use React, Apollo, GraphQL, Webpack etc. the TALL stack is such a breath of fresh air. I can&#x27;t even begin to explain my joy. Just joy.<p>I now dread the time I have to write those infinite lines of JS, conflicting dependencies, slow build times, React hook state management etc.<p>When I speak with my colleagues about tech, they all seem to love the entangled mess of JS dev and willing to jump on any new framework that gets released. I always push for good old reliable SSR. Often get called the weird one for being young, yet favoring old school tech, though.<p>I guess I prefer a better developer experience and shorter time to production&#x2F;market, rather than spending days trying to setup a project and figure out weird quirks and issues with such a complicated mess of a &quot;serverless, modern day web application&quot;.')
