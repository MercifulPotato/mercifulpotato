Gone is the busywork of writing routes, handling CRUD in a zillion slightly different ways, etc.<p>On the frontend, Apollo-client lets me just write my app, not having to handle data-fetching, loading &amp; caching for the zillionth time. I need an additional field? Just add it to the query! No need to get everyone involved.<p>Of course, there are traps you can easily fall into with Apollo&#x27;s caching, N+1 queries on the backend, etc. But in my experience, while you do have to &quot;drop down a level&quot; sometimes to fix these, you spend most of your time at the &quot;higher level&quot;.')
