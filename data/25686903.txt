Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem,&quot; he said. &quot;If a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24 x 7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says the product is region-locked, will come to your country 3 months after the US release, and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store, then the pirate&#x27;s service is more valuable.&quot;')
