[A few] commenting engines listed on the page are provided by heavy applications</i><p>A small ambiguity: There&#x27;s a difference between being light weight client side, in the browser â€” versus server side:<p>1) End users notice the client side in-the-browser performance &amp; light-weighted-ness. Whilst 2) the one who notices app server light-ness is the static site owner, who can save some $ each month.<p>However the comparisons page doesn&#x27;t clarify that it apparently has in mind application server light &#x2F; heaviness (and not browser-side).')
