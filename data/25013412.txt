Whether these moving parts are in trust only for three months, three years or more is not the issue, it is the fact that periodic resync and retrust needs to happen, means that it may result in a cascadable failure of our infrastructure in the future.  Say if a nuclear disaster &#x2F; earthquake take down one city, will it lead to paralysis of servers and services across the world?
