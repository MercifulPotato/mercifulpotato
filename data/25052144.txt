The incentives and structures that created them are here to stay. Anyone who thinks their open source pet projects wouldn&#x27;t face the same problems Twitter has at the scale 300M active users is just being woefully ignorant of politics at play here and still thinks Twitter can be built in a weekend.<p>In 2016, you had a guy jokingly claim that he was ripping republican ballots in Ohio. This tweet spread like wildfire, and caused an unimaginable headache for the secretary of state as the right-wing media went wild on the story. I&#x27;m not surprised Twitter is taking such heavy handed action given that they will be directly in the cross hairs if a story like that ever happens again. No &quot;replacement&quot; would be immune from this issue.')
