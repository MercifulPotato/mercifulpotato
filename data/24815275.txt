People might read it and think it is really a good book for the target audience (which it probably is); they probably dont see themselves as the target audience. Also they read the whole book and maybe it was great for them, and their feedback was honest. My claim is the people who would benefit from it wont get past the title, but I have no idea how to validate this idea.')
