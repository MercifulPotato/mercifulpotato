It’s awful. It is not a good chat app and hasn’t changed much in 4 years. It plays catchup with competitors. Teams is so far away from having good features and app integration; Everyone I talk to that used Slack hates it. It’s just that it’s free with o365 that it’s even used. Honestly, I want to remind people everyone said the same thing about Google buying YouTube and FB buying insta. Two large purchases that were so worth it for the companies.')
