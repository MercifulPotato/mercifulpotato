Note that the only &quot;backing&quot; of these coins is just a promise --- not USD.<p>3) Big customers&#x2F;players use &quot;loaned&quot; stable coin to buy bitcoin --- thus inflating bitcoin price.<p>4) Small investors&#x2F;speculators see rising bitcoin and jump in to buy inflating price even more.<p>5) All together now --- sell bitcoin at inflated prices.  Profit!<p>6) Stop minting and &quot;loaning&quot; stable coins.  Bitcoin drops.  Naive small investors get screwed.<p>7) Repeat at step 1.<p>What facilitates this scheme is people accept the fiction that the stable coin is 100% backed by USD.<p>Doing this in any &quot;regulated&quot; market would subject you to a huge fine, prison time or both.')
