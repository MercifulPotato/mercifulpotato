I don&#x27;t want to have to upgrade the hardware, I want it to be repairable with replacement parts available, I don&#x27;t want to have to upgrade the OS to a new major version that moves all of my widgets around for about ten years.  I don&#x27;t want to use beta software that slowly mutates until it mostly works or is abruptly discontinued, I want to install a suite of finished software that continues to work the same way with only imperceptible security fixes for ten years, so that I don&#x27;t constantly have to be adjusting my workflow as individual portions are obliviated.<p>And then, when that ten years is up and I need to upgrade, I want the changes to be actual upgrades stemming from fixing design mistakes and removing pain points and doing things that not only weren&#x27;t possible ten years ago, but which are also desirable and not merely novel.')
