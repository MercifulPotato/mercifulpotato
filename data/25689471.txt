Item(by='aw1621107', descendants=None, kids=[25689672], score=None, time=1610135679, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25688789, text='You&#x27;re replying to points I never made nor implied.<p>The claim I was addressing:<p>&gt; Point to a single court case in the US regarding this election year where evidence was presented in court and judged.<p>The cases I listed are cases where 1) evidence was (arguably) presented in court, in the form of affidavits&#x2F;expert opinions&#x2F;reports&#x2F;testimony attached to the complaint, and 2) judged to be insufficient for one reason or another.<p>The fact that other lawsuits were dismissed solely on procedural or jurisdictional grounds is irrelevant for the purposes of addressing that specific claim.<p><i>Law v. Whitmer</i>, in particular, does <i>not</i> appear to have been dismissed on procedural grounds, and is sufficient on its own to prove both the claim I originally addressed and the other part of GGP&#x27;s comment incorrect:<p>&gt; CONCLUSION<p>&gt; The Contestants failed to meet their burden to provide credible and relevant evidence to substantiate any of the grounds set forth in NRS 293.410 to contest the November 3, 2020 General Election<p>&quot;Cherry-picking&quot; is also meaningless here, as I made no extrapolation about post-election lawsuits in general based on those 3 cases.<p>----<p>&gt; Oh, and by the way, if a judge dismisses a case on procedural, jurisdictional or standing and then goes on to provide an opinion of the claims&#x2F;evidence presented in a complaint -- it doesn&#x27;t mean that the adjudication was based upon the merits of the case.<p>Well, sure, but it also doesn&#x27;t mean that the ruling was <i>not</i> based on upon the merits of the case either. A case can be dismissed for multiple reasons, after all; for example, <i>King v. Whitmer</i> was dismissed partially on standing grounds <i>and</i> because the judge found that the plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the merits (not strictly a final ruling on the merits, but based upon the merits nonetheless).<p>In addition, the line between &quot;procedural dismissal&quot; and &quot;ruling upon the merits&quot; can get a bit hazy if the dismissal relies upon evaluation of evidence provided by the complainant. For example, Rule 9(b) requires federal fraud claims to be pled with particularity. If the provided evidence fails to satisfy Rule 9(b), then the case can be dismissed. Does this count as a procedural dismissal (not meeting the requirements of a rule), or a ruling based upon the merits of the case (insufficient evidence)?<p>----<p>And also note that I said:<p>&gt; Kind of depends on what precisely you mean by &quot;presented in court and judged&quot;<p>The commenter I replied to didn&#x27;t give a precise definition of &quot;presented in court and judged&quot;, so I worked off what I hope is a reasonable interpretation of the phrase.')
