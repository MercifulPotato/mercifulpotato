But I do think he got some good ideas through the conventional “wisdom”. His execution on everything was poor.<p>Ineffectual? I’d argue he’s one of the most consequential Presidents of the past 100 years.<p>He reshaped the federal bench, confirmed a 6-3 majority on the SCOTUS, overhauled the tax code, negotiated multiple Middle East peace deals, repealed and replaced NAFTA, and didn’t start a single foreign war.<p>His impact on the US political system will be felt for generations.
