You disrupt the government in such a way that the rule of law fails.  In fact, it&#x27;s been reported that at least one Trump goal was to push certification out beyond the 11 day (I think, details are fuzzy) deadline in the electoral count act and force the house to decide.<p>You&#x27;re simply saying that it didn&#x27;t work.  But that&#x27;s down as much to luck (a smallish crowd and multiple barriers to cross) and architecture (cold war escape tunnels) as it is to anything fundamental.  It is VERY easy to imagine an alternate universe where Pelosi and Pence are still being held hostage right now.')
