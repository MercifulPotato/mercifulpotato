Going back more, both were part of the same country.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a long-term option to avoid hitting resource limits. If one person doesn&#x27;t grab the resources, some other person will. Consider the Shakers: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shakers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shakers</a> From a peak of over 4000 people, they are down to just 2, but that didn&#x27;t stop population growth. Other people made up for the loss. An example is the Amish: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Amish" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Amish</a><p>I would certainly like to live among other large families, but I would also prefer to delay hitting resource limits. I guess that means I would encourage others who are very local to me, while dissuading those beyond my neighborhood.
