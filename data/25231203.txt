The core abstraction is a mechanism to control message passing between apps via routing through light weight kernel invocations (which is indeed practically the only thing the kernel does, it being a microkernel architecture).<p>Memory access is enforced, although not technically via the kernel. Rather at boot time the kernel owns all memory, then during init it slices off all the memory it doesn&#x27;t need for itself and passes it to a user space memory service, and thereafter all memory requests get routed through that process. L4 uses a security model where permissions (including resource access) and their derivatives can be passed from one process to another. Using that system the memory manager process can slice off chunks of its memory and delegate access to those chunks to other processes.')
