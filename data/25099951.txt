Maybe it&#x27;s me, but when I look around, I see a lot of hidden tensions in people who&#x27;ve been together for a long time. In most cases, I&#x27;d say it borders toxicity. Relationships are tough.<p>IMO what predicts that people stay together is that they&#x27;re capable of navigating it, it doesn&#x27;t even matter if the navigation is unhealthy (i.e. like some of my family members, they&#x27;ll stay together until death, but there are some painful sacrifices both parties are making).')
