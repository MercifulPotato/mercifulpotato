Item(by='capableweb', descendants=None, kids=[25644023], score=None, time=1609841528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25643900, text='&quot;Telegram publishes users&#x27; locations online only for those who explicitly enabled feature to do so and not implicitly that all users location is shared&quot; is a bit long for a title.<p>While you&#x27;re right, the title is accurate although it comes with bunch of caveats of course, some of them outlined in the article. That&#x27;s why we read the full article instead of just titles. More caveats are that they are using a smartphone, has GPS location on, are using Telegram, have allowed the app to access the location and finally shared their location in Telegram.')
