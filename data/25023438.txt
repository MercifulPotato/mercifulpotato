I am a big proponent of distributism. The means of production should be as widely distributed as possible. This does not mean they should be concentrated in the hands of a small number of individuals (capitalism), nor should they belong to the state (communism). A good example of distributism is workers who own their own tools (the means of their own production). Software engineers have it pretty good in this regard. But this can apply to tradespeople, factory workers that collectively own shares in machinary, etc.')
