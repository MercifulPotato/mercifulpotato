I also like that they at least have a product they can put in the hands of the players.<p>But the scope creep is pathetic. I used to support them early on and for quite a while; however they have lost all incentives to do anything other than string the backers along. They haven&#x27;t actually set to deliver something properly playable and at this point the only people enjoying the game are the hardcore fans who HAVE to enjoy it otherwise they feel like they haven&#x27;t got their money&#x27;s worth.<p>Scope creep itself is fine, but if it perpetually delays your initial release then what&#x27;s the point? I think they know that by now.')
