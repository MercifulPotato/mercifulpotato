Item(by='velcro', descendants=None, kids=[25593717], score=None, time=1609409402, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25588243, text='My experience with Flash is completely opposite to yours - I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re for the most part pretending that by letting Flash die we&#x27;re better off today.<p>My fans spinning up every time I open a random website definitely disagree with you. Wasn&#x27;t that the #1 argument for getting rid of Flash?<p>I started developing Flash websites in Flash 3 in school, transitioned into Actionscript 2&#x2F;3 and did some complex projects over the years. Can&#x27;t vouch for Linux but on my Mac and on Windows it was definitely great, it DID just work and it was cross-platform. People have short memories - but cross-platform back then was also mostly referring to huge JS&#x2F;website inconsistencies between different browsers. I mean - when you say cross-platform, what are you even comparing it to?<p>I had a huge offline collection of different SWF files&#x2F;websites for inspiration and that I could just start up from the filesystem and they also just worked (if it was a single-file project of course). I&#x27;d wager that 95+% of the people also had the full Flash Player installed.<p>Today I do some complex JS&#x2F;React&#x2F;webGL stuff - and let me tell you it takes like 10x as much (money, time, knowledge, effort) to develop stuff that&#x27;s comparable to what I did 10 years ago in Flash. And this comes with more or just as many cross-browser and performance problems.<p>Blaming Flash for &quot;fixing your computer&quot; or saying it somehow had &quot;hosting issues&quot; I can&#x27;t really understand at all.<p>The &quot;mobile era&quot; just started when Flash started transitioning into smartphones&#x2F;apps - first results were not ideal but promising. Were Adobe allowed to have 10 years of iterations on those - I do firmly believe it would have been a #1 app development environment today. There would have been no need for Unity or even cross-platform frameworks like Flutter, etc...<p>But it is what it is - sorry, but anyone who thinks Flash dying was not primarily about Apple or even Google not wanting to keep their walled gardens for themselves is delusional. Adobe definitely has a good part of the blame for not recognising the potential and fighting for it some more.')
