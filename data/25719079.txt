Laying over a graph database on top of your filesystem  which is read-only typically.<p>This helps provide guarantees and also every application has its own hermetic sealed dependency closure.<p>Nix is truly revolutionary and it&#x27;s getting steady adoption. Give it a read if you don&#x27;t know about it. You can adopt it on any Linux distro without using the full NixOS.<p>I write a lot about it on my blog.')
