My prime objectives are for notes&#x2F;b9kmark keeping and photos&#x2F;media.<p>So far the setup was pretty easy on my VM but I kicked the tires with their VM image first.  And so far the Android app is doing mostly OK.  There is a lot to get into. And extensions out the wazoo.<p>I&#x27;ve not had to work with any community (yet) cause so far, it&#x27;s just work - or there is some config I need to tweak (docs are great!)<p>With their VM and docker images tho, super easy to kick tires.')
