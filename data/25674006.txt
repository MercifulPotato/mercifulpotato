Or put another way, because they theorise that white police are involved in an enormous, coast-to-coast conspiracy against black people.<p>Whether you agree with that belief or not (there was one forlorn WSJ article at the start of all that showing that the data doesn&#x27;t support it), it is objectively a conspiracy theory in the sense that it posits a conspiracy.
