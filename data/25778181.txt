Removing allowable commercial terms makes it significantly less &quot;open&quot; though, to that extent that many would argue it isn&#x27;t open at all, like the various &quot;shared source&quot; approaches commercial software uses.<p>Another interesting approach would be something like the GPL, which I don&#x27;t think is often used in hardware. Allow your competitors to use your design ... they just must contribute back improvements. Probably the incentives are wrong for this, but maybe not, it sorta seems like a bunch of the &quot;no-name&quot; chinese consumer goods operate like this. The produces are easy enough to reverse engineer that every just copies the basic idea and produces their own variants. This of course doesn&#x27;t keep the inventor in an advantaged position, but at least keeps them competitive.')
