Even including the value of paying off a mortgage vs. rent.<p>Tech jobs that pay more than $300,000 -- <i>maybe</i> $350,000 -- simply don&#x27;t exist in large quantities outside major job markets. And the ones that do aren&#x27;t the &quot;trusted senior individual contributor with plenty of freedom to choose your projects&quot; roles that exist in spades on the coasts.<p>Last time I job marketed in the midwest I couldn&#x27;t even break $250 <i>all-in</i>, the vesting schedule was pure bullshit, and that role would have included <i>a lot</i> of political BS. Basically moving from blissful respected individual contributor to stressed out disrespected middle management, and all for a massive cut in post-tax savings.<p>I get why jobs are exploding in those areas, but they aren&#x27;t the sorts of jobs I want.')
