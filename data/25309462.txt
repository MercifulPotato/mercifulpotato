I&#x27;ll never get that laugh out of my head.<p>Salieri was painted in quite a negative light in the film, though. He was actually a decent musician and a very good teacher. The portrayal as a bitter, envious composer was probably created just to provide a meaningful villain against Mozart in the film.')
