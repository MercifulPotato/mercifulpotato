In practise, govs are basically big robbery machines which are more interested in their own property and influence than me as a citizen (and as a human being in general).<p>For example it can be VERY tricky in most countries to move all your wealth crossborderly without any intervention or tax (even you if have paid all taxes from your profits) from the gov. That&#x27;s because even the most capitalistic countries don&#x27;t truly respect private property concept and consider individual&#x27;s property as their own.<p>Crypto partially solves this. You can move equivalent of billions of USD through the border in a minute for negligible cost. However, it won&#x27;t worth much if you still will be imprisoned for that. So, basically, potential anonymity and privacy researches in crypto as well as non-regulation are good things.<p>Because even democratic countries show themselves as pretty barbarian ones, when there is something against their interests (Julian Assange is a good fresh example).')
