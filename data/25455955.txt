Yes, Faraday cages work but, having tried it, my colleagues have attested that it&#x27;s much harder to homebrew a fully effective Faraday cage than the average HNer would think, at least in the frequency range we work in.<p>The types of mitigations described by the GP poster are also correct: see, for example, the description of issues for EMI shielding at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;celectronics.com&#x2F;training&#x2F;learning&#x2F;basics&#x2F;Noise-Propagation.md.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;celectronics.com&#x2F;training&#x2F;learning&#x2F;basics&#x2F;Noise-Prop...</a><p>&gt; &quot;<i>These imperfections are:<p>(1) openings<p>(2) conductors going in or out and<p>(3) finite thickness of the shield</i>&quot;')
