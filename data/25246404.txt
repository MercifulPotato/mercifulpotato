I was never comfortable discussing it with my manager.<p>2. Great advice on not bad mouthing others. Will keep it in mind. Actually I dont mind not getting a hike&#x2F;promo. But underserving ones getting is what I am upset about. My manager is very good and I heard he has been trying his best. But I got to know its the layer above him that plays the spoilsport. Apparently due to the perception. I dont market myself and have always been humble.<p>3. Till now I never thought about quitting. Now I am contemplating. Somehow I get a feeling that its the same no matter where you go. My other plan is to stay here, but dont work hard. Just do what is asked. But its difficult to implement since I always want to give my best.')
