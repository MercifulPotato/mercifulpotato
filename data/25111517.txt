If you&#x27;re moving close to the speed of light, stuff that isn&#x27;t is experiencing way more time than you. As light isn&#x27;t affected by time dilation it&#x27;s still traveling at the same speed but now has much longer to do so. So from your perspective the speed of light seems to be 190% not because it&#x27;s traveling faster than C but because it&#x27;s traveling more C seconds per your second when your time is dilated.<p>Edit: on further reading perhaps I haven&#x27;t even addressed your question...<p>If I had to hazard a guess I would say it&#x27;s to do with light having no mass. Once it&#x27;s emitted it&#x27;s no longer in your frame of reference so your supposed speed is irrelevant to it.')
