Manufactures will very rapidly start making changes if everyone did that.<p>You can just write the installation date with a Sharpie on the bulb, or keep track of them in a spreadsheet.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing it for a couple years now, and based on my data I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need to buy a bulb again. My bulbs last around 1,000 hours, not even remotely close to the promised 15,000 hours.<p>So I just return them and get new ones.')
