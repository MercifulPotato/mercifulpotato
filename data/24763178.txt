Item(by='DyslexicAtheist', descendants=None, kids=[24763962], score=None, time=1602574476, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24762449, text='In 2004 I lost my job because I was a specific MBTI type usually associated with &quot;entrepreneurial skill&quot;, &quot;thinking outside boxes&quot;, &quot;natural LeAderShIPP&quot;, and &quot;causing trouble&quot;, and because there were already 2 others with that MBTI in the team it was used as the justification to not extend my contract. The test was conducted by an external HR consultancy that pictured itself as an expert in MBTI and all things psychology.  (they should have just told me they don&#x27;t like my personality which would have been less of an insult and more honest)<p>So no doubt with a bit of marketing this nonsense can be sold into HR departments. The Karen&#x27;s and Kyle&#x27;s of this world will no doubt think it&#x27;s brilliant, buy it and feed their own biased decision making process.<p>MBTI&#x27;s are astrology for people who think they&#x27;re too smart for astrology. Both are total nonsense and dangerous in the hands of the wanna-be psychologist Karen&#x27;s usually in charge of HR. [0][1][3]<p>It&#x27;s all fun and games until people lose their jobs. Unlikely you will lose your job because you got the wrong MBTI, but when a company is downsizing and wants to pretend they&#x27;re using scIeNtiFfic measures to make that decision in the name of performance it&#x27;s likely they use garbage software like this to dress up their &quot;cultural fit&quot; bias.<p>I urge OP to put a big fat warning label on their product and market it as a way to educate people why MBTI&#x27;s are dangerous garbage and guide those that use it onto a path that helps them understand why it&#x27;s dangerous. Make it educational by showing the users where the problems are instead of claiming that this is in any way safe.<p>Also my MBTI is GTFO.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;spc3.12441" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;spc3.12441</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;7&#x2F;15&#x2F;5881947&#x2F;myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;7&#x2F;15&#x2F;5881947&#x2F;myers-briggs-personali...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nesslabs.com&#x2F;mbti" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nesslabs.com&#x2F;mbti</a>')
