Their arguments sound convincing to many, especially coupled with an angry-sounding orator like Jordan Peterson, who mostly just teaches emotional suppression (according to psychologist Gabor Mat√© [2]) while justifying today&#x27;s oppressive status quo.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;90269688&#x2F;high-tech-redlining-ai-is-quietly-upgrading-institutional-racism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;90269688&#x2F;high-tech-redlining-ai-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;adYJm_A2CSM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;adYJm_A2CSM</a>')
