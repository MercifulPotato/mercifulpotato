You had to buy pre-formatted diskettes from DEC.<p>And the only OS they supported was CP&#x2F;M. They did not support DOS on the Rainbow.<p>Ironically, IBM made the same mistake with the PS&#x2F;2 and a machine with proprietary parts that could not be copied like the parts of a traditional 8088&#x2F;8088 based PC.')
