I realize that this entire thread has become polarized, but if you would like to continue this conversation, my email address is in my profile. I can&#x27;t promise to agree with you, but I will treat you with the respect you&#x27;re due and try to better understand your point of view.<p>As for the comments about downvotes, call me naive, but I yearn for a world where we comment when we disagree but reserve up and downvotes for statements about the quality of a comment. I don&#x27;t agree with you, but I upvoted you because you made me think. Ultimately, that&#x27;s what I really look for from Hacker News. I don&#x27;t know everything, but I have my own unique experience. If I&#x27;m wrong, please correct me....:)<p>Incidentally, if you want to continue this engagement off site, let me tell you a bit about my perspective. I used to publish an indie magazine that ended up winning some awards. At one point, I was tasked with editing a submission by a high ranking gang member who wanted to write about why he doesn&#x27;t like the police and why his gang is a better choice for kids. I had to tell a story to make advertising dollars and it was a hell of a story. But our magazine ran contrary to a municipal bylaw so I had to somewhat tone it all down. It was complicated and to this day, I believe that I failed the story. Anyways, I think I bring a slightly different perspective (as do you) and I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you.')
