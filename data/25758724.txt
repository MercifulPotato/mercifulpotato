That&#x27;s small enough that one can realistically look up one in the dictionary by exhaustive search. That doesn&#x27;t work for English with a million words, and having no sort order is what I meant about no dictionary.<p>Any sort order for a picture of a duck and a picture of a house is going to be arbitrary. For English, one memorizes the (arbitrary) sort order of 26 letters, and then the rest requires no additional learning.<p>&gt; You can combine icons to form words.<p>Indeed, and that is a crucial step along the way from a picture language to a phonetic alphabet!<p>&gt; It also doesn&#x27;t prevent us from talking about actions in the future.<p>What picture represents tomorrow?<p>&gt; You get used to variation as the rule.<p>Apple will sue you if it looks anything like a trash can, not just a variation. Amusingly, many apps on the iphone use the word &quot;delete&quot;. The icon empire is showing cracks!')
