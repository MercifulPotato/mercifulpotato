Google controls +80% of search; it dominates desktop browsers with 70% market share; it effectively owns the most popular mobile operating system and +65% of mobile users use Google&#x27;s mobile browser; it also owns YouTube and Gmail, which tie neatly into the rest of its products and lead to even more market domination (they read your emails and sell that information to advertisers, etc.).<p>Google has done more to atrophy progress on the Internet than any other big tech company.  It has used its monopoly position on search and ads to crush competition.  Google has been &quot;evil&quot; for a very long time.')
