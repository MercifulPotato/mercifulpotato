Besides you will be Forced to use it with internet only.<p>So for now there is no better alternative to just using a web browser on your smart tv and typing address in manually.<p>...<p>Note that in future a feature to remember a previously connected device will be added, so you will have to type bafflying address in browser only once :)<p>Cheers')
