LyX was such a stress-free experience in comparison, you could simply sit down and write, knowing that it would almost certainly look good at the end. In comparison, my gf would spend stressful hours battling to keep graphs in the righ place, sections structured properly, and references all managed correctly.<p>It warms my heart to know that LyX is still going all these years later, even though I have no need of it nowadays.')
