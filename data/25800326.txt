I wouldn&#x27;t accuse you of implying that it would also apply to e.g. Date.now()<p>You don’t need to, I’ll gladly go on record saying Date.now() is not a function. It’s a subroutine. The clearest signal isn’t even its return value, it’s the fact that it takes no input.<p>&gt; [... everything else you said ...]<p>I don’t have a problem with the expressiveness of hooks, nor the general way they solve a problem by defining clear APIs for interacting with reactivity and state. I have a problem with the context in which they’re called, and the way they infect their context by changing the semantics to be sometimes else.<p>Hooks are something you instantiate and use in your component’s lifecycle. If it were that simple, you could call them in an outer function and return a component. But because you call them <i>while defining the component’s behavior</i>, your component is no longer semantically a function of props, it’s a constructor.<p>A better API would be hooks called in a component factory, returning components which use those hooks.')
