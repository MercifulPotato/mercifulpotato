Sure, nitrogen fixing crops are a thing; crop rotation, there&#x27;s a lot of ways we&#x27;ve figured out to get more crops grown in less land, and they all have limitations and tradeoffs, and they&#x27;re all a lot less efficient than just dropping some cheap fertiliser on it.<p>Second, no, small-scale agriculture should not blindly mimic industrial agriculture, but you also don&#x27;t get any advantages just by being small. Pests want to eat your crops no matter who you are. And yes, of course a backyard veggie garden needs fertiliser.<p>And third, dfferent consumers have different elasticities of demand. Hobbyists doing something for fun often have high elasticities of demand. I mean, obviously; if you were maximally sensitive to price, you&#x27;d be buying whatever is on sale at Costco already. :) A friend of mine makes her own cold process soap; they&#x27;re lovely and high quality, and she has a lot of fun doing it. Even ignoring her time, the cost per bar for her to make them is a couple orders of magnitude higher than store bought.  You think she&#x27;d stop - or even notice - if one ingredient went up a few cents?<p>Finally:<p>&gt; Bob the farmer has a much closer societal link to joe the fisherman.<p>I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine how that might be true. We&#x27;re talking about &quot;hey, what if everyone grew their own potatoes instead of buying them; would that help the planet&quot;. But I mean....I don&#x27;t know any fishermen. I don&#x27;t even eat fish. And even if I did plant some potatoes in my back yard, I&#x27;m not going to suddenly meet a fisherman. And even if I did, I don&#x27;t see why we&#x27;d assume they&#x27;re an environmental chemist. Seems like he&#x27;d probably be pretty busy fishing, maintaining his boat, and (now) growing potatoes, so why would he even know that the fertiliser we&#x27;re both putting on our potatoes is (eventually, in aggregate) harming the fish?<p>You seem to be envisioning a pleasant world, but none of it really meshes with my understanding of how <i>our</i> world works. But eh, I suppose my arguments sound equally unconvincing to you, so...')
