And to your first question - in the 90s when a friend and I had a custom PC business is Bulgaria, the mafia showed up at our business and started to negotiate a monthly insurance policy, we kicked them out. They didn&#x27;t show up again and didn&#x27;t do anything to our business... but, yeah, we were too small and too lucky. I&#x27;m sure if we had a lot more to lose, we&#x27;d have probably reacted differently. But I still recall them starting negotiations at 1,000 Deutsche Marks (the German currency before the Euro) per month down to 100 DEM and I still kept saying &quot;No.&quot; Fun times!')
