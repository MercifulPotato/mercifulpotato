People talk beforehand — this is reportedly why he didn&#x27;t pardon himself or his children – and especially now there&#x27;s no reason why a member of Congress or other national leader couldn&#x27;t speak against something like this. It practically writes itself — “Republicans support private property rights, thievery isn&#x27;t something we condone” – so if they want an easy way to show that Trump isn&#x27;t the party, all they have to do is start.<p>&gt; While he was in power, sure, Republicans politicians were politically savvy enough to side with him, knowing that the alternative was suicide.<p>It&#x27;s not that easy: some people were making a cold political calculation but we&#x27;re far enough down the Tea Party rabbit hole that there are members who earnestly believe what used to be fringe beliefs. I mean, think about how many right now are willing to unequivocally say that Biden legitimately won the election, which is almost the weakest sop to objective reality possible. That&#x27;s not going to reverse itself quickly, especially without a hard fight from everyone else still in the party. I know some people who are trying to pull the party back from the edge and I wish them success but the odds aren&#x27;t looking great.')
