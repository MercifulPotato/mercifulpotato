The author&#x27;s position is that all drugs, even very hard ones like heroin, can be used recreationally. The author is a professor of psychology, so I find this surprising and really irresponsible. Very few are able to use opiates recreationally. Even the weakest opioid, codeine causes serious addiction problems via codeine-promethaize cough syrup. The <i>extremely</i> high risk of developing dependence, extremely painful withdrawals, and the fact that prices are inflated due to being accessible only on the black market make it a recipe for destroying your life. This is ignoring the risk of picking up a felony conviction for having it on your person.<p>I think many drugs can be used recreationally, my instinct is to let people do what they want, and I wish our drug policy was more technocratic, but it&#x27;s really reckless to <i>recommend</i> people use certain substances.<p>This chart really drives home how dangerous heroin is.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;9&#x2F;9c&#x2F;Rational_scale_to_assess_the_harm_of_drugs_%28mean_physical_harm_and_mean_dependence%29.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;9&#x2F;9c&#x2F;Rational...</a>')
