That allows a user to rapidly collate a set of images based on some theme (so for example I use it for design&#x2F;illustration projects). Despite the UI, it works, and I can&#x27;t think of any other apps that do the same thing and have a better UI, so :shrug:.<p><i>However</i> I&#x27;d still agree with you 100% on its cancerous nature: it&#x27;s an <i>app</i> with a limited, specialised use (emphasis on app). That app leaking and pissing all over search results is not at all good and, as you say, contributes nothing for most people. By analogy, if I have some todos saved in a todo app, what would be gained (or more tellingly who would gain) by making my todos appear in public search results? Best answer I&#x27;ve got is simply that advertisers want that data, and want users on that app to advertise to (so, fuck you, users of search who were expecting useful search results).')
