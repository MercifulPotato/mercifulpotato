Item(by='rcxdude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603981715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24930221, text='I&#x27;m not sure about pokemon but for magic:the gathering, the oldest and most valuable cards have a fair amount of quirks which are hard to replicate, due to the different printing techniques (as well as some effects just due to the age). There&#x27;s still fakes but they mostly scam unaware buyers (and usually for lower value cards). People who just want to play the game will often buy professionally made &#x27;proxies&#x27; which are just as functional as the cards but don&#x27;t have collector value (and aren&#x27;t legal in events sanctioned by the designers, since it amounts to copyright&#x2F;trademark violation).')
