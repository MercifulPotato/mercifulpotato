Not only do they care about the mechanical systems, they care enough that they&#x27;ll make sure certain customer-invisible things (internal to engine, for example) or customer-subconscious things (in Mercedes&#x27; case how the hinge on the door works) are &quot;just right&quot;.  Kind of the equivalent of &quot;I&#x27;ll spin up another server when the load gets to X% just to have a good safety margin&quot; or &quot;this onboarding path could look like a dark pattern -- let&#x27;s work around that just in case&quot;.<p>The embedded software developers for engine control are serious. Among the mechanical engineers the folks writing control software for steering stability or performance-vs-efficiency code were treated with respect (&quot;I don&#x27;t understand what you do but sure, happy to explain this mechanical system&quot;).
