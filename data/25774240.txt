It&#x27;s their business and they can handle it however they want.<p>What you can do (and this is <i>exactly</i> what Kolmisoppi was suggesting) is build your platform to work without relying on other people&#x27;s business.<p>I&#x27;m happy that companies like Amazon don&#x27;t want to get associated with people who organized a failed coup. That should be the bare minimum. But there is no law which forces you to be hosted on Amazon if you want to be on the Internet. You can self-host. You can buy&#x2F;rent servers in another country, where what you are doing doesn&#x27;t have direct consequences which might lead people to want to get away from you. Use the blockchain, use torrent, develop your own P2P protocol. Those people just got locked out from the easy way, something they should have expected to happen (and plan for) since day one.')
