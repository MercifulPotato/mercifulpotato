I’m not sure how Google can run more.<p>But what I’m saying is that if there’s only a single ad and they are paying $3 because google set that limit, they could lower that to what the market will bear and start at .05 or something.<p>If they are worried about ad space they can limit to 1-2 ads and let people bid on them. They already do this as there’s not an infinite scroll of ads, they only show 1-3 and then more on the next page. Setting floors on ads doesn’t reduce the number of ads I see, it just makes more money for Google.<p>This is only possible as they are a monopoly.')
