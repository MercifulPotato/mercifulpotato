Is that accurate?<p>The utterly bonkers u-turn today was a bit of a shocker. For those that haven&#x27;t seen the news, the European Commission managed to say they were effectively going to establish border controls between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Which was a pretty big surprise to both the ROI and the UK. The first not being consulted on the decision, and the UK somehow being blamed for a contractual dispute between the EU and AstraZeneca. They&#x27;ve now backed out of this decision: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;29&#x2F;eu-controls-on-vaccine-exports-to-northern-ireland-trigger-diplomatic-row" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;29&#x2F;eu-controls-on...</a><p>Even if the UK was somehow being duplicitous here, and had somehow undermined the EU vaccine program, the EC&#x2F;EU has made themselves look like total amateurs by whining about it in public and trying to shift the blame and conflating the UK &amp; AstraZeneca. I think they really need to sit a bunch of the big names down together and actually plan their public strategy; Macron&#x27;s been out today going in a completely different direction but somehow also circling back to blame the UK and simultaneously claiming (falsely) that the Oxford vaccine has a less than 10% success rate in over 65s, which probably isn&#x27;t going to boost vaccine adoption: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;29&#x2F;emmanuel-macron-coronavirus-vaccine-exports-eu-controlled" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;29&#x2F;emmanuel-macro...</a><p>It has been an...odd day, as someone who is a very pro-EU, remain-voting, UK citizen. God knows we deserve plenty of blame as a nation but I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s altogether deserved this time.')
