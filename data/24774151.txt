I used to be a developer (in India), earned a decent salary, and at the end of 3 years I had something like 20k USD saved. If I spend 1k on an Iphone, that&#x27;s 5% of my entire life savings (though I&#x27;m pretty young) for a phone. So I end up spending 200$ for an Android phone that runs for maybe 3 years and dies. That being said, the 400$ Iphone SE sounds tempting :)<p>Even if I go beyond my comfort zone and pay $ I cannot really afford for an arguably better&#x2F;durable Iphone, the psychological anxiety that comes from &quot;I should be really careful with this phone because I cannot afford a new one&#x2F;repairs&quot; is something I would not be happy with.')
