We&#x27;re seeing big price increases here in Bend, Oregon and what seems like an influx of people from larger cities. Why live in a city if you can&#x27;t do city things?<p>Bend was already trendy though. I wonder if this effect will indeed spread out even further. There are a bunch of former logging&#x2F;ranching towns here in Oregon (and, indeed, throughout the west) that are not doing nearly so well. Roseburg, Pendleton, Baker City, Grants Pass come to mind. They have access to some nice outdoor spaces themselves. Will people start moving there, or will they constrain themselves to &#x27;the beaten path&#x27; of towns that their peer group considers a &#x27;nice place to live&#x27;?')
