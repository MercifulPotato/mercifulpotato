As you say, it doesn&#x27;t provide a whole lot of capabilities. However, there&#x27;s been a pretty competent ethernet driver available on Linux since Linux 3.9 released April 2013. There&#x27;s out of kernel NTRDMA if you want ibverbs like communication that will make really good use of the PCIe bus too.<p>In addition to mapped memory, there are some other modest capabilities: support for ringing the peer&#x27;s doorbell (one way), &amp; scratchpad configuration. There&#x27;s a pretty good 2016 presentation on NTB in Linux here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;events.static.linuxfound.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;events&#x2F;files&#x2F;slides&#x2F;Linux%20NTB_0.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;events.static.linuxfound.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;events&#x2F;files&#x2F;slid...</a><p>Interesting to note, Nvidia has docs for settings up NTB on their Pegasus &amp; Xavier systems: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nvidia.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;drive_os_5.1.6.1L&#x2F;nvvib_docs&#x2F;index.html#page&#x2F;DRIVE_OS_Linux_SDK_Development_Guide&#x2F;System%20Programming&#x2F;sys_components_non_transparent_bridging.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nvidia.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;drive_os_5.1.6.1L&#x2F;nvvib_docs&#x2F;i...</a><p>I for one think more people should be investigating &amp; harnessing the open-source Linux NTB tools. Switches are a bit expensive, but compared to ethernet switches their cost&#x2F;throughput is great. Alas, yes, the whole ecosystem is woefully undersupported, under-developed. Isn&#x27;t PCI part of the whole PC thing, this great revolution in computing that allowed interoperability to rise? Such a pity that all the PCI SIG&#x27;s seemed to fizzle out, that not a lot of people participated. Sure we got some SR-IOV but that feels like as far as we got.')
