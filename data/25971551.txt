Perhaps a more useful way to think about people&#x27;s relation to truth is one of proximity. For a given individual, their personal experience is entirely factual, and because it is also most proximate to them, it is weighted the most highly. Intuitively, I think we understand this, so we tend to weight other people&#x27;s experiences similarly, knowing that those are as proximate to them as our experiences are to us.')
