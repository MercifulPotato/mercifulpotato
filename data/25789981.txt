Item(by='kodah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610712746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25787759, text='I can understand why that may be thought to be that way, and maybe some folks are just exactly that way.<p>&gt; But what&#x27;s really obvious on this site is that many Americans cannot discuss other choices.<p>Many of us certainly can, however, America is often whalloped over the head for not being like other countries. In some threads this is made out peacefully, like here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25766884" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25766884</a><p>In others, America is widdled down to very reductionist arguments that Americans already debate endlessly. Things like, &quot;This is a very uniquely American point of view&quot; as if to eschew our problems like they don&#x27;t still deserve debate because <i>we</i> should be <i>just like everyone else</i>. An example is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25486350" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25486350</a> Of course, this can be pretty frustrating because America <i>isn&#x27;t</i> all the same, though I know it can be easy to perceive it that way. States in America are more like countries in the EU with respect to their homogeneity, or lack thereof. In some ways we have some overtones that are the same, but we&#x27;re all different. As dang pointed out, HN represents a lot of people from outside Silicon Valley too.<p>You seem to allude to this here:<p>&gt; Every &quot;by the way, in X we don&#x27;t have Y, we do Z&quot; on this site is a recipe for confrontation.<p>and I agree. Maybe this is people learning they <i>actually</i> are part of a more global community and how to respect one another while also fostering thoughtful, curious debate. I can tell you that I often wake up in the morning to read my threads from the night prior because I want to know what the global community, outside of America, has had to say. As I&#x27;m doing right now in fact. That&#x27;s to say, hearing your voice matters <i>at least</i> to me.<p>I&#x27;ll try to pay attention to what gets downvoted, and if that&#x27;s happening you&#x27;ll get my upvote.')
