But I guess this isn’t substantially different from how I work. The biggest difference is that I spend most of my time sending whatever speculative work to the compiler (TypeScript) or the test runner. Both of which are run in various forms of watch mode. When I worked in Clojure that’s pretty much how I worked then too. My flow now is almost entirely contained in VSCode, and the biggest change since I switched from Clojure is that I’ve embraced the IDE, static typing and a debugger.<p>I very rarely stray far from real TDD (red -&gt; green -&gt; refactor), and I very very rarely run whatever service I’m working on. The big exception is when I do (web) frontend work, which used to be my bread and butter but has been fairly limited for a few years.')
