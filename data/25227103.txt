What constitutes a &quot;traffic light&quot;? Just the bulb? The housing around it? Or the pole as well? What about the control unit? They won&#x27;t function as &quot;traffic lights&quot; without that. Remove the control box, and they become just dumb street furniture with no purpose.<p>Do they need to be on a road to be traffic lights? If I took the lights, the pole, and the control unit and installed it in a forest, would it still be &quot;traffic lights&quot;?')
