It&#x27;s always a trade-off. You can&#x27;t expect to have all the fancy effects that rely on multiple frames and also low latency.<p>If there was a simple software fix, GPU manufacturers would be all over it and pushing it to all engines. It&#x27;s in their interests to have the lowest latency possible to attract the more hard-core gamers (which then influence others).<p>Just look at all the industry cooperation that had to happen to implement adaptive sync. That goes all the way from game developers, engines, GPUs, monitors. Sure that sells more hardware(which brings other benefits), but a software-only approach would also allow companies to sell hardware, by virtue of their &quot;optimized&quot; drivers.')
