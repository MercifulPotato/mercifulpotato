Yes, it must be or it would not be premature.  But when a kid or new programmer posts on the internet about what is faster, or how to make a thing faster, why do we tell them this?  (Most programming communities, it is inevitable that they will be told this).   How do the commenters know whether the optimization is premature? Why are they worried about it, when the person is just learning&#x2F;curious?<p>Let them get good!')
