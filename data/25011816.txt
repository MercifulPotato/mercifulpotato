Trust on first use...<p>The &#x27;weak subjectivity&#x27; issue doesn&#x27;t just arise at the first use, it becomes a very important consideration in the event of a network fork (ie, a bad actor attacks the chain, and users attempt to defeat the attack by following a different chain that ignores the attacker). This is a much larger issue, it is easy to find consensus on a &#x27;genesis block&#x27;, but finding consensus in the moment of an uncertain&#x2F;contentious chain-split is very different. At best it falls back to trusting some centralized party to make the correct choice, and then having a large enough portion of the users follow them.')
