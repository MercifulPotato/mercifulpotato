I agree the selection isn&#x27;t large, but they&#x27;ll be bringing much more in 2021 and so far have been living up to that promise that past month or so. Looking forward to EA games being added along with more AAA titles that they promised.  They&#x27;ll also be adding Ubisoft+ support so you can play those games through Stadia.')
