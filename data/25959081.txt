Shorts are very risky for a whole bunch of reasons - which is also why they can be high value. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m sure every high risk fund can find at least one pensioner invested in them, but if your firm is well known for shorting then you can&#x27;t pretend to be anything but high risk&#x2F;high reward.')
