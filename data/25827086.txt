He thought the problem was choosing the most effective medicine when the real problem was decision fatigue looking at endless shelves of things that all seem to do the same thing. Those two problems sort of look the same, but the latter cannot be resolved by selling the tool to doctors in their offices.<p>The tool should have been designed (IMO) as a consumer tool, either a kiosk at CVS&#x2F;Walgreens&#x2F;pharmacies to assist with OTC med selection or possibly as a website with ads&#x2F;referrals. I would absolutely choose a pharmacy over another as a result of them having something to help through that process, especially when I have a headache.')
