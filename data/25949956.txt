In general, if person A puts $5K a year into a 401k between ages 25-35 and then stops, while person B puts in $5K a year between ages 35-65, at age 65 person A will have a larger retirement balance despite having put in only 1&#x2F;3 as much principal.  This generalizes to the rest of your net worth (salary+stock) as well.<p>If you win the lottery and manage to have significant equity in a startup worth millions, congratulations.  If not, you&#x27;re faced with the prospect of being older and having minimal (or at least far fewer) assets.  This is a big problem if you want to raise a family or even if you want to advance your status in life.<p>The economics of software are simply different.  Someone good enough to start a business that brings in $10-20K MRR and barely survive is almost certainly good enough to get hired and paid $200K+ by any number of companies.  If you&#x27;re not going big or going home, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to do a software startup these days.<p>Even in other industries, starting and running your own business is a LOT of work.  If your goal isn&#x27;t to (try to) get rich, you can almost always make more money climbing some corporate ladder for a lot fewer hours.')
