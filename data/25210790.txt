Yes, I could do a lot more work to support my case, to craft a more effective message. But this is immoral. It is highly destructive to user agency, to our ability to make extensions or to scrape pages. It is antitheical to freedom  of thought, to our human liberties. I find the summation of what it implies to be a gross gross regression of human potential. Knuckling under something which is special, which is better, which has extensions, &amp; making it become something pedestrian &amp; mundane &amp; inaccessible. It is gross, and to steal this power from the users would be immoral.')
