If FSD taxis are mostly rolled out in medium to big cities in the beginning, it&#x27;s still be a win.<p>Trying to boil the ocean all at once, and launching an enduser consumer FSD program that can handle wherever the driver takes it, may be the wrong way to do it, top-down instead of bottom up. Start with small geographic areas, and expand as you go.')
