Item(by='kumarvvr', descendants=None, kids=[25042345], score=None, time=1604974769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25034893, text='Their Apple TV+,or whatever its called, the competitor to Netflix, is underwhelming.<p>In India, it costs about 2 USD a month. It has tied up with various regional media houses to cater their content,but the catch is you have to pay them additional monthly charges, to access them through Apples service.<p>Their originals are quite few. For a company that has so deep pockets, one would have expected atleast a few months worth of shows to watch while their catalog is refreshed. Disappointing.<p>Apple Music, while good, is just one of the competitors. Amazon Prime music and Spotify and a few others, are equally good. Music content, in a world where streaming is fast becoming the norm, will eventually spread to all services. So eventually Apple Music becomes a commodity, competing only on price. Something Apple never does. And content exclusivity aint gonna work with the biggest names. Lady Gaga sure as hell wont agree to stream her songs exclusively on Apple.<p>The only strength is a large base and integration with existing services, but in that case too, the profit margins are not as great as hardware.')
