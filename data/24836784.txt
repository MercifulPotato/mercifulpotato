The official docs are pretty clear about what they measure, but they&#x27;re pretty dry and don&#x27;t make for good clickbait&#x2F;blog&#x2F;youtube stories <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;opub&#x2F;hom&#x2F;cps&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;cps.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;opub&#x2F;hom&#x2F;cps&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;cps.pdf</a>.
