Item(by='rpastuszak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603113082, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825442, text='&gt; It&#x27;s quite concerning that websites are able to do this.<p>They&#x27;ve been able to do this for a long time and for valid reasons (think of a PWA audio player, like a podcast app).<p>Unfortunately this used to get abused very often. I remember seeing bugs in ads that would: stop your Spotify playback (due to how audio apis work on phones), and continue playing in background (again, this is a feature, but often abused). iOS is much better in that regard, with stricter autoplay policies, etc...<p>What&#x27;s super concerning is that audio worked <i></i>even when the page was closed<i></i>. Once I kill the tab, the entire process should be killed too.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s just an FF bug purely because being able to play audio in BG is a valid feature BUT there should be no audio when the tab has been killed. My guess is that from the OS perspective, the tab is still running.<p>My another guess is that it has something to do with some clever techniques regarding reducing the app size.')
