Live entirely alone in a 1 bedroom apartment? A studio? Live with roommates? What do their meals look like?<p>A &quot;living wage&quot; means absolutely nothing unless you define the expectations.<p>When I first moved to San Francisco in 2011, I was living on less than $300&#x2F;month or so for 8 months or so. I slept on an air mattress and ate rice and beans prepared weekly from 25lb bags because it was cheaper that way. I spent less than a dollar a meal.<p>What expectations do we have that people learn to be frugal?
