Silver is answering the question: &quot;how much  would the polls (as an aggregate) need to differ from the final result in order for Candidate X to win&#x2F;lose, conditioned on some reasonable priors?&quot;<p>Taleb is pointing out that the polls could be really wrong in all sorts of ways that are impossible to predict a priori.<p>The whole argument is sort of pointless from an intellectual&#x2F;academic perspective. It&#x27;s a war of public personalities more than anything else.<p>It&#x27;s both the case that Silver designed a good piece of software that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and also the case that Taleb&#x27;s skepticism is valid. But then, that sort of skepticism of statistical models is always valid, and yet we use these models to great effect in all sorts of settings.')
