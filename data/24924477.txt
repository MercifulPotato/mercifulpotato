If you all you have is a timzeone, then you need an accurate historical tzdata <i>and</i> also you need to be sure that the system had accurate tzdata itself when it produced the timestamp.<p>Of course, if you&#x27;re storing the timestamp of a <i>future, planned</i> event, then yes, you need a timezone. But for historical records, store the UTC offset that was in effect when the event happened.')
