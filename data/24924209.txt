If I compare to my PS4 Pro, many games &quot;look&quot; better because they drive the UI at full native resolution while using checkerboard rendering to keep the framerate up. The same game on my 970GTX will chug, drop frames or have all the text and UI look blurry because I need to drop the resolution.<p>If DLSS 2.0 fixes this issue, it&#x27;s a massive improvement.')
