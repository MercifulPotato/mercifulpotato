Predictably (Intel is not an open fab business) this massively delayed Stratix-10.<p>At least AMD is fabless so there should be no such issue with Xilinx.<p>Both Altera and Xilinx sell premium devices in terms of cost. If you make a high volume product based on an FPGA and care about profit margin, you are better off with Lattice (assuming their devices are performant enough for your application).  It would be nice if any of these acquisitions made the FPGA prices more competitive, but I doubt it.')
