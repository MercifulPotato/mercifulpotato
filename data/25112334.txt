Item(by='bboygravity', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605538418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25112159, text='&gt; What, specifically, are those mechanisms that you think prevent symptoms but allow for infection and spreading?<p>Asymptomatic spreading. Kids do it with SARS-CoV2 all the time.<p>In other words: the body sheds virus (cells fabricate virions), but the immune system reaction doesn&#x27;t cause symptoms.<p>&gt; Additionally, even if this mechanism exists, why would we care?<p>Because the virus will keep spreading and killing people as long as &lt; 70% of people remain infectious.<p>In case the vaccine doesn&#x27;t prevent much of the spreading, we&#x27;d be looking at years before everything is like it was before the pandemic. This is because we&#x27;re not going to vaccinate 5 billion people in a matter of months all at once (too risky). This will take a while.<p>Additionally humans would be a reservoir for the virus to evolve in, potentially causing mutations that cause symptoms (years or decades in the future). It wouldn&#x27;t actually solve the problem in the long run.')
