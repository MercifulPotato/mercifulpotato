LDX and d-amphetamine were detected in blood following perfusion of the rat small intestine but not the colon&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;The intact prodrug, LDX, was readily absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration, with relatively high levels of LDX detected in the portal blood of rats. When LDX was perfused into isolated segments of rat duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, it was absorbed into the systemic circulation; however, LDX was not absorbed during perfusion into colonic segments. These findings indicate that absorption of LDX occurs via carrier-mediated transport in the small intestines and are consistent with the physicochemical properties of LDX (ie, high aqueous solubility of greater than 0.85 g&#x2F;mL within the physiologically relevant pH range of 1 to 812 and low lipophilicity [logPâ€“1.75, unpublished data]), which would predict poor passive diffusion across biologic membranes&quot;</i><p>But hey, here I am arguing on my weekend about why exactly putting a certain amphetamine prodrug up your ass won&#x27;t work. What are we doing with our lives?')
