For me Google tracking me is a reasonable trade-off for free youtube and email, I can always install a clean copy of Firefox and LineageOS if I want. I don&#x27;t generally do things online (or in person) that I&#x27;m worried about Google tracking.<p>I am worried about the government tracking me, because they have the ability to legally required me to be tracked, giving me no way of avoiding it if I ever have a need to do something privately. And the consequences of the government tracking me all the time are much higher, since they can put me in prison, or put me on some watchlist.')
