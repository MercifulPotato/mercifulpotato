Where are your extra 7-10 coming from?<p>And if you already have a database, you usually just upgrade its specs linearly too. And if god forbid you need to shard... that&#x27;s perfectly linear too.<p>For pretty much all practical planning purposes, servers <i>do</i> scale linearly. The equations you&#x27;re describing seem to imply a deeper hierarchy of server connections, but that&#x27;s not usually how it works -- servers (whether load balancers, web servers, or databases) just come in bigger pools, not trees.<p>Where are you getting your log() or sqrt() terms from? Is it some kind of application-specific caching layer or something you&#x27;ve used in the past?')
