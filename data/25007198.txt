In order to make renumbering <i>possible at all</i>, it needs to be done regularly. If the equipment didnâ€™t handle DHCP-PD regularly the code would rot and other devices and people would assume that address prefixes would never change. That, in turn, would cause lots of things to break when prefixes were forced to change (new ISP, merger, change in upstream architecture, etc).')
