Elastic made the software available under the Apache License. That gives AWS the right to offer this service.<p>Something being legal does not make it ethical,  many people see what AWS did, including profiting off the TradeMark of Elastic Search with zero compensation to the project is unethical<p>AWS is clearly in the wrong here,  I am surpised by the number of people that defend AWS,  this is why FOSS continues to struggle<p>AWS is a leech on Open Source,  like many other large companies.  I will be SHOCKED if AWS fork has any actual feature improvements, my guess is it will be a pure maintenance fork with security updates (maybe)')
