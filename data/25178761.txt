How do you deal with &quot;hateful&quot; user-generated content?  Hate is now politics.  How do you deal with employees expressing thier opinions at work?  Basic fashion is now politics (masks).  Which health care plan do you adopt?  There are right and left-wing plans (birth control etc).  The holidays are comming.  Do your employees say &quot;merry christmas&quot; or &quot;happy holidays&quot;?  Dont think you can avoid that one.  Letting them pick is still taking sides.  What is your policy on weapons?  Can guns be sold&#x2F;discussed on your platform?  Then politics comes knocking on the door directly.  To which parties or candidates will you donate?  Will you create special rules for well-connected users? (Facebook).  Will you turn off a politician&#x27;s account when it violates your rules? (Twitter).  Will you accept a political party as a customer?  What if they insist you then turn away a different party?<p>Politics cannot be avoided.  It is part of the US tech landscape.  The only option is to plan and engage thoughtfully.')
