Plus I like the fact that Postgraphile leverages the database as much as possible, whilst Hasura implements things that could be done by the database. It&#x27;s also much easier to extend Postgraphile, you just use Postgraphile as a library in your nodejs project and add as needed, allowing you to run entirely from one codebase. With Hasura you have to use schema stitching to extend its functionality, meaning you have to keep 2 pieces running instead of 1. When it comes to developer experience, Postgraphile is rather bare in its default form, you definitely want to add a bunch of plugins to make the resulting GraphQL side as powerful as you need it to be. Hasura is much more of a blackbox, you set it up and what you see is what you get. Postgraphile is much easier to mold into exactly what you want.<p>In the end they are projects with semi-same goals but different approaches. I went with Postgraphile and I haven&#x27;t regretted it one bit, but no reason you can&#x27;t try both, they are easy to set up and get a lay of the land.')
