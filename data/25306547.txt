That it&#x27;ll write software in a few years (he&#x27;s from the applied math field). He also glossed over many on going problems with Deep Learning.<p>We&#x27;re in healthcare industry and this guy is pushing Theranos like level of snake oil.<p>The people that don&#x27;t know a lick about ML or Statistic or both rely on these people.
