For any car company that already makes a manual transmission car it would be easy to do.  They might change the design a little (maybe 3 speeds instead of 5, and use sturdier gears and different ratios).  Clearly you don&#x27;t need a transmission in an EV, and leaving it out is simpler and less maintenance, but still... if it can be done and it makes for a (in some ways) better or more fun car, then it&#x27;s a shame no one is doing it yet.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on converting a Mazda RX-8 to electric, keeping the transmission and clutch.  It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what it&#x27;s like to drive.  IIRC, the motor (Netgain Hyper-9 144 volt dual-ended version) has a max RPM of 8000, which is close to the 9000 rpm redline of the rotary it replaces.  The motor is a lot less powerful than what you&#x27;d find in a typical Tesla (which I attribute mostly to it being designed to run at a lower voltage), but having a gearshift should make up for at least some of the difference.')
