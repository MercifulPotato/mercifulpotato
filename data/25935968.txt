Item(by='throw0101a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611792044, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928305, text='&gt; <i>So what does the price mean at this point?</i><p>What does the price of <i>anything</i> mean?<p>Why is a Audi &quot;worth&quot; $60K but a VW &quot;worth&quot; $30K? A Porsche &quot;worth&quot; over $100K? Why is a Patek Philippe or A. Lange &amp; Söhne Tourbillon watch worth $100K? Why should I pay $300 for one All-Clad pan when for the same price I can get a 10-piece set at Costco?<p>Surely you have things that you think are worth paying more for while for others you wouldn&#x27;t spend more than some &#x27;basic&#x27; amount.<p>People perceive things as being of different quality.<p>It&#x27;s not that <i>everyone</i> (!) thinks that GameStop (GME) is &quot;worth&quot; over $300 a share, it&#x27;s just that the folks at the hedge funds <i>are willing to pay</i> over $300 for each share because they have <i>contractual obligations</i> to fulfill, and if they do not they (a) <i>may be sued for a lot of money</i> and&#x2F;or (b) go to jail.<p>So each share of GameStop is &quot;worth&quot; this much to the hedge funds because it gets them out of paying the consequences of (a) and (b). Paying $300&#x2F;share may be &quot;cheap&quot; compared to paying those consequences.<p>And to go back to my first paragraph: a Porsche is not &quot;worth&quot; $100K to me—because I&#x27;m not willing to pay for it, or even for an Audi. But it may be &quot;worth&quot; it to someone else because they <i>are</i> willing to pay for it.')
