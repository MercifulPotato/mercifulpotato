So for example if you start with 1, and keep dividing by 2, in base 10 you get\n1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.03125, etc.\nIn base 8,\n1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.04, 0.02, 0.01, 0.004, etc. Much simpler.<p>Obviously multiplying and dividing by 5 and 10 are more natural in a base 10 system, but dividing things in halves, quarters, etc. (or multiplying by powers of two) are a much more common operation. (We only think of 10s as round numbers because of the base-10 decimal system.)<p>12 is useful in that it has so many different factors, but it misses all the benefits of being a power of 2, so I feel 8 is superior.  Hexadecimal also has benefits, but my feeling is that 16 symbols would be too many for everyday use. Difficult to count on fingers and such. 8 really seems ideal to me. In fact, I&#x27;ve mused in the past that it&#x27;s kind of a shame - you can imagine a world where people ignored their thumbs when finger counting and just lucked into a base-8 system thousands of years ago. (Although of course in that case we wouldn&#x27;t call it base-8, it&#x27;d be base-10!)')
