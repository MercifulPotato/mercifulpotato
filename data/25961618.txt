The sheer amount of interest in new retail investors (who robinhood specifically targets as their demographic) wanting to buy GME and then not being able to is a real use-case the app was broken for. If Uber suddenly surged in user growth 2x and started crashing &#x2F; rides failed for users, would you remove their 1 star reviews? I would argue you should not, because the experience they delivered some user was broken. The technical reason is immaterial.<p>Robinhood had 13 million users as of 2020, and Motherboard was reporting that more than half of all robinhood users held GME this week. 100k reviews in a day seems quite likely if the real values are even half these numbers. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;motherboard&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354798244455395328" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;motherboard&#x2F;status&#x2F;13547982444553...</a>')
