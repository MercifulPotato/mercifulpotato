I tried using `set wildmenu` for a while but I found it difficult to use compared with my denite leader+r using rg.<p>Other than that I have four Tim Pope plugins (vinegar, fugitive, surround, and commentary). Fugitive I could live without as I rarely use it but I could not live without surround - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s my most useful plugin and doing the same in Vim was awkward.')
