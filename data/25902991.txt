Some may prefer the taste of cheaper wines, but most would prefer the expensive taste. Take for example a Lambrusco: it&#x27;s an inherently &quot;cheap&quot; wine type, despite being DOC, largely due to being young and made from high-yield grapes. But it also has a very specific flavour that would never be associated with expensive wines. But it&#x27;s not &quot;worse&quot;; it has it&#x27;s place and people much prefer Lambrusco in certain contexts.')
