The business isn&#x27;t large enough to focus on details, yet. In the future, when fixing bugs takes more time than making features, you should have the money to hire more hands and focus more on testing. If you don&#x27;t, then you built too much product for too little clients which is a problem in and of itself ;-)<p>The cost&#x2F;benefit isn&#x27;t there in the beginning. All the bugs are either obvious, easy to find, or quickly discovered without a test suite. So save the time writing tests to stamp out more features the customer wants!')
