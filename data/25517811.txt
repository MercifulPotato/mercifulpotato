The majority of the time, I just don&#x27;t get a notification. It&#x27;s intermittent, so it&#x27;s not that something is turned off. I definitely don&#x27;t have the issue with other comms apps.<p>That being said, telegram is probably my preferred app - and sometimes I actually use the broken notifications as a positive (the message isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> important).')
