Most purchases are now happening online, subscription based services are on rise and consumer buying habit is changing as well.<p>I like Stripe and I use Stripe for my business. What I don&#x27;t like about Stripe is they stepping on toes of their customers. Stripe starts with API service and later they introduce their product competing with early adopters. A good example is Stripe Billing [0]. Additionally, they position their products top on their partners page, therefore making it &quot;popular&quot;. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see Stripe launching their own virtual bank product.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;billing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;billing</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;partners&#x2F;apps-and-extensions&#x2F;collection&#x2F;recurring-payments" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;partners&#x2F;apps-and-extensions&#x2F;collection&#x2F;r...</a>')
