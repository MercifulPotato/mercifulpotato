Totally anecdotal here, but here are my thoughts:<p>As I get older, I see less value in friendships, mostly because I realize that many of my friendships didn&#x27;t serve me and added a lot of stress to my life (and distracted from time that could have been spent on career &#x2F; legacy). Meanwhile, time invested in my personal life, hobbies, and career pays off in spades - spending a few months getting better at algorithms helped me double my wages with my next job jump. It is interesting how social we are with friends at a young age, then most decide on a constant - but low - amount of time spent with friends.')
