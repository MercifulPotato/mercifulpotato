If all existing hunter gatherers which hunt big game across the globe are like this, and if that applies irrespective of their level of contact with the larger global culture, that points to the cultural trait having ancient origins, from before when the ancestors of today&#x27;s humans diverged, or the trait being so in tune with basic human physiology that it consistently re-emerges across human populations when they adopt hunter gatherer lifestyles.<p>Either one would predict that prehistoric hunter gatherer groups had a similar division of labor across genders.')
