It exports an HSSI bus, whatever that is[1].<p>The thing is, I don&#x27;t think AMD is going to have much of an advantage. Back when AMD64 was becoming a thing, a long time ago, there was a lot of excitement around HyperTransport (HTX), around an inter-processor bus that people could make interesting accelerators out of &amp; connect fpgas with. It never... really went anywhere. It&#x27;s still supposedly quite prevalent as the basis for AMD&#x27;s modern Infinity Fabric, but AMD seems to have no interest, no energy to make Infinity Fabric or HyperTransport interesting to the world, anything beyond an implementation detail.<p>If AMD does want to start integrating FPGAs, they either need to go back 17 years &amp; start pushing Infinity Fabric &#x2F; HyperTransport, or they need some other plan to make the fpga useful. Perhaps CXL or CCIX or GenZ or just like they do now gobs of pcie is enough, is how an fpga can mesh with core complexes &amp; peripherals, but wow AMD would be in a much better place to start integrating FPGAs if HTX has kept up steam.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;12773&#x2F;intel-shows-xeon-scalable-gold-6138p-with-integrated-fpga-shipping-to-vendors" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;12773&#x2F;intel-shows-xeon-scalab...</a>')
