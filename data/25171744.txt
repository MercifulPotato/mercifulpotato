I purchased Pro about 45 minutes after getting the recommendation and checking it out. This should let me get out of my back log hole in a week or two, and stay out of it. I&#x27;ve been stressing out for weeks that I&#x27;ve been unfocussed... I&#x27;m not sure the <i>feeling</i> will go away, but the unproductive side effects can be minimized. This isn&#x27;t just a productivity boost for me, it&#x27;s a mental health boost. Feel free to use that as a quote wherever you care to.<p>Micromanager looks interesting, though the advanced features of Cold Turkey Pro kind of let me do the same thing. But stripping off bits of features into less expensive stand alone apps seems a good idea for people that have specific needs instead of my more systemic attention issues at the moment... homeschooling kids while WFH is hard, switching back &amp; forth without letting more distractions side track me is harder than I&#x27;d anticipated.<p>And if you had something for phones that did this, I&#x27;d buy that too... for now I&#x27;m just leaving my phone in another room. Low-tech &amp; free!')
