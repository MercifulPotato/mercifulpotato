We turned a basic understanding of chemistry into an understanding of subatomic particles, and the ability to create entirely new elements.<p>We did all of this through a process of open and skeptical inquiry, which has been remarkably consistent in its ability to tear down unsupportable theories. The reason the Kuhnian critique exists is not because the scientific process failed, it&#x27;s because the process <i>worked</i> but just took longer than people expected it to because people are human and imperfect. And the speed of scientific advances over the past decades has been higher than at any point in human existence.<p>The reason the term &quot;scientific consensus&quot; exists is because most fields are vastly too complex for a single human being to be able to evaluate the totality of the evidence by themselves, at least in a reliable way. So the process is necessarily decentralized and broken up among many experts, who share their opinions. This isn&#x27;t some popularity contest that you should ignore, it&#x27;s a critically necessary task that has to be performed in order to digest the research contributions of any field, and make progress on solving open problems.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right to point out that consensus evaluation can malfunction sometimes. You&#x27;d be equally right to point out that sometimes experimenters produce invalid results. You&#x27;re wrong that the answer to the former is to reflexively ignore the scientific consensus process, just as you&#x27;d be wrong to say that &quot;don&#x27;t do experiments anymore&quot; is the correct response to a few experimental errors.')
