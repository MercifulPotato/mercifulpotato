Just today a teacher from Fremont wrote in with a heart breaking email about how much a difference a 2015 Mac Pro made to his day and how better his online teaching is because of it. Got through around 200 devices in total including some iPads.<p>During my adventures distributing &#x2F; collecting these laptops, I caught COVID - no good deed goes un-punished. I&#x27;m pretty sure there are at least 5k more Mac&#x27;s sitting in companies IT closets from where they renewed equipment for employees but couldn&#x27;t throw away the 3 thousand dollar device they bought 3 years prior - donating these is a tax break as well so the companies would be best to dispose of them than keep them around.')
