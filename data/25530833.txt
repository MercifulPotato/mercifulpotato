Sure, in some filter bubbles, AMD has won and the remaining share is eaten by ARM, but take a look at the bigger picture:<p>If you&#x27;re buying a server, Ryzen&#x2F;EPIC-Servers are just appearing right now. The dell server line-up [0] is still mostly Intel-Servers, with one novelty AMD server per category. I bought a laptop this summer and most offerings - by far! - are Intel, especially in the ultrabook category. In the gaming scene, AMD has its fans, but raw single-core performance is still important and quite a few people still choose Intel. Lastly, your average consumer really doesn&#x27;t even know the difference. ARM could be a threat, but the low adoption of Windows ARM and ARM servers shows that this yet to realize.<p>Additionally, the recent publicity stunts from Intel also clearly show that they see the upcoming threat and are reacting to it. And even if they don&#x27;t, long lasting contracts and sheer inertia will keep them above the water for quite a few years to come.<p>In summary, yes, Intel is not in a great position, but it is far from dead. And if you&#x27;re attempting to short it now, there&#x27;s a good chance Intel will stay liquid for longer than you.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dell.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;work&#x2F;shop&#x2F;poweredge-rack-servers&#x2F;sf&#x2F;poweredge-rack-servers?~ck=bt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dell.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;work&#x2F;shop&#x2F;poweredge-rack-servers&#x2F;...</a>')
