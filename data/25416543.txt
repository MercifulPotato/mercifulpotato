Sometimes having an abstraction can reduce cognitive load. Think of the configure vs convention arguments for frameworks. Knowing how to implement simple functionality the “right way” (within the paradigm of that abstraction) can make building software easier especially when collaborating with others.<p>I personally find consistency more valuable than having the perfect level of abstraction. Consistency, even if slightly more or less verbose than I might otherwise choose, means I spend less time thinking about the abstraction itself. It allows me to focus on the problem domain, which is where customer value exists. It has the added benefit of simplifying collaboration with others who are also familiar with the abstraction.')
