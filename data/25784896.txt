It&#x27;s anonymous in that the caller and operator don&#x27;t see each other&#x27;s numbers.<p>The original project was based on Rails 3 and Ruby 2.2; I&#x27;ve updated it to modern versions of both, and updated Bootstrap from 2 to 5. Currently working on adding a number of features including call logging, categorization, tagging, reporting, operator &quot;teams&quot; and more.<p>Progress has been slow around the holidays but I&#x27;m picking it back up!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chrisgaraffa&#x2F;pockethotline&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chrisgaraffa&#x2F;pockethotline&#x2F;</a>')
