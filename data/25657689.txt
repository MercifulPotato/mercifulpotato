You&#x27;ll never see a film critical of China made domestically. Our studios want access to the Chinese market and they know that if they produce such a film, they&#x27;ll be blacklisted.<p>This is why we need top-down decoupling. China knows we&#x27;re addicted, and they&#x27;ve got us in a good spot to continue growing off of our market.')
