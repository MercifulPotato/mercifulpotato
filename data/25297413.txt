Those traits would come at a price, and different comunnities (and their package managers) would make different tradeoffs due to their different priorities. Python has a very involved history dealing with platform-native stuff, and provide a lot of convinience aroud specifying, providing, and obtaining those native stuff. But the complexity would leak into platform-agnostic packages, and gives an impression that packaging is worse when “all you want” is some .py scripts. JavaScript provides a much better interface for packaging and installation, but the expense is that native modules are much more difficult to package, and tend to fail spectacularly on installation when something does not work out. Many more things are like this from each side.<p>There are a lot of smart people working on these things in each ecosystem, and when you think some package manager is far surperior over others in every way, you are more than often simply wrong. Or saying it the other way (and paraphrasing a commenter from another thread), the only package manager you think is good is from the ecosystem you are not deeply familiar with.')
