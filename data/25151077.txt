Stay tuned - it&#x27;ll be released very soon but you can try it now in beta.<p>First of all, congrats on the launch! I do really like the aesthetics of the website, and the overall approach. It resonates with our vision and philosophy!<p>Good feedback on experiments feeling heavyweight! We&#x27;ve been focused on doing great foundation to manage data and pipelines in the previous DVC versions and were aware about this problem   (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iterative&#x2F;dvc&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2799" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iterative&#x2F;dvc&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2799</a>). As I mentioned - Experiments feature is already there in beta testing. It means that users don&#x27;t have to do commits anymore until they are ready, still can share experiments (it&#x27;s a long topic and we&#x27;ll write a blog post at some point since I really excited about the way it&#x27;ll be implemented using custom Git refs), support for DL workflow (auto-checkpoints), and more. Would love to discuss and share any details, it would be great to compare the approaches.')
