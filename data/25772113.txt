That&#x27;s like saying they&#x27;re disliked for their style of dress (suits were as much a symbol of the detached elite as hoodies are today!). It&#x27;s their money and their influence on the wider culture by way of spending. It&#x27;s practically guaranteed to create resentment regardless of what the preferences are simply because it is inevitably <i>a force</i> being exerted on people&#x27;s lives.<p>Then of course there are the actual harmful effects of social media on human beings as distinguished from supposed communist infiltration. That generates plenty of resentment as well.<p>Then there&#x27;s the fact that in many cases tech companies make products that are ultimately used by employers to track and control their employees (&quot;business intelligence&quot;) and which serve as opaque arbiters of things like paychecks, time clocks and tax forms. This isn&#x27;t Google, of course, but tech companies serve as a mascot for the digital revolution at large, hence the mythology surrounding Bill Gates. Many if not most of the annoyances of computerization get blamed on the tech industry, fairly or not.')
