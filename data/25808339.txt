At the basic level you can reply &quot;&#x27;Sall right, how _you_ doin&#x27;?&quot; You&#x27;ve caught the ball and tossed it back. Even if you are walking in different directions down the hall this will work... or even looking up and saying &quot;hey&quot; is acknowledging the ball in the air. In an &quot;office&quot; this probably would work fine, but I have always been either self-employed or worked in small businesses. So I don&#x27;t know if this would work on the 24th floor.<p>In day to day life... I imagine the person at the check out counter has a repetitive job that can be quite dreary if all they are doing is punching buttons all day without any engagement... asking the same questions: &quot;Did you find everything?&quot; &quot;Do you have any coupons?&quot; &quot;How are you doing today?&quot; So when I can I try to catch the ball, paint it a different color and toss it back. It&#x27;s a two part process\nHow are you doing?\n#1 catch the ball:\n&quot;I made it this far, I&#x27;m gonna keep going.&quot;\n#2 toss it back:\n&quot;How are you keeping up?&quot;<p>You can have dozens of responses for for each part... mix &amp; match... Silliness can get you bonus points. It&#x27;s just a game. You will discover ways in which a few words can make it so that you&#x27;re having a bit more fun, the checkout person (or server, or phone support person, or...) can also get a few giggles while grinding through their, perhaps  miserable, job... hey, everybody wins.')
