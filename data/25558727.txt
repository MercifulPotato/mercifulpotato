Item(by='wegs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609159067, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25558435, text='&gt; But if you&#x27;re going to draw a boundary and wrap it in a massive array of microphones... Aren&#x27;t you better off just adding insulation material? :-)<p>Well, let&#x27;s do the math here. I can&#x27;t find the data sheet for the weight of an electret microphone cartridge, but let&#x27;s assume 4 grams. A thousand microphones -- assuming we want 100 the length of the airplane and 10 around -- is around 4 kilos. Add another 2 kilos for computation, and a few more for wiring, and you&#x27;ve added the weight of a piece of luggage.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say you want to add 2 inches of mineral wool sound insulation. I&#x27;m assuming 100 meters x 10 meter circumference (I have no idea, but the numbers scale the same). You&#x27;ve added (quite literally) half a metric ton to your airplane. And made it 2&quot; thicker, either reducing cabin space or increasing drag.<p>Plus, sound insulation does very little for low frequencies, which is the majority of airplane noise.')
