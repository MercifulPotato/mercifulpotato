One do-everything car (short and long trips without pre-planning)<p>2. Living in an apartment so no overnight charging.<p>Even with 200mi range, you have to ensure there are chargers en route because they are still sparse and it still takes a long time to charge the car. Gas vehicles still win because in most places, you can expect a gas station within 50 miles and the time penalty is 5 mins vs hours.<p>Sparse city charging infrastructure also mean makes charging much harder.<p>We&#x27;re getting better but imo electric cars in the US at least are still limited to wealthier folks with houses that have charging stations and some city dwellers in nice apartment complexes. I hope we see a good sub 30k electric car soon to shake things up.')
