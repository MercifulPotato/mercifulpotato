I&#x27;m trying to do something similar for VR, for live system diagrams- ie parse all the config files for the large company I work for, generate tron-like buildings for the systems by size of compute&#x2F;memory, and then connect all the dataflows together like pipes. Super hard though!<p>EDIT: My goal is more for real time dataflow visualization, especially understanding how large systems work, and replaying data in outages to see how cascading failures work.')
