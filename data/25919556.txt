It was a great success, thanks also to this crowd.<p>Today we launched Solo v2: a new security key that you can use to protect your Google, Twitter, Github account with the strongest two-factor authentication.<p>Solo is special because it&#x27;s open source. Solo v2 is much more robust, water resistant, has stronger NFC &amp; reversible usb plug. The micro is a NXP LPC55S6x with extra security features and firmware was rewritten in Rust.<p>Join our campaign and support open source &amp; open hardware! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solokeys.com&#x2F;v2')
