A small town in one of those states is not that much different than one in a different state.<p>But if you want to live in Chicago or the Chicago suburbs, moving to Milwaukee, Madison, or Indianapolis is not the same. Those cities are smaller and won&#x27;t have the same job opportunities. You also have a major airport in O&#x27;hare which allows for easy travel, while airports in WI and IN are smaller with fewer direct flights.<p>Plus IL has Northwestern and the University of Illinois, which are top tier research universities supplying a lot of jobs. UW-Madison is also a good school, but not in the same league and the past governor in the WI was not good for their university system.<p>You can also take a look at how WI and IA handle the COVID situation and it tells you a little about the state governments in those states.')
