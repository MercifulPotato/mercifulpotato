President Trump exercised all avenues to prove himself the winner, deprived via fraud. They went through public courts and public scrutiny. His own prior commission on voter fraud disbanded without significant findings of similar levels of fraud he alleged occured during 2016.<p>What public process would you propose when private investigators, the courts, and an administration eager to prove its claims of fraud did not find anything worthwhile? When the head of the department of justice and a strong Trump supporter said claims of fraud on any relevant scale were BS?<p>At some point the demand for a &quot;public process&quot; begins looking like paranoia, when every failure to find anything significant is used to bolster the claim &quot;that just means it&#x27;s <i>really</i> well hidden&quot;.<p>When you&#x27;re using the <i>lack</i> of evidence as justification for your claim, no public process will ever satisfy you if it doesn&#x27;t confirm your assumption.')
