I freelanced for several years on different platforms and I would see the same issues.<p>1. no vetting -&gt; race to the bottom and clients who think $17 &#x2F;hr is an appropriate salary for a senior engineer<p>2. vetting -&gt; great at first. clients are coming in but over time the new jobs go to new people coming in at lower salaries. My previous clients and success on the platform never seems to make a difference getting new work. In the end I&#x27;m stuck charging $50-55 at best.<p>In the end, I found a colleague who didn&#x27;t want to write software so much anymore and preferred networking. He&#x27;d hook me up clients for 10% and that worked great for me. The last one he referred to me became business partners and I&#x27;m CTO of our startup.<p>That said. Instead of vague promises about solving freelancing. how about a few explicit problems that you guys have solved that demonstrate that this isn&#x27;t just more marketing.')
