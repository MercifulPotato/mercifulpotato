I&#x27;m simply trying to understand and explain, if only to myself, to better calibrate expectations.<p>I do not criticize or defend Amazon&#x27;s parasitic relationship with FOSS. Frankly, I don&#x27;t yet see how it can be any other way. I just merely acknowledge the plain truth. And that Amazon is better at this than the other belligerents.<p>While I&#x27;m a very happy Amazon Prime customer, I&#x27;d never be an employee or otherwise do business with Amazon. I just feel like there&#x27;s no way for me to benefit proportionally. Per the parable of the lion&#x27;s share.<p>&gt; <i>...the wrong assumptions how to make money out of MIT&#x2F;BSD style licenses.</i><p>Go on.<p>I&#x27;m hoping someone, anyone will discuss Peter Hintjens&#x27; (ZeroMQ) advice.<p>I have three projects in my back pocket. Once seen, their secret sauce is trivially reproduced. I can think of no way to publish them as anything other than FOSS. Not even as a service. Nor can I figure out how to pay rent working on them.<p>Which is a pity. These three tools are pretty neat.')
