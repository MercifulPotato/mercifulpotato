In many of the issues, the current state is &quot;it&#x27;s a problem with Gitea&quot; such as: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;Codeberg&#x2F;Community&#x2F;issues&#x2F;356" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;Codeberg&#x2F;Community&#x2F;issues&#x2F;356</a><p>HN readers are downvoting you, but Gitea&#x27;s problems are real and they exist. Enough of them are listed in codeberg&#x27;s issue pages that I felt the software&#x2F;platform is very buggy and has a lot of security issues as just a generic user with one week of experience, much less an admin.')
