It was driving me insane.<p>When I came back, I installed an extension to get rid of the trending section and some other garbage on there. It&#x27;s been so much nicer since then (Retweets can still be problematic, but I don&#x27;t want to block them entirely because I use Twitter as a way to follow artists that were forced to flee Tumblr. Retweets are how those artists share art from others that they like)<p>In the time that I was off Twitter, I didn&#x27;t fully disengage from the news. I checked Apple News+ to stay up-to-date, but that was only once or twice a day instead of dozens.')
