I can&#x27;t read the research paper now.<p>My guess is that there is a temperature difference between the grapheme and the resistor. In that case it&#x27;s a normal experiment, perhaps with some tweak, but not a groundbreaking experiment. The power generated by the device is tiny (not &quot;unlimited&quot;), and there are a lot of similar devices.<p>Sometimes the experiment is interesting in some niche (this experiment is related to tunnel microscopy) but this is totally overhyped.')
