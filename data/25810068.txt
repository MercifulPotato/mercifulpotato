It&#x27;s like.....no one is forcing you to use these extra ports? But it&#x27;s very nice to have them and some people will need them. If it doesn&#x27;t increase the weight or thickness of the device(and it definitely doesn&#x27;t to add another USB-C to the 12&quot; MacBook) then I don&#x27;t understand why some people literally treat it like some betrayal of what the device is.')
