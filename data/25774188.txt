The compilation is done on Microsoft servers. It&#x27;s understandable that neither side is looking to have Windows sandboxes to execute arbitrary code in.<p>(Disclaimer: At least that&#x27;s how it worked when Matt introduced the MSVC compilers. Not sure if things are substantially different by now.)')
