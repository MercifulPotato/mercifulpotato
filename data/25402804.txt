[1] It&#x27;s mathematically always going to lead to a stagnant two party system.<p>When people are forced to vote against someone they don&#x27;t want in office, representatives have no incentive to be anything other than &quot;not #otherside&quot;.<p>There is also no longer a reason to have voting in primaries at different times for different states. Having it setup this way means the results are influenced by various special interests (and not just through the media).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo</a><p>Sorry if this comment was to political in nature for HN.')
