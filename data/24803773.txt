This very story is about how Joe Biden is being protected by those tech giants.  Those tech giants also are the ones protecting leftist movements like Antifa and the Democratic Socialists of America.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s a part of the left outside of the USA that still stands up for free speech?  Not here in the USA.  That game is over.  Except for a few voices in the wilderness like Brett Weinstein and Sam Harris, the left is comprised of those whose interests and actions now align with the tech giants.')
