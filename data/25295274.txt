If you sold exactly $1M and were taxed at 15%, Apple takes $150K and you make $850K. Under an increased rate of 30%, that means you would lose money if you made less than approximately $1.25M in the year after, but the odds of someone with $1M in revenue failing to get to $1.25M by next year is very unlikely.')
