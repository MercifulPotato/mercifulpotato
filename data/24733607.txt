My team members used to have both conservatives, liberals, and libertarians. We used to discuss all kinds of politics in a really cordial manner. We liberals were really angry with G.W Bush because we believe the WMD totally destroyed republican&#x27;s credibility, and showed how evil they were as they were willing to shed blood for some god-knows-what reason. The conservatives would defend Fox News by giving lots of factual information, and reminded us about the danger of pushing narratives regardless of truths. Libertarians would snort something like &quot;Change! Change what? It does not even make grammatical sense&quot;. And we all talk about education, history, the projects, white flight, gentrification, and the list went on. No one was offended. No one would charge someone this ism that phobia.<p>What about now?')
