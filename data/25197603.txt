They would also like you to believe that the chip improves security in the cloud. In actuality it protects software running on your device from ... you. All this attestation stuff is great for DRM!<p>That poses a problem for marketing. They have to let it sound like it does something for you when it actually doesn&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s no surprise then that the marketing is basically a giant weasel word souffle with some buzzwords sprinkled on top, and a bit of name dropping.')
