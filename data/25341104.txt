Some people will just do anything to prove that actually there are no special people. Everything is just privilege, we would have 100s of Elon Musk if only not for income inequality.<p>And if reality doesn&#x27;t actually line up with that, hey why not just invent a bunch of stuff.<p>We can do this infinity. Somebody that grew up poor in the US has success. Well, he had food as a child, 100s of starving African could have done the same, but &#x27;who don&#x27;t have the privilege necessary&#x27;.<p>So lets not give credit to anybody ever. If you were not a slave in Somilia at 13 that swam across the ocean by yourself and then build a new technology from the ground up, you deserve nothing and you are just one of those no good privileged people.')
