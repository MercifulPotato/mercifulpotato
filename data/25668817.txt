Item(by='spidersouris', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610009626, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25665034, text='&gt; As for public officials using Twitter, a private company for their main communication channel instead of using government websites, they need to stop doing that.<p>That&#x27;s a relevant point and I hope every public official would do this. However, what people seem to miss is that Twitter, just like other social media such as Facebook or Instagram, started to, in people&#x27;s mind, transform into a public agora and lose their private status. The thing is they gained so much power and became so essential and valuable as far as society and political life are concerned that they&#x27;re now considered as communication channels where everyone, including public officials, should have the right to express their opinion as long as it doesn&#x27;t break the TOS, which is something I can, in fact, hardly disapprove.')
