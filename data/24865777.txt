The majority of Europe is languishing very badly and it&#x27;s getting worse by the year.<p>&gt; $40K&#x2F;year for similar academics you get almost for free in Europe.<p>It&#x27;s not free at all, and everyone knows it&#x27;s not free.<p>Let&#x27;s see you do the final tally, which includes income across a lifetime vs tax rates.<p>Europeans pay epic taxes in part for that &#x27;free&#x27; college.
