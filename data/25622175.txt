In fact experts have been repeating that for decades.<p>Not only that but it seems that this pandemic followed the most likely scenario according to experts, i.e. a new virus jumping from animal to humans. Even the likely animal candidate (bats) was near the top of the list (we already recently got SARS, probably MERS, and perhaps Ebola from them).')
