The CCP has been in an undeclared war with the US since the Korean War, so most are pointed at the US:<p>Mao, &quot;Hide our strength, bide our time.&quot;<p>- We will have nuclear explosions resulting in war in the next 20 years. Both North Korea and the Islamic world are motivated to get them.<p>- the Islamic community has a weird sense of victimhood (losing the science race, resulting in the loss of their caliphate) and superiority (read the Koran) that guarantees the use of nukes against the West. To them, the more chaos, the better. It&#x27;s like 1.2 billion chess players, who can only think 1 move deep.<p>- Russia has a military doomsday SkyNet program &quot;Dead Hand&quot; that will automatically launch nukes after it detects launches from other countries, intentional or not.<p>Moscow is protected by a ring of ABM rockets, so they believe their leaders can protect themselves.<p>- China has monopolized the Himalayan headwaters, diverting water from several other countries, including Pakistan. This is an age-old reason for war. With 8+ billion people, add in overpopulation, too.<p>- nuclear arms control experts are very concerned about what&#x27;s happening, likely the most since the Cuban Missile Crisis.<p>The West&#x27;s secular liberalism is under attack by two powerful ideologies, the CCP and Islam (the #1 baby name in the capitals of Europe is Mohammed.) As we&#x27;ve seen in Europe, our tolerance loses to their intolerance. Hopefully the US can learn from Europe and HK and take action to protect ourselves before it&#x27;s too late.')
