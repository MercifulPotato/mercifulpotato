For example, NTFS has filesystem transactions, although it was rarely used and Microsoft has deprecated it â€“ part of the reason for its rare use, is that with Win32 it isn&#x27;t seamless to adopt, all existing filesystem calls have to be replaced with *Transacted equivalents. (Apparently the undocumented NT level API is more seamless, but well, it&#x27;s undocumented.)')
