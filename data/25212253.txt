In fact, a huge part of the calculus is knowing that US Citizenship is offered to nurses at higher rates (due to the nursing shortage).<p>Ironically: being a doctor is not a strategic choice despite making more money. You need to sacrifice another 10-years of your life in school and additional training, and going into virtually any other field will result in more money in most situations. Especially if you become a general practitioner: the most needed doctor (but the one that is paid the least).<p>Run the numbers of 10-fewer years of 401k savings in your youngest years as a 20-year old... as you go through additional schooling + residency. There&#x27;s not a lot of money to be had here.<p>--------<p>So you have a point: money, citizenship, and more are offered to nurses and doctors. Because the roles are important and a lot of people (fortunately) agree that the role is important.<p>But that&#x27;s not really how nurses &#x2F; doctors think on the day-to-day level. They usually are thinking &quot;Patient X doesn&#x27;t listen to me. X would be in a better situation if they did Y&quot;.<p>Doctors &#x2F; nurses can easily make more money by selling unnecessary prescriptions &#x2F; unnecessary surgery &#x2F; etc. etc. That&#x27;s just the position of trust that they&#x27;re in. The fact that they usually DONT do that is due to a sense of duty and Hippocratic oath. Doctors &#x2F; nurses, if placed in a &quot;pragmatic capitalist&quot; setting, aren&#x27;t to be trusted actually. Its due to culture and soft-reasons (a sense of duty. A sense of morals, a sense of ethics) that they remain ethical.<p>Not all doctors&#x2F;nurses are ethical. But the vast, vast majority of them are ethical. Seeing things in a &quot;greedy pure capitalist&quot; way in the profession is grossly frowned upon. Because most people don&#x27;t really see doctors &#x2F; nurses as an adversary offering health services. A doctor &#x2F; nurse is someone who is there to help you when you need help.')
