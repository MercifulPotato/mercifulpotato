There is an excellent AI community in India.<p>Unfortunately their works are overshadowed by some of the Ivy Leagues and Silicon Valley companies because they do not have that sort of publicity machine or brand name. Even within research comm unity their works dont get cited relative to the importance. If the same work comes from an Ivy League Fac or Company they get cited much more.')
