What a team needs out of project management tools varies immensely.<p>In this thread there&#x27;s people saying that inability to host on prem is an absolute blocker for them, for others they have zero problems with their data being SaaS-hosted. Some people need deep analytics to measure how their team is doing and they can meet deliverables, and some people could care less. Some people have 10+ workflow stages with tons of rules, some people are fine with Todo &#x2F; in progress &#x2F; done.<p>If you have a small team and dont really care about reporting, Trello is probably a great option for you.<p>If you want reporting, but are willing to work with a somewhat prescribed workflow &#x2F; process, across a few teams at most, clubhouse or pivotal tracker are great.<p>If you need full control and flexibility, and are willing to give up some ease of use and speed, JIRA probably is your best bet.')
