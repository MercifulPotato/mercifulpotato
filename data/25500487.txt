At one point the consensus was that dietary cholesterol was very bad for you... it didn&#x27;t change the facts and was the consensus for a very long time despite (often buried) evidence to the contrary.<p>Not all LDL is the same. VLDL and glycated LDL seem to be the problematic markers and aren&#x27;t necessarily directly tied to saturated fat in the diet.  HDL:TG as a ratio is a far better marker for overall health than HDL:LDL or cholesterol markers on their own by count. It&#x27;s more about oxidative stress and inflammation more than it is about dietary cholesterol and saturated fat specifically.<p>Not to say you should eat an unnatural amount of either only in so much that you shouldn&#x27;t avoid natural food sources in favor of say processed foods which are far worse in so many ways.  I&#x27;m an advocate of mostly paleo, most of the time and that should include animal sources even if only fish and&#x2F;or eggs.')
