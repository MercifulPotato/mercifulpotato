Bill and grew up in thoroughly middle class &#x2F; lower upper middle class areas for his entire life.<p>He had a bit of mini-breakdown when he and his girlfriend came to spend a weekend with me in Fort Worth around Christmastime. The constant barrage of &quot;white men&quot; being the source of the world&#x27;s problems, and &quot;recognize &#x2F; check  your privilege&quot; when he would have discussions in classes over the past four years had really worn on him.')
