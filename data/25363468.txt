And even attempts to use these in a bright-line, careful fashion have often squashed the wrong speech and silenced the wrong people; this is before any actual malicious use which is sure to come if the precedent strengthens.<p>In our rush to get rid of the most repugnant ideas, too, we tend to lose our ability to discuss nuance.  To avoid COVID quackery, we can&#x27;t have an open discussion of the merits of specific policies and interventions.  In our rush to squash the dangerous idea of election fraud, we can&#x27;t have the discussion about how to make our actual election system robust and beyond reproach.<p>&gt; So, the danger of &quot;censorship&quot;, in our current context, should be gauged against the danger of &quot;non-censorship&quot; in the same context.<p>Yes, which is why I acknowledged those risks in my first comment and said that I believed that these risks are potentially greater.<p>Think about how much important speech from the past few centuries has seemed dangerous and repugnant at the time it was uttered.')
