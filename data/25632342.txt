Maybe it reflects a particular bad experience? I&#x27;ve delivered a bunch of products built in the way I prefer to work, and it&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve had the problems you&#x27;re describing. Maybe that&#x27;s because I ran into such such problems early in my career and learned ways of handling them.<p>And yeah, if you just iterate and explore, you can wind up in lacunae. You do need to develop some actual goal and a vision of how to get there. Interactive development can be really helpful for the exploring part, but it can&#x27;t pick your goals for you.<p>In short, interactive development is a way of working that&#x27;s good for some cases and some people (me, for instance). It&#x27;s not a cure-all or an objectively superior methodology for all people or all cases. I don&#x27;t want it to take over the world. I just want it to continue to be an option because it&#x27;s the way I prefer to work.')
