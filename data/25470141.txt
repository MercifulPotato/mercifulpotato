I&#x27;ve written more elsewhere, but having purpose in life can drive so many other things, and give one a direction that supports changes in goals.  A late university president &amp; former US solicitor general (Rex Lee) said he had given up on setting goals because...something like...life changed in unexpected ways, and he was grateful and accepted opportunities that arose.  But having purpose first of all would give us a way to navigate that.<p>Vision is what the outcome looks like (and can also change as we learn &amp; mature).  Strategy is like a map of the terrain (per S.R. Covey, IIRC).  I don&#x27;t think of &quot;SMART&quot; Goals because too often there are things that (should? or must) change short-term plans, but there might be something to learn there, but I do have plans &amp; careful priorities as goals, and try to enjoy working on them and making constant progress.  And so on.<p>But it starts with purpose, which in my view&#x2F;experience&#x2F;beliefs solves many, many problems (for me and all I have observed, which I tend to do much of).  If one&#x27;s religion does not provide that purpose, one might consider helping to lift humanity, finding joy through both growth (learning, improvement) and unselfish service to others, employing always honesty and treating others as oneself would want to be treated.<p>(Edit: and it seems loosely relevant:  Tolstoy said something like &quot;All happy families are alike, and all miserable families are miserable in their own way&quot;. I think there is much to that: multigenerational unselfish service in a widening circle brings greater sustainability and peace. Seeing what families&#x27; and&#x2F;or cultures&#x27; traits allow them to persist over time is interesting.)<p>Edit2: having an honest job that is not dream-related, to support a family or help others, is very honorable and can bring happiness with great fulfillments over time.  Many very grateful people (such as in my extended family) are alive and educated and functioning because someone honest and diligent went to work every day, and&#x2F;or diligently cared for, taught, and encouraged them every day!  And if those parents ever need things like a place to stay or basic resources, multiple of those grateful people would certainly strive to provide it.  (That&#x27;s another big subject I&#x27;ve written about, more for another time...)')
