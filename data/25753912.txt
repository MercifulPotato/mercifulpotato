Part of the pain of switching to more open alternatives in the past has been managing operational deployments which this begins to address. Blockchain technologies, for all their misuse and hype have brought us some interesting innovations such as the InterPlanetary File System (which probably isn&#x27;t going anywhere but is a start). None of this is better than the current crop of closed system, compare Diaspora to Facebook for example, but we have the start. But you can only have the &quot;Web&quot; applications he envisions if you have the &quot;distributed internet substrate.&quot;')
