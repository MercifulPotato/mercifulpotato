But in doing so, they conflate personal ability with situational constraints. What about professional designers if they were able to work without commercial constraints, like hobbyists?<p>This last paragraph reminds me of the video game world and common arguments on indie games vs AAA&#x2F;big studio games.<p>Indie games with their hit or miss experimentation, AAA games with their formulaic selling strategy.<p>But in the video game world there have been professionals who have stepped back into the indie world to make something lower budget and more experimental. Those end up being about as hit or miss as the &#x27;actual&#x27;, for lack of a better word, indie games.<p>So I guess my point is, I think the constraints themselves do play a part in hobbyist type games and a professional under the same constraints is likely to produce the same kind of thing.<p>Something experimental that may be awesomely fun or it could be kinda lame.')
