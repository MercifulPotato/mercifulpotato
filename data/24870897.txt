Item(by='kthejoker2', descendants=None, kids=[24875544, 24871691], score=None, time=1603468880, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869219, text='As a thought experiment, I think the best course of action for these freelance pen testers - assuming they incur no actual liabilities for being wrong - is to simply declare everything they test &quot;secure&quot; without putting any actual effort into it at all.<p>If they can manage to do this at any scale whatsoever, there is basically no downside, because there&#x27;s a huge disconnect between the impact of a false negative (site breached, data stolen, etc.) and the impact to them (a 1-star review - even in your nightmare scenario as a customer, you still give them a score of 20%!)<p>1) A large number of the people who come to them will have actually produced secure code, so broken clock theory prevails, and there&#x27;s no downside.<p>2) Another large subset will never generate enough interest among hackers to exploit their insecure code; a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it.<p>3) Another subset still will never know they&#x27;ve been breached and have cause to action.<p>4) If a company does learn they&#x27;ve been breached, they still must connect the dots to the failure of the pen tester.<p>5) And even then ... 1 star and some bad PR!<p>And of course if there were actual liabilities, they wouldn&#x27;t be charging $35 on a freelance site.')
