So all modern compilers come with a bit of knowledge of how standard library functions like memcpy are supposed to behave and as long as the visible effect is the same it&#x27;s allowed to do anything it wants. So instead of calling the function memcpy for a size of 4, it can e.g. just use a mov instruction to move the value from a float to an integer register. [1] It does additional analysis on how the values are used and maybe it doesn&#x27;t even need to move the value at all, but that&#x27;s the gist of it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.godbolt.org&#x2F;z&#x2F;x4P7jE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.godbolt.org&#x2F;z&#x2F;x4P7jE</a>')
