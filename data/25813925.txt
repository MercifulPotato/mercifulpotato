It avoids &quot;I can do better&quot; with a kind of royal &quot;we&quot; that implies other people should do the work. The obvious response to &quot;I can do better&quot; is &quot;okay, go ahead&quot;. &quot;We can do better&quot; tries to tell me that I should be working on this guy&#x27;s problem.

But the best comes in the form of just writing better software, or improving what we&#x27;ve already got. Calling somebody else&#x27;s project a &quot;shiny turd&quot;, on the other hand, isn&#x27;t even really criticism. It&#x27;s name calling.')
