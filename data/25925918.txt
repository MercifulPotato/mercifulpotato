It has lowered the barrier of entry to programming and introduced tens of millions of people to the world of development.</i><p>JS didn&#x27;t lower the barrier to programming at all. On the contrary, programming with VisualBasic and SQL was 10 times more accessible and productive than web development. What enabled millions to write software was the availability of computers in every household.<p>What the Web did was revolutionise software distribution. After making a change to my 1990s style VB program I had to pack a stack of floppy disks and travel to my customer to install the new version on their PCs, migrate the data, make sure everything still worked in spite of other programs installing an overlapping set of DLLs, etc.<p>With the Web, we took a massive hit in terms of developer productivity and complexity, but the distribution model trumped absolutely everything. It also made things possible that would have been completely unthinkable, such as running software made by a large number of developers you don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t necessarily trust with all your data.<p>To this day, the Web is the only reasonably secure runtime environment that isn&#x27;t centrally controlled by some gatekeeper with its own agenda.<p>So I actually agree with most of what you have said elsewhere in this thread. But I disagree about lowering the barrier for developers.')
