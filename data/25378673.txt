Not even the legal kind. They won&#x27;t even take the proceeds. Venmo is owned by PayPal and has the same policies.<p>Google Pay also has an explicit ban on pornography. As does Apple Pay. As does Samsung Pay. In fact, I don&#x27;t think any balance-carrying service available to Americans even theoretically allows paying for porn.')
