With the relatively low tax rates, I would expect you can take home at least $200k (depends on the state). Like the original poster said, it&#x27;s not that hard to live off of $50k in most of the US (even in the bay or NY, but you live like a college student). That leaves savings of 150k USD&#x2F;yr from one source of income. Many families have two working professional adults and can almost double these numbers. Add in investment returns and $2.5 mil becomes a very achievable goal. I know a lot of people in their 30s like the poster and am closing in myself, it is not that uncommon in the US tech community.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;how-much-income-puts-you-top-1-5-10&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;how-much-incom...</a>')
