There wasn&#x27;t a strong commitment to the missions at the time, so making something completely new was out of the question. But there was a lot politically and strategically riding on Shuttle, so they had to find some way of keeping some lights on. Those points can be elaborated, but the decision really wasn&#x27;t much more complicated than that.<p>The F1 and SSME are apples and oranges. They have separate uses and achievements for their times. I haven&#x27;t heard of either being widely considered objectively superior to the other.')
