It is intended for &quot;priority workers&quot;. Those are foreign nationals who either have &quot;extraordinary abilities&quot;, or are &quot;outstanding professors or researchers&quot;, and also includes &quot;some executives and managers of foreign companies who are transferred to the US&quot;. It allows them to remain permanently in the US.<p>&gt; Therefore, applicants who can demonstrate their extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics through sustained national or international acclaim are not required to have a permanent offer of employment in the US and are eligible to self-petition, however, they must intend to work in the US in their field of expertise.')
