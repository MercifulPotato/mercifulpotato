My local library actually has an &quot;Undiscovered Gems&quot; section that has lead me to some interesting reads from authors I&#x27;m not familiar with. I also keep a running list of interesting titles on my library account, putting holds on them as I finish books.<p>I&#x27;m like you, I usually bounce around between fiction and non-fiction to keep my reading balanced.  For me, half the fun of reading is simply exploring and discovering new books&#x2F;authors&#x2F;series!')
