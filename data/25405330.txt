So I&#x27;d lump &quot;understanding the problem well enough that you can solve it&quot; in step 1.<p>Before starting: I&#x27;ve got a sweet idea for a web app!<p>After step 1: I&#x27;m trying to solve ___ problem for ___ users. My MVP will look like these rough sketches and I&#x27;m going to use build it on top of ___ libraries &#x2F; databases &#x2F; frameworks.<p>After step 2: Here&#x27;s the website if you want to give it a spin!<p>The easier the code is to write, the less time I&#x27;ll spend in step 1. Which makes sense - up front design won&#x27;t save much programming time if I can make a prototype faster than I can write a spec.')
