Selling to plebs is (1) expensive since the economy of scale isn’t there and (2) not useful to IBM’s business strategy anyway.<p>Like, if you are buying 10,000 x86 processors from Intel, then you tell Intel, “Don’t charge us too much, or we’ll buy POWER systems from IBM instead.” Intel chuckles, since they know you’re not serious, but (1) you buy a few racks of POWER systems and make your engineers build and test everything on POWER to make your negotiation position more credible, and (2) Intel knows they can’t charge you more than IBM does.<p>The other niche for POWER, as far as I can tell, is that it has various certifications, or it’s used in systems with various certifications that x86 doesn’t have (e.g. certain aerospace &#x2F; defense applications). For example, the RAD5545 is a rad-hard POWER SoC.')
