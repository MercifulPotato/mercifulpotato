I have never worked for small companies (always 25k+ sizes ) so my view may be skewed but the scope of these companies are so large that changing a project can mean totally different ways of working and sometimes totally different industries. Can it be that it&#x27;s easier in europe to change your job context within the company and not so in america?<p>&gt; Changing jobs is part of professional growth IMO.<p>Actually it&#x27;s hard for me to understand why this is taken for granted in America and my home country India. Sounds like KPI chasing to me.')
