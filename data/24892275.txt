Even if you re-OCR them all with Tesseract or something (which will take quite a while, based on how long Tesseract takes to OCR my books even using parallelism on a Threadripper), the OCR will still be awful data. Do you really want to add that to your training dataset...? Far from obvious, and not when there are so many other pools of text like Arxiv which aren&#x27;t so insoluble.')
