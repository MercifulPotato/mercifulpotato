Why should I choose your platform over a platform where i get tens or hundreds of dollars for a single sale, compared to a Spotify model, where i might or might not get few dollars a month.<p>3D modeling is a labour intensive job and the market is way smaller than music or movies, meaning its way harder to get an audience large enough for this kind of service. Even with a audience large enough, could you guarantee I would receive as much as from other services?<p>Also, at $5 a month pricepoint you’re primarily going to attract below average modelers. Such a low pricepoint means the creator is not going to get much, considering the processing fees &amp; comission and sharing the revenue with other creators.<p>However, as a consumer I like the idea. But as a creator I really don’t like it. If the subscription would be $50+, i would consider it.')
