(At least, they claim to have removed it). But it is hard to trust them again, and I would prefer to use a firewall that uses its own kernel extension to manage the network than using Apple&#x27;s API again. (Obviously that&#x27;s going to be really hard with the changes they have made to the OS).<p>I know many Apple&#x27;s fan see this as a positive move.<p>But let&#x27;s not ignore the pattern of privacy violations and user data collections due to deliberate design and the &quot;apology&quot; and &quot;changes&quot; that follow once CAUGHT. A few of these that immediately come to mind are:<p>- Apple selling user data to US government: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2013&#x2F;jun&#x2F;06&#x2F;us-tech-giants-nsa-data" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2013&#x2F;jun&#x2F;06&#x2F;us-tech-giants...</a><p>- Apple iPhone 11 tracks user location even when location services are explicitly turned off by user (another BACKDOOR): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.silicon.co.uk&#x2F;mobility&#x2F;smartphones&#x2F;apple-iphone-collects-location-data-321509?cmpredirect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.silicon.co.uk&#x2F;mobility&#x2F;smartphones&#x2F;apple-iphone-...</a><p>- Apple macOS tracks every app that you use: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sneak.berlin&#x2F;20201112&#x2F;your-computer-isnt-yours&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sneak.berlin&#x2F;20201112&#x2F;your-computer-isnt-yours&#x2F;</a><p>- Apple introduces BACKDOOR in its API to allow Apple apps to bypass application firewalls: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patreon.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;hooray-no-more-46179028" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patreon.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;hooray-no-more-46179028</a><p>(For those who want to diss me for the above, realise that Apple&#x27;s new found love for privacy doesn&#x27;t mean shit without such public scrutiny and discussions. And if you want it to last, remain suspicious and VOCAL on any such possible violations.)')
