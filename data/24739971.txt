PS could increase woe.  Courier was available both ways.  But tons of people stuck with the simple characters like you get on the cheap store receipts.<p>DOS text files using a monospaced font can be reselected to a different monospaced font without all the formatting difficulty you can get otherwise.<p>When Windows got popular, loads of people found out their old dot-matrix printer had been capable of beautiful PS output the whole time, it had just been out of reach without a WYSIWYG drafting approach.<p>You can still set your email window for a monospaced font, and draft a message into a Notepad window set for mono, intentionally with all the sentences of each paragraph on a single line when Word Wrap is disabled (disable Word Wrap before copying &amp; pasting), and with a single line space between these _paragraphs_.<p>Then just copy &amp; paste the whole text linewise from Notepad to different email windows and their mono spacing can be a good way to make the different local &amp; remote word wraps work with less headaches.<p>Courier&#x27;s remaining universalness still makes it a top choice for this type of thing, but a new monospace font that can serve as a functional superset is good to have.')
