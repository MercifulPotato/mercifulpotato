Here in Grand Rapids, MI, USA (generally considered a low cost of living area) an unfurnished apartment in not great parts of town is on the order of $800&#x2F;mo, plus about $150&#x2F;mo in utilities, depending on how cold you can tolerate in winter and how hot in summer, i.e. double the price.<p>Now, actual studio apartments command a premium here, and anything that small is hard to find, you&#x27;ll more likely find an 80m2&#x2F;800 sqft converted space in the basement of someone&#x27;s house for that price. Also, housing is cheaper the farther you go from downtown, and I&#x27;m not sure how good public transit is in Leipzig, but it&#x27;s pretty car-centric here. We have a bus system, but that basically means an extra hour anywhere you want to go, which is a massive pain when you&#x27;re already working 2 30-hour-per-week jobs.')
