This really deserves to make the front page. It&#x27;s a phishing attack aimed not at money but at getting publications in a prestigious journal.<p>I nearly fell for a vaguely similar attack: an email apparently from a relative&#x27;s account. It was phrased suspiciously, and then I noticed that the reply-to didn&#x27;t go to the same account. If I had bitten, I doubt I&#x27;d have been taken in by the reply (I imagine they&#x27;d have asked for money), but only because of stylistic issues, not technical ones.<p>So it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that a better targeted attack could succeed, even against somebody fairly sophisticated.')
