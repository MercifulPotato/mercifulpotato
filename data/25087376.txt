I can keep my dayjob for a while. Which in theory gives me unlimited burn rate. But I&#x27;m worried that I should just cashout everything. I won&#x27;t lose any money. Then move to Saas,where the overhead and unit economics are incredible. Or just do software engineering as an employee with much less stress.<p>Thank you for mentioning Arvid, I&#x27;ll keep him in mind!')
