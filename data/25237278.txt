Otherwise a hacked compiler can inject secret election rigging code.<p>The only reason to keep the source private is for obscurity. Making it harder to hack. It&#x27;s not a good reason though.  For things with high value and motivation to hack, hiding the source doesn&#x27;t do much. The final compiled code can be treated as &quot;source&quot;, read and understood, then hacked.')
