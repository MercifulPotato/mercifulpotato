Until we will be able to use nanomachines to analyize individual proteins and cells we won&#x27;t know how the body works on a global scale so you will end up with incorrectly guessing how much micro&#x2F;macro nutrients the meat will have.<p>Over time artifical meat will be a disaster as far as nutrients go, saying that you can &quot;grow good meat that can compare to natural meat and has all the required nutrients as natural meat&quot; is arrogant and shortsighted, but I don&#x27;t expect anything more from modern scientists.')
