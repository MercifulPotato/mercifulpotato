While sure, they found certain infringements due to their ToS, there&#x27;s a large swath of entities that infringe on their ToS who are not banned. Along with, it&#x27;s painfully easy to prove it&#x27;s because the ones not banned are politically aligned with the platform. To state it&#x27;s a ban due to violence, absolute bullshit. There are tons of Facebook livestreams of violence, gang based, that NZ shooting, and just random people thinking they&#x27;re cool and hurting folks to gain popularity (and making an easy case for prosecutors). Facebook hasn&#x27;t been banned from Google Play Store or Apple App Store yet. &quot;But they don&#x27;t have to moderate due to 230&quot;. Well, why does Parler have to then? I&#x27;m actually okay with Parler being shut down (mostly because I never used it or really care) but then I want to see the same punishment for other social media platforms. Hold one accountable, hold them all accountable. No favoritism just because you wear a certain color tie during political meetups.<p>Sure, maybe there is no law that really punishes selective enforcement of company policy. However, can you really say that it&#x27;s not absurd and ethically fucked up? Can you really not see, &quot;Wow, these companies do hold too much power in public discourse and can twist, bend narratives in their favor&quot;? As the general public, we need to vote with our wallets as well as ballots. These companies need to know that this shit isn&#x27;t cool or funny. Giving them blank cheques everyday because we&#x27;re too lazy to change our habits will never help. Complacency isn&#x27;t an excuse after a certain point.')
