I purchased a kindle a few months ago and it has drastically increased my reading time. I try to carry the kindle around the house instead of my phone. And read whenever I can - 15 to 30 mins chunks. I also read in bed before going to sleep and the backlit kindle is great for that.<p>Also I have been renting kindle books from my library. Very easy to try books and continue reading only if I find it interesting!')
