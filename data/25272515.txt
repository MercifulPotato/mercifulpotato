If you personally know something about the hobby this can work. But if you find yourself saying &quot;The minimum wage employee at Best Buy told me this widget was the best one&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve heard people talk about this online. For example, someone getting into record collecting being gifted the cheapest turntable available on Amazon or in a high street fashion&#x2F;trinkets store that not only sounds bad but may even damage the records. A waste of money if the recipient is already saving up for a good turntable or already has one. Slightly less worse is receiving an original pressing of an old record but not taking enough time to read about the quality it&#x27;s being sold in.<p>You can&#x27;t exactly tell the gifter you spent 10x the cost of a Crosley on a phono preamp alone :)')
