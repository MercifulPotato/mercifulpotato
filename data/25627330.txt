The quality of the samples are going to be wildly different and that needs to be taken into account.<p>Linkedin calculates an ad impression (last I checked) as 50% of the ad is on screen for at least 300ms. I can be scrolling as fast as my thumb will flick down my LinkedIn newsfeed and it would probably count.<p>Then the KPI being used is clicks. I don&#x27;t know of any business owner who would take that as valid. It should be some kind of conversion event (newsletter signup, contact request, or purchase, etc.)<p>If it were up to me, I&#x27;d want 4,400 <i>clicks</i> and a few dozen conversion events to do my calculations on statistically significant effectiveness. Especially since the author is paying CPC (cost-per-click)... who cares about impressions at all?')
