Some are just off topic. If you see one that is not spam, you can vouch them, and if it is really great you can write an email to the mods. (It&#x27;s a manual process, so only write about the very good post.)<p>There are some corner case, like people that make very simple technical post like &quot;How to sort a list in Python using the standard sort function&quot;, and submit every day one of them. A good discussion about different sorting algorithms is nice, but a two lines post about [1 4 2 3].sort is not.<p>It would be nice if you link 2 or 3 examples.')
