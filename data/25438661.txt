A few pieces of unsolicited feedback from a marketing perspective:<p>* Always have the call to action repeated at the bottom of the page; you did a great job having it above the fold, but I got to the end and had to scroll back up to express intent. That&#x27;s a flowbreaking design.<p>* This is purely stylistic, but I strongly prefer the first letter of each line to be capitalized. I find the stylistic inconsistency around capitalization offputting.<p>* You have pretty nicely made docs, consider making the link to view the sample chapters a clickable picture of the first diagram-page in your chapter.<p>Thanks for making this!')
