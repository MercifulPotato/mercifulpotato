From what I have seen UW, Oregon State, Seattle Colleges, etc were already employing question banks and timed test windows rather than resorting to poorly functioning half measures like Respondus LockDown Browser and its ilk.<p>Many colleges were already fully capable of distance learning in multiple forms, whether through correspondence courses (what WGU often pitches, complete the project or test and bypass the class, though some of their certificate partners abuse test takers with Respondus or similar) or online learning with systems like Canvas.<p>Decent colleges offer a mix of these, I can attest to the quality of these programs at Seattle Colleges (specifically North Seattle College &amp; Seattle Central). There is little value in building a panopticon of surveillance in higher education, especially when these divert resources that would otherwise enable students to better master the subject.')
