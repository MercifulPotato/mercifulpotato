Item(by='clarkevans', descendants=None, kids=[25958901, 25958800], score=None, time=1611936545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25958504, text='Hard data on outstanding shorts is posted semi-monthly, and even that data is probably stale a week or so. Daily regulatory reporting of short positions doesn&#x27;t exist. Thus, assertions that &quot;the squeeze has not yet occurred&quot; should be treated with caution. It might be true, but it might also be a mirage.<p>There are various firms that look at market transaction data to estimate outstanding short positions. However, they rely upon various assumptions since firms don&#x27;t report how may shares they purchased to cover shorts. Hence, claims that GME is 130% oversubscribed or any other assessment could be wildly off from reality.<p>Also note retail investors are around 15% of GME. Most shares are held by institutional investors. What&#x27;s going on isn&#x27;t David vs Goliath, the situation is more diffuse.')
