A card deck should aid you in building your own model rather than forcing dumb memorization.<p>A good card is one that highlights what is important for you to memorize. While preparing the card, one should reflect what are these parts and how it fits into the larger whole so as to reflect this in the card. This helps go beyond mere memorization, and apply spaced repetition also to some higher-level concepts.<p>Example: for a recent exam I took I had to memorize extinguisher types and to which types of fires they can be applied. You can stuff it into a dumb deck (&quot;[Class A]= [common combustibles]&quot;), or you can put it into a hierarchy or turn it into a relationship (&quot;[Class A] extinguishers cannot be applied to [electrical equipment]] because [...]. [Class C] should be used instead.&quot;)<p>For more information, see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medschoolinsiders.com&#x2F;medical-student&#x2F;anki-flashcard-best-practices-how-to-create-good-cards&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medschoolinsiders.com&#x2F;medical-student&#x2F;anki-flashcard...</a>')
