Just a little bit of distributed storage (e.g. Tesla car in your garage back-feeding your home periodically) could potentially obviate the need for peak generation capacity altogether. What little we do need could simply be spinning reserve w&#x2F; nuclear generation providers where it&#x27;s required the most.<p>In the areas where nuclear is not feasible, we obviously would continue to burn the most appropriate fuels. That said, one big area that could definitely use some attention would be international shipping. Perhaps as reactor costs come down, boats that are bigger than a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier could be justified in having nuclear power too.')
