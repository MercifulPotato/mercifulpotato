Nobody is owed an explanation of downvotes, but if someone asks for one on something I downvoted, I would reply if it hadn&#x27;t already been adequately addressed by someone else.<p>When a comment is partly greyed out, I&#x27;m almost certain to either upvote or downvote. If I think the downvotes are unfair, I will upvote, and if I think the comment should be hidden, I&#x27;ll hasten the process.<p>The point of downvoting is to keep the site as a useful resource, and that means downvoting when appropriate without spending an inordinate amount of time on it. Nobody has time to read every comment posted on HN.')
