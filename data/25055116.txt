The Internet has become boring and yet I constantly am on things like HN hoping to find the diamond in the rough. Something that’s interesting.<p>Used to be, everyday there was at least 5 or more interesting stories that just got me excited about something new to try or learn.<p>Now, I’ve become so complacent with relying on sources like HN that I can’t find things on my own anymore.<p>Google does suck now. It’s mostly marketing.<p>Websites like Lifehacker used have fun information, now it just “hey buy this deal” shit.<p>Reddit sucks.
