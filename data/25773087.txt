Education is much more expensive in the US which means having a degree will fetch a higher premium. With free education European software developers need lower salary to make getting the education worthwhile.<p>Also European work days are much shorter. A key reason American software developers earn more is because they work a lot more hours.<p>Last time I checked this I think I concluded I had much better hourly salary here in Europe than in the US because work weeks where crazy in the US. Not to mention much shorter vacations. I got 6 weeks full paid vacation with plenty of national holidays on top, and long paternity leave for each kid.<p>It is unrealistic for why we should have the same pay as Americans with all the benefits we enjoy.')
