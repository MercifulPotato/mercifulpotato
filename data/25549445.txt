Their main product is utter trash and the DOJ is actively seeking to decouple their moat.<p>If you use Google search, you&#x27;re admitting that you want ads. Google rearranges the results to prefer AMP and other ad infested properties before relevant results.<p>The internal Google culture is fucked. They launch random things and close them, all to feed their chaotic promo cycle. It leads to distrust and anger amongst users. I&#x27;m still furious about Google Play Music going away. YouTube music recently put this [1] in my indie music playlist.<p>Their current CEO reminds me of Ballmer. They need to bring in a Nadella to save things and make Google cool again. Also, when&#x27;s the last time we heard from Page, Brin, or Schmidt? I thought they cared more.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;ve started using Bing and I&#x27;ve been quite happy with it.<p>&gt; After 20 years of advancements in web technology we are an inch from making it useful only for ad companies and consumer driven behaviour. Is usenet valuable alternative for filtering out tons of crap pushed by ad empires ?<p>Google is responsible for the web atrophying. Once Google and Facebook have been chastised by the DOJ, we might see a return to form for the web. If not, maybe we should start building more distributed &#x2F; p2p content distribution. How difficult would it be to design semantic markup for blogs and comments, and start &quot;torrenting&quot; news articles in a web of trust? Signal to noise ratio would skyrocket. This sort of design keeps the marketers out completely.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Kxp8qPEwSXM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Kxp8qPEwSXM</a> (decidedly not indie or alt rock music)')
