Some unknown number of affidavits were discarded by Trump&#x27;s legal team that were acquired in exactly the same manner.<p>Their star witness claimed that there was an error of 100k in the books when an error of 30k (necessary to swing the election) wasn&#x27;t found during review. When challenged on that point she claimed the Republican was in on it. Whatever it is.<p>No claim has been made of general election malfiance. All accusations are specifically about the presidential election. How and why would you rig only a presidential election? You can&#x27;t do that by merely rescanning ballots.')
