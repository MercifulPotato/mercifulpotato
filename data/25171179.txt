People who incur a lot of student debt are basically a random mixture of &quot;students at actual elite colleges&quot;, &quot;non-traditional students at for-profit colleges of wildly variable quality&quot; and &quot;people who incurred debt to get their MBA or other professional degrees&quot;.  It makes no sense to treat all of these people equally wrt. debt forgiveness, and no they aren&#x27;t just &quot;the elite&quot; either.')
