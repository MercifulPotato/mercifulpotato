Item(by='cbozeman', descendants=None, kids=[25849710], score=None, time=1611163877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25848926, text='They will recover, but we&#x27;re not at the bottom yet.<p>I think the stock will hit rock bottom in early-to-mid 2022. It&#x27;ll start to climb around Q2 2023 when new products on working Intel nodes are announced. Once those products are reviewed and performance is at parity or better than AMD &#x2F; Apple products, it&#x27;ll rebound.<p>And they will have to recover, one way or another. Intel is now a strategic asset. TSMC is too close to mainland China to risk losing access to, the Arizona fab won&#x27;t be online for at least 3-5 years, and its capacity is tiny compared to the main fab in Taiwan. Samsung can&#x27;t afford to share capacity because whatever portion of their fabs aren&#x27;t used for Samsung products, the rest is locked up by NVIDIA, which literally every researcher needs because GPU-based compute is now dominant.<p>Intel has to succeed, and if they can&#x27;t do that on their own, the United States government has to step in, in some way. They did it for a bunch of shitty bankers in 2008, they can definitely do it for an industry that produces an actual, tangible product.')
