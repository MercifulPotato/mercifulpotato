Item(by='1vuio0pswjnm7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606868332, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25266743, text='&quot;I continue to believe that macOS &quot;security&quot; is mainly theater that only impedes the law-abiding Mac software industry while posing little problem for Mac malware.&quot;<p>Unless we use a more specific term such as &quot;user security&quot; I just assume &quot;security&quot; means company security -- the protection of Apple Inc.&#x27;s business.<p>One can argue that the security of Apple Inc. benefits its enthusiastically supportive customers.  Thus it is possible to conflate &quot;Apple security&quot; with &quot;user security&quot; under the ambiguous term &quot;security&quot;.  However I think these two concepts are often not interchangeable, and at odds with each other.  The user is not the corporation, nor vide versa; they are separate beings with different interests.  Neither can speak for the other.  Apple now &quot;secures&quot; its BSD-derived OSX from unauthorised software -- unauthorised by Apple Inc., not necessarily unauthorised by the user.  As the author notes, this restriction guards against (&quot;impedes&quot;) not only malware but <i>all</i> third party software.<p>The same applies with respect to &quot;privacy&quot;. Under Apple&#x27;s definition, there is no such thing as privacy from the company.')
