Item(by='1vuio0pswjnm7', descendants=None, kids=[25272737], score=None, time=1606868332, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25266743, text='&quot;I continue to believe that macOS &quot;security&quot; is mainly theater that only impedes the law-abiding Mac software industry while posing little problem for Mac malware.&quot;<p>Unless we use a more specific term such as &quot;user security&quot; I just assume &quot;security&quot; means company security -- the protection of Apple Inc.&#x27;s business.<p>One can argue that the security of the business of Apple Inc. benefits its enthusiastically supportive customers.  Thus it is possible to conflate &quot;Apple security&quot; with &quot;user security&quot; under the ambiguous term &quot;security&quot;.  However I think these two concepts are often not interchangeable, and at odds with each other.  The user is not the corporation, nor vide versa; they are separate beings with different interests.  Neither can speak for the other.  Apple now &quot;secures&quot; its BSD-derived OSX from unauthorised software -- unauthorised by Apple Inc., not necessarily unauthorised by the user.  As the author notes, this restriction guards against (&quot;impedes&quot;) not only malware but <i>all</i> third party software.<p>The same applies with respect to &quot;privacy&quot;. Under Apple&#x27;s definition, there is no such thing as privacy from the company.  It is as if the company and the customer are viewed as the same person.  Employees of Apple are under strict obligations of confidentiality to the company, but they are under no duty of confidentiality to the customer.  When an Apple employee discloses secrets of Apple, Apple can enforce its rights and the employee&#x27;s obligation via the courts.  When Apple discloses the secrets of a customer, the customer has no applicable rights or obligations it can enforce against Apple.  Instead, we have seen privacy &quot;theater&quot; as Apple protested, via the courts, against aiding in disclosure; purportedly this was done on behalf of the customer.  The truth may be that Apple was acting on its own behalf to protect the business of Apple, Inc.')
