My thesis is that it is not. This is not because it necessarily does anything worse (though it does). It must simply do something <i>better</i>. If there were actually <i>anything at all</i> it did betterâ€”well, I still wouldn&#x27;t necessarily want it as a default but it would be a defensible abstraction.<p>The heart of the matter is that a Unicode codepoint sequence view of a string <i>has no real use case</i>.<p>There is no &quot;universal principle&quot; that we use abstractions always, regardless of whether they fit the problem; that&#x27;s cargo-culting. An abstraction that does no work is, ceteris paribus, worse than not having it at all.')
