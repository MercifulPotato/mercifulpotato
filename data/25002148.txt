Item(by='frillip', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604611542, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25002144, text='I originally wrote this so that I could update a BIND9 dynamic zone directly from a Unifi UDM-Pro. I was a little disappointed to discovered that the only Dynamic DNS options were cloud providers, so I opted to write something that pretended to be a No-IP compatible cloud DNS API, but instead does proper RFC2136 nsupdate style modifications to a zone. This enables me to continue using my self-hosted BIND zones and not have to move to another cloud service.<p>Maybe you will find this useful too. The code as it stands is currently running and working well for me, so I though I would publish it for anyone else who has a similar need.')
