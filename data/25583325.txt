The first question is &quot;Where have all the flowers gone&quot; and the answer is &quot;Young girls picked them, every one.&quot;<p>The song is a commentary about how we send generation after generation of our children off to war and death--figuratively consuming our children.<p>Kinda like the ammonites of yore devouring their own offspring.')
