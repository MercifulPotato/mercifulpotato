Item(by='ilaksh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609183552, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25559929, text='&gt; Warfare involved, among other things, killing, maiming, torture, kidnapping, rape, and the extortion of tribute in exchange for avoiding such fates. When two neighboring tribes were not at war, one was usually paying tribute to the other. Tribute could also serve to bind alliances, achieving economies of scale in warfare. Mostly, it was a form of exploitation more lucrative to the victor than further violence against the defeated.<p>This hasn&#x27;t changed.  Maybe post-humans will be better.  But I don&#x27;t see a lot of hope for humans reforming.')
