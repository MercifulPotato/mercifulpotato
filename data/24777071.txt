Is there some concrete definition of for example &quot;came out of lockdown too early&quot; being applied here? Or is it just the post-hoc reasoning of &quot;well, they didn&#x27;t achieve good results, so their methods must have been bad&quot;? You could probably explain any pattern in the data with such vague criteria.')
