When you do it for a living it&#x27;s very different. You no longer strive for perfection, you strive for expectations management.<p>Some things cannot be perfect due to prior imperfect work. For example if a room isn&#x27;t square, or something isn&#x27;t level, you build your new work to match previous errors or your work looks out of place.<p>I walk onto a jobsite and there are some unspoken rules. Learning these rules is part of the fun. At the end of the day it&#x27;s just a bunch of people trying to get something done.<p>Working in trade also helps you accept the principle of &quot;good enough&quot;. You should always try your best, never give up, but accept things aren&#x27;t perfect. What you see as imperfect will likely never be noticed by the property owner.<p>Dealing with the customer has some quirks too. If you run a bundle of cat6 that looks like laminar flow then you will blow their socks off. They assume everything else is perfect. Meanwhile you could have wrapped cat6 around a&#x2F;c ducts 10 times in the attic and they will never know.<p>Knowing where to put your effort is an art.')
