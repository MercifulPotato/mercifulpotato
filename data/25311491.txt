Here in Maryland, for a family of four making $70,000 per year, the premium is under $300&#x2F;month for a high deductible plan, and under $500 for a low deductible plan. Even a family making $100,000 receives federal subsidies: a low-deductible plan is under $800&#x2F;month, and a high-deductible plan is under $450&#x2F;month.<p>We implemented a sweeping healthcare reform a decade ago now.
