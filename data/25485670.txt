For a lot of us, perhaps most, being in a social environment greatly assists with learning.<p>Hence having small classrooms where students and teachers can interact with each other.<p>I found the importance of the social aspect most vividly in webinars:<p>- A live webinar and a pre recorded webinar where attendees only passively watch and do not participate are exactly the same except for the feeling of being “live”<p>- That said, individuals are many more times likely to dial into a live webinar than a pre recorded one —- it’s because of the social aspect<p>I ran a series of webinars at work and saw these principles play out first hand (I did a write up on how to organize effective webinars for anyone interested: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.medium.com&#x2F;Bpq4EH8Ymcb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.medium.com&#x2F;Bpq4EH8Ymcb</a>)<p>I feel we will learn more from an average teacher who we socially interact with than the best teacher from who we are not socially connected. There’s something about humans being social creatures that we best accept knowledge in a social sphere.<p>I say this as an anti social person who prefers to read textbooks than watch videos or talk to people :D But through the years I realize I am more in the minority.<p>This is why meetings in companies are very important - for us hackers it sounds like a waste of time - but for a lot of the genera populace, a meeting is an easier way to absorb information because of the social aspects to it. Many people I think struggle to learn anything without an interactive session')
