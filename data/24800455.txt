Item(by='save_ferris', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602853818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800327, text='&gt; The proliferation and commoditization of F&#x2F;OSS is what made SaaS business thrive, and made it so that integration and polish is the only avenue left to make a buck, leading to our paltry attention economy, oligopoly, and platform lock-in by network effects.<p>Do I think F&#x2F;OSS played a role in these issues? Absolutely. Do I think it&#x27;s the primary role in causing these issues? Definitely not. I&#x27;d argue that weak antitrust law, ill-intentioned VC money, and lack of oversight of software titans play the biggest role in what you&#x27;ve described here. Yes, F&#x2F;OSS gave the companies tools to iterate over app development quickly, but they were pushed for hockey stick growth and total market domination by the checkbooks, and the government has completely failed to police their behavior. F&#x2F;OSS gave people with questionable incentives the ability to do questionable things, but it didn&#x27;t create the motivation to do those questionable things.<p>&gt; when was the last time you used a piece of software that truly achieved something useful on its own rather than solving a perceived problem that only exists because of the idiosyncratic nature of the web and cloud stacks?<p>I actually use a fair amount of F&#x2F;OSS that is independently useful to me, projects like Hammerspoon, MIDIMonitor, VLC, MuseScore, and others. Yes, the majority of F&#x2F;OSS that I use is for commercial purposes, but that&#x27;s certainly not exclusive.<p>&gt; Meanwhile, maintainers of popular F&#x2F;OSS get nothing in return.<p>I completely agree with this, and I think it&#x27;s one of the most critical problems to the F&#x2F;OSS movement.')
