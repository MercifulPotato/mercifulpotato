I&#x27;ve been using 16:9s for a long time now. Off the top of my head, I&#x27;d say that 16:9 favours entertainment uses, while a &quot;taller&quot; aspect ratio would favour text-heavy tasks. I use a one-window-at-a-time approach when programming, so screen specifics have relatively little effect on me.')
