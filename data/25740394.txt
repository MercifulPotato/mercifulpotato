I had a simple netgear unmanaged switch and an apple airport extreme in bridged mode.  The equipment works and i didn&#x27;t want to add more trash to the landfill and spend money i didn&#x27;t need, so I wanted to continue to use them.<p>There is no way to identify any clients on your network that are either behind the switch or behind the airport (even in bridged mode).  I would expect at least some list of clients based on DHCP leases or the ARP table, but they are not accessible through the UI.<p>I have a robotic vacuum from china, and i want to stop it from calling home.  There&#x27;s isn&#x27;t even a way to find out the IP or what traffic it&#x27;s sending through the UDM pro, and no way to set blocking rules from the UI.<p>I understand if they want to provide wifi mesh support and other special wifi features for unifi devices only, but the supposed &quot;enterprise grade&quot; router and FW functionality should support standard network setups, since all traffic goes through the UDM-Pro, and it is certainly aware of the clients since it gave them DHCP leases, and they are in the ARP table (which is only accesible through the SSH command line) and are on the same subnet.  It&#x27;s unacceptable in my opinion.')
