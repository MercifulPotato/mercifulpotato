It&#x27;s like the worst best car company at the same time.<p>I have heard many, many Tesla owners complain about build quality, but others say it&#x27;s fine. It appears to be hit or miss, which is typical for a poorly optimized manufacturing process. Some cars come off the line in good shape and others have ridiculous problems or bad panel alignment, etc. Tesla&#x27;s support is also apparently a fucking disaster, which is a common pattern with Silicon Valley companies... even large and cash-flush ones like Apple and Google. SV does not do support or customer service after the purchase.<p>Elon&#x27;s behavior on Twitter is nuts and makes me concerned about him. His COVID nonsense is the worst so far. Hopefully he holds it together long enough for Starship to be fully operational before he completely loses his mind.')
