For example Volvo had a reputation for making great safe cars. The brand is now owned by a company with a reputation for making cars that disintegrate and obliterate the occupants in crash tests.<p>The same is true of Arc&#x27;teryx, Jaguar, and many other well known brands that have been sold off to companies with terrible reputations for quality.<p>Ultimately the only way to guarantee quality would be to vote for politicians who support strong regulations and a strong regulatory apparatus.')
