Something like 20% of people self-report it, but the actual prevalence is only ~4%. What most people seem to mean when they say they have it is &quot;I can&#x27;t sing at all.&quot; But really tone-deafness is not about singing poorly, it&#x27;s about not being able to discriminate tones. This includes you vocalizing them, yes, but it also includes you hearing them. In fact I would hazard a guess that if you are able to tell you are off-pitch while you&#x27;re singing, then that might in and of itself preclude tone deafness (although my understanding may be off there).<p>What I do know is that most people with amusia cannot and do not enjoy listening to music. Many say it sounds like noise, or just sounds unpleasant. And People with amusia tend to have other, related issues -- difficulties discerning pitch in spoken sentences (was that intonation representing a question or a statement? that sort of thing).')
