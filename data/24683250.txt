Honestly, I listen to loads of British bands circa 1990-1994. And from Stone Roses at Spike Island 1990 to Oasis first gig at Glastonbury in 1994, there is a veritable time capsule of those epic days on YouTube. I concur with the sentiment here that if you ever wanted to Kickstart a documentary I believe the response would be tremendous ;)')
