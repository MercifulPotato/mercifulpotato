Even better actually, as reactor fuel is basically just a very expensive and pure heavy metal &amp; only slightly radioactive. Only once the reactor is first started all sorts of unstable radiation releasing elements are formed in the fuel.<p>So if you only start the reactor once it is in space &amp; pack the fuel securely for launch, all should be good to go! :-)')
