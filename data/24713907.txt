I&#x27;ve had equity compensation from most of my jobs, and I never really felt strongly GP&#x27;s statement of &quot;What&#x27;s good for shareholders is also good for [...] tech employees&quot;. My company&#x27;s (public) stock could double and it wouldn&#x27;t materially affect my lifestyle. For non-public companies I&#x27;ve worked for, the equity usually ended up worth $0. In one company, I was able to sell all my equity at the height of its stock prices, and made maybe enough for 2 months of rent. I think the idea that equity allows employees and companies to share success is kind of overblown.')
