Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607995563, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25425220, text='&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m pretty sure what&#x27;s going to happen is the law will make it clear that porn generated from your likeness and distributed without your consent is as illegal as revenge porn. Then a bunch of people who did it anyway will go to jail and that will put a strong chilling effect on the whole thing. In most cases, the people with the motive an ability to make machine-generated porn of a particular person will be relatively easy to find.<p>&gt; I just find this incredibly difficult to believe, unless this &quot;ban on user content&quot; extends to a ban on general computing. And maybe that&#x27;s where we&#x27;ll end up, but I think that&#x27;s a much more malicious result than generated porn. Or maybe anonymity will disappear online, which I find fairly scary, but is another clear thrust we&#x27;re seeing.<p>You&#x27;re not thinking about this clearly, and are veering off into overreaction and catastrophizing.<p>Machine-generated porn of celebrities is far harder to police, because they&#x27;re celebrities.  There are thousands, maybe millions, of people who have the desire and technical means to make porn of them.<p>For regular people, the story is different.  For the most part, no one&#x27;s going to want to make porn of some random person they don&#x27;t know.  The only people with an interest in making or consuming machine-generated porn of a particular normal person are people who have some connection to them, which is a <i>far</i> smaller group.  That makes enforcement possible with <i>regular investigative tools</i>.  Enforcement doesn&#x27;t even need to be 100% to be effective at creating a chilling effect, just make examples of some bitter and angry exes and creepy stalkers.<p>Celebrities are also a pretty rarefied group.  Once this problem starts affecting everyday people, there will be more electoral pressure for dealing with it legislatively, just like with revenge porn.  At least some cases of &quot;leaked celebrity sex tapes&quot; would probably count as illegal revenge porn today.')
