I grew up believing certain things until, around 30, I went to look up the figures and noticed clichés and prejudices were more correct than teachers and journalists. What a world we live in. Not a situation I’d desire!<p>To start with, it seems Galileo didn’t say « Pero se mueve ». If you pull the string from there, he can’t possibly have been incarcerated for saying that the Earth wasn’t the center of universe, because Kepler more or less said the same before and wasn’t incarcerated. All of that, which I had been taught in school, is false. The king of France was guillotined because he wanted to organize a referendum for him, which he was confident to win, not because he was unpopular. And so it goes on to XXth century, and the to XXIth century, with the feminism and racism narratives. When you notice the ILO’s universal treaty of 1928 against slavery of every human on Earth...<p>...didn’t include males from 18 to 49. Who had to wait until the UN treaty of 1957 against forced labour, if I remember, to be included.<p>I’m praying every night for the world to pop out of this censorship of reality. But praying is less efficient than censorship.')
