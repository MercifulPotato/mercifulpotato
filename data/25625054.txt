Once you take into account the brand new entire replacement unit and the disposal of the old one (not to mention the portion of electric powered by fossil fuels anyways) it just doesn&#x27;t make sense. You get a much better return on replacing windows, sealing cracks, adding insulation where needed, etc.')
