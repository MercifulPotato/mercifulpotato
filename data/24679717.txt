E.g. a list of 1000 points with the keys “latitude” and “longitude”.<p>I can think of various more compact ways of structuring the same data, but JSON + gzip encodes the naive structure in a very compact way with very little programmer effort.<p>In general, the design seems to miss a compact representation of an array of homogeneous records, which is a common use case IME.<p>Edit: Also I agree with GP regarding NUL and other comments about no optional stuff.')
