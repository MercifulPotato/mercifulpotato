Styled-components can do everything sass&#x2F;less&#x2F;postcss can and more, you don&#x27;t need random binaries installed globally to transpile it to css when building, you get theming for free, it is easier to understand because you can ditch the arbitrary mappings of state variables to css classes, and even get types, it works with SSR and promotes one-file-components which is heavily used in Vue. Oh, you can even extend css syntax to fix small annoyances or add features.')
