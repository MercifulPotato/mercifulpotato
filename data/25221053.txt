I work at a place where I&#x27;m required to explain urban planning issues while using the simplest-possible subjects in all sentences. So, I can write, &quot;Transit improves traffic,&quot; but I can&#x27;t write, &quot;To the extent that transit enables residents to reach destinations more efficiently than driving, a greater number of proportion of people can travel without worsening traffic.&quot; This isn&#x27;t a great example because I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a simpler way to write my second sentence. The pattern I&#x27;ve noticed, however, is that I often need to be intellectually dishonest to write simple sentences with simple subjects, because they make the world seem simpler than it is. A complex world — full of gradations and marginal costs — often requires complex sentences.')
