I first chose the tab I wanted to record, then it switched me to that tab with a bar at the top saying &quot;stop&quot;.<p>I thought it&#x27;s being recorded. After I recorded everything, I clicked stop and switched back to zest, I noticed that there is a &quot;record&quot; button.<p>It turned out that I need to select a tab, then switch back to zest and click record.')
