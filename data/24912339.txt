But as others have pointed out when you tell people &quot;You can do all this stuff without coding,&quot; but when what you&#x27;re really doing is making it easier for people to code while calling it &quot;not code,&quot; you&#x27;re forcing them to reinvent this history of computing, but now they don&#x27;t have the language to connect what they&#x27;re doing to what the industry has been doing since 1959.<p>But the article is just very self contradictory. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to say &quot;The No-Code Generation is arriving,&quot; while also saying that &quot;Lua has never been more popular,&quot; or that we just had &quot;the largest increase among all of the [Advanced Placement] organizationâ€™s dozens of tests&quot; or &quot;Meanwhile at top universities, computer science has emerged as the top or among the top majors, pulling in hundreds of new students per campus per year.&quot; Quite clearly, besides &quot;no-code&quot; platforms, there quite clearly is a growth in interest in traditional coding tools as well.')
