Not going into &quot;fine china&quot; or whatever crap my mother used to hoard.<p>When I move between flats, I might reuse some furniture but a lot of it I would have to sell. I would lose loads of money if I would buy expensive furniture and then sell it for 70% of what I paid for, I don&#x27;t even think I could get that much for used furniture, probably 50% would be more realistic.<p>Cheap IKEA I can basically give away and not have to haggle for price with cheapskates over the phone (mental health toll for me is too high if I have to sell something). If it is broken I can dump it and since it is cardboard it probably will not be that bad for environment.<p>If someone is having steady life conditions for next 20 years then he can afford &quot;life time&quot; items. With current situation I would not count on that and I&#x27;d rather have stuff that I can easily dispose&#x2F;give away in case I have to move to smaller apartment because I cannot afford current one anymore.<p>Owning things also has its costs, like if I am renting flat and have shitty neighbors I can just move to other place. When I would own a flat I am stuck with whatever comes my way.')
