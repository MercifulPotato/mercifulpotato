I personally assign less and less value to it. I just meant to point out the fact that our fractional reserve banking system is &#x27;built-to-fail&#x27; by design.<p>The helicopter money and trillion dollar injections can only last if the banks are solvent - they cant be peddling&#x27; garbage debt,,,they never stopped and some market will bubble again and wash out the meek..<p>This constant balancing act that we play with the US economy and global markets incites fear and greed.<p>Back before US notes and banks, we had the goldsmith. Goldsmith takes custody of gold, and issues dollars&#x2F;bonds&#x2F;notch for amounts on transactions... as it is much easier to hand someone a slip of paper than moving gold around constantly. OK cool except, wait - nothing is stopping goldsmith from making multiple slips for the same stack of gold. Uh oh - The classic double spend!<p>Now, 2021, We have solutions to this now in the form of blockchain&#x2F;crypto. It is the most easily accessible sound form of money...just not quite easy enough yet.')
