I haven&#x27;t decided to switch, but I&#x27;ve been thinking about it for a while. Like many others, I wouldn&#x27;t be switching from <i>vim</i>, which is just my text editor, but from from an assortment of CLI tools that make up my &quot;IDE&quot; (perhaps just &quot;DE&quot; would be more accurate).<p>In theory, I don&#x27;t like the idea of my text editor being my OS; I prefer the unix philosophy for tools, which interoperate via standards and are widely portable.<p>But, having recently attempted to write a bunch of posix-compliant shell scripts... I think <i>practically</i> emacs might just be a <i>better</i> OS. Particularly in the sense of everything being more uniform.')
