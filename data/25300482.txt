Python maintainer of Nixpkgs here.<p>What we need is to be able to use a resolver such as included by pip or poetry, to build up our package set. In Nixpkgs this is nowadays unfortunately done manually, and I suppose the same goes for Guix. In Nixpkgs the reason is simple: too eager pinning makes it impossible to resolve a package set that works with the entire set.<p>Now that pip has a resolver what is needed is a way to use constraints not to set only lower and upper bounds, but to enforce a version when resolving. That makes it usable for downstream integrators to construct their primary package set. One could then even make the next step and construct &quot;stable&quot; sets that extend the primary set.')
