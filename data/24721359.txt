Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[24721611], score=None, time=1602177366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720873, text='MS is not IBM though.<p>Azure is a &#x27;best effort&#x27; attempt at a seriously important strategic vertical by a very smart company with deep pockets.<p>MS would throw zillions of dollars and blood at Azure to make it work.<p>MS has very deep enterprise relationships, way more so than Amazon or Google and in the long run, that may be the advantage.<p>A lot of &#x27;fancy services&#x27; that we see are not &#x27;the thing&#x27; that corps want: they want to spin up servers, basic networking and security, do things at scale. That&#x27;s the bread and butter and Azure can surely provide that.<p>Being on the buying side of some of these things, even 100% aware that &#x27;other offers may be better&#x27; it&#x27;s extremely hard to fend off the professionalism of a well managed sales effort. It&#x27;s even rational: entities that are so operationally effective at managing the relationship &#x27;surely must have tech that works&#x27;. And it&#x27;s a &#x27;safe choice&#x27;.<p>I always assumed Azure would carve something out, IBM, not so much. Oracle, somewhere in between.')
