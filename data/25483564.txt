I&#x27;m an audiophile - I&#x27;ve spent countless hours just sitting in a chair in front of a stereo system I&#x27;ve spent a couple thousand on. If I ever lapse into non-attention to the music, I try and get back to the music. It&#x27;s like mindfulness meditation, but unlike the monk, my mind is focusing on a sense, not emptying itself.<p>On the other hand, I can&#x27;t lie in bed for more than two minutes without deep introspection - my morality, arguments for and against all positions, what projects I want to work on, the papers I&#x27;ve read, etc.<p>But before writing some comments on this website and elsewhere, I&#x27;ll have a deep think about what I&#x27;m arguing, and why.

Even writing this comment sadness comes over me.<p>To think that in the 19th century, there were men being compared to Hegel and Feuerbach at age 21. What the hell am I doing?')
