I&#x27;m not distributing any GPLd code.<p>Well, IANAL, but I fail to see how you are bound by the GPL in any way on that situation.<p>There used to be a market of proprietary software patches, that fixed stuff the software creator didn&#x27;t bother changing. AFAIK, nobody ever contested its legality until EULA came and made it illegal to the end-user (instead of the distributor). There is a famous guy who sells proprietary security patches for Linux, isn&#x27;t there? Your example is much clearer than patches.<p>The situation of RedHat distributing both isn&#x27;t as clear.')
