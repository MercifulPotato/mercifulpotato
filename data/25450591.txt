I use dvorak, she uses qwerty. About 75% of the time when the layout is switched back from qwerty to dvorak it becomes completly fubar, and all layouts output non-sense garbage until a restart. Because the layouts are broken, I can&#x27;t save any of my terminal work.<p>I&#x27;m still pretty on the fence about things, but honestly I&#x27;d say linux and os-x are pretty even as far as shit breaking, and imo linux is a little bit better. I remember the old days when you sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade &amp; pray, but stuff is pretty stable even on distros like arch these days.<p>Every time there&#x27;s a major update for os x, I already know it will definitely break something for me. Catalina broke most my game collection that could run on os x to begin with, and I&#x27;ll be waiting at least another couple months before upgrading to big sur.<p>This isn&#x27;t to try and invalidate your experience, but just saying that mine has been: Switched to OS X because things were more stable and I need a solid work machine, but linux is getting more stable while my faith in apple&#x27;s software quality goes down dramatically every year.')
