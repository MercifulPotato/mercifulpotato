I think it makes sense to try and give smaller municipalities equal footing with larger municipalities.  E.g. in the global scheme we think it is a bad thing when super powers stomp all over the little guy.  Same thinking applies internally.  Each state is sort of like a mini country.<p>In general our country seems to try and prevent a tyranny of the majority, which is one of the historical flaws of pure democracy.  E.g. see kulaks in USSR, jews in Nazi germany, other minority groups in the US etc.')
