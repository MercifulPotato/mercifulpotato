The squashed blurry bad-quality image isn&#x27;t all that useful, and you&#x27;re never actually sure if it is or isn&#x27;t loading a better version in the background. I&#x27;m not so sure if it&#x27;s really better UX, because either 1) you care about the image quality in your use case and a blurry version just won&#x27;t do, or 2) the image quality isn&#x27;t all that important and you should be serving smallish images anyway (like the Guardian), possibly clickable to load a high-res version for those who desire it.')
