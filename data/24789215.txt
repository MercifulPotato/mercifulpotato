This was made more complex as the reservation system we had to call used EBCDIC on ancient mainframes and often failed to properly encode a person&#x27;s name with non ASCII letters like Ã… often resulting in tickets that could not be used. The name would look fine in our booking flow and email, but the actual ticket data would be wrong leaving the customer angry at the time of flying.<p>So supporting names is not only an issue with changing them, but preserving the actual spelling through all systems you call. I actually spent 4 years in college (long ago) with no vowels in my name, and never could get them to fix it (even my diploma had it spelled wrong).')
