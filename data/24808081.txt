But, it&#x27;s strengths are being federated, open-source, and integrated with an exosystem of open-source community and productivity tools.<p>One additional note, our small cooperative uses a managed version of Nextcloud from Web Hosting. The cost starts at $35&#x2F;month for fully managed or $7&#x2F;month to update Nextcloud manually via the settings page (which is surprisingly simple). The Web Hosting Web page and sign-up process are slightly klunky, but their customer care has been excellent in my experience.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webo.hosting&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webo.hosting&#x2F;</a>')
