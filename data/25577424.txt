Their administration purposefully suppressed CDC information and pursued a herd immunity strategy without expressing it. You can&#x27;t say &quot;beyond trumps own incompetence and personality&quot; without also saying &quot;without Xi&#x27;s incompetence and personality&quot;... I don&#x27;t think that is intellectually fair.<p>I&#x27;m happy to criticise china for the things it could do better:<p>- It&#x27;s fast approach to full blown dictatorship, the death of the party, the rise of Xi<p>- Or its suppression&#x2F;persecution of people actually trying to improve things for the Chinese people (Wuhan reporters, Rights activists etc)<p>But &quot;Forced labour&quot;... while developed nations like the US have prison labour? Persecution of Uighers, while Guantanamo is still a thing. Fix the things in your own back yard, which you have control over then from the moral high ground try and fix further abroad, otherwise no one (including the Chinese) pay no attention to what they see as just agg-prop. HN loves to jump on the latest china bashing and just make excuses&#x2F;justifications US based domestic problems')
