Dismanting regulated marketplaces, in favour of corporates and contract faming have made it redundant and only gives an illusion of choice -<p>- Farmers cannot sell to individual users at a scale because they don&#x27;t have any distribution networks.<p>- Weakly regulated mandis are as good as free market with no real protection.<p>- Contract farming with corporates shifts the balance of power away from farmers as they do not have the capability to negotiate on equal terms with them. This is made worse with the new farm laws deliberately favouring the corporates.')
