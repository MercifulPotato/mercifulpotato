Big Sur’s icons for <i>technologies</i> (e.g. the PrefPane icons representing system components) are weirder-shaped than ever.<p>Thus, I feel like this change actually helps to differentiate the two. Sort of like how capital letters help differentiate proper nouns in English. You can tell when an app is “mentioning” another app visually (as in a plugin, or an “Open In” action) — without even knowing what the other app <i>is</i> — just because it has “app shape.”<p>I would also point out that this was already something useful in iOS; in the App Store, you can visually differentiate regular apps from iMessage app-plugins by their icon shape. Those iMessage app-plugins are then always “mentioned” in iMessage itself using that same shape.')
