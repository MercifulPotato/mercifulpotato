Most people aren&#x27;t at all tidy with their commit history, and I&#x27;ll often see a PR with a fairly small final diff (maybe a couple hundred lines changed total) with several useless one-word commit messages like &quot;fix&quot;.<p>And then after the PR has gone through review, most people tack on extra commits with equally-useless commit messages like &quot;addressing feedback&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s infrequent that I see PRs with commit histories that actually chronicle the history of the change itself; it&#x27;s more a chronicle of the developer&#x27;s changing thought processes as they try different things, go down blind alleys, change approaches several times.<p>Most of the individual commits have test suite failures and some of them don&#x27;t even compile, so it&#x27;s impossible to bisect across them if an issue is later found.<p>In those cases, I wish people would just squash (and some do, where I work).  Yes, you lose information and separation, but I&#x27;d rather have one large working commit than 15 small broken commits followed by one working commit.  Ideally people would curate things before submitting their PR, but I&#x27;ve found that most people just don&#x27;t care, or don&#x27;t understand git well enough to even attempt to do it.<p>Sometimes I toy around with the idea of trying to teach people (what I consider) better practices, and insist they are followed, but we all have a limited amount of social capital in our workplaces, and I&#x27;m not convinced this is something worth spending it on.')
