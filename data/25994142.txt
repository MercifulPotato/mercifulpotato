Not that that IS what is happening here, but getting caught out doing that is beyond discrediting.<p>its not good policy to build an abberant world view among your population that will culminate in being crushed by reality, this is why people panic in the first place, and the solution seems to be keep cycling that way so that panic is assauged by building another alternate belief that looks comfortable. its like the trope where someone is hiding&#x2F;slash disposing of the body while having a conversation accross the house designed to prevent someone walking in before its all hidden away.')
