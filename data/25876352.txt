I suspect more than one car maker has considered making their own fab, but the costs are just too high. (My company has in fact done that, we didn&#x27;t open a fab last year because of the costs - I&#x27;m not sure that was the right decision given the costs we have spent porting working software to the replacement instead, and we have a fraction of the volume of the big auto makers)<p>Manufacturing is a core competency of any car maker (second to supply chain). I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see a fab partner ship between automakers in the future just to ensure they can get the chips they need. This will be at least as much about ensuring old chips don&#x27;t go obsolete as about supply.')
