It would be fun&#x2F;educating for the regular folk (like me, who doesn&#x27;t know each muscle group and&#x2F;or their names) to just &#x27;browse&#x27; the human body and see the name of that muscle group and what it does.<p>Edit: on the parts that are not a muscle group (e.g. face, &quot;love-handles&quot;, feer&#x2F;hands, &#x27;throat&#x27;, etc.) maybe paint them grey so they are visibly distinguishable from the &#x27;muscle groups&#x27;. I was veri curious to see if the &#x27;love-handles&#x27; region has any use apart storing fat.')
