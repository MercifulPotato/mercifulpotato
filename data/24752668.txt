(Though employment of doctors itself is quite different from how hiring normal employees work, they&#x27;re often more like independent contractors or running their own practices)<p>If an institution is hiring a fresh software developer, then a CS diploma does not even reliably guarantee that they know the basics of software engineering (e.g. see yesterday&#x27;s discussion in HN <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24740765" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24740765</a> ) - so you have to do all the evaluation yourself, and neither you nor the candidate would be willing to spend as much time and effort on that evaluation as a lawyer or doctor does, so it definitely is trickier to evaluate since you don&#x27;t (can&#x27;t) have enough information.')
