They&#x27;ve had many instances in the media over the years documenting this type of exploitation, all in non-US locations to be sure, but nevertheless, it&#x27;s a concern that has tarnished the brand a bit over the years.<p>Furthermore, non-unionized partners seem unlikely to be part of the criteria on the face of it, if you&#x27;re attempting to build a presumably high-end product like an Apple car.  If worker benefits deriving from union activity are a large enough threat to your product, it&#x27;s unlikely that you&#x27;re going to be able to command high margins on it, as Apple seems to do.<p>Lastly, while it&#x27;s one of many minor concerns, perhaps, I find all of this quite implausible, given the stature of the Apple brand.  It&#x27;s a huge risk to potentially dilute the Apple image with a failed or likely initially not-quite-great partnership with a company like Hyundai.  Why do that and not approach one of the dozens of other higher end manufacturers like Mercedes Benz, or BMW, that are likely wanting for battery tech anyway?')
