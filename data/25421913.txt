Even Windows 10 interface looks better.<p>Even though Material UI is functional, there is something off about it. Something is weird about it, and I can&#x27;t tell what. Maybe there&#x27;s a word for it. It feels&#x2F;looks cheap, like designed for the lowest common denominator device. Like... at least add a backdrop filter&#x2F;blur to it, it gives a different feeling. The current flat design feels <i>dead</i> and soul less.<p>The <i>only</i> place where material UI is suitable is Google search. Not Gmail, not GCP and DEFINATELY NOT on stock android.')
