Switching to Bitcoin would not change the expenditure in those areas one iota. Not. One. Iota.<p>If anything the US dollar is freeloading on the expenditure there.<p>However, setting that aside, it&#x27;s pretty trivial to disprove your argument. If you linearly scaled the energy usage of Bitcoin to the number of transactions per second currently handled by <i>just</i> Visa alone, Bitcoin would require more energy than the entire world generates a few times over, and generate more e-waste than the entire world generates today. 7 transactions per second is enough for a decently flea market or a Costco, not a global economy.<p>&gt; Bitcoin would be an utter failure if it sacrificed security in order to gain speed and efficiency.<p>Which is why it shouldn&#x27;t exist. We can do better. We <i>are</i> doing better already.')
