The <i>name</i> is metaphorical because it’s supposed to evoke the image of things flowing through it but that’s where it ends. A Linux pipe makes no effort to pretend that it behaves like a physical pipe. But it does abstract the implementation details about how data is sent to and retrieved from it.<p>An email program where the user is shown sheets of paper and envelopes is an illusion. The underlying implementation now has to modify its behavior to fit the physical properties of paper and envelopes to some degree. Letters only have one destination, CCing and BCCing now means copying and sending bundles.')
