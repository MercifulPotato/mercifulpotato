Even houses always go over time and money and that is fairly straight forward.<p>These days, I only give estimates in terms of <i>units</i> but without numbers. Hours, days, weeks, months, quarters or years. Some relatively small number of those units. If you want a quote it will take an extra 1&#x2F;4 of the estimate worth of time for an exact timeline. I really wish we would treat sales people the same way. &quot;How much money is this contract for? What date will it be signed?&quot;')
