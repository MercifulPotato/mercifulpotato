Even when we think about potentially highly advanced aliens, we still assume they&#x27;ll have a psychology similar to ours, and they&#x27;ll just be more advanced technologically (ie. the aliens and ants analogy).”<p>Very true. A lot of our behaviors and instincts are based on how we procreate and the environment we live in. For example if you live forever or don’t have the pressure to procreate you will have a totally different perspective on the universe.<p>Lifeforms that have developed differently most likely would have motivations we can’t even fathom to understand.')
