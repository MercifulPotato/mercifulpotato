Cargo does not support building other languages than Rust well. When you have projects that span multiple languages, your build system needs to know about dependencies between pieces that cross the language boundary and also needs to know about how to produce libraries, perform linking, etc. On top of that, lots of infrastructure features like remote workers, build artifact caching, etc are just not supported by Cargo.<p>Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t have insider knowledge of how stuff actually works at Google, but I&#x27;ve been using Bazel in cross language environments for a couple of years now and I have read the papers on Googles build infrastructure.')
