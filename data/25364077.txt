It provides much more insight and context on the situation.<p>For me, the whole thing comes back to the news article. It is absolutely bonkers no matter the circumstance. Huffington Post should not have published anything without verifying that she was actually a criminal. \nClearly Tesla thought they screwed up as well or they wouldn&#x27;t have fired the guy responsible for it two days later.<p>I completely understand wanting to have her removed from the company and the way it was done. It&#x27;s just that you cannot go around labelling someone a criminal for life if all they have done is make a few middle managers angry by going over their heads. If she truly is a &quot;criminal&quot; for secret recordings then it&#x27;s on Tesla to take that to the proper authorities. \nOnce the proper authorities (i.e. the justice system, jury of your peers, not power tripping middle managers) determines that you are a criminal, then feel free to share that for reference checks and write as many news articles as you want broadcasting it. But not until then, and if that kind of rule is broken, the penalty for those that do should be very severe.')
