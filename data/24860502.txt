In instance mode, you could setup so us-east1 is like 441, us-east2 is 442, us-west1 is 451 etc. And then you wouldn&#x27;t have tcp 4-tuple collisions on the instance.<p>Similarly for ip mode, you could put the same host in for ports 440-449 and get 10x 55,000 connections, or however many ports you need to hit your numbers.<p>(Port numbers chosen for example only, check &#x2F;etc&#x2F;services if you don&#x27;t want to stomp on allocations for services you&#x27;re probably not using)<p>Thanks!')
