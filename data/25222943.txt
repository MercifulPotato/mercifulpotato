How many people are buying SUVs? I live im Britain, there are hardly any SUV&#x27;s, most of the world is not living in US.<p>A roadster is not just a faster car, its tiny, useless and expensive to boot. It can&#x27;t travel a mile down a road in Russia without getting stuck. It still can&#x27;t (legally) exceed the speed limit. It&#x27;s utility advantage over a compact is zero.<p>If people bought roadsters, that still has no relevance to flying cars.<p>People live in cities because that&#x27;s where the well paid jobs are. Many mouve out when they hit pention. It&#x27;s a completely separate set of tradeoffs that has nothing to do with the subject<p>The whole argument about flying cars makes no sense.<p>&gt; people arent willing to pay extra for faster or bigger planes<p>Its the other way round - people pay extra for smaller planes that take them directly to their destination, as opposed to taking a big plane and then change flights in a spoke and hub model.<p>Also planes are not any slower, speeds of  all subsonic planes have been very consistent.')
