Thus any competent lawyer workin a case against a self-driving car company in the case where their car killed someone, will argue (rightly!) that those sane lives could also have been saved by less high-tech measures, such as AI detecting undesired human behaviour and putting the car in limp-home-mode or similar.<p>In that case you are saving the same lives and not causing any new fatalities, but it&#x27;s not a super cool tech that will attract lots of investment. So the choice to implement self driving was ultimately putting profits over human lives.')
