Above all, such behaviour signals to me that there is only 1 person making commits &#x2F; merging PRs and they are kind of tired of OSS (which is fine, by the way).<p>I think it&#x27;s more nuanced than that. It&#x27;s perhaps more &quot;I care if you have problems only if you have put in the effort to try and fix them. Then we can work together on getting it fixed for everyone&quot;.<p>&quot;Issues closed, PRs welcome&quot; is a perfectly reasonable way to run a healthy project.')
