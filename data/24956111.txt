It can be legitimately unclear if the person in the next entrance is going to enter the roundabout before you, especially because the exact moment a car counts as &quot;in&quot; the roundabout is a fuzzy measure that people could disagree on.  If they&#x27;re going slower than you, then whether you or they are supposed to yield can be unclear.  So you have to handle their intent, not just follow a checklist.<p>This is a rare situation, but <i>so is having to worry about the intent of other drivers at a 4 way stop</i>.<p>&gt; time their arrival<p>You definitely have to time the arrival at roundabouts.  Cars can&#x27;t stop instantly, so any situation that involves yielding means you have to time things.<p>&gt; The roundabout serialises the traffic flow so that a driver entering the roundabout need only deal with the next vehicle in the lane.<p>You need to pay attention to other cars coming up too, the ones that <i>will</i> be in front you at the roundabout in addition to the cars that <i>are</i> in front of you while approaching the roundabout.  This could easily be more than three.<p>And if a 4 way stop is experiencing a lot of traffic, it goes into a mode where cars alternate in pairs, so you only have to look at the turn signal of the car across you.  This specific case is actually easier than a busy small roundabout!<p>&gt; To be honest though, I think you know all of this, and you’re simply engaging with me in bad faith.<p>I&#x27;m not engaging in bad faith at all.  You&#x27;re overestimating the problems with 4 way stops, while arguing as if [small] roundabouts are perfect.  Neither one is perfect, and neither one is dangerous.')
