But it&#x27;s hardly undemocratic.<p>The EU has always struggled to explain how it works, why it&#x27;s structure works the way it does. But all the leaders in the EU are elected, just not always via direct elections. A process that actually isn&#x27;t that unusual in the world.<p>The US is actually a bit of an outlier, because they have direct elections for almost every position in government, with some slightly mixed results. The EU it&#x27;s common for countries to select and organise their executive bodies via in-direct elections. For example in the UK our prime minister isn&#x27;t directly elected, the general public didn&#x27;t &quot;choose&quot; Boris Johnson. Instead the conservative party did, via its own methodology which it can change any time it does.<p>The current byzantine system exists out of a need to somehow balance the power of the EU as a federal entity, against the sovereignty of the individual nations. With irony come from the fact that the &quot;unelected&quot; leader only exist because it give <i>more</i> power to leaders of the member states, and takes it away from the EU as an organisation independent of its member states and their elected governments.')
