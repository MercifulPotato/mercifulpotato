Is the claim made more meaningful by these specifics?<p>Yes? It&#x27;s a different claim. Somebody doing X and a culture where many people turn a blind eye to and enable X aren&#x27;t the same thing.<p>&gt; People who regularly meet and discuss things are aligned on the part that counts. They might not be organized, but they&#x27;re definitely aligned<p>We&#x27;re talking about forums on the internet. Are you an I &quot;aligned&quot; because we had this discussion here?<p>Also, please do respond to my edit.
