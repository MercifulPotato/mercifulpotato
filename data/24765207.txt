And if it is not algorithmically bad, there are many other errors lurking in dark corners.<p>I am a HPC cluster admin as day job.  Many years ago, we had a (for us back then) rather large project.  Several million hours of CPU time.  During a support case, I happened to stumble across the source code for the project.  And I was pretty surprised.  It was a few hundred lines of Pascal, compiled with fpc.  I knew about the language being used and was told other compilers dont make a lot of difference &quot;because the code only uses 32-bit values&quot;.  Hmm, suspicious, but you can&#x27;t dictate how people solve their problems.  At least not easily.  But the small LOC count, and a upcoming weekend without a lot to do got me thinking.  So I sat down and more or less mechanically translated the code to C++.  Making use of templates to move a value from runtime to compile time.  And bang, I got a speedup of 5x.  So a few hours of time spent by someone <i>NOT</i> involved in the project at all helped to save around 5m hours CPU time.<p>Of course, this is a pretty extreme example and not really representative for the scientific computing community.  Still, with my experience watching people run big jobs I am estimating that we waste around 50% of our computing time (world wide) on insufficiently thought-out implementations and lack of knowledge about the actual architecture the code is running on.\nSometimes, I am happy if a users really knows the difference between OpenMP and OpenMPI :-)')
