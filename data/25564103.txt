It sounds like you were eating larks tongue in aspic and are now buying year-old potatoes at the Latvian coop. Remember, some in an international audience may have done just that at some point. Is that what happened?<p>Whoops, my bad!<p>Due to the step nature of purchasing food, the break even points change depending on exactly which meals we&#x27;re talking about dining out for. The more you eat out, the higher the cost per home cooked meals due to loss of economy of scale and spoilage.<p>My wife, the keeper of the budgets, calculated that the break even point for work lunches was $11 a lunch. This is doable, but it basically means relegating yourself to low end fast food. In the area where I lived (Southern California) that put even Chipotle out of reach for my preferred configuration. There are certainly places that can reliably deliver 800 calories for less, but that&#x27;ll cost you in the long run in different ways.<p>&gt; Wonder if a functional kitchen should be thought of as an expense-management device. No matter what the financial situation, in the US without a kitchen you can always find something to eat to keep body and soul together, but with a functional kitchen you can always eat something both tasty and healthy (if you can cook).<p>I think that&#x27;s a pretty good way to think about it. As GP has pointed out you do need to purchase an actual kitchen too, but I think that the cost is fairly marginal compared to buying a home in most markets.<p>&gt; You can choose to cook if you have the cash; you may need to do that if you don’t. The fact that you always can is a very consoling fact in rough economic times.<p>If one wants true consolation in rough economic times, buy a chest freezer. Nothing provides emotional security like a hundred pounds of meat and vegetables frozen in the garage.')
