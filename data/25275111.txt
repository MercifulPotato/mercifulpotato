You could have exposure to an asset that you want to hedge. So being able to purchase a financial instrument that&#x27;s negatively correlated with an asset price is useful.<p>2. Putting downward price pressure on an asset sends an important market signal and reduces volatility<p>3. It provides income to owners of this asset as they have an option to lend to others and earn interest off of that.<p>4.
