You can use them more &quot;freely&quot; if you keep your raw data in open formats.<p>You need something more complicated than what can be done using BigQuery&#x2F;Snowflake (that remaining 20%, though I would say 10%)? Export the dataset to CSV&#x2F;Parquet&#x2F;Avro&#x2F;ORC&#x2F;whatever and process it with anything, including Dataproc&#x2F;HDInsight&#x2F;EMR or even Databricks. That&#x27;s actually a common pattern.')
