Arduino had&#x2F;has the same impact (both the hardware simplicity and C SDKs in the IDE). It&#x27;s intimidating jumping into embedded if step 1 is &quot;use the vendor-supplied startup code to enter into `main()`, then start writing baremetal C with so-so (and in some cases no) C lib support owing to being on a resource constrained platform.&quot; MicroPython doesn&#x27;t offer a full Python standard lib implementation, but the standard Python syntax is definitely more accessible to a broader group of developers who may not be familiar with C or Rust.<p>OpenMV has used MicroPython to great effect. It&#x27;s really impressive what they&#x27;ve done, especially in the realm of porting vision algorithms to constrained platforms like Cortex-M&#x27;s.')
