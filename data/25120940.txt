Item(by='moonchild', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605596278, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25120892, text='Ghidra is of course the most mature and deals the best with convoluted code.  It has the least unnecessary type munging.<p>But I&#x27;m <i>very</i> impressed that retdec was able to to get in an early return.  Deeply nested ifs are a big pain point for me in ghidra, in cases when the code would be much easier to read with an early return.<p>Edit: I wonder how it&#x27;s implemented.  Presumably you need some heuristic to decide to duplicate a basic block; perhaps that could be exposed to the user?')
