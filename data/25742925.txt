Ubiquiti isn&#x27;t the risk here.<p>- UniFi features that depend on WebSocket and WebRTC are unavailable when using self-signed certificates. This includes live stats updating, device terminal, airView, etc.  (Those features can be used in the cloud UI... if your Internet connection happens to be working fine.)<p>- Valid SSL certificates would be easy to auto-provision these days with LetsEncrypt. There are some minor challenges around port forwarding &#x2F; relay, but that isn&#x27;t rocket science.  If Plex can figure it out, Ubiquiti can figure it out :)')
