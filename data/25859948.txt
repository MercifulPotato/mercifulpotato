In the case of working on the hottest days of the year in full PPE, additional mandatory breaks and hydration are required. Additional airflow should be added if in a poorly ventilated space and compatible with the work being done. PPE used should match the risks presented, which should be well documented before starting work. Shortcuts to the standard process, failure to identify when things start going wrong, etc. cause injuries and deaths.<p>Safety culture is super hard to build, taking years of collaboration between management, workers, and unions if applicable. Every group wants nothing more than for the employees to go home the same way they went to work.<p>Any one time you do a task with less than required PPE, probably nothing will happen. But over the course of a career, those &quot;this one time&quot; instances add up and eventually will cause an injury or death.')
