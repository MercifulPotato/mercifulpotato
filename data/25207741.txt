I bought it in the US when I was there on vacation. This was when the dollar was at such a low that I got the device for at the time the equivalent of something like 1200€.<p>I couldn&#x27;t sell that device for half of that a year and a half later. I got a newer laptop in 2016, again very specced out for a laptop. About 1800€, couldn&#x27;t sell it for 800€ 2 years later. I still use that last one because I didn&#x27;t want to sell it so far under what the market value <i>should</i> be.<p>If you try to sell anything Apple related that isn&#x27;t more than 5 years old you won&#x27;t have that problem at all. You can get a good value for the device and sell it without too much of a hassle.<p>Even if you&#x27;re a student you would likely be better off buying the cheapest macbook you can find (refurbished or second hand if needed). If you don&#x27;t like the OS you can just install Windows or a Linux distro on it.<p>Are you sure about that 250$ number? Because I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very realistic number.')
