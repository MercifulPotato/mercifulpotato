Compared to the United States, Finland seem to have had things relatively under control in terms of supplies?<p>I mean, compared to the United States, Finland seems to have done pretty well since somebody who screwed up <i>actually lost their job.</i> Consider the difference in point of view: our federal government were screwing up <i>constantly</i> with PPE supplies and nobody ever resigned. All a topic for a different story, I guess.')
