And change the law so that US citizens residing overseas with no US-sourced income are exempted from filing and paying taxes.<p>Other countries that wish to have leading edge commercial fabs, e.g. Germany or Netherlands, should compete with USA and try to get their passports to TSMC employees first.  Tell them your country does not tax citizens on overseas income, and like Taiwan, has universal healthcare, high-speed rail, and gun control.  Netherlands can also advertise that TSMC employees likely already have some Dutch friends at ASML.')
