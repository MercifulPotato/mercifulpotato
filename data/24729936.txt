It replies poorly to the electricity storage problem, because the production chain efficiency is really low, as low as 15-20% : electrolysis has a ~45% efficiency, then compressing the H2 to 700 bars consumes 30% of the stored energy, then you must add distribution and transport (and mostly can&#x27;t use the huge, existing gas transportation infrastructure). While batteries have an efficiency over 90%, ditto (already existing) HT network.<p>Also H2 isn&#x27;t great as a dense power storage for vehicles either; the H2 plane is but a pipe dream, because it requires entirely new ways to store energy aboard, therefore probably requires entirely new planes with new architectures (like flying wings), huge new airports infrastructures...<p>All in all, methane would be a saner, simpler target : you can create methane from water, CO2 and electricity; we already have all the infrastructure to transport, store and distribute methane; and using methane in vehicles of any kind is a no-brainer and requires no breakthrough or radical change.<p>I don&#x27;t believe a word of all the H2 hype.')
