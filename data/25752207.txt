The problem, as I see it, are that journalists are mistaken wrt to what the facts are or at least what can be demonstrated), and when questions really are pertinent. A host can be as confrontational as they want, so long as they are bi-partisan (i.e fair); It&#x27;s only when they are not that their manner becomes an issue to an audience.<p>I often see aggressive questions asked, then don&#x27;t really serve a useful purpose other than give someone a hard time, e.g loaded questions.')
