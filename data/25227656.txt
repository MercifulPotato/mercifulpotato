It&#x27;s a tenet of traditional journalism that everyone in a story must be doxed. A local newspaper wouldn&#x27;t write a story about someone being burgled without describing them along the lines of Julie West, 53, unmarried, formerly of Westford but now living in Sackville Close, Eastford... I don&#x27;t know the underlying reasons, I think it derives from principles of reporting truthfully combined with NOT having a principle of not giving personal information. But it seems weird as hell compared to more recent views on privacy an online anonymity.')
