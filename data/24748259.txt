Even if you don&#x27;t take those for granted, though... Let&#x27;s assume lower risk than a studio, and you relax the conditions from developed-in-house to <i>maintained</i>-in-house (e.g., a library exists, so you go grab it, and by the power of open source, internally it&#x27;s now &quot;yours&quot;â€”a fork that you take full responsibility for and have total control over, just like if you <i>had</i> developed in-house, except you&#x27;re shortcutting the process by cribbing from code that already exists.)<p>Here&#x27;s an unrecognized truth:<p>The cost of forking a third-party library and maintaining it in-house solely for your own use is no higher than the cost of relying on the third-party&#x27;s unforked version.  Depending on specifics, it can actually be lower.<p>Note that this is a <i>truth</i>; the only real variable is whether it&#x27;s acknowledged to be true or not.  Anyone who disputes it has their thumb on the scale in one way or another, consciously or unconsciously.')
