You can&#x27;t just tell an entire country with its own unique culture and 50 million citizens &quot;FU, you&#x27;re wrong&quot;, and when you do, it&#x27;s you that&#x27;s wrong not them! Everyone from Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, to federated platforms like Matrix or Mastadon, to developer tools, to every forum on the Internet [1] requires a first and last name! These platforms have literally millions of users or customers around the world - and at least one entire country - that don&#x27;t fit the &lt;first&gt; &lt;last&gt; mold and I find it highly disrespectful to force it on them like this.<p>[1] My info might be out of date on some of these as I&#x27;ve been out of the country and not paid much attention for a few years. I would hope that by now at least some of these big multinational companies would get it right. However, suffice it to say, the vast majority of SaaS platforms today are disrespectful to people with one name.')
