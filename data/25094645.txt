The article doesn&#x27;t for instance investigate the fact that the OCSP requests go over port 80 (i.e. unencrypted HTTP), or discuss the reliability issues that come into play when everyone&#x27;s computers depend on a single service to have 100% uptime.<p>Finally, I think the writer should be more careful with their use of the term &quot;dogwhistle&quot;. It&#x27;s a politically-loaded term that isn&#x27;t used correctly in this piece.')
