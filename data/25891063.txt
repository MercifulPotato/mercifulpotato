They did adapt how it works for the specificities of japanese, but it&#x27;s still pretty bad. It&#x27;s fun to use, to learn some words, but I wasn&#x27;t learning to speak&#x2F;write japanese with it. I&#x27;m making far more progress with books like Genki, which is a shame because Duolingo is fun to use.')
