Schoch on various podcasts, I&#x27;m starting to wonder if there could be, or have been, long-dead civilizations for which we have little-to-no evidence. This guy isn&#x27;t a crackpot from some backwater university, this is a Yale-trained Ph.D.. His hypothesis that the Sphinx is actually 12,000 years old would imply that there have been much older civilizations which have died out.<p>Can you build something like the Sphinx without any form of written system at all? I don&#x27;t honestly know, but my educated guess would be a resounding &quot;no&quot;. If that&#x27;s the case, it throws everything we know about &quot;the Alphabet&quot; up in the air.<p>What if our writing system is actually far, far older than we believe? I don&#x27;t think its really &quot;important&quot;, but its definitely fun to ponder.')
