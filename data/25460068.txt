Like every company wanted to create their own license with the intent to get free development work that they could then wrap up in closed commercial products. They were often incompatible with other licenses as well for that reason.<p>To ensure code is maximally reusable IMHO all we need are MIT, BSD and GPL, LGPL. And two of those are not really different in my mind. I understand AGPL too, but not MPL or Apache licenses. But if they are needed then that really should be all of them. Any others have some kind of non-free agenda.')
