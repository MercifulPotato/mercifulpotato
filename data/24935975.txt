At the very least, it fails Occam&#x27;s razor. The best argument I know of against authenticity is the lack of release of any raw messages with headers, but even that is pretty low-impact in the face of FBI&#x2F;DOJ&#x2F;DNI confirmation.<p>I&#x27;ve collected what I found so far here, both arguments for and against, with sources where possible: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kialo.com&#x2F;are-the-hunter-biden-emails-as-released-by-the-new-york-post-authentic-41503?path=41503.0~41503.3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kialo.com&#x2F;are-the-hunter-biden-emails-as-release...</a><p>If the raw messages are later released in whole, and the DKIM is validated, that&#x27;s the smoking gun. A number of media organizations are then going to have some very uncomfortable questions to answer. The same later applies to some of our three-letter agencies if they turn out to be bogus. That would mean our investigative and intelligence agencies are both tainted.')
