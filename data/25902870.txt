Why don&#x27;t Google Maps and the likes have a way to say: that road is closed! Often it&#x27;ll keep sending you back to the same road no matter how far away you drive (even in the opposite direction) , because it&#x27;s much closer than any other way.<p>But I want to tell it that the bridge is jammed and driving 25 minutes off my path, is better than waiting 2 hours for the bridge to work again. In this example I know that there&#x27;s another bridge about 7 miles away &quot;in the wrong direction&quot;. But I need to cross and this current bridge is not an option.<p>Why don&#x27;t they have a button to click, &quot;this road is closed&quot;')
