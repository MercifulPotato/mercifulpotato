If you buy some massive gaming &#x2F; ML rig, yes, that&#x27;ll use a lot more but it&#x27;s a lot closer if you buy a comparable capacity and quality system.<p>The best way to see this is to buy a watt-meter and test it while doing what you normally do. Also remember that two decades ago you&#x27;d probably have had the computer _with_ a CRT sucking several hundred watts constantly, probably with some nice incandescent &#x2F; halogen bulbs to keep things extra toasty, and a decade ago if you weren&#x27;t using a Mac you probably had most of the power savings features disabled for system stability and&#x2F;or compatibility. By now even the faster components have great power management when they&#x27;re not fully loaded.')
