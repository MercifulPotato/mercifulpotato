Then you would only very rarely have intelligent life actually evolve, and that intelligent life would generally notice that it came into existence near the end of their planet&#x27;s lifespan, and that simple life happened to get started very near the beginning of their planet&#x27;s lifespan (or else intelligent life probably wouldn&#x27;t have had enough time to evolve).')
