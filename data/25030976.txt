Item(by='dmix', descendants=None, kids=[25031171, 25031320, 25031198], score=None, time=1604889993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25029762, text='HN needs to come together to reward &#x27;dang&#x27;s hard work keeping HN to HN quality.<p>I have this theory that with almost any great music groups there&#x27;s usually one, sometimes two, great mind(s) working in the background, usually introverted, that really define the talent of the wider group (Brian Wilson, Quincy Jones, Phil Spector, etc are the rare few who got that recognition).<p>NYT did a great exploration of how this currently works in pop music:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;arts&#x2F;music&#x2F;100000005858557&#x2F;watch-how-a-pop-hit-is-made.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;arts&#x2F;music&#x2F;100000005858557&#x2F;wat...</a><p>This analogy is already starting to stretch a bit thin but my main point is there are always some smart people working hard in the background who don&#x27;t always get enough recognition for what they do. The Aussie girl is in the NYT clip who basically made the song still lives in relative obscurity (you can find her on twitter, probably well paid, but still living without much fanfare), despite this song among others blowing up in the charts.<p>I am going to attempt to think of something on a personal level but it&#x27;d be great if we could organize something larger like a community backed gift&#x2F;reward. At some level simply upvote internet points aren&#x27;t enough thanks for the work people put into user forums like these to keep them healthy. I obviously don&#x27;t have the full solution here just a seed of an idea.<p>Maybe something nice to do in these depressing pandemic times!<p>Edit: if anyone has any ideas about organizing such a thing please let me know, maybe a discord channel?')
