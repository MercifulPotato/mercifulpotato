Upload a zip file\n  2. Fill in very few additional details\n  3. Wait for review\n</code></pre>\nHere’s what it takes for Safari:<p><pre><code>  1. Own a Mac\n  2. Download 12GB of XCode\n  3. Run the conversion tool (this is the point that everyone talks about)\n  4. Well done, now you have an XCode project you’ll have to maintain\n  5. Pay $99&#x2F;yearly\n  6. Fill pages of senseless details and read scary-sounding notices about encryption because your extension is enabled on HTTPS\n  7. Wait for review\n  8. Get denied because of an “entitlement” that the conversion tool added for you\n  9. Wait for review\n  10. Fix a number of slight incompatibilities you’ll find over time, from basic features that other browsers have had for a long time to the APIs actually not being standard.</code></pre>')
