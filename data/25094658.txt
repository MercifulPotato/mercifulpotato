What if there isn&#x27;t? What does it mean then?<p>I find that those who are strong believers in conspiracy theories never consider that they might just be wrong. No, anything that might suggest they&#x27;re wrong is just further evidence of a cover up. I guess being wrong in this case would mean all the famous people who&#x27;ve been villainized for alleged participation in Epstein&#x27;s trafficking aren&#x27;t actually worthy of all the mud that&#x27;s been thrown their way. He&#x27;s actually more valuable as a political tool dead than he is alive so certain political groups can slander their opponents with connections to him and he can&#x27;t refute anything. Here&#x27;s an alternative conspiracy theory: right wing groups killed him so they could start a conspiracy theory that a powerful Democratic cabal that doesn&#x27;t actually exist had him killed and dirty left wing politicians with association to him. Prove that didn&#x27;t happen.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not true, maybe it is, but in absence of additional evidence it just seems most likely that the guy just killed himself to avoid being prosecuted for sex trafficking of children, which he was almost certainly guilty of.<p>But seriously, I still think any investigations should continue and any associates of his, whoever they are, should be brought to justice.')
