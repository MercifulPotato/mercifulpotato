Ride sharing &#x2F; taxi vs car ownership breakeven is at €10 per short trip (5km or less), but only worthwhile if I could totally get rid of the car: only 25% of car ownership cost is fuel, 75% or €5000 is maintenance + depreciation.<p>my calculations (sorry if formatting is off)<p>depreciation:<p>13000 purchase (5y old ex-lease car)<p>1000 after purchase: change of timing belt + water pump etc<p>resale: 5y after<p>6000 ?? residual value<p>1800&#x2F;y depreciation<p>annual maintenance:<p>250 (1000 for 2 sets of seasonal tires every 4 years)<p>1000 (insurance + road tax)<p>40 official checkup<p>200 basic service (oil, filters)<p>1000 ?? fixing things + parking + road tolls + tickets<p>2490&#x2F;y maintenance<p>fuel (europe)\n6.5l&#x2F;100km diesel\n20.000km annual mieage\n1.3 €&#x2F;l diesel (don&#x27;t buy at highways)<p>1690&#x2F;y fuel<p>garage 75&#x2F;m (comes with my apartment)\n900&#x2F;y garage<p>total cost: 6680 €&#x2F;y<p>total cost: 0.334 €&#x2F;km<p>I also figured I do 500 trips during school year (40 weeks, 12.5 trips per weak)<p>total cost: 13.36 €&#x2F;trip<p>This is surprisingly high.

Sadly, even at free electricity EV is not going to be much better. Only 100% ride sharing will bring a cost reduction that will influence decisions.')
