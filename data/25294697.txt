When I was pregnant, I spent over 40 hours researching items for my baby registry. After all that time, I accidentally bought a mini crib. Did you know that you can’t return nursery furniture because of safety regulations in the U.S.? Cool. The experience in preparing for my daughter was frustrating, time-consuming, and information overload.<p>I want to change this and simplify it.<p>So I built Poppylist.<p>To ensure all future parents spend significantly less time researching every baby product under the sun, I developed a Parent Type quiz that’ll match each person with their respective parent type: The Minimalist, The Environmentalist, The Practical, or the Tech-Savvy Parent. Based on your parent type, users receive a corresponding baby registry checklist (each list has less than 50 items). I built the quiz in Typeform.<p>I learned a lot while developing the quiz and talking with other parents. For example, most people will spend 30+ hours researching their products only to register for items referred to them by trusted friends. So every single product that we recommend has been sourced directly from parents.<p>I am transparent about what I’m building, and my goal is to simplify this process for all future parents. So please let me know what you think &amp; if you have any questions. My parent type quiz is just the start for what I want to build.<p>We can raise our children with less stuff, and the process of preparing for them doesn’t have to be so complicated.')
