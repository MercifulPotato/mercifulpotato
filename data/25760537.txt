There are still a lot of improvements and new ideas added to the top programs and even if they reach a plateau, you&#x27;d have to show that increasing time per move 100x doesn&#x27;t result in a significant improvement in playing strength. We don&#x27;t know what would be the Elo difference between a 32-piece tablebase and the best existing program but I don&#x27;t think anybody would bet that it&#x27;s less than 200 Elo.<p>Here is a graph of Stockfish&#x27;s progress since the end of 2015: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;camo.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;f169f774996346ad146f96f74d9f33da3f7d7b45597280309ec9b6423fb20898&#x2F;68747470733a2f2f696d6775722e636f6d2f6e34456269386a2e706e67" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;camo.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;f169f774996346ad146f96f74...</a>. Self-play exaggerates strength differences but it&#x27;s been a very good rate of progress, even without hardware improvements in the meantime.')
