My blog is made with Pelican. I also tried Hugo, Gatsby, and Jekyll, but they require much more orchestation than Pelican. There are two areas that can be improved: documentation and themes. I got difficulties trying to customize my blog (syntax highlighting, integration with jupyter notebooks, latex support, and so on). Most of the time the answers were in another blog, not in the docs. Also, the default theme is not attractive for new users. That prevents them to even give it a try.')
