The usual way you make a screw thread is by cutting it on a lathe. But the heart of a lathe is an accurate screw thread...<p>How to making flat plates from scratch with the 3 plate method is relatively easy to understand. But screw threads have a much more complex geometry, with no obvious way of making one from scratch. They also have many more parameters to consider, including relative pitch accuracy, and absolute accuracy.<p>As far as I can tell achieving accurate screw threads it something that took a huge amount of work by many different people effectively <i>working together</i> to get successively better and better threads, using each others&#x27; screw threads made using multiple techniques to average out errors. But I&#x27;ve never actually seen anyone describe from start to finish out to go from nothing to an accurate screw thread. It&#x27;s not even clear to me that it&#x27;s possible to do alone in a reasonable amount of time.<p>Relevant: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freechaptersinbooks.wordpress.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;screw-thread-cutting-by-the-master-screw-method-since-1480&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freechaptersinbooks.wordpress.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;screw-t...</a>')
