By befriending someone on Facebook you gave them access to data you chose to share with your Facebook friends. You don&#x27;t get to choose what they do with that data. It&#x27;s just like if you tell someone something irl and they use that info in a way you don&#x27;t like. Once you share info you can&#x27;t put the genie back in the bottle.<p>Unfortunately, Facebook has a history of changing data permissions that have caused info to be shared in ways users didn&#x27;t intend.')
