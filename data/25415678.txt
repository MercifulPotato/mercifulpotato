We know about how many batteries will be produced in the next 5-10 years.<p>The EV market will grow as fast as the battery market can support it, and Tesla is by far the largest current buyer of batteries and they will continue to expand that. While at the same time also attempting to be one of the biggest battery companies in the world.<p>The Tesla &#x27;pilot plant&#x27; they have in California, is targeted to be the 15 biggest battery factory in the world by end of next year. Its the same size as the plant VW and Northvolt have planned in Germany by 2026.<p>Tesla will in start building multiple huge battery factories next year, in Berlin and in Austin, Giga Nevada (biggest battery factory in the world, with Panasonic cooperation) will continue to grow and they will also continue to be one of the biggest costumers for LG and CATL.<p>We are quickly at the point where the raw material inputs will have a seriously hard time keeping up. Massive amounts of new nickel, lithium, cobalt and battery grade graphite need to be minded and refined. Nickel is the best investment, as there is basically no way around massively increasing nickel in the next 10 years.<p>This is before we even consider grid batteries. Li-Ion grid batteries, even when not able to be a backup for the cities are seriously useful for basically every grid operator in the world. While other storage mechanism exists, li-ion batteries are arguable the best in the market and will be for a long time.<p>Tesla is already a serious contender in that market (largest market share by far) both in terms of home and grid batteries. They already have all the software and electronics required, and already are in contact with utilities around the world.<p>People are very fast to claim &#x27;bubble bubble bubble&#x27; but I would push people to seriously consider the market dynamics at play and how the transition EV and renewable energy will play out in the next 15 years. Tesla if you like them or not, is well positioned, in terms of EV, Grid Batteries and Solar installation, all of these will grow globally and exponentially over the next 10-15 years.')
