Ryzen needs around 5W per core but it&#x27;s on a worse process. The entire system does use less power than a x86 system but that has nothing to do with the processor. It&#x27;s more about how the SoC is arranged and that RAM is (almost) on the same package. It means they can get away with higher bandwidth and lower power consumption for the entire system.<p>The idea that it&#x27;s all about the processor is completely wrong. Yet all we have heard is how fanboys cry it&#x27;s going to be 3x faster than desktop CPUs because of misleading TDP numbers.')
