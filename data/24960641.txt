So that doesn&#x27;t apply so much to them as it does to other European countries. It wasn&#x27;t quite as good as it is now - looking at the RKI&#x27;s stats, they did over 400,000 tests in the week at the end of March when test positivity hit its spring peak, compared to over 1.2 million the last few weeks - but they didn&#x27;t have the massive ramp-up in testing that most other European countries did.<p>Speaking of test positivity, their all-time high is 9% and the most recent week for which information is available isn&#x27;t that far off that at 5.6%, and I think that number&#x27;s effectively a week old at this point. All indications are that Germany really, genuinely does have a bigger outbreak this time around.')
