Does that make it categorically better? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Also, the company probably only has to pay those $40k to $200k in salary costs for a few years, but the benefits derived from the work might outlive it. There&#x27;s nothing stopping anyone from firing an employee just because they previously made a massive contribution to the company&#x27;s financial success. Why keep the cow if you can get the milk for free?<p>So it might even be the full $500k in pure profits after the 2nd year.')
