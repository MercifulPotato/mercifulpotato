I first saw that technique with the Tropical MBA and Dynamite Circle crowds, and this uses very similar language on their sign up page.<p>&quot;Mastermind Member (€75&#x2F;m)&quot;\n&quot;Weekly check-in to hold you accountable for your business goals&quot;<p>For paid forums or paid Slack like this, I always wonder how it benefits more experienced entrepreneurs to join. The 100€ monthly fee kind of suggests that the value I receive from being in that community is going to be larger than the value I add by mentoring others and giving advice.<p>But in the past, my experience was more that I&#x27;d get pitched a lot by online marketer types and people offering services for startups. Plus these groups tend to attract &quot;idea predators&quot; who check out what works for the bigger companies and then try to launch their own clone.<p>For these reasons, I believe this kind of paid networking groups always end up being almost exclusively filled with amateur marketers.<p>Please explain to me why I&#x27;m wrong.
