The article says to emulate the x86 TSO consistency model on an ARM machine which is weakly ordered you have to add a bunch of instructions which would make the emulation slow. I followed that much but then after that it doesn&#x27;t really explain how they would get around these extra instructions needed to guarantee the ordering. It just says &quot;oh, it&#x27;s a hardware toggle&quot;; toggle of what exactly?<p>I could see them just saying no to following TSO for single core stuff and when running emulated code for single core performance benchmarks since technically you don&#x27;t care about ordering for single core operation&#x2F;correctness. That would speed up their single core stuff but then what about the multi-core.')
