There&#x27;s an empty spot in my building that&#x27;s a coffee shop storefront. When we moved in, I saw that it was vacant (beginning of 2020) and asked about rent. It was $9k&#x2F;mo. I offered them $5k and they declined. Still vacant. That&#x27;s a lot of lost income, but perhaps it makes sense in the sense of commercial real estate.')
