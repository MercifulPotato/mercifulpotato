The protoconcept of judicial process probably arose from subsistence farmer communities needing a way to hypocritically expel or kill people who did not conform to religious decrees, but without losing any social status, and in fact gaining social status by association with the judicial system.<p>What we have today is a tiny, tiny, tiny modification of that, where our savanna-adapted meat brains put in accoutrements of due process and fair trials, but it’s all just for show so that political elites can say one thing (freedom, due process, fairness) but do another (court packing, systemic racism, regulatory capture, corporate shilling).')
