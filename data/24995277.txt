Item(by='throwawydedbee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604545019, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24995016, text='I&#x27;m well aware that I have nothing to complain about, money-wise, when considered on a global scale.  (To say nothing of the historical scale.)<p>I&#x27;ve never missed a meal.  And a precious person in my life gives me a roof over my head, use of her car, food, and most importantly, her support.<p>At the same time, all of my cash is gone.  I&#x27;ve had to drain my retirement accounts, and it turns out that alimony&#x2F;penury is not a valid excuse, so you pay the 10% penalty for early withdrawal.  It&#x27;s embarrassing to explain to HR why I&#x27;m taking 30 allowances on my W-4 when everyone else takes only a few.  I can&#x27;t take the company 401k matches, because I don&#x27;t have the money to do so.  More money lost.  The deductions for alimony are mostly wasted, because if alimony takes most of your income, you didn&#x27;t owe taxes anyway.  You can&#x27;t use it in a future year--you just lose the value of it.<p>A lot of &quot;normal&quot; financial&#x2F;tax regimes are stacked against you when you&#x27;re under alimony.  Had to explain to family why a contribution to my 401k would <i>cost</i> me 10% of the contribution in taxes, right away.  Seems inconceivable, but that&#x27;s how it works out.  Alimony?  Fuck you, buddy.<p>If you want my lesson, don&#x27;t get married.  Nor live in any sort of common law situation.<p>I have nothing to say about kids.  If you get someone pregnant, expect to pay for the next 20 years.  I have no particular problem with that.  Children are always the highest priority.  (Better not to bring them into the world, though.)')
