Very thoroughly wrong.<p>It <i>only</i> reads in the Root CA certificates in the Machine store.<p>It ignores the User store entirely.<p>It ignores the Intermediate CA store as well.<p>I bet Mozilla&#x27;s logic is that Intermediate CA certificates can simply be &quot;downloaded&quot; dynamically, but Windows Server CAs use LDAP URLs by default, which Firefox doesn&#x27;t support.<p>It also ignores CTLs, CRLs, revoked certificates, and a bunch of other Windows PKI stores.<p>Chrome was pleasant to use in that &quot;it just worked&quot;, and this was a major reason it was adopted by large organisations and Firefox wasn&#x27;t.<p>Please don&#x27;t break this.')
