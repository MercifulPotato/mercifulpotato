Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606658865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25239905, text='&gt; in the language that CS majors use the phrase &quot;Kolmogorov Complexity&quot; is sufficient to encode the concept of KC itself<p>Wait, isn&#x27;t that just conflating &quot;language&quot; with &quot;knowledge&quot;&#x2F;&quot;information&quot;? The underlying assumption here is that the CS major has an association of a concept encoded by the letters &quot;Kolmogorov Complexity&quot;.<p>This is not universal, though, i.e. there&#x27;s no computation that could derive the meaning behind these letters from the encoding alone. It&#x27;s like claiming &quot;620&quot; is sufficient to encode Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (&quot;The Magic Flute&quot;), because in the language of a musician, the Köchel catalogue number along with the context would enable them to decode the full meaning.<p>But in reality you would still have to look up the number and the score somewhere so it&#x27;s not really an encoding but more of a pointer or index. I&#x27;d see any technical term that way, in that the term itself is not an encoding, but a key&#x2F;index&#x2F;identifier of a concept, not a full definition of the concept itself.')
