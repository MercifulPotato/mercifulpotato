Imagine if the West invested in nuclear power to the same level as France did - think of the trillions of tons of CO2 that would not have been emitted into the atmosphere. Maybe it would have bought us an extra 5 decades.<p>There is nothing we could have done in the early 2000s that we didn&#x27;t do (and though your comment is very American-centric, the world is bigger than America). The biggest gains we received were when many regions transitioned from coal to natural gas but natural gas was not an economical option before the fracking revolution (which environmentalists are against).<p>Even now, we don&#x27;t really have any options to transition from fossil fuels. The best we can do (outside of nuclear, and if geography allows, hydro&#x2F;geothermal) is to pair natural gas with solar panels and wind mills - but though solar&#x2F;wind are OK (just OK) with CO2 emissions, they are very hard on the environment because of land-use requirements, production, and disposal. This doesn&#x27;t take into account other fossil fuel use, like fuel for cargo ships, rockets, and airplanes, and the thousand of products that need petroleum.<p>By the way, there&#x27;s a Green party candidate running in Vermont (or Maine) that is against importing hydro power from Quebec. Insanity.')
