So, it kind of shows that our speed of execution went up... it was just that we were able to hire aggressively, we were able to get a lot of other technical help from Facebook on the storage, on the server side of the things. They brought a lot of those things that we were trying to build ourselves that they already had... So, combining the two really turbo-charged the growth of WhatsApp. So, I think I&#x27;d say execution was flawless in terms of the deal.&quot;<p>&gt; <i>...it wouldâ€™ve just taken a bit longer</i><p>Yeah, we are in-agreement: &quot;[Facebook] put its growth on steroids&quot;.')
