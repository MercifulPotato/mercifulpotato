Item(by='klipt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606581721, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25238325, text='&gt; while most others site charge $7-10 shipping or have a minimum of $75-100 for free shipping.<p>Target and Walmart both have free shipping for orders over 25&#x2F;35 depending on which items.<p>Our local Target also offers drive up service where they&#x27;ll load items into your trunk for you, and you can combine orders so you pick up $30 worth of items same day and get a $5 item (not in store) shipped free since the total is $35.<p>2 day shipping and 5% off with Red Card makes it a pretty compelling competitor to Amazon. Especially with all the fake&#x2F;potentially unsafe items on Amazon, I prefer to get food related items from Target if possible.')
