Right now, afaik the fed is pursuing a strategy of cheap capital, with the idea that the economy running hot will benefit workers by eventually increasing competition for workers. From some data I&#x27;ve seen, this was actually working before covid set in, with even the lowest wage workers beginning to see upticks in their wages.<p>However, I think a low-regulation, high-capital environment ends up favoring the &quot;MBA-ization&quot;, because investors gain a lot of sway, without many backstops. For example, when unions are strong, they can drive employers to invest more in their workforces. If your employees are expensive, you&#x27;re more inclined to spend money to improve their productivity. This happens when the minimum wage is increased as well. But without those incentives, companies instead spend their surplus on buybacks to keep investors happy. I think that low regulation on private equity may be another factor here. So it&#x27;s not that just that MBAs have a particular way of viewing things that creates problems. It&#x27;s that the economy is structured in a way that gives the stereotypical MBA point of view a lot of power.')
