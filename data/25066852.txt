Essentially, I take this factorization and then run it through my own iterative method.  When I run tests in MATLAB, SPQR scales fine for matrices of at least a few hundred thousand rows and columns.  For larger, it would be nice to essentially have an incomplete Q-less QR factorization, which I don&#x27;t think exists, but should be an extension of the incomplete Choleski work.<p>But, yes, LSQR or more fitting LSMR solves a similar problem, but they&#x27;re the iterative solver and I need the preconditioner, which I&#x27;m using the factorization for.')
