Item(by='dspillett', descendants=None, kids=[25284053], score=None, time=1606957194, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25281582, text='&quot;OK Google&quot;&#x2F;&quot;hey Google&quot; is one of the reasons I went with Amazon&#x27;s products instead! (other reasons include that they seem to understand my voice more reliably than Google or Microsoft&#x27;s systems). I get to call it Computer instead of Alexa too, though if I were stuck with Alexa it would still be preferable to Google (or Amazon for that matter).<p>It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t <i>just</i> branding though, if I&#x27;m right. The wake word needs to be something that is easy to pick out from a complex audio environment and not be a regular part of common speech so cause confusion (computer fails a bit in that regard) so allowing completely custom wake words might cause reliability issues. Also some might choose wake words that the brands don&#x27;t want to be seen listening for: I might choose &quot;slave&quot; as a Blake&#x27;s 7 reference for instance but that could easily offend some if they overhear, and there are many other epithets, slurs, and swears, that would not be deemed suitable either.')
