Item(by='JNRowe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608342964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25473851, text='Dorian Lynskey&#x27;s Orwell biography The Ministry of Truth spends a chunk of its time on interactions between Huxley, Wells and Orwell.  I found much of that fascinating, picturing these esteemed authors critiquing each others works(sometimes over supper).<p>Full recommendation for the book, even if only for the Zamyatin chapter collapsing everyone from Rand to George Lucas in to twenty pages or so.')
