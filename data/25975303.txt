I think it&#x27;s useful to talk more about complete stacks instead of focusing on individual parts without mentioning the &quot;glue&quot; between them so I really like these kinds of posts. Just two questions:<p>1. If you&#x27;re not going for scalability why Postgres and not SQLite?<p>2. What does your monitoring look like? I&#x27;ve read something about Grafana and Hetzner dashboards in the comments but what exactly do you use and where do you run that? Also, do you have anything for intrusion detection specifically? (I&#x27;d be extremely paranoid about that.)')
