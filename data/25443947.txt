You can have a drink with fewer grams of sugar but that still has a higher glycemic load. Lactose has a fairly low glycemic index which results in it often having a lower glycemic load of drinks sweetened with lower quantities of maltose&#x2F;dextrose. In terms of scientific literature I think there are a bunch of well regarded studies on this topic (glycemic load and how it relates to health) since its a pretty key factor in diabetes.<p>Vegetable Oil - tbh I&#x27;m less sure of the science for this but reading <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeffnobbs.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;why-is-vegetable-oil-unhealthy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeffnobbs.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;why-is-vegetable-oil-unhealt...</a> gave me enough doubt to try to reduce my consumption.<p>I still occasionally use unsweetened coconut milk, since it has no added sugars and none of the more suspicious vegetable oils. But what I&#x27;ve found is that when you get rid of the sugar&#x2F;vegetable oils none of the milk substitutes taste anything like milk.')
