My foreign friends in university laughed at this a lot, especially those from Eastern Europe and Greece. They would at most schedule to meet &quot;next weekend&quot; for beers not &quot;Saturday at 15:30&quot; like we Dutchies would write down and then all arrive exactly at or just before 15:30. They often agreed and then showed up an hour late claiming Romanian time :-) we got used to it quickly but still both sides made fun of it.<p>But I know very few people that set &quot;formal&quot; recurring meetings for just coffee or lunch like the author is suggesting.<p>Things around some kind of activity like tennis every Tuesday evening, or grandma babysits every Wednesday of course are very common. But not like the author of this post describes purely social things that are set so recurring.')
