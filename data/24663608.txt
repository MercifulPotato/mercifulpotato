We have various openings across the rest of the organization which you can see here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elationhealth.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elationhealth.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a> but specifically I&#x27;m focused on growing our engineering team with frontend ReactJS experienced folks. Right now is a particularly challenging time for our healthcare systems and providers -- Elation offers an opportunity to work and innovate in support of those providers and their patients.<p>Elation is headquartered in San Francisco (though remote for at least the rest of 2020), and our engineering team is distributed across PST-EST timezones.<p>Tech stack is AWS&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Django&#x2F;MySQL&#x2F;ReactJS. We have a great team full of people that really value working closely with product, customer-experience, and users. Lots of interesting problems to solve!<p>Apply on the website if interested, and feel free to reach out to me directly if you have any questions or are curious!
