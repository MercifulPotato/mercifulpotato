Model training is not much to be honest. I have a fairly fast processor so it takes about 10 minutes to run every iteration. \nIt has evolved from predicting just one dimension&#x2F;feature but now, it predicts all of the variables it can train on (all training features)\nEarlier, I used to manually input every predictor and then run the algorithim but now, I have figured out the copy-paste method which essentially cuts the pre-processing from around 2 hours to 10 minutes now. It gets a bit hectic giver the current nature of sports happening every day and increasing frequency of cycles. That part can be optimised via web scraping but not a priority at the moment but is a priority nevertheless.\nOutputs are generated into a spreadsheet at the moment but would publish them onto an online platform later once I figure out the &#x27;monetizing&#x27; and user-prompted running of the algorithim part.')
