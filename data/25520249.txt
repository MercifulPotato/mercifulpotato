Item(by='makeee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608746651, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25505664, text='I’m building <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;divjoy.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;divjoy.com</a>. My approach has been to let people make high level changes in a low-code editor (create pages, rearrange sections, tweak global styles) and then export as a React&#x2F;Node codebase where they build their custom functionality. It doesn’t help with your specific use-case yet, but that’s a great example of something I’d like to enable just by dropping a “tweets list” component into your UI.')
