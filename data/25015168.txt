They become Class 1 due to the continuous scanning. If a laser beam were to become stuck pointing in one direction, as GP mentions, it becomes Class 3R.<p>And with the current limitations to stay in Class 1, range is 100m or less, so basically useless on a highway. There is a lot of work going on to find good tradeoffs in power and wavelength to give useful range while staying in Class 1.')
