Item(by='ncmncm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608182871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447388, text='This is a helpful tutorial for beginners.<p>What would be really be helpful to me is a compendium of what has been found not to work. Every microcontroller has a horrendous, secret list of stuff that is just broken, and the only way usually to find out is to try to use it and fail. If you get somebody from the vendor to talk to you, they say they knew all about it already.<p>For example, ESP32 is supposed to be actually useless for low-power applications, because its sleep modes are messed up, somehow; maybe it doesn&#x27;t wake up reliably, or does when it shouldn&#x27;t? Also it draws more power than it should in a sleep mode.<p>Lots of the on-chip peripheral gadgets have very non-obvious failure modes. I guess you are supposed to expect trouble synchronizing things with different clocks: &quot;Check this flag bit twice before you trust it.&quot; Special added non-standard instructions have gotchas like &quot;turn off interrupts while this instruction runs&quot;, or &quot;don&#x27;t let these instructions write to memory; get the results in registers and copy them out&quot;.<p>It seems like a wiki would be a good way to compile lists like this, but engineers who program microcontrollers mostly don&#x27;t seem to think that way. Too, many have signed NDAs or don&#x27;t want the vendor mad at them.')
