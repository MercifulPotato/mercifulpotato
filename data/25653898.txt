Other employees of the company commit crimes. You know about the crimes. The company profits from the crimes paying your salary &amp;&#x2F;or bonus. You do not inform the police.<p>How is this not a criminal conspiracy engaged in by the CEO (either before or after the fact) resulting in Jail time for the CEO?<p>Is it just because &quot;with a computer&quot; that the CEO isn&#x27;t facing charges? What crimes committed and prior or subsequent knowledge of and then profit from those crimes would qualify in the CEO being charged with being involved in a criminal conspiracy? Does it have to be something that reads dramatically in a newspaper like armed robbery or assult or murder? Do the victims of the crime have to be elderly? Or are those crimes also fine as long as your title is CEO rather than &quot;Don&quot;?<p>Is this fixable?')
