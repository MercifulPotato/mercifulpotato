It also found obstruction of justice by both the Trump campaign and Trump Whitehouse. What is up for discussion is if it found criminal collusion on the part of Trump, which it <i>might have</i> but stopped short of explicitly stating for political, not criminal, reasons (Muller did not feel he was able to indict a sitting president).')
