However I see that many people advocate dark mode everywhere. I think this is a bad idea. I think it puts a lot less strain on your eyes when your screen has less contrast to your room.<p>What that means is that I use a light theme for my editor during daylight and when my room gets dark and I realize that my screen &quot;becomes bright&quot; I switch to a dark theme.<p>Also I can recommend night mode. Gnome and others have this out of the box. What it does is fade your screen to more reddish colors when it gets dark.<p>Also don&#x27;t use too small fonts.. this sometimes seems to be like a contest for coders: &quot;Look i have font size 7. I need to scroll less&quot;.<p>And also don&#x27;t use too low contrast color schemes.')
