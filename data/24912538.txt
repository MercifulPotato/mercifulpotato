There&#x27;s essentially no reason you need to delete a hotmail account, you can just completely ignore it instead. That means you never have a devil&#x27;s choice of not deleting your hotmail account to keep access to xbox games.<p>Social media accounts are by their nature a large amount of photos, posts, tags, personal info that other people will see including employers, immigration officials, future dates. There are very good reasons you may want to delete it (and prevent future tags, wall posts) rather than just abandon it, so it becomes more problematic if you cannot without other penalties.')
