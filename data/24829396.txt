It integrates all the features that others have, and even more. Two level WBS : of course, ProjeQtOr does it, and even 20 or mode Levels if you wish !!! You don&#x27;t have restrictions with ProjeQtOr; You can have projets with sub-projects, with sub-sub-projects (and so on) and each project can have tasks, with sub-tasks, and sub-sub-tasks (and so on). But if you want only two levels, you also can. Gantt chart ; ProjeQtOr also provides it but not only; You can have project portfolio, resource Gantt chart (not a real Gantt but very easy to read and very efficient to analyse resource planning). ProjeQtOr also provides real capacity planning calculation : you don&#x27;t only draw a gantt chart, ProjeQtOr calculates it for you depending on the constraints and resources capacity (when resources are shared on several projects, it&#x27;s not an easy trick). ProjeQtOr also calculates the critical path (which is in fact a critical chain in ProjeQtOr as planning is driven from resource capacity)\nAnd all of this is easy to install, easy to use, and free.<p>Really, ProjeQtOr is worth a try.')
