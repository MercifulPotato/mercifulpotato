In this article, they are growing 14 layers, so to match the output of one acre of farmland requires 1&#x2F;14 of an acre of building, if all else is the same. Also, vertical farms can produce 365 days a year, which conventional farms can not. Other factors such as precise control of climate, nutrients, and pests will also increase the output of vertical farms.<p>I think in the end, you are right - vertical farms will be more expensive. But its going to be nothing like 275x as expensive.')
