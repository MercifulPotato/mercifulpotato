Basically always working with small relatively informal teams.<p>I also occasionally get ideas for software I want to build myself, which has made up a significant part of my experience: from making games, to developer tools, to e.g.: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diskatlas.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diskatlas.com&#x2F;</a><p>I generally prefer to work with web tech these days and have about 5 or 6 years experience there, out of my 17 total programming.<p>I&#x27;d be a great pick for building some new software from the ground up using web tech, especially if it involves some uncommon challenges that require novel solutions, or dipping into research, exploration via prototypes, etc.<p>Looking primarily for freelance work, but would definitely consider the right early-stage startup.')
