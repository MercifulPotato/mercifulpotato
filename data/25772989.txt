At least known criminals usually are drug tested and so on, it&#x27;s not perfect but there are rules and ways to reduce harm. In most countries if you have a criminal record you can&#x27;t get a gun, someone who sells on the dark web can&#x27;t even do a minimal amount of due diligence.<p>Of course you can say well screw it I don&#x27;t like the rules I&#x27;m just going to sell it anyway but then really you can&#x27;t be surprised if the gov. brings the hammer down on you.<p>I think Ross Ulbricht&#x27;s sentence is too high, I&#x27;m generally not a fan of lifelong imprisonment, but he engaged in lawlessness and crime on a very large scale and that deserves punishment. If people aren&#x27;t punished for breaking the rules tomorrow someone will break laws that you actually think are valuable.')
