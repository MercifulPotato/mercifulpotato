For a laptop-monitor combination in Linux, standard resolution is absolutely the way to go.<p>This isn&#x27;t a rant. Mad, mad respect for Linux here, and longtime Linux user.<p>KDE only offers a single scaling factor, so you must scale the laptop and the external screens identically. That means all at 2:1, or 1.5:1, or what have you -- this means one of your screens will be scaled improperly (too fine or too large). Gnome does the same, I believe. I have heard Pop_OS can scale monitors differently but didn&#x27;t try it.')
