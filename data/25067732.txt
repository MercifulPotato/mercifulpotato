At least as of a couple years ago, the only way to use local disks with standard 512-byte or 4096-byte sector sizes was through VIOS or similar* storage virtualization mechanisms, so unless QEMU supports 520- or (4096+mumble)-byte virtual SAS disks, you also need to emulate enough of the IBM POWER hypervisor architecture to support running VIOS (IBM&#x27;s AIX-derived virtual I&#x2F;O appliance) concurrently in a separate logical partition within the same QEMU VM.<p>Even if QEMU <i>does</i> support odd-sized virtual sectors, given the integral support for logical partitioning included <i>within</i> modern IBM i releases, various system management and RAS features, etc., I&#x27;d be entirely unsurprised to learn that significant firmware support isn&#x27;t also required to boot the OS at all, regardless of I&#x2F;O device support.<p>In which case, you&#x27;d either need to reimplement a significant bit of IBM firmware functionality from scratch, or else you&#x27;d need to emulate POWER system hardware convincingly enough to fool (possibly hacked) authentic IBM firmware.<p>Finally, given that AFAIK IBM has never sold unbundled licenses for IBM i (or OS&#x2F;400), the only potentially legal way to do any of this would be to run QEMU a POWER system already licensed to run IBM i (no technical problem, as all recent POWER systems have excellent Linux support).<p>*Where, by &quot;similar&quot;, I&#x27;m thinking of virtual disks used by virtual instances running within an existing IBM i instance, which wouldn&#x27;t be helpful here.')
