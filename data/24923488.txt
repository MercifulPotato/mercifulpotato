Having user-friendly tooling also helps promote diversity of OSS communities since it&#x27;s easier to onboard people with all sorts of backgrounds, since the technical adoption barrier is lowered.<p>I think GitLab is a clear winner here since it&#x27;s user friendly and designed for cross-functional team collaboration (GitLab dog foods their own product in all departments of the team, so you have HR, Marketing, Finance, etc all using it, in addition to the full product teams).<p>Full disclosure: I work at GitLab as the OSS Program Manager. Part of the reason I joined was because I feel really strongly about GitLab&#x27;s ability to lower the contribution barrier and get more people involved in OSS.')
