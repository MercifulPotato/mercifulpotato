Because I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very realistic number.<p>I&#x27;m not a student but it&#x27;s pretty close I think.<p>I invested $350 into a Chromebook that runs native Linux[0] about 4 years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong as a secondary machine I use when I&#x27;m away from my main workstation.<p>It has a 13&quot; 1080p IPS display, 4gb of memory, an SSD, a good keyboard and weighs 2.9 pounds. It&#x27;s nothing to write home about but it&#x27;s quite speedy to do every day tasks and it&#x27;s even ok for programming where I&#x27;m running decently sized Flask, Rails and Phoenix apps on it through Docker.<p>If I had to use it as my primary development machine for web dev I wouldn&#x27;t be too disappointed. It only starts falling apart if you need to do anything memory intensive like run some containers while also running VMs, but you could always spend a little more and get 8gb of memory to fix that problem.<p>I&#x27;m sure nowadays (almost 5 years later) you could get better specs for the same price.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickjanetakis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;transform-a-toshiba-chromebook-cb35-into-a-linux-development-environment-with-galliumos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickjanetakis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;transform-a-toshiba-chromeboo...</a>')
