If you claim that he is lying, the burden of proof is on you. Also that somehow doesn&#x27;t stop them from hypothesising about personal tensions with the adviser as an explanation for non-invitation.\n2. ...not being invited to a seminar is no biggie, 6 billion people weren&#x27;t invited..\n  C&#x27;mon, if that seminar is run by your adviser on your topic of interest it is not the same as for the rest of the planet.\n3. ...he is already elite of of the elite in a PhD program at Harward...\n  Okay, so what? Put up with corruption? Ignore the fact that the system is rigged and not in your favor?\n4. ...It&#x27;s childish to have a revelation when discovering all this backscratching and deals going behind the scenes in academia...\n  Really? Should a person expect it as normal? Maybe looking for a secret meeting should be the first step one should make in their academic career?\n5. Stuff about him being paranoid&#x2F;having prosecution complex.\n  Making a diagnosis from a several minute podcast clip to conclude with ad hominem argument is beyond the pale IMHO.<p>What of these two episodes strikes you as the most condemning about Eric? Maybe something he did or some abhorrent position he holds or something verifiably false that he said on purpose?')
