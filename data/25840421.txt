I remember in the 90s, if I thought of a website or invention, I figured I had about 2-3 years to make it (certainly less than 5) before someone else did. That number dropped to maybe 6 months by 2010, and today most things are either about to be released or were released 2 weeks ago (minimum). So I&#x27;m not sure if I manifested what you made by needing it months ago, is what I&#x27;m saying.<p>Anyway, the value proposition of LayerCI may not exactly be in the CI&#x2F;CD stuff. What caught my eye was the 12 staging servers with high power CPUs and the layer caching like Docker (which takes multi-minute build times down to seconds). I think if you manage to include backups and monitoring from the start, you&#x27;ll really have something. And if you&#x27;ve already done them, good job manifesting that.')
