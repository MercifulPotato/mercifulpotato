As in them you can normally run a hardened Linux, where such attacks simple are not possible.<p>It hints to how Linux is not really designed as a desktop system. And IMHO is <i>fundamentally</i> unsuited to become a modern desktop (or handy) OS without changing it so much, that&#x27;s not really Linux anymore. This is also why I never had much hope for the libre phone.')
