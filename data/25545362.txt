Item(by='berkes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609007754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25537310, text='&gt; But those strike me as much more cases of people &quot;holding it wrong&quot; than rails being the problem.<p>My idea exactly.<p>To stretch that analogy: Rails has guides, books and neat API documentation explaining how you should &quot;hold it properly&quot; (and when not to etc.). But it also lacks &quot;notches&quot;, &quot;crossbeams&quot; or &quot;ridges&quot; that help people &quot;hold it properly&quot; on a daily basis.')
