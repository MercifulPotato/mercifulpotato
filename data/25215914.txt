Next day someone will use a 8k camera on the same slow tablet. Another day someone will run your app in parallel with with some other process consuming all CPU cores.<p>A fix would be making so that however slow the computer is, processing frames from the camera doesn&#x27;t affect GUI latency, at least not by much.<p>You probably gonna need multithreading for that. And if that 2010 tablet only has a single CPU core without hyperthreading, you might need to adjust the priority of that camera&#x27;s thread. But it&#x27;s all doable.')
