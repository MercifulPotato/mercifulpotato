Item(by='robocat', descendants=None, kids=[25826845, 25827942, 25826925], score=None, time=1611003824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25826506, text='I suggest you avoid using the word hacker, as to me you are using it in a negative sense, while missing that a good hack can be excellent engineering. “Hacker” contains a wild variety of behaviour and skills. The concept is too amorphous and people have wildly disagreeing meanings associated with the word (the meaning is very audience and context sensitive) so it is difficult to use the word as a proxy for the sense you wanted to convey, in a discussion with a wide audience.<p>Edit: I am suggesting hacker is a loaded&#x2F;confusing word that is definitely not the opposite of engineer. Good engineering and good hacking are compatible - the right temporary fix can be excellent engineering. Cowboy (≈hacker) mechanical and civil engineers exist, so the concept of hacking is not incompatible with engineer. Using the word hacker intrinsically includes the concept of software, so contrasting hacking and engineering is not a tidy argument.')
