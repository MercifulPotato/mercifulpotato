Without doing deeper research than I have any interest in, indeed Kalanick never seems to have publicly said anything like &quot;We are so f&#x27;ed without self-driving&quot; (which would be a truly idiotic thing to do) and even made some references to the length of the transition. But he also made reference to things like Uber&#x27;s growth being limited until Uber was cheaper than owning a car and a <i>ton</i> of pubs seem to have &quot;independently&quot; reached the opinion that this was necessary. And I also don&#x27;t see a lot of fervent denials from Uber in this regard.')
