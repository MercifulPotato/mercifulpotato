Doublet of lenticula.</i><p>In Swedish, for example, the word for the food (&quot;lins&quot;) is exactly the same as the word for the optical component. I just thought that was interesting, since naming is hard and perhaps the connection was not obvious to everybody.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;lentil" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;lentil</a>')
