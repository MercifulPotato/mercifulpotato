Lowering the barrier is only going to bring in more people who are fundamentally unable to think algorithmically. If you are a manager you do not want those people to work for you, and if you are a programmer those people make you look better.<p>Of all the people I have tutored thus far, if they struggled with a language like Java or C#, trying to program with Scratch was just as hard for them.
