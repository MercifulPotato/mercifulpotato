Why would a harmless feature that the vast majority of people want have to have its own &quot;prominent&quot; setting. I&#x27;d argue the exact opposite - that making it prominent would lead people to disable it without knowing the consequences and then think their browser is broken: &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t want sites to access my clipboard, that sounds scary&quot;, then two months later &quot;this browser sucks! When I copy my selection from Google Docs it strips all formatting! It works in Chrome, Firefox sucks!&quot;<p>Anyways, this is far more time than I&#x27;m willing to spend talking to someone who thinks their PoV is the only correct one (I just now recognize your username from a few other threads under this post). Cheeers!')
