The other really long-running shows are soap operas like Eastenders or comedy panel shows.<p>But in the US, there seem to be an awful lot of outliers, and it&#x27;s on the strength of those series that Netflix initially established their following: <i>Friends</i>, <i>The Office</i>, <i>Park and Rec</i>, <i>Seinfeld</i>, <i>Community</i>, <i>The Walking Dead</i>, <i>The Blacklist</i>, <i>Gilmore Girls</i>, <i>Grey&#x27;s Anatomy</i>, <i>West Wing</i>, <i>That 70&#x27;s Show</i>, <i>Supernatural</i>, <i>Criminal Minds</i>, and I could keep going, honestly, for quite a while.<p>So yes, there&#x27;s an extent to which 5 or 8 seasons is less common, but the goal for US shows has been 100 episodes for decades now, which is usually 5 seasons of 20+ episodes each.<p>If Netflix is adopting a more UK-like approach, that might result in better TV eventually, but it would be nice for creators to know they have to tell their story in 16 episodes rather than 100.')
