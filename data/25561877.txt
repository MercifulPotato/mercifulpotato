Item(by='epistasis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609181061, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25561792, text='Pointing out specific, xenophobic viewpoints doesn&#x27;t mean dismissing everybody as xenophobic. If they have legitimate density complaints, please bring them. But I will also point out that these density complaints are even more xenophobic in origin. Density restrictions and zoning in San were invented a century ago to push the Chinese populations out of their neighborhoods.<p>And for me, this isn&#x27;t about more or less restrictions. This is about meeting the needs of the <i>people</i> of a city. Not just the wealthy, not just keeping buildings the same, not just the people that have lived there the longest. The needs of the <i>entire</i> people. Which includes people that don&#x27;t yet live in the city but need access to the economic resources.<p>So I definitely think that there should be density restrictions, but rather than maximums there should be density minimus. It should be illegal to build a single unit on a 5000 square foot lot anywhere in San Francisco. When somebody tears down a tiny Victorian, they had better replace it with many homes rather than just one. And if somebody remodels those exclusionary Pacific Heights homes, they better be adding more units, IMHO.')
