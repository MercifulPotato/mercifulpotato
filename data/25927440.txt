In some sections of narration the Culture is described as a true symbiosis, but elsewhere it&#x27;s admitted and implied that the minds usually end up with more power than humans, and in multiple culture novels humans do get manipulated and used by drones&#x2F;minds to various extents - e.g. Player of Games.<p>It&#x27;s not a symbiosis in the strongest practical sense. There isn&#x27;t mutual reliance for survival: if all humans suddenly disappeared, the minds&#x2F;drones and accompanying infrastructure would survive perfectly fine. But culturally (lower case) you could definitely argue that losing the humans would destroy the fundamental identity of the Culture.<p>I like that while this topic was gradually touched on over the series, mostly the reader is left to make up their own mind.')
