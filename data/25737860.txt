Had to stop playing it because it&#x27;s not worth it to ruin the experience.<p>Can you clarify a bit whether you were hitting game play bugs or visual issues?<p>On the PC side there are occasional visual glitches but the game play is relatively stable - I&#x27;ve had trouble with one quest line (the delamain one) and the enemy AI can get stuck sometimes - but it hasn&#x27;t interrupted game play too badly.')
