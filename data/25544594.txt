Of course, I’ve rotated my tires many times, on schedule, but I <i>replace</i> them all at the same time. It’s standard practice. I’ve never experienced OPs behavior.<p>The algorithm is such that there’s a limit to the amount of “slippage” it will accept before traction control engages. A difference in tire diameters, exacerbated by a hard curve, leads to more slippage than the algorithm is willing to accept. What do you think would happen if traction control was off? :)<p>Furthermore, there are unknowns here - OP hasn’t specified the diameter (between 2 and 8&#x2F;32’s) of their old tires. They simply stated that the tires had enough tread to meet their personal standards. Clearly traction control sees the situation differently.')
