How many people have emailed him a thank you note, let alone sent him money?<p>2) Is that good or bad?  or both?<p>3) Mature software has low low maintenance costs (that&#x27;s almost the definition of &quot;mature software&quot;, eh?)<p>4) The real problem might be that we keep writing new code.  If you restrict yourself to mature code your costs go way down, since you&#x27;re not paying to write new code nor to maintain it.<p>(It might read like I&#x27;m saying Marak should be like Ramsey, that&#x27;s NOT my point.)')
