At work, They are wearing masks, staying socially distant, have shields and blocks in many cases,and keeping the economy afloat.<p>Contrast that to crowding within 6 feet of 5+ family members unmasked for hours, traveling and spreading virus everywhere for a holiday that celebrates native americans giving food resources to ill prepared settlers?<p>What IS silly is that this is a holiday, it&#x27;s a fun but nonessential day. Do you think Turkey day or Jesus&#x27;s &quot;birthday&quot; (aka coopted Pagan winter solstice day) is worth the 1000s of deaths that they will certainly cause? The pandemic that has killed 250,000 Americans in just 8 months is far, far more important than a couple family meals.')
