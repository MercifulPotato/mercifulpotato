So there is no causal link, there is a correlational association. I think the term &quot;link&quot; needs to be banned in this context. &quot;associated&quot; would be much clearer. Maybe the Hacker News mods could change the headline posted here.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that Vitamin E supplementation is declining in the US, probably because several studies on its supplementation have not shown benefit (or shown harm). [1]<p>The primary understood role of Vitamin E is as a fat soluble anti-oxidant, and that is primarily to stop PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) oxidation. Most sources of PUFA come with Vitamin E, so this often works itself out in the diet. But cooking at higher temperature can destroy vitamin E. The Institute of Medicine didn&#x27;t express the RDA as a ratio between vitamin E and PUFA, but they wrote that &quot;high PUFA intakes should certainly be accompanied by increased vitamin E intakes.&quot; [2]<p>A natural source of vitamin E that is low in PUFA is red palm oil. But another way of dealing with vitamin E status is to avoid most vegetable oils and thus lower PUFA intake.<p>Vitamin C seems a more straightforward supplement, but even for that I avoid Vitamin C supplementation after exercise due to its potential inhibition of mitohormesis.
