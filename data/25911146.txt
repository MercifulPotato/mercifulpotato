If you file a lawsuit in which you yell at the opposing side without making any specific allegations as to what happened that deserves legal remedy, your case will be thrown out because it doesn&#x27;t make any sense. That was what happened to about half of the election cases. Accusations of fraud need to be plead &quot;with particularity&quot;. This means that in your initial filing, you have to allege a specific fraudulent action that was carried out by a specific group of people. The main thing that led election fraud cases to be thrown out was that no fraud was found, and none of the lawyers were willing to get disbarred by lying to the court. As such, all of the cases that shouted fraud were missing the description of what the fraud actually was. As such, the judges dismissed them because there wasn&#x27;t a viable claim.')
