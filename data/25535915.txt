I always liked the syntax and the ecosystem but felt like they were dragging their feet sitting at ancient computing paradigms for way too long. (Transparent parallelization like in Erlang&#x2F;Elixir, anyone?)<p>I feel the same way towards OCaml and its multicore saga as well. I figured I&#x27;ll just wait for 5.0 which is due at the end of 2021 (at least) and then will start afresh there without having to do 100+ legacy code and compatibility dances, and have multicore from the get go. (Sort of like starting with Python 3 and never touching 2, I suppose.)<p>Back to Ruby, I always felt it was too slow as well, at least when paired with Rails anyway -- JS and Erlang&#x2F;Elixir are much faster and are still dynamic.<p>But with 3.0 I might make a return to it. Shame that IO#select isn&#x27;t supported but with async and actors that&#x27;s likely not a big problem.<p>Here&#x27;s to exciting times ahead.')
