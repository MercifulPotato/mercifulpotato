The onus is on you to pay attention to your surroundings. It doesn&#x27;t matter whose fault it is if you clip a child at 40mph, they&#x27;re dead.</i><p>This is disingenuous.<p>Say for instance a person wants to die by being hit by traffic: they can jump out from behind a parked car right as the car passes.  So in at least some percentage of cases, there&#x27;s simply nothing even the most attentive driver could do to avoid hitting someone.<p>I&#x27;m not saying cars are never at fault (I walk, ride a bike, and ride a motorcycle, each more than I drive a car; I&#x27;ve got plenty of first hand experience with at-fault drivers) but framing it this way seems very dishonest to me.')
