No collective bargaining, no workplace issues, only political problems quite removed from the average worker at Google. Do they call themselves a union to get legal protection, or is there another reason why they don&#x27;t just drop the term?<p>Yes, it&#x27;s effectively a PAC, not a union. Just like at Kickstarter where they were more concerned about people deemed &#x27;conservative&#x27; not using the platform to promote comicbooks than anything related to work conditions.<p>A union shouldn&#x27;t be telling their boss who they can or cannot work with, partner with or have as clients, it&#x27;s plain insubordination especially when it has absolutely nothing to do with their own compensations or work conditions.<p>Obviously anybody can claim that employer B working with X or Y make their employees of class Z emotionally &#x27;distressed&#x27; or &#x27;unsafe&#x27;...<p>The irony&#x2F;hypocrisy here is people claiming &#x27;unions are political&#x27; when that thing at google is really just about being partisan, yet these people don&#x27;t have the courage to call a PAC...a PAC, and hide behind the word &#x27;union&#x27;.')
