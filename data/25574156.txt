My wife is a stay-at-home mom with no income. She&#x27;s about to have our 7th kid any day now. Living with us is her teenaged sister and elderly grandmother. We also have 2 cows, 40 chickens, 15 ducks, a goose, a guineacock and 2 dogs. I do have about $60k in student debt for my 3 years of engineering school. Don&#x27;t let some PhD doing studies in being &quot;neuroqueer&quot; tell you what&#x27;s not possible. Especially when she probably hasn&#x27;t set foot outside her metropolitan bubble.')
