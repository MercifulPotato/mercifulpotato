During her academic career, it was beat into her head <i>donâ€™t plagiarize, everything must be yours</i>.<p>In her first review after a few weeks on the job, her manager says that she takes too long to do her work; they just need her to take what the client says verbatim, fact check it, and then slap it in a document.
