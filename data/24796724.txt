The general pattern is a loosening of rigid characteristics driven by belief. What that means is depends on what you believed.

So if they find the probable external changes to <i>get</i> that better inner state abhorrent enough, then they should avoid that drug.<p>This works for the lobotomy example as well, if they have their memories in tact from before. You can assume there&#x27;s a decent chance you&#x27;d feel better if others with similar problems felt better, and you have to weigh that against fairly objective external changes which you might find abhorrent, fairly obvious in the case of a lobotomy.<p>Perhaps medical ethics should make a point that the type of changes you could experience should be outlined, but there&#x27;s a general pattern than I think can be defined and understood enough for informed consent to be given or withheld.')
