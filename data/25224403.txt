What I read is that this is not a good fit for how the data retention of an SSD works, it expects to be plugged in to power more frequently. If the storage is safe for 6 months to a year to 10 years, it would be good to know. I believe it may not be.<p>I entirely agree that its not the medium of choice yet, if ever.
