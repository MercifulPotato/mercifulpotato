I&#x27;m excited to see the M1 Air for all sorts of reasons. I&#x27;m excited to see ARM providing hard competition in this space, and excited to see the Air&#x2F;ultrabook form factor get attention again. I&#x27;m also frustrated because I&#x27;m tired of seeing these sorts of developments be leveraged to push all sorts of problems with DRM and privacy. Ideally I&#x27;d like to see this same thing be offered but with linux or BSD, or at least under owner control.<p>Having said all that, anything pertaining to battery life I&#x27;m skeptical of. In the products I&#x27;ve used, the battery life always declines over time, and in my experience Apple products have been the worst. I love my Macbook Air, but similar dramatic improvements in battery life were touted at the time I bought mine, and I&#x27;ve not been impressed over the years. Sure, at first, the battery life was amazing, but then not too long after I obtained it (a few months or so) the battery life dramatically declined. My Dells, in contrast, started out with less impressive battery use, but declined much less, so after about a year, the battery life was about the same: the Apples just started out great and declined dramatically, and the Dells started out less great and declined less.<p>There&#x27;s reasons to think this might be different, but so far the devices haven&#x27;t been around enough to really speak to me about the long-term battery life patterns. I&#x27;m hopeful and open-minded but also skeptical.')
