But to look to the government as some sort of Arbiter of Fairness, as Thomas Sowell might say &quot;Cosmic Justice,&quot; is very naive.  The government has no one person you can point to and hold accountable, but when you look in the mirror there is definitely someone who fits that description.  I do not think the solution to a more equitable society is greater taxation, because typically, the wealthy will not have it (and will do all in their power to prevent it), and the tax dollars already at play have yet to achieve it.  Were it the case that we were part of the way there and simply needed more funding, the argument might have merit, but the fact remains that many points of access are not equal and it does not come down to simple taxation, the problem is a societal, individual, collective, and motivational one.  Without addressing the actual root causes of inequity, distributing -or &quot;redistributing&quot; as people like to say- funds will amount to little more than an invitation to use force to take from the haves and deign to the have-nots, without creating any meaningful method of creating more value or unlocking more creativity in between.')
