As a direct consequence, it is possible to program at a higher level in C++ than in Rust. This gap will get larger as more libraries are written that exercise the difference, and as C++ adopts new features that expand the difference.<p>Within the HN echo chamber, the apparent situation is muddier because technical merits carry little weight vs. trendiness and surface sheen.<p>How likely game programmers are to use the greater capabilities is neither here nor there; they probably see more effect from the extremely slow compiler.')
