Item(by='jka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601811212, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24677752, text='&gt; This is a bigger problem, but in practice I assume it wouldn&#x27;t happen because if someone were to actually put in weeks or months of work into significantly improving the project, why wouldn&#x27;t you just hire them or pay them ? After all, the whole assumption here is that this is a model for a for-profit endevor.<p>This is getting a bit hypothetical, but here&#x27;s a question.  Lets say you&#x27;re an experienced software developer and you are using an application called &quot;A Large Well-Known Word Processor&quot; that is dual-licensed (A)GPL and proprietary, as explained in the post.<p>You might really want to add a feature that would save you time for a personal project, or just for your own sense of enjoyment.<p>Perhaps that feature had been discussed in support forums &#x2F; issue trackers, and you want to add it as a kind of pro-bono &#x2F; personal achievement in spare time.<p>And perhaps the company wouldn&#x27;t want to pay for it to be developed themselves, perhaps because it competes with a revenue-generating plugin in their ecosystem developed by a partner company.<p>As I say, it&#x27;s a little bit &quot;out there&quot; in terms of use cases, but in terms of the freedom to modify, improve and have input into the software that people collectively use, it&#x27;s a valid one.<p>Another commentor elsewhere on this thread mentions a potentially-related problem regarding jurisdictions where it&#x27;s not legally possible to remove your own copyright over materials you&#x27;ve produced.<p>That actually initially strikes me as a sensible policy, since it reduces the possibility of people being pressured (knowingly or unknowingly, with or without compensation) into losing control of their work.')
