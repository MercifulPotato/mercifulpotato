The whole process is utterly demeaning and demoralizing, especially if you&#x27;re from cultures where beating one&#x27;s chest is frowned upon (such as e.g. Russian).<p>You routinely see people do ridiculously awesome work and then get turned down for promo. You also routinely see people promoted who just sat in the meetings with the right people and took the credit for &quot;launching&quot; stuff. Major part of the reason why I left.')
