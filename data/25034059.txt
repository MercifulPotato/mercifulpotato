I meditate and in addition to helping me know my connectedness to the universe, all people, and nature here on earth, meditation is exercise to improve the ability to concentrate on work, art, cooking, really listening to people, etc. In my experience meditation == super power.<p>I also believe that what we eat strongly affects our lives. For myself, I avoid processed foods. I simply suggest paying attention to what you eat and how you feel, and act accordingly.<p>I also think that taking many short work breaks during the day helps productivity, especially if you are stuck on something. I live  a 90 second walk from a trailhead leading to national forest land. Amazing how 15 minutes in nature will bust through solving technical problems. Five minute breaks to play ping pong or racket ball on an Oculus Quest is also a good way for me to pause work and sometimes return with new ideas of perspectives.')
