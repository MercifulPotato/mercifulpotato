Not necessarily for the rest of the world. I&#x27;m sure they specify some temperature range, it&#x27;s just not quite enough. Besides it was left outside for 10 minutes, not hours.<p>To add insult to the injury, all my older Apple laptops were able to survive bouts on the balcony, and if anything, the winters were colder 10 years ago.')
