Frankly impressive for an OSS project.<p>However setting up and managing Syncthing is far from self-explanatory for a non-technical audience. It&#x27;s OK in our case as we can hand-hold and onboard people in-house, but not ideal. Syncthing&#x27;s usability would benefit immensely from an updated front-end UX, consistent across platforms.<p>Dropbox for all its recent dark patterns and upsells is still one of the most intuitive systems. Yes, the client UX has worsened, but the core service retains a very predictable behaviour. A folder is a folder. Shared with X and Y. When un-sharing or deleting a folder or file the options are clearly communicated. Compare this with Google Drive, where a &quot;file&quot; can become orphaned and keep existing in limbo, where it&#x27;s invisible in the browser or filesystem, but it&#x27;s discoverable by search. It drove us nuts multiple times making it very hard to track access to old documents without having to update settings one-by-one, etc. Google Drive feels like an afterthought to accompany the otherwise great Docs, Slides. and Sheets.')
