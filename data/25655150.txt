Item(by='zwm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609914694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650224, text='7: minecraft taught basic logic with red stone.\n8: tinkered with available tools to hack eg. lego games.\n9: godot programming via youtube video series.\n10: ??? will see.<p>If a kid is bored, they&#x27;ll think anything is fun. Key is to have a video game schedule; before that, &quot;technology&quot; is off limits. But the loophole is to allow access to certain apps (blender, godot, krita, puzzles, etc) before tech schedule if it doesn&#x27;t conflict with daily responsibilities such as homework. None of these were forced but encouraged indirectly. Again, if a kid doesn&#x27;t get hook on instant gratification with passive consumption of entertainment, the change is big your child will turn to exploration when bored...programming might be the natural direction given light encouragement.')
