Any reason it&#x27;s not available as a web app? It looks like it&#x27;s HTML&#x2F;JS anyway? At least going off your alpha code on github.<p>That would be helpful for students who often aren&#x27;t able to install software on school computers, people who have chromebooks, or people like me who don&#x27;t like running native apps unless they&#x27;re sandboxed somehow.<p>In any case, I hope you&#x27;re successful here - very exciting project!')
