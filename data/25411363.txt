Because as one gentleman found out when doing terabytes worth of off hours remote backups, your ISP is more than happy to come back and bite you if you <i>actually</i> put those contractual terms to the test.<p>The fact is, every last ISP has been caught extracting higher fees from users for purportedly unlimited plans, to which the user was given the understanding they werre paying to <i>not be throttled</i> then hiding behind weasel worded contractual clauses to avoid culpability so as to not be held to task by having to improve their network infrastructure to handle actual traffic needs.<p>I&#x27;m more than versed in networking. I may not work backbone services, but I&#x27;m aware of the foundations of it, and I&#x27;ve gone out of my way to get familiar with the business environments and models around it.<p>Yes it&#x27;s all statistical multiplexing. Yes. QoS is a purportedly necessary scourge to everyone in the modern day. Why? Because we allow ISP&#x27;s and connectivity providers to sit back and provide lackluster links, overpromise what&#x27;s being delivered, and wiggle off the hook.<p>My assertion is you shouldn&#x27;t be able to market unlimited. All it does is create a misleading and unmeasurable relationship where no one can be held to account, and the status of the &quot;relationship&quot; between the customer and provider is opaque to the customer.')
