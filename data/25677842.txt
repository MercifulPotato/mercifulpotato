Certainly way more than the 20 or so who showed up in primaries.<p>The issue was that a relatively large number of them had financial support and sizeable backing within the Republican party until late in the campaign. That&#x27;s less likely to happen if there&#x27;s one outstanding candidate. For example, it didn&#x27;t happen in 2020, not because nobody else wanted to be President, but because the GOP overwhelmingly agreed that Trump was their best bet.')
