A rectangular pizza baked in a greased, shallow pan with cheese that goes all the way to the edge. The bottom comes out golden brown with a fried texture but the base is otherwise very light and fluffy. This gives a crispy&#x2F;soft&#x2F;chewy contrast with the sauce&#x2F;cheese&#x2F;pepperoni on top. This type of pizza can also handle more sauce and toppings than a New York style without getting soggy. I prefer crispy over soggy any day, and I love toppings.<p>The cheese around the edges comes in contact with the metal pan and turns brown and crunchy, just like you get when the cheese leaks out into the pan with a grilled cheese sandwich. Amazing pizza!<p>If you don’t have a rectangular pan you can also make it in a cast iron skillet. Works extremely well!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seriouseats.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;how-to-make-detroit-style-pizza.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seriouseats.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;how-to-make-detroit-styl...</a>')
