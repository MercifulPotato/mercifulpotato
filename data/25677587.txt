Why not at least take a look at the New York Times article? Are you afraid you&#x27;ll forget you don&#x27;t trust them and take everything at face value?<p>Even if you don&#x27;t trust the journalists and editors at the NYT, the article links to primary sources from the US Supreme Court, Wisconsin Supreme Court, Pennsylvania Department of State and more so you can do your own research.<p>As a non-Trump-supporter who doesn&#x27;t trust the mainstream media, where do you get your objective facts about politics?
