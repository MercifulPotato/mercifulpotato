Item(by='rcoveson', descendants=None, kids=[25805751, 25807574], score=None, time=1610819606, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25802632, text='Can anybody explain to me why it ever seemed like a good idea to make both: (1) Semicolons at the ends of lines and (2) Function-call parentheses, not <i>required</i>, and not <i>illegal</i>, but <i>optional</i>? It strikes me as an abdication of the responsibility of a designer, like making both String::substring and String::substr available as aliases one to the other. Who cares? Choose one and stick with it! Otherwise it becomes a race between linter-writers and community programmers to see if the entire ecosystem will become polluted with an ugly mix of both styles. A race which the linter-writers always lose.')
