Because it doesn&#x27;t generate real value.<p>Lets compare to alternatives like dam and flood control infrastructure, better roads, rail, etc. I understand the real pragmatic benefits and return on investment from these.  A farm field is irrigated, a home not destroyed, less fuel used in trucking, on and on.  These investments generate real value because they increase the total of societal output, not just that particular factions slice of the pie.  Meaning, you are finding new gold to mine, not just taking over part of your neighbors gold mine and saying you are adding value.  Its not adding value to the overall economy.<p>Please help me, what real value does an investment like this yield for the economy as a whole?  As i understand it an investment like taking part of your neighbors gold mine, not mining new ground.<p>Effectively they have increased their slice of the pie, in this case it is time not land, but not made the overall pie bigger.<p>It is interesting to think about things this way, in terms of investments that increase the carrying capacity of our economy, and those that don&#x27;t.<p>Advertising comes to mind.  The cola wars, while expensive, dont yield a net increase in cola drinking, just a relative difference between the brands.  Same with beer, on and on.')
