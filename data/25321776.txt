Great kickoff to a lifelong love of his satire.\nCat&#x27;s Cradle shows both the horror and absurdity of Nuclear War. It&#x27;s unbelievable to imagine losing all the world&#x27;s water and yet anyone can fathom how actually horrific it would be. This is Vonnegut&#x27;s gift. Hard to imagine another write who can make you feel knowledgeable and challenged but also doesn&#x27;t require some deep subject&#x2F;stylistic knowledge of the allegories to be in on the joke.\nBreakfast of Champions is also a must read. No book has ever made me laugh out loud both at the deadpan delivery and absurdity.')
