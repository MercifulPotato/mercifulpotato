Except I&#x27;m Russian so for me it was VKontakte, the social network used by literally everyone, before it was bought by Mail.ru Group and started being turned into a profit machine, by which time I quit. It used to be a small team, maybe 10 developers, 4 sysadmins, 1 designer, and 1 Pavel Durov. Now it&#x27;s several hundred people and I can&#x27;t help but wonder where is so much work coming from to keep all of them busy. It&#x27;s also engulfed by advertising and most decisions are driven by KPIs, not user needs.<p>Everything interesting we&#x27;ve had was bought by Mail.ru, Yandex, or Sberbank. Everything runs on ads, which I consider the cancerous tumor of the internet.<p>Silicon Valley is even more depressing than that. I&#x27;ve been there, and I&#x27;ve seen these offices with rows and rows of desks that go as far as you could see. This didn&#x27;t feel like a welcoming environment. This also raised that question about what the hell do all these people do.<p>I want companies that are primarily concerned with making the world better, not making shareholders richer at the cost of everyone&#x27;s sanity.')
