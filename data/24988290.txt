For example that It has to decide if the scroll bar will be drawn or not. And it has to make that decision before it starts drawing layout items because there can be an item which expands from left-side to right-side(dynamic layout), so the finalLayoutWidth = originalLayoutWidth - scollBarWidth. Then it can compute item&#x27;s sizes and draw them. My solution is to save maximum layout size from previous frame.<p>SkyAlt would &quot;solve&quot; your example by quickly redrawing the frame. The power consumption is good because it&#x27;s redrawing only when the key is pressed or the mouse is moving, otherwise one frame every two seconds, so CPU is most of the time under 1% and my 3.6GHz CPU is running on 1.4GHz.')
