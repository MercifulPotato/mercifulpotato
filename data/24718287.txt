Item(by='exDM69', descendants=None, kids=[24718351], score=None, time=1602158349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718112, text='Yes, Japanese blacksmithing and metal industry is very highly skilled to compensate the poor quality of iron ore available in the region.<p>The &quot;ore&quot; (called Tamahagane) is sandy&#x2F;rocky stone material which needs to be forged repeatedly to remove impurities and get a higher carbon content in the steel. Then the forged bars are broken down, pieces sorted by carbon content and forge welded back together. This is a very labor and skill intensive process.<p>There was a really good blacksmithing video in YouTube about making a Katana from Tamahagane. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find it now, but my searches come up with many low quality vids on the subject.<p>If you&#x27;re feeling adventurous, you can buy some Tamahagane sword steel ore from here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dictum.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;steel-cca&#x2F;japanese-sword-steel-tamahagane-750-1000-g-719608" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dictum.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;steel-cca&#x2F;japanese-sword-steel-tam...</a>')
