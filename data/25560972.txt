They are a set of fossilized hominid footprints made in the Norfolk mud 800,000 years ago. In the UK, there&#x27;s old stuff all over the place (I live in a house that was built in the late 17th Century) so you get used to it, but 800,000 years is a length of time I find it hard to conceive of.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Happisburgh_footprints" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Happisburgh_footprints</a>')
