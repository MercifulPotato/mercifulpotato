Item(by='Ancapistani', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607702003, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25386653, text='&gt; For these people, the Confederate flag is a symbol of resistance to an oppressive nation state, and flying it is no more &quot;racist&quot; than it would be for someone to fly the flag of Tibet.<p>&gt; And obviously, some other people associate the Confederate flag with institutional slavery.<p>As someone who considers themselves squarely in the first group, but who is cognizant of others’ views and therefore choose alternate symbols, I feel compelled to point out that there is significant overlap. They are far from a “union set” (a pun!) but there are actual racists who use that flag.<p>I’m just happy that the actual first flag of the Confederacy is largely unmarred in popular culture, along with the Bonnie Blue')
