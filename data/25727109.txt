Item(by='compsciphd', descendants=None, kids=[25730467], score=None, time=1610361461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25714619, text='I think we can distinguish between a technical and a colloquial use of the term &quot;money laundering&quot;.  Yes, colloquial usage would annoy people who have to deal with the technical definition, but I think instead of trying to dispute the colloquial usage, which isn&#x27;t focused on the IRS, a better way for people to address it is that &quot;it&#x27;s not technically &#x27;money laundering&#x27; in the eyes of the law, but should be referred to as &#x27;xyz&#x27;&quot; (whatever xyz term that describe it better).  The way I was colloquial using it, was a way to get cash out of people&#x27;s stolen credit cards in a way that would be difficult to track back to the thief.<p>some argue above that there&#x27;s no fraud involved, it is people simply doing manufactured spend, that makes little sense to me, as there are cheaper and simpler ways of doing manufactured spend (I&#x27;ve done it!).  Heck, just buy the gift cards direct from amazon.')
