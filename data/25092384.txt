As I recall, the ultimate reason why this and similar technologies are not in use has nothing to do with whether the technology works or not. Apparently there is fairly little interest at present from the market for these technologies. That doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me (these technologies can clearly save a lot of money in the long run) but this is what I recall from the class. I&#x27;d speculate that the people with the power to implement the retrofits needed are skeptical of the benefits.')
