An early Internet company was sued for failing to take down defamatory content posted by an unidentified commenter on a message board. The company contended that it merely distributed the defamatory statement. But the company had also held itself out as a family-friendly service provider that moderated and took down offensive content. The court determined that the company’s decision to exercise editorial control over some content “render[ed] it a publisher” even for content it merely distributed</i><p>Judicial confusion is traditionally where SCOTUS steps in, and this article lays out a great deal of it.<p>I think we can expect a case clearly defining the limits of S230 in the not-too-distant future assuming direct legislative action changing the law is avoided.<p>Another:<p>&gt;<i>Paring back the sweeping immunity courts have read into\n§230 would not necessarily render defendants liable for\nonline misconduct. It simply would give plaintiffs a chance to raise their claims in the first place. Plaintiffs still must prove the merits of their cases, and some claims will undoubtedly fail.
