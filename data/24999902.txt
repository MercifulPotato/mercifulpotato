I just used it as an example of a language which has inheritance built into it. It&#x27;s completely optional, of course, and I was not suggesting anywhere that it was required. In fact, I rarely use it at all in my own C++ code, and when I do, I usually go the old fashioned C-like approach (for numerous reasons which I won&#x27;t explain in this comment).<p>In the article, I define inheritance as the following:<p>&gt; Most people generally view inheritance as a combination of subtyping and dynamic dispatch through virtual method tables (vtables).<p>So I did not confuse anything between regular and virtual member functions.<p>You have made a lot of assumptions about my views which are not even in the text.<p>And I agree Computer Science is very much not a science in the natural sense. I do with many more people would either say it is just mathematics (formal science) or start giving empirical evidence for their claims that &quot;X is the best way to Y&quot; (natural science).')
