So is Ruby’s behavior - calling the date invalid - is that bad behavior, or a totally reasonable choice to assume the DateTime is Gregorian? It would be neat if the exception said why the date was invalid, but I guess for any dates going back in history globally we should try to use a more sophisticated time lib that takes calendar and locale into account whenever they exist.')
