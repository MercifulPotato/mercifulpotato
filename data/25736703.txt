As for me the story with WhatsApp is clear, it&#x27;s Facebook and if you like being Zucked - go with it. But why so much hate on it?<p>On the other hand, every time Signal pops up the only answer I see: &#x27;because it does only e2e well which is only one feature of Telegram&#x27; - wrong, Signal does secure messaging and messager has to do its job well, that&#x27;s it. You need a media platform - go for Telegram&#x2F;WhatsApp&#x2F;Facebook, you need a messager - use Signal&#x2F;Wire&#x2F;etc<p>Does anyone else feels this bias towards WhatsApp? I cannot blame WhatsApp for being WhatsApp, that&#x27;s how FB makes money')
