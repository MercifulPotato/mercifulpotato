Systemic racism doesn&#x27;t exist in the United States. There are racists in the United States, but that doesn&#x27;t mean institutions are inherently racist. Also, racial stereotyping isn&#x27;t necessarily based on racism and not all bigots are racists. You can make an argument for systemic discrimination, but not on racial superiority.')
