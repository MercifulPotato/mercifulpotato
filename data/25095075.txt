If I know that corporation&#x27;s investors don&#x27;t have personal liability and still decide to go into business with them, it&#x27;s my personal decision to accept this risk and not society&#x27;s. If I so please, I could go into even riskier deals, up to just gifting them my money. It could be a stupid decision, but it&#x27;s my decision to make, not something that &quot;society&quot; can allow me to do â€“ actually, not society, but it&#x27;s worst enemy, the government.<p>Of course, some governments act out of assumptions that you stated, but it&#x27;s nothing more than just justification for tiranny.')
