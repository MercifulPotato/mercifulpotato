They don’t have enough ammunition and fuel for a full blown war. They don’t care about religion or doctrine. They are not trying to spread communism. They have no delusions they can take the Korean Peninsula.<p>Without anything motivating themselves besides just trying to survive, the motivation of everyone to fight is very low. That doesn’t make for a good dedicated army. Most NK soldiers would surrender as soon as they could.')
