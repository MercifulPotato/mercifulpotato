That will be helpful.<p>I know (in principle) how to use curl to send an authenticated API request via HTTP. That&#x27;s <i>authenticated</i>; you have to log in. I already have a twitter client for that use case.<p>There&#x27;s also unauthenticated API access (read-only public tweets only, as you&#x27;d expect). (I assume this is what nitter.net is doing.) Less tracking, but you still have to request an API key, so it is under Twitter&#x27;s control and they could in theory cut it off. It&#x27;s still not supporting the basic web principle of &quot;you can GET the flippin&#x27; data&quot;.<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m glad this is getting some public attention. I&#x27;m a little surprised that I was the first one to make a fuss about it.')
