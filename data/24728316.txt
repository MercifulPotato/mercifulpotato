More people can find issues. Many more people can find issues than can fix them. The bug tracker bloats. Core team members get called incompetent every 2 hrs. As a counter reaction some core team members get it into their head, to share less or react in unhelpful ways that have long term costs and things go back and forth in waves.<p>We have a few rules at work.<p>1. Focus on solutions over reactions.<p>2. It becomes easy to take advantage of weaknesses in people and squander their strengths, so try as much to do the opposite.<p>3. Have a plan to handle highly ambitious people before they show up. Don&#x27;t start wondering what to do after someone with more energy&#x2F;drive&#x2F;talent&#x2F;resource shows up and wants to take over everything, which will keep happening as networks expand.\nFor this we treat things like sports teams, which have to deal with a whole spectrum of highly driven people and get them to work in sync. Works out some days and blows up in our face on others.<p>There is no free lunch with transparency and growing networks. Just lot of tradeoffs.')
