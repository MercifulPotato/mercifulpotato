That&#x27;s just not true.<p>Edit to expand: it&#x27;s a partisan issue because structurally the democratic party is <i>already</i> a loose collection of interests.  They&#x27;ve always structured their internal workings around this kind of dealmaking and coalition-building.  Shifting to an environment where those groups (Blue Dogs, DSA, The Squad, the Congressional Black Caucus, etc...) become first class parties doesn&#x27;t really change the way democrats have always governed.')
