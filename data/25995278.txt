I also like to clean up my place because of the sense of accomplishment that it gives me (especially when at work I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m making progress because I spent all day coaching&#x2F;meetings&#x2F;etc) but not everyone might feel like that, I can definitely think of someone with ADHD that doesn&#x27;t like to clean up the same way I don&#x27;t like plan my meals (please don&#x27;t make me do it).')
