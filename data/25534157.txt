There were all kinds of different narratives such as how it would be the &#x27;easiest [deal] in human history&#x27;. Not to mention how poorly everything was formulated.<p>The referendum should&#x27;ve been a lot clearer in it&#x27;s goals and limits. It&#x27;s not a joke, it&#x27;s not possible to be brash with such things because you can&#x27;t redo it because then it becomes a matter of just redoing things until the party in power gets what they want. Cameron didn&#x27;t take it seriously because he was so confident that it wouldn&#x27;t come to pass.<p>In some ways, I am genuinely not surprised that Brexit happened when you have a large coalition of people that wanted hard brexit, people that thought it would be over and done with in one night, people that bought into the lies of british politicians about the EU because it&#x27;s a convenient scapegoat.<p>If the options outlined were May&#x27;s plan, no-deal or staying in the EU, things would&#x27;ve been very different.<p>Goddamn David Cameron.')
