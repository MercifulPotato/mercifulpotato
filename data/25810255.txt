One is called Amusia, which is a disorder affecting the ability to perceive music and difficulty remembering music.<p>There are people who can&#x27;t imagine pictures in their head, such as your example manipulating 3D scenes in your mind. They couldn&#x27;t do that. That&#x27;s known as aphantasia. There are also people without an inner-monologue, so they don&#x27;t think inside their head. I couldn&#x27;t find the name of that.<p>It&#x27;s an alien world to think of any of those possibilities, I guess you would work around it. I knew a graphic designer with aphantasia, and she was just as capable as the others!')
