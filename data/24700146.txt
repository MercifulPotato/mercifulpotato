That&#x27;s the entire feature.<p>(Also, HN frontpage traffic isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> much -- it&#x27;s a few requests per second at most, not thousands per second.)<p>The only scenario I can imagine where this would be a genuine concern would be if you were subjected to a (D)DoS-type attack. But in that case you still want legitimate users to get through, so you really need a separate DoS-protection layer which is totally orthogonal to this.<p>Am I missing something?')
