How can you honestly evaluate the value proposition of Apple&#x27;s &quot;great&quot; store, if they&#x27;ve killed all the competition?<p>You can&#x27;t.  Which is the whole damn point, because Epic <i>HAS</i> a store that I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d love to release on iOS but Apple prohibits it.<p>Basically - Apple is the bully who&#x27;s now crying foul when the competition is actually trying to enter the game.<p>From a monetary standpoint, I understand why Apple is doing this.  As a developer and distributor of software (my day job), I cannot express clearly enough how much I&#x27;d like to see Apple lose this case.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, they can fuck right off.<p>I&#x27;m firmly in the &quot;Handle it like MS and IE&quot; camp - I want a court ruling that not only prohibits Apple from stopping competition in their store space, I want a <i>MANDATORY</i> popup on first use that asks the user which store they&#x27;d like to use.')
