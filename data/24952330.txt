Tesla has no idea what damage has been done to the battery pack and how they were or were not repaired. If the car catches fire while supercharging then Tesla is the one in the news, not the company that rebuilt the car.<p>Battery safety and compliance testing is going to be a big industry in the next decade as a result IMO.')
