I develop software in C# and SQL for a local company, but still do help desk and a whole host of other IT things for them, at the same time.  You guys may have seen my Cyber Punk Trainer, I posted on here a couple of weeks ago. I want to move into a more &#x27;legitimate&#x27; development job, but I&#x27;m getting tons of rejection emails and putting in hundreds of applications with no response. I&#x27;ve been at it now for about 6 months, and, am honestly finding it hard to fight off the depression from being told &#x27;No&#x27; so consistently.  Once or twice I&#x27;ve done some coding tests for potential employers, but I still never make it past the recruiter.  I&#x27;ve been told on a couple of them, that I did fine on the coding challenges, but for the most part it&#x27;s sort of a &quot;You passed, but so did they&quot;, type of response. I&#x27;d appreciate any and all advice you guys have to give.  I just want to turn all this unbridled hunger, into a real career!\nThanks!')
