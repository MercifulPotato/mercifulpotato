Becoming a software engineer in the US is available to just about anyone, basically the cost of a cheap computer that sometimes literally rounds to &quot;free&quot; and some time. That is how I became a software engineer while working long hours at low-skill jobs. I eventually worked at FAANG and earned (much more than) $250k. This isn&#x27;t a unique story; one of the under-rated aspects of living in the US is that this is realistically possible and many people do it. Low salaries for engineers don&#x27;t help anyone except the company owners.<p>Poor people generally don&#x27;t pay for healthcare in the US for the most part. I have multiple family members that received (literally) state-of-the-art cancer treatment at top hospitals at no cost to themselves. The hospitals don&#x27;t even try to collect anything. That&#x27;s pretty normal in the US. Having to pay expensive medical bills is something that happens to the middle class, not the poor.')
