It&#x27;s just, cheap, reasonably good, easy to find and get. The idea of having to buy a non-Ikea desk scares me because I have no idea where to buy it (I&#x27;d have to spend time googling, analyzing and coping with uncertainty), I believe it&#x27;s going to be expensive (which also implies I&#x27;ll spend the rest of my life worrying about damaging its surface) and heavy. With Ikea I just go there and get whatever I need (+ an awesome Swedish dinner and best coffee ever).')
