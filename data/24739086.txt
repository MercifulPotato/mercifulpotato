Variables should not be allowed to change their type.<p>This sounds nice, but is there a way to accomplish it without losing some expressibility or concision? Rather than looking at JS, consider low-level operations on a small chunk of memory as a niche example. Interpreting the same region as a buffer of 64-bit ints vs 16-bit uints gives entirely different behavior to the standard operators like addition, multiplication, and shifts, and there are plenty of cases where it makes sense to mix and match those operators. It&#x27;s possible to construct a single type that encompasses all that behavior, but the price for doing so is a formidable wall of similar-looking method names rather than just being able to use a plus sign or other easier-to-understand constructs.')
