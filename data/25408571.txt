The trick is to pick a specific genre of music -- soul, rock, whatever. Use spotify&#x27;s playlists to get a rough idea of the genre and then use the radio feature to suggest more. There are good genre explorers, too -- i seem to remember one posted here that introduced me to tanci&#x2F;pingtan, and managed to find some example works to listen to.')
