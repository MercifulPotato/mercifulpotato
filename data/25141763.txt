The software jobs that pay high professional salaries are indeed competitive, but there are quite a few lower-paid jobs available.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is the case in your country, but my impression of the European market is that the pay difference between a &quot;mediocre&quot; and &quot;good&quot; job is pretty small: say, €40k vs €50k &#x2F; year for an entry-level job in one of the richer countries. In the US, a mediocre entry-level job might pay $50k &#x2F; year while a top-tier one pays $150k or more.<p>The level of competition for the higher tier is extreme.')
