Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[25003707], score=None, time=1604597303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24996871, text='&gt; Have we really arrived at a point where fact-checking and providing context to a claim is considered censorship?<p>Because it&#x27;s censorship. You do realize that the right-wing, muslims, chinese, russians, etc also have &quot;fact-checkers&quot; right?<p>You just think that &quot;fact-checkers&quot; are correct because you agree with their politics&#x2F;agenda. But on most controversial issues, it&#x27;s very hard to &quot;fact-check&quot;.<p>Take abortion. It&#x27;s clearly the killing of a human life, but it&#x27;s not murder since the fetus isn&#x27;t a person. There are lots of ways to &quot;fact-check&quot; and spin the issue on both sides. This is true for every controversial issue from lgbt to climate change.<p>Fact checking, just like news, is great for uncontroversial subjects. But for important controversial topics, it&#x27;s pretty much propaganda.<p>People like you are proof of why censorship is terrible and why we need free speech. Your bias clouds your judgment on facts&#x2F;reality. I&#x27;m pro-choice btw.')
