We would bind buttons on the diagram to send requests to external APIs to trigger requests etc. We also had things like packet counters and traffic flow diagrams on the canvas that would show additional detail.<p>We also repurposed it later to visually build networks of VMs: we would lay out the nodes and networks on the diagram, configure OS, network address settings etc and then hit a button to convert the diagram to an Ansible playbook that would make it all real.<p>That was a really fun project - I should dig out that code and play with Terraform some time. :)')
