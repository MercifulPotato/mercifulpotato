Item(by='donmcronald', descendants=None, kids=[24795482], score=None, time=1602801371, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24793945, text='&gt; Now we are trying to figure out how to manage real time publishing platforms that can&#x27;t (or won&#x27;t?) validate identity, won&#x27;t take responsibility for fact-checking, are open to targeted manipulation by adversaries, and are capable of distributing damaging lies and propaganda with little oversight or financial consequences.<p>The identity validation part is worth repeating.  I&#x27;m not a fan of real names, but I&#x27;d consider opting in to an identity that follows me between platforms so I could build a reputation.<p>I&#x27;d also like to see more transparency from social media platforms.  I&#x27;d love to be able to get metrics on a post.  X% of likes came from these countries.  X% of retweets came from known VPN IPs.  X% of shares came from IPs in known botnets.<p>I&#x27;d also LOVE to filter out people that participate over a certain volume.  If someone is spending 8h+ per day on Twitter, I want them hidden because IMO they have nothing to add if all of their experience is from social media and not the real world.')
