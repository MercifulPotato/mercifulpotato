This is exactly it. I live in Germany, and bought a petrol gar this year. I&#x27;d love to have a battery EV. I simply cannot charge it anywhere, maybe at work (and since Corona started I have been to the office exactly once). There are like two public charging spots in the city of 320k people I live in (that I know of), and I&#x27;d say 70% or 80% of people here do not have a driveway or garage. As long as this infrastructure problem is not solved the government can make EV cars cheaper or not, as long as people cannot use them, petrol will go strong.')
