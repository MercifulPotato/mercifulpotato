However, there are <i>tons</i> of web frameworks in various languages that provide way more out of the box than you can find in Rust. These frameworks have had tons of time to mature - Ruby on Rails is 16 years old, Django is 15 years old, Laravel is 9 years old, and so on.<p>I think (and hope) Rust will get there eventually, but I think it&#x27;ll take some time. There&#x27;s a lot of hype, but speaking as a web developer who&#x27;s interested in Rust I think there will need to be a lot more tooling and a lot of educational content before it gains any significant market share. I got my start with C&#x2F;C++ before I ever touched web stuff, but I never got too far into advanced language features. That combined with not having written a serious C program in years makes Rust something I&#x27;d really have to commit to learning, so even though I&#x27;d love to have a faster better-typed alternative to PHP I won&#x27;t be writing any actual webapps in Rust in the near term.<p>Basically, I think most of the people writing webapps in Rust will be Rust people interested in the web rather than web people interested in Rust for a while. There are of course organizations that do more complex stuff on the web and will jump on this sooner, especially places that use microservices and don&#x27;t have to move their whole platform over, but many people building simpler sites with smaller teams will wait until there&#x27;s a substantially larger ecosystem.')
