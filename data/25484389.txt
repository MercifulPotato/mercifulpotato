It&#x27;s like being born without legs and using what has been developed from science to correct the problem. Have the right hormones be distributed in the body and so I could&#x27;ve mimic&#x27;ed a somewhat normal life like a cis woman that cannot get pregnant. Unsure why you writing it a psychiatric disorder and then arguing it&#x27;s not a real thing while expressing your view as it&#x27;s science. A successful transition doesn&#x27;t need lifelong help and I have friends that are transgender that never have seen a therapist or a psychiatrist. They were ones that were lucky to get on puberty blockers or HRT young with good genetics to pass as their identity.')
