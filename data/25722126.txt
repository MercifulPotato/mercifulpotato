Trivial checks like whether it&#x27;s byte for byte identical are just as trivially bypassed by the uploader, e.g. by reencoding. Anything more complicated than that will fail to match with 100% accuracy, especially when the uploader is <i>trying</i> to cause that to happen. And then you would still have people complaining that the videos are there again.<p>This isn&#x27;t a job for the platform. It&#x27;s a job for the police.')
