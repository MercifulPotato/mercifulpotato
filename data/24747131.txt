It monitors CPU&#x2F;GPU temps then generates an HTML chart on SIGINT.<p>I like top-level await, the standard library and first-class typescript support.<p>I do wish the sandboxing was more granular. My small CLI tool requires: --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run and --unstable. I only need a read&#x2F;write in a single directory, run a single binary. Unstable is required for signal handling, but that shouldn&#x27;t be the case forever.<p>I&#x27;m glad someone is re-imagining JS&#x2F;TS on the back end. A robust and stable standard library could well improve the dependency hell and broken projects issues.')
