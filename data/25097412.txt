I have moments of being stuck in my house with my great family and say “man I’m tired of the pandemic” or “my kids are acting crazy”. Then I remember the lives of others, not just men who were drafted in the wars but their wives who had to make a living and raise their children in a time that it wasn’t so easy for them. I also think of other countries where people aren’t stuck in a house but a shack with 5 others and have to go out and do dangerous work.\n Not invalidating that there are people with depression that I could never understand. I also realize some people are very alone and don’t understand why.  BUT if your biggest problem is that you are stuck in your house or apartment over in Silicon Valley or NYC playing video games or reading books, I have a hard time being sympathetic. Things could be much much worse.')
