If one has a database filled with historical correlations between bluetooth devices &quot;in range&quot; and GPS coordinates, it is possible to get a pretty accurate fix on someone&#x27;s location from the current devices that are in range. This is the reason why Google has bundled Bluetooth and GPS in one permission.<p>Of course, the very fact that these permissions are bundled is the reason why it&#x27;s feasible to keep such databases up-to-date, and why up-to-date databases provide a continuously stronger case why Bluetooth should be considered a type of location permission..<p>It would be totally possible to separate location permissions between &quot;passive&quot; location (e.g. triangulation through received GPS coordinates), and &quot;active&quot; location, e.g. inference of location through indirect measures and correlations with historical databases.<p>Afaik it&#x27;s now a system-wide setting to disallow said correlations, but offering app developers more fine-grained control would be better for all of us. Why does, for example, my Sony Bluetooth headset need my location just for updating some firmware..')
