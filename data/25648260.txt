You suggested a good point about the Leaf is the ability to buy a used one for $7k.  I believe the way pricing works suggests that the Leaf has low desirability, because you can get one for so cheap.  What you&#x27;re implying appears to violate the law of demand, and I&#x27;m hoping you can explain what I&#x27;m missing.')
