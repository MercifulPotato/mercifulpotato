Story time.<p>Anyways, one thing really annoying about banana trees is how dry them get during the summers. It&#x27;s literally just a husk of dried plant matter that&#x27;s upright. So you can guess what happened when I had to burn some compost and organic waste, while not taking into account windspeeds. Nearly burned down our neighbor&#x27;s clothes hanging on the side, and possibly his house too when the fire nearly went out of control.<p>The trees are too hardy that even if you cut them by the stem, then burn the remainder, they&#x27;ll still grow after a few months. If you really want to pull out a banana tree, you better get an excavator to grab them by the roots.<p>Another thing, the sap from the Banana tree can really mess up any clothing you have, especially white ones.')
