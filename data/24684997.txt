Something I found weird is that it needs a daemon to run, integration didn&#x27;t seem very deep yet either. \nLonger term I&#x27;d be happy if it was deeply integrated, with Android apps running just like native ones. \nCurrently it still seems to need a daemon and a complete running Android system. Does anyone know whether it&#x27;s something one could get around or are we stuck with that?')
