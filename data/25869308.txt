Why shouldn&#x27;t respecting everyone&#x27;s privacy be the default?&quot;. I&#x27;m not speaking in the context of the article because the article depends on a whole bunch of other articles that were deleted, not linked to, or not published:<p>&gt; I think the New York Times wanted to write a fairly boring article about me, but *some guideline said they had to reveal subjects&#x27; real identities, if they knew them, unless the subject was in one of a few predefined sympathetic categories (eg sex workers)*. I did get to talk to a few sympathetic people from the Times, who were pretty confused about whether such a guideline existed, and certainly it&#x27;s honored more in the breach than in the observance (eg Virgil Texas). But *I still think the most likely explanation for what happened was that there was a rule sort of like that on the books, some departments and editors followed it more slavishly than others, and I had the bad luck to be assigned to a department and editor that followed it a lot.* That&#x27;s all. Anyway, *they did the right thing and decided not to publish the article*, so I have no remaining beef with them.')
