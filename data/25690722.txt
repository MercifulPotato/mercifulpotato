Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25693158], score=None, time=1610141148, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25690221, text='Tesla has plenty of MBAs, I&#x27;m sure. The trick is that MBAs &gt; writers who don&#x27;t even pretend to do research.<p>Right near the top is this: &quot;Consider a Tesla salesperson tasked with selling all three models.&quot; Tesla doesn&#x27;t need salespeople. Tesla sells its cars online. You go to tesla.com and click &quot;order&quot;. Tesla has &quot;galleries&quot;, but those aren&#x27;t sales people. When you want to buy a car, they take you to a kiosk in the back running the same web site.<p>Lots of other things are laughably wrong in retrospect, like his conviction that all of the other car companies would turn on a dime to start producing electric vehicles. He doesn&#x27;t appear to know anything about either those companies or the technology that&#x27;s specific to EVs.<p>But while that&#x27;s clearly wrong in retrospect, it&#x27;s the line about the sales people that really sticks in my craw. It wasn&#x27;t just a prediction; it was false on the face of it at the time, and readily verifiable. He wouldn&#x27;t have to be inside the company culture to know it.
