Every wrapper is a thing itself which must also be understood when trying to understand how things work. And every wrapper is a division between blocks of code, meaning if you have changes which impact multiple layers of wrap, its harder to determine what to change, and to maintain the understandability of each layer.<p>For this reason im an advocate of lazy wrapping. Create an abstraction at the last moment, when its painfully obvious what benefit it will provide, when you can see how it ties together disparate pre-existing code blocks, and when you have the highest confidence that it will stick and not need to be unwrapped next week by the senior dev.')
