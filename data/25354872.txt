Let alone giving that programming language an even half-thought-out library designed to help with such a task.<p>Even Go, which is really not amenable to any sort of in-language DSL or syntactic sugar, is nicer to use than XSLT itself.<p>XSLT locks you in a trunk without enough tools to do what you need. I remember using a variant of XSLT Microsoft put out back in the day that let you embed Javascript into it... but then I noticed, why not just do it in Javascript? So I did. And it was soooo much better.<p>There are good ideas in XSLT, but they are so buried in a cascade of bad decisions and limitations and restictions and missing functionality and bizarre ways of doing things (and I mean, I speak Haskell, pure FP doesn&#x27;t scare me, and they&#x27;re still bizarre) that the best remedy is just to start over.')
