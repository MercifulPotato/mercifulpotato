In Safari you can opt in to use display-p3 for colors in CSS, and it will display those as WCG and everything else still as sRGB. This looks amazing.<p>However, there’s Firefox which only supports sRGB, but then displays everything in WCG completely over saturating every single colored pixel on a website [1]. The only way to get your website to look the way you intended it on Firefox is to make the whole thing black and white.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;comments&#x2F;dloon6&#x2F;solving_firefoxs_color_saturation_issue_on_wide&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;comments&#x2F;dloon6&#x2F;solving_fir...</a>')
