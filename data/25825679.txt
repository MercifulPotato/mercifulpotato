I am going to try using both VS Code and Emacs on my current .Net 5 project. I installed the Emacs keybindings extension for VS Code. I upgraded from an ancient version of Emacs to version 27. I do really want to do development in both so as to decide what works best for me.<p>Emacs configuration is a labor of love as any Emacs user can attest to. I&#x27;m already at 50 hours and guestimate that I&#x27;ve got another 20 hours to go before it&#x27;s where I&#x27;d like it to be. This has required multiple tech support discussions on Stack Overflow and Github and Reddit. I constantly ask myself if it&#x27;s worth it, and only time will tell. But I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for 30 years and it&#x27;s a tough habit to break. Still, I can easily justify the effort as I&#x27;ll be using Emacs until my last keystroke. The open question is will I be using it for C#&#x2F;.Net development.<p>I do wish to give VS Code a fair go. And certainly it makes sense to be proficient in that editor.')
