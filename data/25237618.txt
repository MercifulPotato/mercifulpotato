A surgical mask fits only lightly over it, floating a half inch away from my face.  That&#x27;s better than nothing I suppose, but it really is only filtering big droplets.  All the air is going in and out that half inch.<p>An N95, with it&#x27;s rigid faceplate and strong rubber bands pressing it against my face, crushes the beard and makes breathing more difficult so I can tell some air is being filtered.  I&#x27;m not getting anywhere near the protection the n95 is designed to provide, it&#x27;s still much better than what the surgical mask does, which is almost nothing.  And I don&#x27;t use the valve kind, so any filtering the n95 is doing, it&#x27;s doing it in both directions.<p>The surgical mask with a beard is kind of like walking around with my hand held a half inch away from my face.')
