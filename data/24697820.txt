Yes, it&#x27;s impossible to select a perfect answer for all climates, but it&#x27;s absolutely possible to select an approximate answer for all estimates.<p>To make this more accessible, I made up four arbitrary tiers that approximately separate &quot;basil in a pot&quot; from &quot;an apple tree&quot;:<p>Tier 1: Herbs — basil, thyme, etc.<p>Tier 2: Greens — lettuce, dandelions, strawberries^<p>Tier 3: Buried foods — potatoes, carrots, beets, etc.<p>Tier 4: Large plants — fruit trees, tea bushes, artichokes, squash, etc.<p>^ These are grouped by my mental approximation of difficulty level, lowest to highest — <i>not</i> by taxonomic distinction. Please don&#x27;t derail with arguments about &quot;fruit or vegetable&quot;. They&#x27;re all food plants, Brant. One strawberry plant is about the size of a head of lettuce, and they both have easy root systems, so they&#x27;re both in tier 2.')
