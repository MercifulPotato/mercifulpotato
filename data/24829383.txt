Like if a friend used my location sharing to set fences to see when I&#x27;m going to a specific location and measured that, etc.<p>But if they used the fence around their own home to be like &quot;Hey, when&#x27;s he near my place so I can see if he wants to come hang&quot; I think I&#x27;d like that.<p>So perhaps, to me, the thing that makes me happy is intent. I bucket these people into high-trust so I expect them to not do the weird one (and they won&#x27;t even do the latter).')
