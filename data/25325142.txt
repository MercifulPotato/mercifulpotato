Item(by='skim_milk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607277085, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320077, text='&gt;Trying to decide if someone with one of these conditions is actually responsible for their own actions is as much of a philosophical problem as a moral one. But it&#x27;s absolutely clear that people with Dark Triad issues are almost invariably poisonous in organisations and will create extremely unpleasant and toxic experiences in a work environment.<p>I love this explanation so much, thank you.  People tend to want to forgive their fellow human being when they realize their odd behavior is connected to just them being a little awkward and anxious or nervous, and that&#x27;s great all of the time; everyone is constantly experiences both sides of this.<p>But when you&#x27;re HR and you see abuse at your organization, you gotta realize there&#x27;s a difference between having empathy and straight up rescue fantasies.  Sociopaths are rare so you&#x27;re rarely going to deal with them but they&#x27;re easy to spot and fire when they cause workplace trouble.  But people with narcissistic tendencies can and do hide behind HR&#x27;s rescue fantasies to be enabled to play out their fucked up world view on their workers, and that&#x27;s why we have so many psychology studies out here telling us to, yeah, just fire workplace abusers when it happens.')
