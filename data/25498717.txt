Intellectual &quot;property&quot; cases take especially vast amounts of resources because of the fuzziness involved. Meanwhile, treating workers as fungible producers of ideas that can be bought and sold both reduces the bargaining power of individual workers while empowering companies that can amass large portfolios of patents, etc. to use in litigation.<p>Not sure about reforms for the court system, but patent and copyright reform, combined with restrictions on unfair employment contracts, would go a long way to improving the situation.<p>[1] NDAs, NCAs, etc.')
