They&#x27;ll downvote you into obvlivion on &#x27;Fox News&#x27; comments - but this is not cancel culture.<p>Nobody is &#x27;losing their job&#x27; and being &#x27;publicly shamed&#x27; because they said the &#x27;like AOC&#x27;.<p>Sure - you might get a few Trumpers in your face for supporting one of the more perceptibly radical faces of the Demcorcatic party - but that&#x27;s just &#x27;angry culture&#x27; - not cancel culture.<p>&quot; Parler censored people for supporting BLM.&quot;<p>I strongly doubt this is true - even if it is - again, this is not &#x27;cancel culture&#x27; - this is just bad groupthink on a site.<p>If executives and staff were being fired and losing their jobs for showing up at a BLM rally, or donating money to BLM - that would be &#x27;cancel culture&#x27; - but I don&#x27;t believe that is happening.')
