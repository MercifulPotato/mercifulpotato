I don&#x27;t use direnv&#x2F;lorri, but I assume you would have to relaunch the IDE in the case of adding more dependencies, unless the IDE has nix-shell integration (like an emacs user mentions in a sibling comment).<p>I made a different way of setting up a development environment[1] that would probably work just as well for e.g. VSCode, that doesn&#x27;t require restarting the IDE.  I did this for lisp development, where dynamically loading libraries during development is fairly idiomatic; it took me about 15 minutes to write, and could probably be adapted for other IDEs as well.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.sr.ht&#x2F;~jasom&#x2F;nix-lisp-dev&#x2F;tree" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.sr.ht&#x2F;~jasom&#x2F;nix-lisp-dev&#x2F;tree</a>')
