There are hundreds of well-regarded universities in the world, many with massive private endowments - if just one of those universities could prove that they are capable of advancing valuable knowledge without falling into that publishing trap - why wouldn&#x27;t they? All of these institutions claim to have education and knowledge discovery as missions, but all they seem to do is build up barriers in the name of elitism.<p>The world needs innovators, discoverers, creatives, and engineers - but why is a university structure required for someone to be acknowledged as such? The market&#x27;s needs certainly can&#x27;t drive every valuable intellectual discovery - but I don&#x27;t think they preclude them. Government agencies (NASA, EPA) are also capable of doing research and publishing.<p>To be clear, I do think academia does serve a valuable role and is a good thing in general. I just think that it&#x27;s grown too broad in scope - probably because of the massive availability of government grants and competition for those grants.')
