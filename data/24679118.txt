It&#x27;s at the top because I carefully wrote it and purposefully kept it short and digestible. The long details of my life experience are linked rather than written out. People opt in to read more.<p>From past experience, the long, rambling, barely coherent rants I start with aren&#x27;t effective or well received. :)<p>Note: This comment was eight times longer and took about 8 minutes to reduce to what I have here. And I seriously considered deleting it because it doesn&#x27;t add much to the conversation. Only 20% of the comments I write survive to be posted.')
