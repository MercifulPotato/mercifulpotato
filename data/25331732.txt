It&#x27;s basically a way to use logical modeling to automate tasks, actions, and pull and push data for said automation. It&#x27;s parallel to programming - these folks are using iterators, splitting and recombining fields, creating reusable parts out of smaller parts. They basically ARE programming, but almost none of them know anything more about programming than Hello World in Python.<p>I find the situation absolutely bizarre')
