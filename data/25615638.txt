Really great work on those Iceland pics. It’s an original concept I haven’t seen before - adding thermal data to panoramas of landscapes with geothermal heat. So cool. I’m a bit jealous I didn’t think of it first.<p>Sounds like you have a science background and field, but I’d encourage you to think of these as art and chat to a few galleries about an exhibition.
