It doesn&#x27;t.<p>How does your personal worrying help at all? It doesn&#x27;t.<p>Are you affected today? No, you&#x27;re not.<p>If all you&#x27;re doing is passively reading news, then worrying is unproductive.<p>To state what should be obvious in 2020, there is always another crisis.<p>If mankind wants to do something about climate change, then they have about 80 years. So far no country has done anything, which shows you people&#x27;s true priority.<p>If you personally want to get involved, there&#x27;s lots to do over the next 80 years. But panic, sadness and pity won&#x27;t get you anywhere. The world dosn&#x27;t need another hysterical Greta Thunberg.')
