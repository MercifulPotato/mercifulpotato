The &quot;Aggregator&quot; would buy pool of accounts on their users behalf. Some more breakdown -<p>For this discussion - let&#x27;s say there are total of 10m users for these services but they all would never be online at the same time. So, the aggregator can buy 5m Netflix accounts, 1m Apple, 1m hulu, 2m HBO, and so on.<p>I think it&#x27;s a very fragile idea. Once Netflix, and the gang would figure out about the &quot;Aggregator&quot;, they might start blocking it. There are ways to handle that but how long are you going to play this cat and mouse game?')
