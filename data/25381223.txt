Zillow and OpenDoor will buy your house basically at a &quot;fair&quot; price and you don&#x27;t have to &quot;fix&quot; it up but really the advantage is that you get a 3 month window to close while you find a new place to live.  This means you don&#x27;t have to find an alternative rental in the meantime or sell your house on contingency.   The definitions of a &quot;fair price&quot; and &quot;fix up&quot; will depend on your negotiation ability, demand etc...  This model is eating up realtors margins.  In some sense you might be able to arbitrage VC money here in the short term as OpenDoor and Zillow buy market share.  In another sense you may want a realtor when you buy in a new market since you may not know the area and the regions future development plans.  Yes you can find that out yourself but it&#x27;s not easy to know the market.  In the long run someone like OpenDoor will own the buy and sell side entirely, I think it is inevitable.  Worse case OpenDoor has to pivot to rentals on their inventory.  VCs will invest billions in this and shape the market for sure.  Oh and you will be able to get a Zillow mortgage or OpenDoor one.. housing in the very real sense of the world will become vertically integrated. In that world you might get a better deal than dealer financing but you&#x27;d have to do your homework.')
