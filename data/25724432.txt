I seriously wonder how much generally pro-dem or apolitical people are going to find themselves Trump-curious or even Trump-sympathizing after all these bans and removals. I have almost no doubt there is going to be such effect, the only question is the scale. This is so obvious it almost seems a trap, like if president Trump himself had secretly ordered to ban him.')
