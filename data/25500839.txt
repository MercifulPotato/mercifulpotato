Deaths don&#x27;t automatically outweigh everything. This logic quickly breaks down once you apply it consistently. Traffic accidents are a huge cause of deaths, yet we don&#x27;t ban all vehicles.<p>There are massive costs associated with lockdowns, most of which we can probably only judge accurately once everything is over, and certainly there are second order effects which cost lives also. Such as suicides due to depression amplified by social isolation.<p>Those costs should be factored in. It&#x27;s not as simple as a blanket &quot;people are dying so everything is justified&quot;.')
