(As a side note, sites like this make me miss the old days of the Internet when everything was unique.)<p>People are indifferent to car dealerships (They&#x27;re all typically the same. Yes, luxo-brands will have free cookies and nicer waiting areas...), just like with insurance-- they are &quot;boring&quot; verticals so having something so out there works great. When you look at insurance companies, which companies have memorable marketing? Companies like Liberty Mutual with their vanilla &quot;Save $200&#x2F;year&quot; commercials, or the Geico Gecko, &quot;We are Farmers....&quot;, All State&#x27;s Mayhem, etc.. The cheesier the better, since auto insurance is a boring, fungible product to consumers. Compare to another boring vertical like Men&#x27;s Razors. They&#x27;re essentially all the same. How are any of the marketing campaigns from P&amp;G&#x2F;Unilever actually differentiated enough to be memorable (ignoring the duopoly considerations)?<p>Having unfortunately worked in marketing, everyone seems to shoot for the middle-- and they end up being bland and forgettable. Chances are, you&#x27;re not going to have a super memorable marketing campaign by doing something slightly different than everyone else. The companies I&#x27;ve worked with where their marketing is intentionally cheesy have always had better reception than the vanilla &quot;professional&quot; brands.')
