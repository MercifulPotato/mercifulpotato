I&#x27;m sure GrubHub and DoorDash are cheering.<p>Indexing and aggregating data is already covered by numerous laws.    If Google can aggregate restaurant listings without permission then why can&#x27;t others?   Linking is ok, showing a call button is ok, but delivering isn&#x27;t?<p>The law around copyright is clear: you can&#x27;t copy a restaurants menu without permission the same way you can&#x27;t copy someone&#x27;s blog post.  This should be enough.<p>If I want to pay a service to drive, purchase and deliver something for me it should be a human right, the same way that anyone should be able to walk into a restaurant and order without being refused service.<p>Why don&#x27;t restaurants want delivery companies doing this? The typical argument is bad Yelp reviews.  Instead of blaming delivery companies why not blame Yelp for not authenticating their reviews? Same way that you shouldn&#x27;t be able to leave an Amazon review without buying the product you shouldn&#x27;t be able to leave a yelp review without booking a table at the restaurant.  It&#x27;s Yelp&#x27;s fault for not authenticating reviews.  Restaurants should be benefiting from delivery companies distributing their products, and there is nothing preventing them from offering direct to consumer deliveries themselves')
