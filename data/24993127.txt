I&#x27;m also not quite sure what&#x27;s an &quot;app platform&quot;, but this seems to be some sort of a web publishing service, and there&#x27;s a bug on page creation: it leads to a 404 error page (possibly it requires JS, but doesn&#x27;t say so, and works without it otherwise).<p>Edit: Noticed the docs page [1]. There&#x27;s some scripting, so the uploaded pages are rather PHP-style scripts&#x2F;apps, hence the &quot;app platform&quot;, probably. Might be useful to link the documentation from the main page.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ugliest.app&#x2F;docs&#x2F;pages.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ugliest.app&#x2F;docs&#x2F;pages.html</a>')
