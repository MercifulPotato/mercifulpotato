I don&#x27;t have to sell cars to anyone if I don&#x27;t want to. If I do want to sell someone a car, I can specify a contract or license that they must follow if they buy my car. Ferrari famously only sells exclusive models to customers who have been pre-approved, i.e. they have a certain amount of income and own 5+ Ferraris already. I also cannot walk into a Lockheed Martin dealership and tell them to sell me a F-22, even if I can afford it, even if my country has permissive laws regarding the ownership of fighter aircraft.<p>As for software, well, EA has the right to ban me from their servers if I hack their games, even if I did pay for the product, and this makes sense because it ruins everyone else&#x27;s experience. I don&#x27;t pay for HN but if I did they still would have a right to ban my account if I start posting slurs or other abusive content.<p>Is it desirable? Of course it&#x27;s desirable; imagine having no control over your own creations and having to deal with the consequences of other people abusing it.')
