Everything is about the exit, and most exits are either acquisitions or IPOs. Neither type of exit mandates profitability, and both care capable of offloading to a greater fool.<p>A strong trend I&#x27;ve personally noticed with VC backed companies and something I&#x27;m highly wary of for our own company is the way it inevitably turns companies evil. I would highlight Google and Cloudflare as two examples, but the general trend seems to be that VC pressure inevitably forces you to hire &#x27;better&#x27; people who invariably steer the company to being more focused on profit and power rather than on some intrinsic mission.<p>Actual mission focused companies like Mozilla only seem to succeed if they stay private and stay away from VC.')
