All the manufacturer would then need to do is to add a few components that have an expected lifetime just after the warranty time.<p>On the whole, I agree with you that at the very least the battery and RAM should be easily replaceable. I just happen to also think that the increase in weight&#x2F;bulk is worthwhile tradeoff for the option for <i>me</i> to decide when I want to stop using the machine, not the manufacturer.')
