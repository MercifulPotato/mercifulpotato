It&#x27;s the perfect transition vehicle. I had a Smart Fortwo which was cute but had terrible range - followed by the Nissan Leaf which was better but had terrible battery life in the winter which has only been resolved recently.<p>Tesla Model 3&#x27;s are nice, but if you&#x27;re an economical driver the cost per mile is still way higher than a hybrid. Ugh.<p>EDIT: To clarify I&#x27;m referring to the total cost per mile, not just the cost to drive a mile - the Model 3 wins in that regard as far as I know. The problem is that the Model 3 costs tens of thousands of dollars more than the cheapest hybrids, so unless you&#x27;re going to keep your Model 3 for like 300K miles it&#x27;s not worth it on a purely economical basis.<p>If you compare to a gas car, again on a purely economical basis, it&#x27;s even more lopsided. Factor in used vehicles and <i>even more</i> so. I ended up just buying a used Corolla in the end sadly since it was cheaper and from my understanding more environmentally friendly.<p>TLDR: If you want to be &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; that means minimizing driving. However, if you minimize driving it makes basically no sense, economically or environmentally to buy an electric car - you&#x27;re better off buying a fuel efficient used vehicle. Please correct me if you believe I&#x27;m wrong in this thinking.')
