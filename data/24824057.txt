There are multiple suppliers and gas stations are owned by private entities.<p>&gt; there is always a shortage and you will see huge lines to fill up gas<p>Been driving for over 15 years, all over the country. Never have I seen shortages as you mention.<p>&gt;A large number of drivers live in slums which may not even have proper electricity so they can&#x27;t charge it at home<p>The target market for Ev&#x27;s, at-least for now, is the middle class office commuting people. As for drivers unable to charge their cars at home, they could park it in charging stations. Even now, drivers park their cars far away from their homes, as being slums, you don&#x27;t have place to even drive the car near their homes.<p>&gt; Most buildings are not designed to have electric chargers as we do not have a concept of &quot;parking spot&quot;<p>Almost all apartments constructed for past 10 - 15 years, and that is a <i>lot</i> mind you, have designated parking spaces for each and every apartment.')
