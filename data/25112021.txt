Normal businesses don&#x27;t get big.</i><p>That&#x27;s a non sequitur. In any case, Apple didn&#x27;t become big because they found a &quot;loophole&quot;. They were on the brink of bunrupcty and become big because they put out product after product that people liked: the first iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad.<p>And they didn&#x27;t even compete on cheaper prices, undercuttting the competition or anything: they did it while selling only on the higher end of the market, and charging the same or more than their PC&#x2F;mobile competitors.')
