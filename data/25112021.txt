Normal businesses don&#x27;t get big.</i><p>That&#x27;s a non sequitur. A lot of &quot;normal businesses&quot; became big.<p>In any case, Apple didn&#x27;t become big because they found a &quot;loophole&quot;. They were on the brink of bunrupcty and become big because they put out product after product that people liked: the first iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad.<p>And they didn&#x27;t even compete on cheaper prices, undercuttting the competition by throwing VC money (a trick Amazon did): they did it while selling only on the higher end of the market, and charging the same or more than their PC&#x2F;mobile competitors.<p>Oh, and for the most part they didn&#x27;t even do it though marketing either. Their ad budget was laughable and less than half to 1&#x2F;5th compared to competitors for the first 15 years. Heck, Samsung used double to triple Apple&#x27;s ad budget, and Google used 1&#x2F;2 Apple&#x27;s budget on just a single phone product.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;103266&#x2F;google-is-about-to-spend-half-of-apples-annual-marketing-budget-promoting-a-single-phone&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;103266&#x2F;google-is-about-to-spend-half-of-apple...</a>')
