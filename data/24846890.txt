Abstractions have a real cost, and they typically complicate a lot: I would advice to just make sure you centralize the access to your database in a single module &#x2F; class &#x2F; whatever, but other than that, swapping out databases seems like a non-goal to me.</i><p>I tend to agree, as long as the database you’re using is of the free and open source type so it’s a low-risk dependency.<p>The “pluggability principle” holds more strongly for higher-risk dependencies, IMHO. For example, if you’re working in an online environment and you can’t readily integrate a new payment processor or messaging service or whatever, your existing dependency starts to look like a single point of failure that is not under your control. Some careful abstraction of the essential features and avoiding dependencies on the peculiarities of any specific platform can be a valuable safety blanket if your external dependency catches fire one day.')
