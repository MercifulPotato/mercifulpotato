Saw this same scenario play out many times between services at FB, and I&#x27;m still really not sure there&#x27;s a good &quot;one size fits all&quot; answer either there or at peer companies like Google. For every &quot;just do X&quot; I&#x27;ve seen here I could probably identify the incident where that fix led to or exacerbated a different outage. Sometimes teams don&#x27;t collaborate well, and that requires a <i>specific</i> fix beyond outsiders&#x27; view instead of more platitudes.')
