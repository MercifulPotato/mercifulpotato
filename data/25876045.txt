Can anyone in good faith argue for a JS project which offers the stability, refinement, and elegance of projects available for Ruby (Rails), Python (Django), Elixir (Phoenix), etc? Even micro-frameworks like Flask, which don&#x27;t include tons of batteries, are still much more dev-friendly than Node&#x2F;Express&#x2F;React&#x2F;etc.')
