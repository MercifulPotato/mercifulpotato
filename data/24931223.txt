Everyone would agree passing off different food is fraud. Using a different number and marketing yourself as jdmichael&#x27;s friendly delivery service is not fraud, since the customer knows they are not working directly with the restaurant. Using a different number and marketing yourself as the restaurant IMO is fraudulent.')
