I&#x27;ve been a party pooper on a Rails meetup before, people were extremely clueless where Ruby ends and Rails starts. Nothing wrong about it, but it can be a bit worrying sometimes how much misinformation is being spread.<p>For the record, I like Ruby -- but no longer work with it. I feel there are languages that picked up its slack for years now. Might come back to it now with the 3.0 release (provided Rails works with it). Actually excited to see if it&#x27;s better now.<p>So I am not mindlessly hating. But &quot;raving&quot; about something is not a data point.')
