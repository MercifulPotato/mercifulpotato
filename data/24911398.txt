I can certainly imagine a scenario that plays out like the following:<p>Step 1 - Eliminate geographic considerations for salary.<p>Step 2 - Scale all salaries to expensive markets.<p>Step 3 - Slowly allow salaries to stagnate until employees in expensive markets are no longer receiving fair pay.<p>Step 4 - Employees in expensive markets leave for other jobs.<p>Step 5 - Allow steps 3 and 4 to repeat themselves as many times as you like.<p>Step 6 - Company has now decreased employee salaries and physical expenses like office space.<p>Step 7 - Profit.')
