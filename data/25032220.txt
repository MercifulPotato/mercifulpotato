Yes, reasons can add up. No, a reason doesn&#x27;t have to be sufficient on its own. The car having uncomfortable seats, loud exhaust or no android Auto are not a reason to swap cars alone, but in aggregate they are.<p>Like, think about houses - a small bedroom, noisy neighbour and no fast internet are probably no reasons to move houses on their own - if you told someone you moved houses just because your neighbour was loud people would think you&#x27;re weird. But when you start listing other reasons in addition to that, people understand. Same for relationships(small reason to leave add up), changing employment or even changing your phone - once the list of reasons for changing is long enough, you make the jump, you can finish justify it to yourself.<p>And FYI - in UK you can&#x27;t keep a lease, that&#x27;s specifically the difference between a lease and a purchase contract. I&#x27;m also not a native English speaker so apologies for perhaps not explaining things clearer.')
