No, it’s not hard to establish reasonable doubt with that.<p>But that’s damn well enough for a search warrant to sieze electronics from somebody’s home.  Being fired for insubordination, she had motivation, the terrible security practices gave her opportunity, and IP logs are a clear piece of evidence that it could be her.<p>That’s a pretty solid ground for granting a search warrant.<p>Hanging up on officers and denying them entry for twenty minutes is a good way to make them nervous about your intentions as well.<p>IPs can be spoofed? Sorry it would take a hell of a lot of sophistication for that to be what happened or outright evidence falsification on the prosecution.
