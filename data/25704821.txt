They&#x27;re more along the civil rights dimension.<p>The 1964 Civil Rights Act didn&#x27;t mandate equal access because of Big Restaurant or Big Bus Stop--it was because segregation was an exceedingly immoral, dehumanizing, discriminatory action against millions of people.<p>That Big Tech finds half the country so odious they are willing to ban them is pretty gross to me.  I think people should be served, as humans, irrespective of their beliefs.  I don&#x27;t think it matters whether those beliefs are religious or political (the new religion for a lot of people).')
