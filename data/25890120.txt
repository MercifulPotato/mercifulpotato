With a monolith, you have to deploy more instances of the entire monolith to scale it, and that’s if the monolith even allows for that approach. If you take the high load parts and factor them out into a scalable microservice, you can leave the rest of the system alone while scaling only the bottlenecks.<p>All of this is in the assumption you need to scale horizontally. With modern hardware most systems don’t need that scalability. But it’s one of those “but what if we strike gold” things, where systems will be designed for a fantasy workload instead of a realistic one, because it’s assumed to be hard to go from a monolith to a microservice if that fantasy workload ever presents itself (imho not that hard if you have good abstractions inside the monolith).')
