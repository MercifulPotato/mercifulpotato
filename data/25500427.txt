We&#x27;ve found that the best way to avoid scheduling conflicts is to let kids drop in anytime in a big zoom room and then assign them to breakout rooms with tutors for 1-1 support.<p>The way masteryhour.org works is that students drop in to our zoom room at 10am or 3pm and we assign them to a tutor and send them to a breakout room.\nCurrently, we&#x27;ve been assigning tutors to students manually, but in order for this to scale, we need to be able to automate the process.<p>We are growing really fast and we need a solution for this problem as soon as possible!<p>The basic tags we need to assign breakout rooms are &quot;student&quot; and &quot;tutor&quot;,<p>However, if possible, we&#x27;d like to add more specific categories like &quot;can tutor high level math&quot; &quot;prefers to tutor elementary math&quot; &quot;speaks Spanish,&quot; as well as recency so we can establish some type of continuity.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the best approach to do this might be - if zoom already has a tagging system or if we want to build a bot to do this project.<p>Would love your thoughts on the easiest way to do this in the short-term. Or if anyone wants to volunteer to set this up for us, we&#x27;d love help:)')
