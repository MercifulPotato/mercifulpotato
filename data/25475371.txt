It&#x27;s faster and more responsive in every way. Especially under load<p>The most noticeable things for Xcode are:<p>- Iterating is faster, the build-run loop is much quicker so it feels lighter when you make code changes<p>- Indexing and autocomplete is very quick. Noticeably better than the MBP<p>I also use Android Studio and it&#x27;s definitely not as quick or smooth as Xcode. But it never was on my old Intel machine either. The UI seems to lag under load and navigating a large code-base just feels a bit more clunky due to lag on character input and opening files<p>Android Studio feels about the same as it did on my i9 as the M1')
