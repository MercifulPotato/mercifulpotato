The benefits seem really great, but it&#x27;s such a daunting hill to climb. You can&#x27;t just have a couple different services and <i>boom</i> everything works. You need to worry about consistency, efficiency (e.g. no database joins), and so many other things. Then there&#x27;s a question of how do you handle things that used to be simple-- i.e. a POST request maybe used to return an id but now it just returns 201 and that&#x27;s it since you have event sourcing and the instance is eventually created.<p>In the end, I wonder how many companies really need microservices. What if boundaries between apps were actually enforced?')
