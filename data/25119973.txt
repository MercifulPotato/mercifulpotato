When we talk about stimulus programs, we need to think about where that money goes.  If you&#x27;re encouraging people to buy new cars, then this carries quite some negative externalities as it eats into Earth&#x27;s budget for nonrenewable resources and emissions.  If it goes into services (say, personal training), then that kind of spending is pure good.<p>&gt; If no one consumed anything above basic subsistence, we&#x27;d have a lot less economic growth, fewer innovations, and inferior technology (including medical technology).<p>I take issue with the use of the term &quot;economic growth&quot; like it&#x27;s a self-evident goal.  The problem is when it&#x27;s measured in GDP -- ie., spend more to make the chart look better.  But in that case, we fall into the fallacy of ignoring externalities.')
