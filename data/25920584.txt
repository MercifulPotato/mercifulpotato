If all Firefox 85+ users are partitioning, then any inferences drawn from that behavior do not increase your trackability â€” and it could well decrease it, as those Firefox 85+ users will be joining the swarm of Safari users whose browser has already done the same sort of partitioning for a couple years.<p>Multi Account Containers are an oddity, and alone they would not be particularly distinguishable from a multi-user computer (which, at a home residence, could be unusual; many people don&#x27;t have User Accounts on a shared device). However, when combined with cross-container tracking infection (such as URL parameter tags designed to survive a transition to another container, e.g. fbclid or utm_*), it&#x27;s possible to identify that a user is using containers, which is a very rare thing and not available by default, thus increasing risk of being tracked.<p>UBlock Origin allows far too much customization for me to prepare any clear reply there. I imagine it is possible to run UBO with a ruleset that only interferes with requests to third-party adservers, without letting the first-party know that this is occurring. I doubt, however, that a majority of UBO users are running in such a circumspect mode. Adblocking often requires interfering with JavaScript in ways that are easily visible to the first-party (who has a vested interest in preventing ad fraud).<p>Fingerprinting is a known defense against fraudulent clicks, so there&#x27;s a lot to puzzle over there. But I definitely don&#x27;t like to take active steps to make myself stand out from others. I&#x27;m annoyed that I&#x27;m tracked a little on the web, but I&#x27;m indistinguishable from the general pool of &quot;users with default browser settings&quot; today. That&#x27;s a type of protection that addons can&#x27;t provide. I&#x27;m not wholly certain what I think yet, but happily the browsers continue advancing the front of protection forward, so maybe by the time I decide it won&#x27;t matter anymore. YMMV.<p>ps. I&#x27;m glad to see your much more nuanced consideration of this balance, and I wish that more took your careful approach here when recommending &quot;privacy&quot; setups to others.')
