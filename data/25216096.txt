Especially with my strategy.  Also you get 100x leverage. So I will give you a sample trade from today.<p>I bought Dec04 $600 Calls for $900 each at 9:55 am. At 1:25 I sold for $1820. So $1000 would be $2000. Now to make $1,000 in shares it would require ($1000&#x2F;($25)) so I would need 40 shares (40*$550) = $22,000 risk.<p>Now I only buy calls or puts so my upside is always unlimited but downside is limited to the initial order.<p>Swing trading stocks is really hard because you have to sleep on $22,000 overnight. You can wake up with nothing in a black swan event. With options the most I will get hit on is $50-$100,000 which I have in the market at once. The rest is ready in the savings account in cash or etfs&#x2F;TSLA stock.<p>I think options are the safest bet. Everyone starting out should look into the wheel strategy as it&#x27;s basically free money for shareholders.')
