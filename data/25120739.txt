So which n is special in the model that you get from the model existence theorem? Doesn&#x27;t it all get somehow equivalence-classed away?<p>The model existence theorem relies on extending your original language (and therefore your theory) with a bunch of new constants. So in this case you would end up conjuring up a specific new constant symbol just for `Special`.<p>You then &quot;forget&quot; about all those constants when you retract back to your original theory and so you lose the one-to-one relationship.<p>So it is true that if your original theory is Henkin (i.e. there is a constant symbol witnessing every single existential statement you have) and maximally consistent, then there exists a model that coincides exactly with your theory, in particular the model that is constructed from all your constant symbols modulo equality in your theory.<p>But most theories are not Henkin. And moreover most theories are not maximally consistent (since that would imply completeness in the sense of Godel&#x27;s <i>incompleteness</i> theorems). In particular the theory you get out of the model existence theorem is usually not computably enumerable, so you can&#x27;t actually write down your extended theory.<p>So most theories do not have that nice property that they correspond exactly with the semantic properties of a model.')
