I think of it as a transient emergent configuration of neural systems, like waves in an ocean, but I could be wrong.<p>Are you sure the <i>you</i> that wakes up in the morning is the same <i>you</i> that went to bed? Are you even the same person, moment to moment?<p>Weights change. Membrane polarizations are in flux. Microtubules, just one component in a deep sea of biochemical complexity, are dynamical.<p>&gt; The true immortality<p>These are just words.<p>Evolution found genes as a solution. That&#x27;s what your kids are. Humans have done even more with recorded words. I&#x27;d like to think that one day we can do the same with thoughts and minds themselves.<p>I like to imagine a future where you could download part of my mind and experience it yourself.')
