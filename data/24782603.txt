Item(by='honkycat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602715571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24781730, text='&gt; No one at this point - parents, players, fans - should have any illusions about the consequences of playing these games.<p>I have a friend who is a high school football coach. In his words: &quot;Only people playing at a really high level are at risk&quot; even though we know for a fact this isn&#x27;t true, and high school level players CAN and DO get CTE[0].<p>People do not take the risk seriously, and they DO NOT understand what they are getting into. Nobody is sending consultants to schools, or having school assemblies about &quot;the dangers of CTE&quot; like they do with drugs and alcohol. No, they are burying their heads in the sand and having pep rallies and dangling the glory of becoming a college football star to attract people.<p>&gt; Many things in life can have severe, life-destroying consequences including smoking, drinking, and eating fast food, but none of those can pay you tens of millions of dollars and the praise of millions of people like sports can.<p>The percent of people who become professional athletes is absolutely tiny. So because a tiny fraction of athletes will make millions of dollars, the topic is unworthy of discussion?<p>I think you just trying to convince yourself there are no victims in your athletic meat grinder.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;consumer.healthday.com&#x2F;kids-health-information-23&#x2F;child-safety-news-587&#x2F;brain-condition-cte-seen-in-h-s-football-players-study-743006.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;consumer.healthday.com&#x2F;kids-health-information-23&#x2F;ch...</a>')
