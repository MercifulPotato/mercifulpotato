I can buy non-ECC RAM at almost any retailer that sells computers.  If I need non-ECC RAM right now I can have it in my hands in 30 minutes.  ECC on the other hand I pretty much have to buy online.  Microcenter stocks a single 4GB stick of PC4-21300, and I can&#x27;t think of a single use case where I&#x27;d want ECC but not more than 4GB.')
