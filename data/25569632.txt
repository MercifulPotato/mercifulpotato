ISP treating delegated prefixes the same way as a dynamic IP in IPv4 (as in, change it often and randomly) is one of my major pains as a user of IPv6. The whole network stack is very bad at handling this - it results in a very annoying, semi-broken network where things kind of work, but not really: hosts on local network might be reachable or not, depending on when they get the prefix change and adjust their global addresses accordingly. Hosts further uplink might be reachable or not, depending on when and in what sequence the ISP&#x27;s routers get notified of the change. It&#x27;s a nightmare if you want to have any kind of reliable connectivity.')
