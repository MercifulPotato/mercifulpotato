Let there be a field &lt;input type=pake challenge=blah &#x2F;&gt;. Whatever is typed into that field is unavailable to the front-end code. Instead, the browser computes a one-way function of the password, challenge and origin, and makes <i>that</i> available to the front-end.<p>The devil is in the details, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that a robust security analysis could eventually produce a solution that allows any user to type any password in a &quot;super-password&quot; field, and rest assured that the phishers are out.<p>The next issues would be:\n- How to prevent &quot;downgrade&quot; attacks, i.e., the user should immediately notice if a legacy password field is used.\n- How to convince the Internet to adopt this.')
