(I&#x27;m well-read on startup literature.)<p>I&#x27;m a problem solver. Give me a problem and throw me in the deep end. You don&#x27;t have to keep checking on me. I&#x27;ll find a way out. I&#x27;ll either solve the problem or provide you with the necessary information to make an informed decision.<p>I specialise in debugging hard problems which no one else wants to do.<p>I keep myself busy. You can see from my work history that, if not employed, I always have a side project happening. But don&#x27;t let that deter you. I&#x27;m always willing to shuffle my priorities for the right opportunity.<p>Thank you for reading and hope to hear from you.<p>(No recruiters please.)')
