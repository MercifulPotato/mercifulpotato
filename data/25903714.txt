Could the 737 MAX be certified without MCAS?<p>1b. Could the 737 MAX be certified <i>within the existing 737 family</i> without MCAS?<p>2. Could the 737 MAX be flown safely under normal circumstances without MCAS?<p>3. Could the 737 MAX be flown safely under <i>exceptional circumstances</i> by a <i>competent</i> pilot without MCAS?<p>3b. Could the 737 MAX be flown safely under <i>exceptional circumstances</i> by an <i>average</i> pilot without MCAS?<p>(Note: By competent, I mean a hypothetical &quot;no human errors&quot; pilot. I don&#x27;t mean to imply that the real pilots were bad or are to be blamed for the crashes; and I am fully aware that systems must be built taking into account that minor operator error will invariably happen.)<p>As far as I can tell:<p>1. No, the MAX would not be certifiable without MCAS, due to the requirement that AoA not increase without stick forces increase in certain flight regimes.<p>1b. No, if the MAX can&#x27;t be certified, it can&#x27;t be grandfathered into the existing certificate.<p>2. Yeah, the MAX would fly perfectly fine in almost all flight regimes without MCAS.<p>3a. Yeah, even in exceptional flight regimes, a competent pilot could fly the MAX perfectly fine. He&#x27;d have to recognise an uncommanded AoA increase and push the stick forward.<p>3b. Maybe. A mediocre pilot might struggle with the MAX in certain flight regimes, due to its pitch-up tendencies.<p>Interestingly, a competent pilot could also deal with the erroneously deployed MCAS (recognise the ran away stab trim condition, pull the circuit breaker), as Boeing explicitly assumed.<p>&gt; mask the reality that the plane needed a recertification due to its inadequate aerodynamics<p>That&#x27;s not accurate, I&#x27;d say. There was no &quot;masking&quot; going on. I think the aerodynamics are fine, largely, and MCAS was added to fulfil a certification requirement.')
