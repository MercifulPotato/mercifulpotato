Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=[25108313], score=None, time=1605489473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25106513, text='&gt; It pissed me off enough where I did give it a full go on Linux with Gimp Shop and some other alternative open source alternatives, but it just wasn&#x27;t the same - which really bummed me out.<p>Is Gimp Shop still a thing?<p>Wikipedia says the stable release is from 2006.<p>Going to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gimpshop.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gimpshop.com&#x2F;</a> leads you to the official gimp site when you try to download it.<p>It kind of looks like maybe it&#x27;s a marketing site for gimp now?<p>I was one of those people who moved from Photoshop to gimp and for the longest time I thought gimp was really bad but after customizing a few hotkeys and setting up some pre-made scripts and brushes it&#x27;s pretty decent. At least for casually making YouTube thumbnails and things like that.<p>Some design decisions still leave me baffled tho, like not having a default bind to merge a layer down or not being able to easily center things relative to objects in an intuitive and graphical way (ie. dragging something until it snaps in place while seeing some temporary guide lines overlay near where it&#x27;s snapped and some basic pixel measurements near it).')
