I want at least 6 (ideally 8) rotors that each have their own motors and at least 3 redundant controllers.  A single motor to gearbox driving 4 props sounds problematic.  I would also like to know the capacity of the batteries and minimum flight time.  Does this have ADS-B so other aircraft can see me?  Will this only be allowed in class-G airspace?  Will these be considered IFR (assuming class c&#x2F;d&#x2F;e airspace) and will the automation assume the FAA requirements for IFR landing or is this on the pilot?  How much do these weigh?  Will these vehicles be designated a call-sign?  Is manual control permitted or will these be &quot;driverless&quot; and GPS only?  Will the GPS get TFR&#x27;s and CFA&#x27;s and automatically route around?  What GPS will these have?  What ambient air temperature are these rated at?<p>Oh, I missed the most important question. How much will these cost?')
