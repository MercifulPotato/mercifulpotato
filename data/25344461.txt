Item(by='bregma', descendants=None, kids=[25344750], score=None, time=1607431890, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25331944, text='&gt; Homeless people aren&#x27;t being treated differently for &quot;not thinking the correct thoughts&quot;, or &quot;not being morally aligned&quot;.<p>Homeless people who hear voices or are delusional  are treated differently precisely because they are not thinking the correct thoughts.<p>Homeless people who indulge in self-mediation with alcohol or other drugs are treated differently precisely because those behaviours are not considered morally aligned.<p>&gt; They are treated differently from ordinary people, but if any ordinary person did the same they would be treated that way too.<p>Plenty of people with homes are addicts. Plenty of people with homes suffer from depression or other conditions. I don&#x27;t read a lot about how they should be rounded up by the authorities and reformed or institutionalized.<p>&gt; Being treated differently based on behaviour is not necessarily wrong.<p>In the 1930s Soviet Union under Josef Stalin, political opposition was considered a mental illness just like schizophrenia and hysteria. You were considered crazy of you did not support the regime. Thousands of these crazies were rounded up, often in the middle of the night, and institutionalized in an attempt to cure them. The fresh air and honest labour of camps in Siberia were considered just the thing to help.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s not necessarily wrong to treat someone differently based on behaviour. We consider it reasonable to isolate an individual who demonstrably poses a danger to others. The line is poorly drawn when it comes to differentiating between danger and inconvenience. Is seeing someone in a park smelling like urine and talking to someone you can&#x27;t see enough of a threat to be isolated and force-fed mind-altering drugs? Does making unproven accusations demonstrate enough possibility of danger that we should &quot;lock her up&quot;?<p>Where does the line get drawn, and who has the privilege of drawing it?')
