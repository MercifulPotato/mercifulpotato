Item(by='collyw', descendants=None, kids=[25441376], score=None, time=1608117254, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441240, text='&gt; I think the opposite is true. GraphQL puts most of the onus on the client to know the data model, define their own queries, understand how to join data etc. REST-style APIs do all of this on the server side, and provide the most interesting query results directly.<p>This is how I view graphql (despite not having used it). It seems better practice to keep the querying done in the backend and keep frontend for display logic more than anything. Seems like graphql will encourage business logic in the frontend (my current workplace has this problem and it is not something that should be encouraged).')
