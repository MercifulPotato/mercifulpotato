Deployed networks typically use only inference from pretrained weights, and those weights are what get transferred for model &quot;updates&quot;. You can have all your devices using weight array W0 for a neural net architecture, spend a million compute hours training that net on cutting edge systems to produce a much better weight array W1, then upgrade all the deployed devices by sending them W1 which will be the same size as W0.')
