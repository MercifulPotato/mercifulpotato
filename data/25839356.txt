Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611092946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829886, text='&gt; <i>I like some of the ideas of the Right that they believe that States are governments to experiment with</i><p>That&#x27;s mostly feels like just all talk, though.  A concrete example: California would <i>love</i> to do some health care experiments, including going single-payer.  However, the state can&#x27;t do so without permission from the federal government to use Medicare funding in different ways (obviously there is no way a state could fund something like that itself without state-level tax increases that would never get past the electorate).  GOP-controlled Congress would never go for that, in part because they don&#x27;t want to be seen by their base as &quot;supporting socialism&quot;, and also in part (I&#x27;m conjecturing here) that they&#x27;re afraid that it&#x27;ll work and they&#x27;ll be proven wrong.<p>From the GOP&#x27;s perspective it more seems like &quot;states should experiment... as long as they&#x27;re experiments we agree with&quot;.')
