I wanted to preserve them<p>Here&#x27;s where I raise my hand and ask &quot;Why?&quot;<p>They&#x27;ve been sitting in a box for 15 years. You never watched them, you never even thought about them. Why preserve them?<p>It&#x27;s why I stopped taking pictures and videos of things. I never watched them again.
