For modern tools like Notion, Airtable, etc the filesystem is just a fallback option for piping data around when other more direct methods do not exist. Modern tools are database-driven, supporting multiple data types (images, text, tables, etc), different editing UIs for different content, multi-user support with comments, and instantaneous pointer updates when content is renamed&#x2F;deleted&#x2F;moved.<p>I&#x27;ve seen several products now including Obsidian that seem to take markdown support quite literally, centering themselves around .md files and markdown presentation (### Heading 3), rather than simply markdown keyboard shortcuts and ability to export as markdown. Markdown has its place but its primarily for easy diffing in text-only content like code editors, or a human readable option for backing up content. Tools like Obsidian are essentially lightly tweaked code editors, not modern project-based editors the whole company can use.')
