Before getting on CPAP life was pretty tough. It definitely exacerbated my ADHD at least 2x. So, I can understand that if you&#x27;re neurotypical and have sleep apnea it is going to be affecting your executive function such that you aren&#x27;t at 100%. The flip side is ADHDers are significantly more likely to be morbidly obese and have other health complications like sleep apnea as a result. At that point it&#x27;s a real downward spiral. Very glad I finally sought treatment for my apnea after kicking the can down the road for 4 whole years, which is very typical ADHD behavior in itself.<p>For real though CPAP is life changing if you need it and you get on it.')
