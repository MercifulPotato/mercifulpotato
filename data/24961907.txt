The AP can have holes punched for port forwarding to the cameras, some kind of dyndns solution could be used to give them a persistent name if the AP&#x27;s public network address is dynamic.  There are other solutions in this space as well...<p>My preference however is to not punch any holes and not bother with supporting external connections at this layer.  Instead I have the cameras establish and maintain ssh connections w&#x2F;reverse tunnels on an external server having a static IP on the internet.  Those reverse tunnels only listen on localhost ports at the server, requiring a locally executed process to reach the camera tunnels.  In the case of my server&#x27;s configuration, that basically requires logging into the server via ssh to reach the camera tunnels.  For an authorized user with ssh access to the server, it&#x27;s trivial to access the tunnels with a web browser by establishing a SOCKS proxy via ssh and configuring a web browser to use it.<p>I&#x27;ve ~reproduced this setup for some friends&#x2F;family members, using extremely cheap VPS instances strictly for terminating the ssh tunnels and providing a self-signed cert https proxy w&#x2F;basic auth to reach the camera tunnels more conveniently using a smartphone&#x27;s browser.  It seems to work fine for them once they get the self-signed cert permanently accepted in their phone&#x27;s browser, and is more convenient since they&#x27;re not IT people and won&#x27;t be running an ssh client anytime soon.  The main problem that&#x27;s come up is reconfiguring their cameras wifi when they upgrade their home network.  They forget about the cameras wifi dependency, and by the time they discover the problem it&#x27;s too late and we&#x27;re talking usb2serial GPIO console to reconfigure wpa_supplicant time.')
