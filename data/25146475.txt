Here are just a few very biased recommendations of interesting folks for your podcast:<p>There are a bunch of different cliches (community bio vs biohacking vs citizen bio vs grinders vs transhumanists are all VERY different), but I&#x27;d recommend checking out a few of the conferences. iGEM is going on right now which is super cool, and BioHTP and Biosummit are 2 I always recommend. Since you&#x27;re into fungi, there are a few cool folks in the DIYbio community you might want to talk to - Rolando Cruz Perez (in Endy Lab right now, off to do amazing fungi things soon! PhD on standardizing fungi growth conditions for distribution of strains) and Phil Ross (Mycoworks CTO, extremely eccentric, very artist, supremely interesting)<p>If you haven&#x27;t followed them, David Ishee on Facebook+Twitter and Sebastian Cocioba on Facebook are also real good to follow. I love David&#x27;s spirit+integrity of hacking and science, and Sebastian radiates an aurora of childlike wonder (specifically in plants) that is inspiring but calming. Might want to also give Josiah Zayner a follow, he is an interesting case of definitely knows-what-he-is-doing but still extremely controversial. He&#x27;s a generous and kind guy though, and it is extremely respectable what he does.<p>Gabriel Licinia is another interesting individual in the DIYbio community you might want to reach out to - him and Justin Atkin (the thought emporium on youtube) are some of the few folks who actually do things in the community. Real science and real cool. Gabe is the local angry man who&#x27;ll always tell ya if something is BS on the DIYbio facebook groups. Those 2 also work with Andreas Stuermer, who is a fantastic DNA designer. Those 3 are quite a superpower.<p>On the startup side, I&#x27;d recommend checking out Ryan Bethencourt&#x27;s stuff. He is a great guy, transitioned from diy-&gt;startup stuff, and often helps others do too. I personally like Elliot Roth&#x27;s company Spira and what they are doing with cyanobacteria and photosynthetic organisms. The future is cyanobacteria!<p>On the non-profit side, I really like what the BioBricks Foundation is doing and what the Open Bioeconomy Lab is doing.<p>Hope some of those things help! Glad your P.olymerase C.rap R.eaction worked - GMO yeast is easier IMO, just follow the culture timings and you&#x27;ll be fine. Also Sanger is terrible, and Nanopore is awesome. I&#x27;d be happy to talk with you too if you&#x27;d like - I&#x27;ve been around for a bit, and I love helping other people get started in these communities!<p>PS: on your website you say you want to &quot;Learn to navigate GenBank&quot;. Please be prepared to be disappointed.')
