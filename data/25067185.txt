The non upgradable ram capping out at 16gb is very disappointing though.<p>I&#x27;m hoping the rest of the PC market benefits from this increased market for ARM compatible desktop software. ARM has less of an issue with patent encumbrance and more competition. Desktop CPUs could get a <i>lot</i> cheaper in the future if ARM Windows and ARM Linux get more use as well as Mac.<p>(In case you didn&#x27;t know, you can run ARM Windows now (sort of unofficially, you&#x27;ll need to google)! App support is a bit spotty, but it can also run 32 bit x86 apps through a translation layer (why it&#x27;s limited to 32 bit I don&#x27;t know, I guess it&#x27;s easier to do?))<p>Edit: The Switch is ARM too, so there&#x27;s a reason for some AAA games to come to the otherwise small market too.(for traditionally Console&#x2F;PC games, I&#x27;m aware mobile gaming is a huge market, it&#x27;s just not one I find to produce much quality output)')
