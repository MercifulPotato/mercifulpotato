I&#x27;ve seen this attitude a lot, but these 4 words is the best summary I&#x27;ve seen. You basically said that unless we tip toe around your sensitivity and morning mood, we all can go to hell. That&#x27;s like going to a nightclub and demanding to put the volume down and to change music to something less tasteless, maybe Mozart or Bach, because otherwise you&#x27;d feel unwelcome in the club.')
