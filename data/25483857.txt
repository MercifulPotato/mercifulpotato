We got HP Elitebook notebooks at work a few years ago and replaced them with Lenovo and Dell because the HPs kept crashing and slowing down over time. Their &quot;utility&quot; software like HP Sure Click slowed the whole system down and turned into nagware. There were at least 3 HP programs hogging the tray area and made discovery of my actually wanted tray icons hard. On top of that the fans just didn&#x27;t spin down, even after a reinstall, so I were forced to work with constant fan noise in the background.<p>I never felt so miserable using a notebook before and dreaded each day I had to use it.')
