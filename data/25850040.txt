I&#x27;m going to ignore generation ships, because those seem a trifle unlikely (too complex, rather cruel to the inhabitants), but let&#x27;s imagine some embryo-laden carriers, freeze-dried aliens, and von Neumann probes.<p>Now, again, that&#x27;s still a long way for very little gain.  There&#x27;s nothing physical you could bring back to your civilization that would be &quot;worth&quot; the trip, but what about some <i>irrational</i> civilizations?  Religious zealots, or just a large enough portion of a technologically advanced society that says, &quot;Screw it, let&#x27;s hurl some madly self-replicating probes out into the spiral arm.&quot;  Ninety-nine percent of their civilization might think that is a terrible idea (or pick your proportion), but there only needs to be a few to pull it off.<p>Why are we not seeing the von Neumann probes?  I will admit that the other scenarios are less likely.  But where are they?  Even at a ten thousandth the speed of light they would have swarmed the galaxy, replicating down one spiral arm, into the core, and back out along the remaining arms.')
