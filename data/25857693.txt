I haven&#x27;t seen reports of quite that many in the last few decades. These are always males looking for mates. They are venomous but rarely bite and their venom is no more dangerous to people than a bee sting (i.e. it can be dangerous if you&#x27;re allergic). They make good pets although wild-caught ones don&#x27;t live long.')
