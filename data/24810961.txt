He was a mediocre comedian paid to tell low-info people how to think (and vote).<p>I’m also astonished at how liberals, with full financial support of the world’s wealthiest people (you could count notable exceptions on your hands), censorship authority over every digital and print media, control over education curricula, union bosses, the FBI, and more have the ability to believe that they’re victims of some right wing conspiracy. It’s not just wrong; it’s the opposite of the truth. The US is still distinguishable from North Korea, so clearly there must be skullduggery afoot! BIG OIL must have done this! It can’t possibly be that most regular people think my pseudo-religion is dumb.')
