Don’t use pre-made functions (such as Integrate, Simplify, Solve) right at the start, but manually work your way (via simple operations like expand, substitute, and your hand-written functions working on expression parts) to the point when expression is in form you would put it by hand.<p>Each step, substitution, transformation etc has to be stated explicitly in order to be understood by SymPy! That way if you are able to “explain” it to a computer (that has no intuition about objects that it’s working with, maybe beyond some basic algebra and fact that they are symbols) it will be much easier to explain and present it more clearly.<p>That said the obvious con of this method is learning SymPy, but believe me it will pay back both by understanding math more deeply, as well as in ability to solve problems that are too large&#x2F;tedious to do by hand in the future.<p>Btw I believe this is basically the way the applied math (computational, non-proof part of math) should be presented nowadays. When I (hopefully) finish writing my phd thesis I hope to to write CAS dedicated to this purpose (doing math in by-hand like way, but with help form computer) from scratch. Until then SymPy is IMO your best bet for that ;)')
