Item(by='ojnabieoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603272659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843757, text='The fact that <i>you</i> are blatantly a white supremacist means that your entire first paragraph is dripping in pure bad faith. You are also attacking your own strawman by the way, &quot;growing white supremacy&quot; was your quote! Not something from a journalist. White supremacy has clearly been crowing over the past decade, with increasing membership and activity among white supremacist terrorist groups (in the US) and political parties (in the EU). I guess you can say that it &quot;declined&quot; over the past century, but that&#x27;s a useless point of view when considering the Christchurch terrorist attack.<p>&gt; The former is consensus among researchers in the field.<p>No it isn&#x27;t. The &quot;consensus among researchers in the field&quot; is that black Americans tend to score more poorly on IQ tests than white Americans. It does not mean black people are actually &quot;dumber&quot; since IQ is not conclusively related to &quot;intelligence&quot; - we don&#x27;t even know what intelligence is! We also know that you can raise your IQ considerably by practicing IQ tests, that psychological pressures have immense impact on IQ scores, that education increases your IQ score, that being adopted into a richer family can increase your IQ score, and so on. Hence the IQ tests are flawed circumstantial evidence, where the testee&#x27;s &quot;inherent&quot; and &quot;biological&quot; intelligence is hopelessly entangled with psychological and economic factors that obviously have nothing to do with the individual.<p>This is like the phrenology arguments of old: it might have been the consensus among researchers in the field that Africans had less cranial CC than Europeans. But there was no evidence that this had anything to do with brainpower, and racists like yourself have always played fast-and-loose with &quot;real fact&quot; versus &quot;evidence-free assertion&quot; to make your point. Now that it&#x27;s been demonstrated that the 19th century phrenologists were wrong about African&#x2F;European head size differences, you rarely see people pushing phrenological arguments and they sound self-evidently ridiculous.')
