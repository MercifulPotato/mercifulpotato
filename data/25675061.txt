And when things finally boiled over, instead of condemning the rioters he only tried to walk them back to just before the breaking point.  That is obviously unacceptable conduct for a president and I think Facebook has correctly assessed the situation when they say his posts&#x27; &quot;effect -- and likely their intent -- would be to provoke further violence&quot;.<p><i>However...</i> it&#x27;s also important to note that assessment was made in hindsight.  Facebook did not block his account or remove his posts until the riots had already run their course.  I suspect that is because Trumps posts (at least the ones I&#x27;ve seen) never directly called for violence - even if that was his intent.  What Trump said yesterday was not inconsistent with what he has been saying ever since he lost the election.  In context yesterday was different, but that context was never considered until well after events had already unfolded.<p>So what&#x27;s the precedent here?  Would Trump&#x27;s posts still be a block-able offense if the riots never happened?  What if the context were different and he made the same posts on just another normal Wednesday?  Does intent play into it?  I believe Trump had bad intent here, but how do you prove that?<p>Ultimately, I have to ask all these questions because I don&#x27;t trust Facebook.  Their business model is based on establishing and re-enforcing echo chambers to maximize engagement and ad revenue.  Those echo chambers have become factories for misinformation and social unrest.  Facebook&#x27;s response is to establish vague and inconsistent policies regarding appropriate content as they scramble to de-platform the echo chambers they consider to be problematic.<p>Praising Facebook here feels to me like praising BP for their efforts to clean up the 2010 oil spill.  Except BP&#x27;s oil spill and subsequent cleanup efforts didn&#x27;t threaten to underpin democracy and plunge the nation into a prolonged period of violence.')
