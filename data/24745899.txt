We may not agree politically, but being rightwing doesn&#x27;t make you a terrorist or even a terrible human being. There is very clearly a separation between far-right and right in the same way there is a separation between far-left  and left. Disagreeing on the position of abortion for example doesn&#x27;t mean either of our lives are immediately at danger. This sort of conflation is dangerous.<p>Regarding Facebook hosting only far-right terrorism and organization, this simply isn&#x27;t true. It also hosts far-left terrorism. As much as Antifa claim to have no structure, there is clearly some form of hierarchy in the sub-groups - if there was none then how do they all turn up to the same place at the same time?<p>Facebook doesn&#x27;t have a far-right problem, it has a radicalization problem. The moment you are able to create bubbles and select who to include in them, you can&#x27;t even rely on the report functionality anymore.<p>_Any_ service that offers comments can be used for nefarious purposes. I distinctly remember pedophiles commenting timestamps in Youtube comments to indicate the &quot;good&quot; parts in the videos featuring young children. Hell, Club Penguin was used for terrorist planning in the film Four Lions. I know for a fact that Discord has a _massive_ pedophile problem.<p>What it really comes down to is this: How do you moderate content when the amount of content is so large? You have some attempts to do this via AI, but one common problem with almost every automated system is that they over-train for things like key-words. Machine learning is well known to be too data focused rather than abstraction focused. Until we have generalized AI, I am not sure there is a solution.')
