There <i>should</i> be a standard text layout library with pluggable back-ends, but there isn&#x27;t. If you go to the #text stream on xi.zulipchat.com, there&#x27;s a lot of discussion under the &quot;Skribo: lifting the curse&quot; topic and a couple others.<p>It&#x27;s definitely possible to build something yourself using Allsorts and other pieces, but making it all work well is a highly nontrivial task. Part of the problem is that there are a bunch of projects out there, each with their own subset of requirements, rather than one good one.<p>I&#x27;d like to mentor work to make this situation better, but it&#x27;s too much for me to take on single-handedly.<p>I&#x27;m also hoping that WebGPU catches on, and we&#x27;ll be able to run piet-gpu on it (through wasm). That would, I think, be compelling for a lot of interesting use cases.')
