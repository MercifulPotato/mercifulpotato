We have the utmost confidence in the outcome of this investigation &#x2F; audit.”<p>How many times do you want them to recount Georgia?  Read the transcript of Trump&#x27;s call with Raffensperger—they investigated all of these rumors, and they turned out to be nonsense.<p>And the simple answer to your question is, because nobody believes that a &quot;full investigation&quot; would ensure anybody&#x27;s faith in the election.  Accusations of fraud started the night of the election, they&#x27;re not based on evidence.  And so no amount of investigating will ever be enough.  Or as Jonathan Swift put it: &quot;It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into.&quot;')
