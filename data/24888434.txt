It was effective at that goal. And Iran <i>with</i> nuclear weapons would make regime change in the future even harder.<p>International politics with these kind of countries are tricky business; personally I&#x27;d love nothing more than see Iran become a better place, but you can&#x27;t just force things like this. We tried in Afghanistan and Iraq, and that didn&#x27;t turn out so well. People are still trying in Syria and we can&#x27;t exactly call this a great success either.<p>So ... your best bet is to deal with these kind of regimes the best you can, by applying pressure in one area and making a deal in another. I think few people are especially happy with this, but it&#x27;s the best option out of a bad bunch.')
