For web browsing, Big Sur&#x27;s Safari finally works well (it&#x27;s the first time I managed to do a switch from Chrome, after multiple tries).<p>Time Machine backup is also awesome - I couldn&#x27;t find anything working just as well for other OSs.<p>There are also some neat system-wide tricks you may like:<p>- you can set up a hot-corner in preferences to show the desktop. I have mine in bottom-right, that way if I want to move sth in and out of desktop, I grab it, do the hot-corner, and drop.<p>- most file-editing apps have an icon next to a file-name in the window bar. you can drag&amp;drop that icon to copy file etc. if you command-click the icon, the whole path to the file get revealed<p>- you can drag &amp; drop files to every open file dialog in the system. super-handy<p>- home&#x2F;end&#x2F;pgup&#x2F;pgdown keys are missing on the keyboard, but Emacs shortcuts work throught the whole system, e.g. Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E = home&#x2F;end in every text dialog<p>- command+option+shift+v = paste without style, if you want to paste something into a wysiwyg text editor as a plain text<p>- command+shift+4 - screenshot of a part of the screen. also can serve as a pixel ruler, since it shows how many pixels you are grabbing<p>- Cmd+Up&#x2F;Cmd+Down - navigate within the filesystem<p>In general, for me as a dev - the best thing about MacOS is how much of the stuff is built-in, and a ton of system features that are consistent through all the apps. That, and a linux-style console&#x2F;filesystem :)')
