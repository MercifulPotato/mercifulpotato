Of course more people are infected when you allow more people to be infected.<p>Sadly it is not nonsense to state the fact that Sweden&#x27;s approach caused more deaths than what would otherwise have happened. The reason is quite simple: some people somehow believe the opposite. There&#x27;s a crackpot section of society that somehow and unexplainedly believe that lockdowns and wearing masks and any change to their personal routine causes more harm than a disease that already killed over a million patients.<p>Then there are the inconvenient facts that:<p>a) patients do get reinfected,<p>b) allowing an epidemic to run wild creates conditions for it to mutate and change in unpredictable ways, including becoming more deadly and damaging than what it is right now.')
