Just stick a machine out doors with a solar panel on the top, and come by once a month to empty the bin and refill the food.<p>You&#x27;d need to make sure the exchange rate (food per trash) is set based on the weight of the trash in order to avoid incentivizing the birds from tearing trash into smaller pieces for more food. And you might need some decent machine vision to reject non trash. Seems eminently solveable though.')
