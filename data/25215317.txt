It took the dutch authority 18 months for them to decide they couldn&#x27;t be bothered to make GitHub provide my data. GitHub also lied and claimed my repositories weren&#x27;t personal data even tho my name and email are all over them. Also if you talk to your agency you can&#x27;t actually appeal the decision because your agency didn&#x27;t decide anything, they have to follow it on to the agency that is responsible for that country based on which country the company is based in.')
