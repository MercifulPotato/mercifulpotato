Medical ethics relate to individual patients, so even if you have a coherent public health strategy that makes sense (and a placebo to spread supplies more thinly could be such a strategy), the medics insist on applying ethics to individual patients.<p>For example the early data for HPV vaccination was enough that as public health policy it made sense to immunise boys. The men would not spread HPV and thus contribute to reduced cancer in any future female partners. But that would be unethical because it&#x27;s no direct benefit to the boys you&#x27;re vaccinating. So they waited until they had data showing it would likely also prevent some cancer in men, bingo now it&#x27;s both ethical and good policy.')
