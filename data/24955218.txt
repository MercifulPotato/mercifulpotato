There are people alive today who were born in a world in which we thought there was only one galaxy, but they also thought there were only 8 planets at the time.  Hubble proved there were other galaxies a few years before Pluto was discovered.  You would have to go back to the 1850s to find anyone who thought there were more than 8 planets and only one galaxy.  Back then dwarf planets and large asteroids were all categorized as planets which put us at over 20 planets before there was a reclassification.')
