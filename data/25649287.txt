My family is in China. They&#x27;ve been through SARS. They started wearing masks themselves the day the heard about this new respiratory disease. And you know how CDC insisted that masks are not needed at the beginning. Things got out of control because of this IMHO.<p>From the article,\n&gt; more aggressive and systematic quarantine regime whereby suspected or mild cases — and even healthy close contacts of confirmed cases — were sent to makeshift hospitals and temporary quarantine centers.<p>The thing that really worked was not centralized quarantine.  It&#x27;s how to identify people for centralized quarantine. My family has gone back to normal life (like pre-covid normal) since March. Since then every new coronavirus case will be on the headline, and deep contact tracing (not only close contacts, but close contacts of close contacts of close contacts of ...) will be performed to ensure suspected infections are quarantined.<p>People coming from another country are required to provide extensive documentation of negative test results in the past three weeks. The tests need to be conducted in very specific time frames and even locations, and often between two flight connections. The rules are deliberately designed to make people stop thinking about coming to China. Sadly I&#x27;m in the US and I don&#x27;t expect to reunite with my family until mid 2022.')
