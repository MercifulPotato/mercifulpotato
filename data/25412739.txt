The parent of your comment pointed out how it might not be because external sexism poses challenges to female founders which makes them riskier than their male counterparts. I agree that one can (even should) invest for reasons other than strictly profit maximization, but if one invests for profit maximization (as was discussed by comment chain op) then sexism in the broader market definitely has an effect that cannot be discounted.')
