I think its biggest political flaw is probably the fact that it would apply July 1, 2022, with no phase-in for small businesses whose lease passes through the property tax. So hopefully in November 2022 another attempt can be made that addresses the political shortcomings.<p>Proposition 19 (which eliminated tax breaks for inherited investment property in exchange for increased tax portability for the elderly) only <i>barely</i> passed 51%-49%, and that was after it received overwhelming support from the legislature, and a $45 million advertising campaign from the California Association of Realtors that some people criticized for only highlighting the goodies for old people and not the costs for inheritors.<p>No one is attempting a full repeal of Proposition 13 including residential property.<p>It could also be attacked judicially; see this episode of the Henry George Program for a discussion of Nordlinger v Hahn and whether different legal arguments could be tried (e.g. does Proposition 13 impinge on the American freedom to migrate under the US Constitution?) <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;seethecat.org&#x2F;ep&#x2F;2017-07-11.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;seethecat.org&#x2F;ep&#x2F;2017-07-11.html</a>')
