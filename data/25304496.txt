The company can claim you were unproductive and probably has an easier time proving this that you have proving otherwise.<p>Most companies try to extract the most value from their employees and this may mean overloading them and they use &quot;industry benchmarks&quot; to set the bar for what you&#x27;re expected to deliver. Those are very debatable but effective in supporting their point.<p>Then in the bulk of the push comes from incentivizing people to do overtime by offering promotions, bonuses, good projects only to those who go above and beyond. Refusing overtime may not only be received with a lack of incentives but with concrete disincentives like getting the really nasty activities and treatment. If you&#x27;re building a career, want the position, or want&#x2F;need the higher pay, you&#x27;ll do it. Depends on the company, the job, the person.')
