I switched away from Fedora because it seemed to break more than my Arch installation. There are a lot of things they are doing that no other distros are doing right now. Cgroups v2, for instance.<p>The benefit of Fedora was that they handled a lot of things that were a pain to configure. The biggest culprit being fonts. But now that TrueType patents have expired, and it&#x27;s included in Arch automatically it&#x27;s one less reason to use Fedora.')
