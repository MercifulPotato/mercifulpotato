But the people filing these challenges were not unhinged randos from Twitter. They were elected officials, lawyers, educated people. They aren&#x27;t going to go into court with something they <i>know</i> is frivolous.<p>Given that a sizable minority (and likely unprecedented number) of the voting public thinks there was fraud in the 2020 election, maybe it would have been better to have rebutted the evidence rather than the process.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;today.yougov.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;politics&#x2F;articles-reports&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;america-speaks-do-they-think-fraud-occurred-2020-p" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;today.yougov.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;politics&#x2F;articles-reports&#x2F;20...</a>')
