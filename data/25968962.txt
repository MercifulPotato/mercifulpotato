I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re not alone in this, so the entirety of the answers there could be restored from mirrors or just used from the mirrors if the main site disappeared.<p>Nearly all of the information there is also available in the public documentation of whatever the question asker is asking about anyway. Forcing developers to use real documentation instead of Stack Overflow would not likely hurt everyday work. It might become harder to find literal worked examples, but even those are mostly duplicated elsewhere and SO is just making it easier on search engines to find it.')
