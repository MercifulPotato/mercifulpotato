Item(by='andrewaylett', descendants=None, kids=[25101047, 25101056, 25100956], score=None, time=1605446186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099615, text='Since lockdown started, we&#x27;ve gradually converted most of our house to Hue.  A key feature is that _all the light switches still work_.  We just don&#x27;t use them all that much, unless something&#x27;s failed.<p>From reading Matthew Garrett&#x27;s exploits, I&#x27;m pretty sure we don&#x27;t want WiFi IoT devices.  We have Hue switches next to the physical switches, which don&#x27;t depend on WiFi being up; Smart control works with only local networking.  Add more smartness for extra control (SmartThings, remote access, Google Assistant), but it&#x27;s no less functional than a non-smart system when the smarts are offline.<p>The killer feature for me is the ability to adjust the colour temperature and brightness of lights in each room -- I&#x27;ve got a 50W panel above my desk which makes my work-space brighter than it is outside at the moment (Edinburgh, UK, 1pm with rain) but automatically fades down to a warm, dim light as the evening progresses.')
