I&#x27;d guess 1-2 <i>in the gym</i> plus another few hours at least actually practicing soccer. Even something that&#x27;s fairly brutal like American football involves an hour or two per day in the gym, plus practice. Professional athletes figure out how to practice as much as possible in a way that doesn&#x27;t lead to long-term injury and &quot;as much as possible&quot; is almost always way more than a couple hours per day.')
