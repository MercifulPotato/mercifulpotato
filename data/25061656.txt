It&#x27;s a common trope, but also a pretty tired one.<p>We have a pretty long history of plague, famine, war, and other &quot;apocalyptic&quot; scenarios, and in almost all accounts, people tend to help each other, and most would die of hunger rather than steal from an innocent person.<p>The main problem is that what we are very good at is building narratives that portray some class of &quot;others&quot; as not-so-innocent, and therefore, deserving all the pillage, rape, and murder we can muster.
