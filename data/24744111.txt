A trillion dollars buys a lot of experimental 5nm masks, and their walled garden enables them to completely rewrite their entire OS and toolchain... something they&#x27;ve already done twice in the last 20 years for desktop, and a few times for mobile.<p>Will 3rd parties like adobe or digidesign get on board?
