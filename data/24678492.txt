It actively spread misinformation and hate and made the website worse for other users.<p>And a question for you: You say that Reddit is not in favor of free speech because it banned subs like t_D, but t_D and similar subs were banned anyone who questioned the narrative that was being pushed by those subreddits&#x27; moderators. So is it not fair to say that t_D (and similar subs) were <i>very clearly</i> not in favor of free speech either?')
