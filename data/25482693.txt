It&#x27;s really hard to witness considering how much I worry about her everyday she&#x27;s on service.<p>My understanding is the training is capped at 80 hours&#x2F;week, but they average that over the month. They definitely work more than that some weeks, but it&#x27;s usually because it&#x27;s not scheduled hours; it&#x27;s shifts that run long because of emergencies or codes or whatever. When she was a resident and had to write patient notes, that definitely took extra hours each night after her shifts. It&#x27;s brutal.<p>And for what it&#x27;s worth, not all doctors make great money after training. In pediatrics, salaries are generally half what adult doctors make. For a lot of subspecialties, that&#x27;s on par with average software engineering salaries, even after about 14 years of education and training.')
