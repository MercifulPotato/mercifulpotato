But speaking as somebody who has spent years as a contractor, I don&#x27;t think Uber&#x27;s drivers are &quot;incredibly well-suited to being contractors&quot;.<p>For me, the essence of a good contractor relationship is a balance of power. It went best for me when I had multiple warm clients, giving me the ability to tell any one of them &quot;no&quot;. This meant that they&#x27;d listen to me and bargain fairly. And if they didn&#x27;t, well, I could walk and I&#x27;d be fine, especially since I was careful to keep a significant financial cushion.<p>Uber drivers face a tremendous power imbalance, and that was always the goal. Kalanick was aiming for a monopoly. He didn&#x27;t quite get there, but given that they have 70% of the rideshare market and Lyft has the other 30%, it&#x27;s close enough. With that sort of market failure, and given the eagerness of VCs to buy future market failure, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d want to be a contractor in that market.')
