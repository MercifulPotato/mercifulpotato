For instance, to be able to tell at compile time if a matrix multiplication is going to crash due to dimension mismatch.<p>So far, in Python at least, at best I can tell that it&#x27;s a float array, without specifying the dimension (for example 2d for a matrix) or better, specifying its dimension is (n,p) where n and p are both type variables.')
