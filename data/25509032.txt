For example when Rand Paul claimed he had immunity after recovering from Covid, liberals I&#x27;m in casual contact with were jumping up and down screaming &quot;he&#x27;s not immune! he&#x27;s not immune!&quot; Of the maybe 10 people I know of who&#x27;ve had Covid and recovered, 2 are still actively worried and living in terror that they will get it again.')
