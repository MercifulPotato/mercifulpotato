It had a somewhat obtuse onboarding process so I just copied one of their tutorial applications thinking that would be and easy way to get some data flowing through the tool.<p>Running on Amazon Linux it took nearly two hours for me to descend into the pits of ruby&#x2F;rvm&#x2F;node&#x2F;puppeteer&#x2F;headless chrome to get the damn thing ‘working’.  Broken builds, missing tools, wrong major releases, segfaults, path issues, byzantine environment variable dependencies.  I felt like Hal fixing the light bulb and I still have no idea what actually is going on when I run the tests. I just get the API requests I need and the rest feels like a black box in the form of nested Klein bottles.<p>I was really feeling my BOFH oats by the end of it and dismissing everyone that deals with that mess every day as a flock of sadists.  I’ve since calmed down and realized that it’s probably not that bad if it actually is your day job.  I just know that if I depended on that heap to actually do anything more than run some unit tests I would have years of acclimation in front of me.')
