You couldn&#x27;t have chat flowing through a paid provider&#x27;s data center, and it&#x27;s unlikely either would open up a paid option to their chat APIs unless it were mandated under some type of consumer laws.<p>In the examples in the post, I have to pump my normal web connections through the VM&#x2F;IP of the machine that&#x27;s doing the bridging. Maybe a provider could use a proxy you install on your local machine, but many people these days have laptops they don&#x27;t keep on full time. You&#x27;d have to install the proxy on a Pi and then you&#x27;ve reduced your audience for such a commercial offering quite a bit, to people who know how to do this but don&#x27;t want to put in the effort to setup the services themselves.')
