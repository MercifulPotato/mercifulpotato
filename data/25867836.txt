The only reason there are people siding with ELK here is because the other side is the eminently unlikable Amazon. It also never worked very well.<p>Yes, you can sustain a company with it, and even make it large. But it&#x27;s limited in size and any idea that you can get VC money on a large evaluation and things will go smooth is ridiculous. The model also has a limited lifetime, after what you&#x27;ll see your business slow down or you&#x27;ll have to fight against your customers. It certainly can last enough to make people rich, but it&#x27;s not sustainable, unless you diversify your software. None of that is caused by cloud providers.')
