Item(by='mnjn', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1605123542, title='Show HN: Disco, a platform for independent artists to reach more fans', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Just launched the MVP of my startup today after two weeks of non-stop work.<p>Right now, Disco is an artist discovery platform where artists can submit their Spotify tracks for users to listen to through a Tinder-like UI, swiping right on the ones they like.<p>The vision is far grander, of course, and involves fostering greater artist &lt;-&gt; fan connection while also providing a sustainable source of revenue for artists.<p>The music industry in its current state is too impersonal and not sustainable for all but the biggest artists. The solution to both problems is artist &lt;-&gt; fan connection&#x2F;engagement, where an artist&#x27;s fans can interact directly with the artist and actually connect with them rather than cheer them on from far away. I believe loyal fans will be willing to financially support their favorite artists in exchange for that level of connection.<p>Disco is aiming to build the platform to enable that. I focused the MVP on discovery in order to focus on artists who are just starting their career. I&#x27;m excited to conduct lots of interviews to really understand the problems they face.<p>More info on the future of Disco is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.disco.so<p>The actual app is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;disco.so<p>As always, I am open to any and all feedback :)')
