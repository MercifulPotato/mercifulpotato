So, what happens if there are several people included and some or many of them each have their own preferred pronoun. I have to thread very carefully in every part of my Email not to step on someone&#x27;s toes. I mean I&#x27;m looking at this table [0] here and I imagine I have to make a look up table for everyone that uses a pronoun should I write stuff to several parties.<p>Is this really practical? Are there any better solutions?<p>0 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uwm.edu&#x2F;lgbtrc&#x2F;support&#x2F;gender-pronouns" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uwm.edu&#x2F;lgbtrc&#x2F;support&#x2F;gender-pronouns</a>')
