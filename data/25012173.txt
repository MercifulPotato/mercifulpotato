It was before deregulation brought airline fares down. The buses were reasonably clean, not that smelly unless you sat way back by the restroom. I wouldn&#x27;t care to do it today--the 20-year-old back can tolerate what the 60-year-old back can&#x27;t, or anyway would rather not.<p>But it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I would stand at the end of the line for a bus. The worst outcome was sitting next to the person nobody else wished to sit next to. The best and more common outcome was that the bus would have filled up before I boarded, and Greyhound would bring out another bus--I could ride in a nearly-empty bus.')
