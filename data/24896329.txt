I had one who showed up at 7am to get a test, lineups were around several blocks and they shut the whole thing down because people were getting rude. He then had to wait a bit and drive to Guelph. People were driving out from Toronto to London, Woodstock, etc. to get tests.<p>In our industry if we provisioned data centres or server instances like this, we&#x27;d be in a bit of trouble, no?<p>EDIT: FWIW I have a political leaning and bias towards a strong public sector and am a big believer in public service. I&#x27;m not one of those &quot;government can&#x27;t do anything right&quot; and &quot;less government is better&quot; types.  But I do think that several decades of &quot;government can&#x27;t do anything right&quot; people being a dominant cultural and political force now means that government can no longer do anything right. We&#x27;re losing our ability to act collectively :-(')
