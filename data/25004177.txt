An audit by definition happens after the results are reported. It is a process meant to double-check that the original process, which you describe above, gave an accurate result.<p>If you stake everything you have on the original process being incorruptible, then your only response to an audit that shows a discrepancy must be &quot;the audit is wrong&quot;. That&#x27;s unlikely to satisfy many people; if that is your only strategy for dealing with audits, you are running an inauditable process.')
