You can install software in less than a minute, and keep things updated pretty easily.<p>Linux is not the frequent target of malware, specifically ransomware. There will be always that one non-compliant person in an org that clicks every link and believes in every email and having that person use Windows is a bad idea.<p>Office suites used to suck on Linux... not anymore. SoftMaker Office is on par with Microsoft Office for the most essential use cases.<p>Gaming is getting better on Linux with many native games, as well as Wine, Proton and DXVK... Many games run pretty well on Linux, you can check ProtonDB for details. Perhaps not every game or the newest games, but you can have a decent gaming experience on Linux.<p>And for development, Linux is king. Everything is observable, everything can be measured, most things have debugging symbols and source code. On Windows, get used to read assembly code and become a reverse engineer if you want to understand what&#x27;s going on.')
