However, if I had to actually take a bullet, I&#x27;d prefer it to be from an assault rifle any day of the week.<p>Assault rifles generally fire either 5.56x45 or 7.62x39 - intermediate rounds than are unlawful for use in hunting most game because they are unlikely to kill the animal, at least quickly.<p>Hunting rifles are going to (except for varmint hunting) generally use much bigger, much more powerful rounds such as the .308 Winchester. It is much more likely to kill you (and <i>much, much</i> more likely to blow off an extremity if hit there) than an intermediate cartridge fired from an assault rifle.')
