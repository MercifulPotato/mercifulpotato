The main proposition &quot;Everyone is a racist, whether you know it or not&quot;, is an overstatement. There is no way you can tell &quot;everyone&quot; is a &quot;racist&quot;, is just an aphorism with multiple interpretations. This has become the tool of identity politics and group thinking, throw and aphorism and let people fight over it. Unfortunate.')
