For example no physicist pretends that any of the models of reality (newtonian physics, relativistic, quantum mechanics, ...) not even the latest models (say the standard model) are the Truth with a capital T. The absolutist picture of the comment you respond rely on the simplification that a model is either true or false (which is of course correct) but ignores the incredible success of abductive reasoning: the prior models can effectively correspond to the superceding models in the regimes that were explored previously while specifically disagree in a regime more recently explored or made accessible experimentally. This does typically correspond with errors &#x2F; falsehoods in the prior model but they are typically concentrated in llmited prior false postulates that needed replacing.<p>It also ignores the power of multimodal measurements where the same or other factors are measured with independent means.<p>One of the most powerful assumptions is simply assuming no time travel is involved: my favorite example is post partum syndrome &#x2F; suicides. If one creates a plot with a horizontal axis of relative time bins and a vertical axis of event counts then let the relative time of 0 represent time of giving birth, and for each mother that commits suicide as a function of say weeks since birth you increment the corresponding bin. Integrated over maternal suicides we observe that there is a background suicide rate (due to other reasons) and a childbirth related peak that falls off over time. This means that <i>something(s)</i> related to the time of childbirth is traumatizing. Obviously a maternal suicide does not cause childbirth a few weeks prior (assuming causation can not occur in reverse order), so while causation is hard to prove, it can be feasible to exclude hypothetical causation pathways. This still leaves the possibility of a prior event causing both: say the day of getting pregnant but this does not explain the maternal suicides of mothers that had shorter or longer duration pregnancies! The peak is more <i>concentrated</i> with respect to days since childbirth compared a <i>broader</i> smeared peak when  plotted with respect to days since fertilization. The fact one can blind oneself of timing information, obviously frustrating cauation analysis, should not be construed as an impossibility proof to gradually tease out and map causation pathways.<p>One of the characteristics of post partum trauma is &quot;hallucinatory conceptions&quot; etcetera. I find it very suspicious that I never find a paper documenting these prolonged &quot;figments of imagination&quot; into classes, with examples on each. Except for the rarely abused class of deliriates the other drugs (LSD, THC, ...) don&#x27;t cause prolonged concrete hallucinations. Hence I do not believe any endogenous hormonal imbalance is causing these &quot;strange ideas&quot; of a fraction of the women that recently gave child birth. Such a trait would obviously be selected against and disappear. More likely is that a fraction of them experience one or more common types of trauma during child birth. This could be many things: cutting the genitalia, caesarian section, ... but I believe one of the main factors is the female orgasm during childbirth, the contractions to squeeze the baby out of the vagina. If a person is unaware of this fact and then becomes aware during child birth, this feels like lack of consent and thus rape (with obvious suicide statistics of its own), betrayal, the discovery of prior taboo and censorship, and incomprehension why the information doesn&#x27;t flow back to the medical (and school) system in order to adapt and better prepare future mothers of this natural function of the female orgasm. Instead they get assigned a shrink who shrugs off their frustration as &quot;figments of their imagination&quot;, and openly document it as such in the literature. And then we collectively act surprised when some of them commit suicide? How many children must lose their mother, how many fathers must lose their wife, how family members must lose a relative, ... before we realize that this is too high a cost for the implicitly supposed &quot;benefit&quot; of &quot;in sanity we trust&quot;?<p>The original comment does have its merit in cautioning against causation analysis without any timing information whatsoever (sadly one of the most common analysis techniques), like correlatings between classes of people (smoker &#x2F; non smoker) X (healthy &#x2F; cancer).<p>But I think it would be more constructive for these run of the mill &quot;correlation is not causation&quot; rants to point out the value of multimodal measurement: for example measuring tar in your example, or measuring timing information as in the example I gave.')
