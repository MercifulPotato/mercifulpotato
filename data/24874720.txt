I&#x27;m fine with the company I work for taking public political stances that help its business. I&#x27;m not fine with being expected to personally take those stances as part of my job.<p>If a company expects its employees to take particular political stances, think about how this affects people&#x27;s ability to work for this company. You might think of your political stances as a personal choice, but a lot of people come from families and communities with overwhelming political leanings that they can&#x27;t really change. Maybe your family is Catholic or evangelical or atheist, or some of your family members live in a country that one candidate supports more, or your community is hugely affected by offshoring or drug laws. You would alienate a lot of your friends and family if you support the other candidate at your employer&#x27;s urging.<p>I think there are several reasons why it&#x27;s bad to put employees in this situation, but one I find compelling is that it reduces the available employee pool; it&#x27;s bad for hiring and hence business. Maybe this is on purpose, to filter the employees to ones who are more aligned politically, to make management&#x27;s lives easier in some way. I don&#x27;t know. I do know that as a non-partisan, when my employer endorses any political stance, I feel alienated. I&#x27;m sure this leads to a loss in productivity and more attrition among employees like me.')
