AWS recommends you use DynamoDB instead of SimpleDB for new applications.<p>However, I wouldn&#x27;t call SimpleDB abandoned. SimpleDB continues to work as it has for may years.<p>One thing that AWS is amazingly good at is not breaking existing customers and their applications. Did you build an application 10 years ago based on SimpleDB? All the APIs you used 10 years ago are still there and available to your application today. Its really quite amazing how dedicated AWS is to not breaking existing customers.')
