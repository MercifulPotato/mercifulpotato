It also has the downside of being a common term (abbrevation of precomposition) in image&#x2F;video editing.<p>Also, for other stream types like JPG and MP3, even &quot;-cn&quot; directly compresses the data without being able to see the intermediate decompressed representation, so in these cases Precomp (re)compresses.<p>But well, it&#x27;s just a name and I decided to stick with it, changing it several times would&#x27;ve lead to confusion, too.')
