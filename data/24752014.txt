Its type system is much more complex, sure; idiomatic ats proves many interesting programming attributes that rust doesn&#x27;t.  But if you write ats in the same style as rust, the only additional complexity you&#x27;ll notice is you have to manually drop.<p>&gt; you would solve the halting problem, among other impossible feats<p>...what?<p>I don&#x27;t see what the halting problem has to do it.  Safe rust programs aren&#x27;t required to halt; nontermination is safe, even if not necessarily desirable (like memory leakage, which is also allowed for the same reason).<p>1. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ats-lang.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ats-lang.org&#x2F;</a>')
