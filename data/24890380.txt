You picked from a small collection of available parts which met your cost and design goals, and you put up with whatever horrific software tools supported the platform.  This was my experience as an EE grad doing embedded SW work in the late 90s.  Embedded back then didn&#x27;t get anywhere near the attention that desktop processors received.  Toolchains, debuggers, emulators, library support... all poor.  Expectations were low and remained low.  They could be, because most embedded stuff was handled by EE folks who didn&#x27;t know any better and often weren&#x27;t interested in the potential overhead of any &#x27;better&#x27; ways.  Embedded margins were always typically tight, so there really wasn&#x27;t a bunch of money sloshing around to fund improvements.  You&#x27;re talking about an industry where fractional cent savings mattered.')
