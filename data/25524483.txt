Signal is as centralized as Telegram and moxie has already stated that he does not care about open or federated systems because of the usability trade-off required.<p>My argument is that the inferior usability is not an intrinsic issue  of federated systems, just circunstancial. Being closed&#x2F;centralized on the other hand, is an intrinsic property of all major platforms, and any of these major platforms will screw its users whenever they have enough lock-in.<p>So, I am not saying simply that open is good and closed is bad. What I am saying is that open should be preferred and promoted.<p>And no, people working on open systems should not just sit on their asses and say &quot;you have no other choice, so you will have to take whatever we do&quot;. People working on Matrix already have quite a lot of work cut out for them and I am painfully aware of the points were it can improve. The thing is I am also aware of how much improvement <i>has happened already</i>, while there is <i>absolutely zero</i> proprietary platform that opened up itself for public benefit.')
