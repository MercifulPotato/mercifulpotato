SW dev has never been a seller&#x27;s market in the way that eg the property market or job market can be a seller&#x27;s or buyer&#x27;s market. There are powerful effects in the market making that a massive simplification. Firstly platform network effects; think of the browser wars for instance. Secondly, open source: a lot can be had for &quot;free&quot;. Thirdly, lowest bidder: John Glenn famously commented, when asked what he thought about sat on top of an Apollo rocket, &quot;every component has been built by the lowest bidder&quot;. Fourthly, novelty: a significant amount of SW dev is about building things that haven&#x27;t been built before. Which can be more like a research project than eg putting up a new apartment block, or bridge, or designing and productionising a new car.')
