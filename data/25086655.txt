These &quot;written systems&quot; are also fascinating to watch, with so many pieces of paper being &quot;slid&quot; down the kitchen, ensuring that everyone&#x27;s orders were being done correctly.<p>But many restaurants, like the one in this post, do everything by memory. So that&#x27;s much harder for me to see what&#x27;s going on, because all of the thoughts of the workers are internalized. So you really need someone to explain the thought process out in words to understand what they&#x27;re doing.<p>I&#x27;m happy that somebody with experience finally typed it all up. These little things are the stuff I&#x27;d like to learn, even though I never really want to have that job.<p>Next in line for things to learn: grocery store logistics. I&#x27;ve watched people loading milk up at the store and &#x2F; or eggs, and ensuring that all items are sold (and pushing the older sell-by dates in front of other jugs) is a thing that they&#x27;ve definitely been keeping track of. But I&#x27;m also fascinated by those logistics. There&#x27;s clearly a bunch of little &quot;elves&quot; who are behind the scenes, making sure everything runs smoothly here.')
