If the OS image is jumping several versions (or actually being downgraded from a security patch release), here be dragons. Typically the USB installer pulls down another installer via Wi-Fi and then has to perform a random &quot;this disk needs an upgrade&quot; routine which 50% of the time results in bad thing happening and I&#x27;d be left with the flashing question mark. Then its time to start over again.<p>Weird. I had the opposite problem.<p>Mid 2012 Macbook, couldn&#x27;t get El Capitan to install at all, but installing directly to Catalina from the USB worked first try.')
