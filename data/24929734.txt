Item(by='Mindwipe', descendants=None, kids=[24929893, 24929884], score=None, time=1603974417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929514, text='&gt; Wouldn’t the better option be to have regulation that prevent Both the rights seller (Hollywood) &amp; the seller From revoking the sale&#x2F;license, and guaranteeing it in the company’s perpetuity?<p>So how would this law work? The reality is that compound works are always, always made up of third party bits of copyright. So are films required to clear any music in perpetuity, no matter what? Goodbye to musicals. What happens if rights are in dispute and a supplier loses the rights to the title, or parts of a title (this happens a lot)? What happens if an estate of a creator files to have the IP in a character revert to them after fifty years?<p>How are you going to have this regulation pass in every country in the world at the same time?<p>Or is this one of these things that&#x27;s easy to glibly say but basically impossible to do?')
