Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=[25507421], score=None, time=1608649833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506786, text='&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make any sense to put up a building that&#x27;s 10% cheaper, but ugly, when it only makes the whole project 0.1% cheaper.<p>That&#x27;s the problem with most of the cheap&#x2F;tiny&#x2F;etc. housing schemes. By the time you account for whatever combination of land cost, overhead of common areas&#x2F;access, utility infrastructure, maintenance, etc., you now have housing that is often substandard in some way that isn&#x27;t actually much cheaper (and is going to be harder to rent&#x2F;sell&#x2F;re-sell).')
