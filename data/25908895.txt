This may be of use to someone reading: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23665164" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23665164</a><p>I did not solve mine, though it is signficiantly better managed. I got an improved night guard that isn’t causing jaw misalignment, did some physiotherapy of the jaw and exercises to improve masseter joint junction, and used the sleepguard bruxism monitor so I can see when I’m grinding.<p>The last one has become less useful as I’ve started knocking it off or turning it off in sleep, but it’s helpful to know bruxism is happening even if you think you have fixed it.<p>My new guard is a lower guard. I seem to grind more with it, but the upper guard was causing front tooth pain, so I think that may have interrupted grinding but been worse?<p>Anecdotally I grind more since no longer having a dog.')
