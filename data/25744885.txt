The key quote from the BBC article seem to be &quot;Facebook says it does not use WhatsApp information for those kind of purposes (i.e. ads, --Ed.) in Europe, because of negotiations with European data protection bodies.&quot;<p>In practice, what does &quot;negotiations&quot; mean in this context ? Are Europeans clearly protected under European data protection laws (with the UK lumped only until the can be technically &#x2F; legally separated once Brexit clears up) or is there a risk that these same changes will be eventually applied here too ?')
