It takes technical knowledge to overcome that measure.  (Go ahead, ask any non-techie you know to download a copy of a video from Youtube without using a tool like youtube-dl. They&#x27;ll fail.) That&#x27;s a reasonable measure; it would prevent the overwhelming majority of the population from copying. It doesn&#x27;t matter that it wouldn&#x27;t protect against the entire population; in the real world, keys, safes, bike locks, etc.  don&#x27;t stop determined individuals either.<p>And the outcome, if youtube-dl wins this case? Youtube and other sites that feature substantial amount of copyrighted content will have to change the technical details of how they store temporary video content, ultimately rendering youtube-dl useless for <i>all</i> videos, not just the ones guarded by the RIAA. Win the battle, lose the war.')
