It may not be enough, but the conclusion we ought to reach from this should be that we need more of it, not less of it.<p>Worse, it makes the situation murky by placing a veil over the initial communication, because the tweet&#x27;s effect of having been seen has already occurred. Obfuscating this information after it has already seen the light of day adds to its dark powers and makes disinformation harder to stop.')
