Do you realize that 20%+ of children are so badly nourished they are stunted? The impacts this will have on their entire life and development?<p>Not everyone country is your well developed western country where the state provides food to everyone.<p>This is kind of scary to see on HN - programmers should really travel more (I&#x27;m a dual citizen with pretty extensive travel AND WORK in much much poorer areas).<p>&quot;Apple for effectively funding that [starvation or bust] environment&quot;.<p>Heads up. Apple is one of the FEW western companies to actually cut off chinese suppliers for violating supply chain codes ($ lost, not just lipservice). I have no idea what you are talking about in terms of apple funding child exploitation. You are probably buying chinese made goods including those made with essentially forced labor. Do you not understand the situation in these countries? That US and European countries CONTINUE to sign new trade deals despite horrific labor and other abuses?<p>In all likelihood Apple factories, and even the factories of third party suppliers working for them, are probably one the <i>least</i> likely (not most) factories in china to be employing child labor as a result of apples efforts.')
