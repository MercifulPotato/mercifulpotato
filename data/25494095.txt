Yes, you can increase the chances of getting rich faster by being dishonest, and in the cases it works, you can get spectacular results (like early Microsoft) or you can get caught and finish in jail. But many businesspeople get good results by a combination of already having some initial capital, the right idea in the right time, some talent and willingness to work and take some risks to make things happen. Many of these don&#x27;t ever consider anything unethical. But of course only the worst cases get publicized.<p>I call this idea dangerous, because it stigmatizes all successful people, not just the bad ones. Accepting this kind of collective responsibility is as repulsive as racist statements.')
