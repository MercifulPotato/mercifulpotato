No more, no less.<p>Regardless of what this early result is, the only thing most of us can do is try to keep social distancing, use masks, and get vaccinated to protect ourselves as best as possible.<p>If the vaccine doesn&#x27;t actually protect us against the newer strains, we should <i>still take it</i> because we need protection from the more widely strain regardless.
