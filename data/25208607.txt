I could learn formulae and some typical solutions by heart to substitute values and solve some exam problems but hardly ever understood them. I felt school&#x2F;college math pure waste of time as I didn&#x27;t actually understand anything. Things like betterexplained were a blast that opened an entire new beautiful exciting world to me instantly.')
