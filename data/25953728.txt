Facebook obviously isn’t a natural monopoly. WSB is mainly on reddit, was active on discord, and congregates elsewhere.<p>I don’t think Facebook should have shut down WSB but that doesn’t make them a monopoly.<p>As for monopoly in general, there’s Tiktok, Snapchat. Clubhouse just raised a big round.<p>The blue facebook app is actually anything but a monopoly, as Instagram (a facebook property) gets much more enthusiasm. There’s no “natural” monopoly for Facebook blue there.<p>It’s easy to pick a concept and try to apply it everywhere, but Facebook can act objectionally without being “a natural monopoly”.')
