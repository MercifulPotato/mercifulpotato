Shops can refuse to accept devices that they can&#x27;t repair. Consumers aren&#x27;t sheep, and I don&#x27;t believe in legislation predicated on the assumption that they act like bovine.<p>I&#x27;m all for regulating tech companies, but not when it harms their ability to create products that fit market demands. When it comes to market demands today, repair-ability is at odds with other areas that companies innovate like device complexity, size, form factor, etc.<p>There is little market pressure for repairable devices. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the role of government to create it. The most compelling argument I&#x27;ve heard relates to recycling and reducing landfill usage of electronics. But I&#x27;m not sure what levers government can pull in that regard that make repair easier.')
