That he is still hedging a plot for a coup? Doubtful.<p>I think that you are giving him credit he&#x27;s not due. He&#x27;s not someone who creates and executes long term, complex plans. He acts on emotion; whatever he&#x27;s feeling right then, and takes actions that will coerce people into feeling the same way.<p>He&#x27;s angry that Biden won and that the certification of the vote is going to happen. Thus the certification is bad, and anyone going along with it is bad, so he says whatever will make the crowd think it&#x27;s bad.<p>&gt; The fact of the matter is that until yesterday, it made complete sense for Trump to cause a huge scene to scare the electors into tossing the election.<p>No, that&#x27;s not a fact. This was never going to happen. The electors were never going to get scared and overturn the will of the voters. He&#x27;s a simpleton; he didn&#x27;t like that he was losing, so he demonized everyone involved with that bad thing that he doesn&#x27;t like. This is something he&#x27;s been doing his entire life, and it&#x27;s effective as long as he has the money, influence, and smart people on the payroll to shape his vitriol and gusto into reality.')
