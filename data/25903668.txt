Flagging and censorship is a big concern here as there is an asymmetric balance of power that is clearly being abused.<p>Somebody doesn&#x27;t agree with me politically? flagged &amp; downvoted.<p>Somebody is a potential competitor? flagged &amp; downvoted.<p>Somebody drives a Ferrari and I don&#x27;t? flagged, downvoted (recently, somebody on HN tried to doxx me with no moderator taking action)<p>I miss the days when there were really good discussions, while those are still around, HN increasingly feels like a competition of &quot;I am smart because X so Y&quot;.
