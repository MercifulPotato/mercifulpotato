They do sometimes die, but not every wave. It&#x27;s still an insanely hard game.<p>The crazy thing about the lives is that they wrap around modulo 128 (maybe it&#x27;s 256), (and you can&#x27;t see the count beyond 3 or 4!) which means that if you are unlucky when it wraps around and you die, then it&#x27;s game over, even if you have been absolutely killing it wave after wave. Haha. Exciting!')
