Remind me, BBC, why is that a &quot;secure&quot; area?</i><p>Firstly, if passengers with connecting flights can get off one flight and onto another without going through security again, then the arrivals area must be connected to the departures area, and hence as secure as the departures area.<p>Indeed, if I wanted to sleep in an airport I&#x27;d go to the connections&#x2F;departures area - as someone sleeping while awaiting a connection wouldn&#x27;t seem out of the ordinary. Whereas sleeping in arrivals would be unusual, as an arriving passenger would go to their hotel or house and sleep there instead.<p>Secondly, if international arrivals have not yet passed through customs&#x2F;immigration, the area should be secure enough that they have to do so. Although in the case of O&#x27;Hare, I believe international arrivals have a separate terminal, and this passenger was on a domestic flight.')
