Maybe I&#x27;m just warped but GridBagLayout, while containing a certain base level of frustration, is O(1) for frustration. Whereas CSS are absolutely O(n) or worse. One of the best feelings in the world is replacing a complicated nesting of buggy BorderLayouts et al with one nice (slightly verbose) GridBagLayout that actually works.<p>In my imaginary company that I own where we all run linux laptops that are managed by puppet or something, I think we might make a strong case for building many internal tools in Swing.<p>The biggest hurdle I see nowadays to using Swing is all about distribution: both of the jvm and the program. Imo that&#x27;s really where the web won - certainly not because of its dev productivity. So it&#x27;s definitely a no-go for your actual software product.... but for internal tools where you have a lot more leverage over the environment, I think it looks extremely attractive.<p>Regarding JavaFX... Honestly, I really like it. I have a personal project that was originally in Swing and I ported it to JavaFX because HiDPI is in a lot better shape there (though I think Swing has since figured it out?). And it&#x27;s a lot better in many ways. I love-love-love using SceneBuilder for designing the view layer and the Observable pattern, I think, yields a lot of nice QOL&#x2F;verbosity-reducing things.<p>That said, I think it did have a slightly higher O() for frustration than Swing&#x27;s O(1). And I think the community, as a whole, just understands it less (less prior art etc).<p>So if someone said &quot;build a usable high-quality GUI asap or you die&quot; to me, I&#x27;d go to Swing immediately.')
