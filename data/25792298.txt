There was a good write-up from Anil Dash that picked up one of my favorite pieces of the recent TabFS write-up[1][2], _Keeping Tabs on Abstractions[3],_ noting that the browser &amp; OS are each running competing abstractions for tabs. The application&#x27;s invention of the Multi Document Interface (MDI) has done weird things! And I feel like most consumer OSes have done little to try to unify or provide options in the OS level, to take back territory.<p>I as quite happy &amp; pleased when Google&#x27;s Chrome on Android had tabs each appear as tabs in the OS. I have too many tabs, but I enjoyed that it was up to my launcher, up to my os to help me work with that. It gave me flexibility &amp; options to approach the problem. Where-as, when Chrome went back to managing tabs itself, it&#x27;s both been a disaster for me (new tab window shows me the start of my tabs, which has some years old tabs i only need occasionally), and a sadness, a defeat, that the OS can no longer manage this thing.<p>&gt; I do see the point of reattaching to shell sessions or attaching from multiple devices.<p>I&#x27;ve recommended dtach[4] elsewhere[5] in this topic &amp; here-by recommend it again! Very lightweight detachable proxy for persistent programs. I run vim inside of it, so I can attach&#x2F;detach. Vim has terminals inside of it, so that&#x27;s all I needed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;omar.website&#x2F;tabfs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;omar.website&#x2F;tabfs&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25600338" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25600338</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anildash.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;03&#x2F;keeping-tabs-on-your-abstractions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anildash.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;03&#x2F;keeping-tabs-on-your-abstrac...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;crigler&#x2F;dtach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;crigler&#x2F;dtach</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25792205" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25792205</a>')
