Item(by='TimTheTinker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609006619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25544190, text='&gt; Are you saying the auditors are the bureaucracy or the FIPS standards approvers are the bureaucracy?<p>Both.<p>&gt; All the auditors are saying is that you have to use a FIPS approved algorithm.<p>... which is a problem, because FIPS approved doesn’t imply secure.<p>Bcrypt is a better password hashing algorithm than any FIPS-approved algorithm at this time. Don’t agree with me? Read up on it. I’m not necessarily recommending it though - there are others that may be even better, depending on the circumstance.<p>&gt; they are using something else that’s not approved by FIPS (for good reason I might add)<p>What reason? Is there an expert cryptographer’s opinion or any expert cracking reports you can reference? Just because a group of experts decided a certain list of algos were “approved” several years ago doesn’t mean that newer algos designed or popularized since then are less secure.<p>Authority alone doesn’t confer reality or truth.<p>And unlike compliance, security is a process, not a destination.')
