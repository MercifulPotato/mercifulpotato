Item(by='acdha', descendants=None, kids=[25450680], score=None, time=1608161058, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25449008, text='That&#x27;s the value pitch for RHEL, where it&#x27;s understandable â€” whether or not you like the enterprise IT model of avoiding upgrades as long as possible, there&#x27;s a ton of money in it.<p>I think the gap is the question of how many people there are who want enterprise-style lifetimes but don&#x27;t actually want support. If you&#x27;re running servers which don&#x27;t need a paid support contract, upgrading Debian every 5 years is hardly a significant burden (and balanced by not having to routinely backport packages). There&#x27;s some benefit to, say, being able to develop skills an employer is looking for but that&#x27;s not a huge pool of users.<p>I think this is the reason behind the present situation: CentOS&#x27; main appeal was to people who don&#x27;t want to pay for RHEL, and not enough of those people contribute to support a community. That lead to the sale to Red Hat in the first place and it&#x27;s unclear to me that anyone else could be more successful with the same pitch.')
