Had they succeeded at this it would&#x27;ve brought together two sides of not only drug markets but like all kinds of shit (think everything not deemed appropriate by Visa&#x2F;MasterCard) on a convenient platform with plenty of features.<p>Sad to see those plans gone but what else there is to expect from authorities if you&#x27;re about to make their jobs 10x harder.')
