That if they like wide tables (they <i>enable</i> wide tables) that must mean the wider the better.<p>Sorting (or partitioning) is one of the most powerful optimizations in your toolbox.  But only when optimized for some kind of access pattern.  When you combine domains to get more width you have to make a compromise on the sorting. Then the wheels come off.<p>You still need different tables for clicks and orders and payments, even if they are very wide.  You may or may not physically conform your dimensions in pure Kimball style but logically you (should) still start there.')
