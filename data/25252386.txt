USAToday  state the claim, and then provide a official response to counter it.  But the official response is what is being brought into question!  It&#x27;s literally accepting the final word from the defendant.<p>Secondly, USAToday chooses a poor example of the &#x27;fraud claims&#x27; info on Facebook to debunk.  Because of that, it can say that there is no info as to how there is fraud on the tests, that the author didn&#x27;t respond to requests, etc.  So, the fact check article does not even need to address the fraud claims.<p>By purposely selecting poor material, USAToday do not need to look into any fraud details.  The can say &#x27;no fraud&#x27; without explaining why.<p>But even so, this so called &#x27;Independent Fact Check&#x27; is then used by Facebook, and presumably others, in order to warn people off the content.<p>Frankly, the process is a shambles.  Information is presented to Facebook that questions the official story.  Facebook ask a media expert (USAToday) to fact-check it.  USAToday ask the officials who are being accused in the information for the final word.  The information is labelled as FALSE.<p>This is a closed loop, and has nothing to do with getting to the truth.<p>As Orwell said in 1984:  &quot;Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth.&quot;')
