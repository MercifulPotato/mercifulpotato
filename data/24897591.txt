Gab is abusing your idealism. If you spent any amount of time on Gab you&#x27;d know it was a deeply right wing bubble full of hate, with a lot of harassment coordination happening. I say has because it has gone a bit out of fashion and these people moved on to Parlor now. This is not merely a place where people have opinions (that someone thinks are bad). That exists on YouTube. If the bar really was &quot;the consensus thinks you&#x27;re wrong, filled with bias and not interested in productive exchange&quot;, Stephen Crowder, Dennis Prager and Tim Pool would not be on YouTube. James Damore would not have been on every conservative program in existence. Society has drawn a line, and you can argue if it&#x27;s too strict or leniant, but to say we could never draw one without the possibility of false positives is defeatist idealism.<p>Sites like Gab or, let me dare mention their name, Kiwi Farms, are different. They facilitate material harm in a very tangible clear-cut way. They are very definitely beyond the point where tolerance does not actively work to destroy itself.')
