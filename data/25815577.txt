I&#x27;ve used Emacs on Windows at work for a decade. Other than magit, there&#x27;s virtually no difference in experience between the two platforms.[1] Of course, perhaps you use a different set of features than I do.<p>&gt; Maintaining Emacs on windows takes considerable effort.<p>I install it on my work laptop every 2-3 years, and for the last 5 or so years, it&#x27;s literally been &quot;Download, unzip and run.&quot; Occasionally I have to make registry changes to get org-protocol to work. Even 10 years ago, it was still fairly simple - just a bit of extra work to get some GTK related stuff installed as well. But right now it couldn&#x27;t be easier.[2]<p>And I don&#x27;t even use WSL. This is native Windows.<p>[1] Of course, if your Emacs is calling out to tools like grep&#x2F;find, etc, you&#x27;ll have issues unless you install those tools. Although these days, it&#x27;s not hard to configure it to use ripgrep and fd, which has excellent Windows support.<p>[2] And perhaps installing LaTeX if you want to export org files to PDF.')
