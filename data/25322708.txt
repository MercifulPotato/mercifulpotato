That doesn&#x27;t make sense. An id attribute value is supposed to be unique to a document, they also act like anchors. Your &lt;h2 id=&quot;foo&quot;&gt; <i>is</i> already the #foo anchor target. You can add arbitrary anchors with the &quot;&lt;a name&gt;&quot; tag but if you&#x27;ve got elements with id attributes you&#x27;re already good for anchors.<p>This is true of all elements with an id attribute, not just headers. They&#x27;re unique in the document so they can be unique selectors in the DOM.')
