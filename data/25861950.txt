She was an ER doctor). Before seatbelts and other safety devices were common there were a lot of gruesome accidents on the roads and we would have to stop.  I remember several episodes were my sister and I were bored and annoyed because my mother had departed in the ambulance and my dad would drive us to the hospital to wait for her.  Kid&#x27;s perspective.<p>I&#x27;ve been trained to do emergency procedures like a tracheotomy, move a patient with a back injury* et al and in my life have encountered <i>zero</i> situations where my so-called &quot;skills&quot; would be useful.  I don&#x27;t even drive past many car accidents any more, nor have I ever seen a diner choke to the point where they needed assistance.  But as a child I knew several kids who&#x27;d been hit by cars or fallen out of trees and been hospitalized, not to mention kids who&#x27;d lost a parent.  Has the world become safer?<p>* Obviously you only do this when the victim would be in even more and immediate danger where they are, else you leave &#x27;em in place for the professionals.')
