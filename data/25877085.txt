Item(by='nullsense', descendants=None, kids=[25877786], score=None, time=1611354455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25876789, text='Some point after I got diagnosed and I was having a conversation with my wife and I just burst out crying as I explained to her how after spending north of 1000 nights doing the dishes at 2am sometimes 3am because I was determined not to let our marriage bust up over me not doing the dishes and thinking to myself night after night &quot;I wish I knew what this was called so I could get her to understand&quot; I was just so overwhelmed with relief to finally know why and to be able to communicate that and to know there really is a reason underpinning it etc.<p>It helped tremendously with that aspect. Balance so far I haven&#x27;t been able to obtain still. I haven&#x27;t had any luck with medication yet as apparently 20% of people don&#x27;t respond to it and I might be one of those people. So far I&#x27;ve only tried a sustained release formulation of Methylphenidate and I don&#x27;t notice any difference. For other people the difference is quite dramatic. I&#x27;ve been encouraged by r&#x2F;ADHD to be persistent in trying to find if there is a combination of meds that works for me. Next I will try the instant release version.<p>It&#x27;s helped my health a lot. I would always put off going to the doctor or dentist and thought if I ignore it it&#x27;ll go away. Since learning that untreated ADHD has a life expectancy that&#x27;s shorter by 13 years on average (due to increased risk of a accidents, obesity, drug addiction, suicide etc) I&#x27;ve really started to put an emphasis on fixing my litany of health problems and in the past 12 months have started to see progress.<p>Getting diagnosed was the biggest revelation of my life and a very positive thing for me. The down side is is you go through this honeymoon phase where you feel like &quot;now that I know what this is I can finally solve all the problems&quot; and eventually realising it&#x27;s a neurological condition and not a curable disease.<p>But for sure if you have suspicions seek an evaluation. One thing that I found interesting is that it presents very differently in people, so how one person describes it might not be how you experience it. Generally speaking though if the patterns that emerge when you start looking through r&#x2F;ADHD and How To ADHD YouTube channel and the book &quot;Driven To Distraction&quot; resonate with you then it&#x27;s probably a pretty good indication.')
