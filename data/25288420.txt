It doesn&#x27;t matter if we reduce pollution if we&#x27;re still causing global warming - things may be better, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re good enough.<p>&gt; A peasant in the dark ages had to deal with starvation, black death or invaders. These were actual threats in the sense that an average conversation will be like: &quot;Last week Martha got her head chopped off by a barbarian and Bob died of starvation. &quot;<p>To even suggest starvation doesn&#x27;t exist is...I don&#x27;t even have the words.<p>Did you hear about the Nigerian farmers who were executed last week by Boko Haram? Not very different than a barbarian raiding a small village.')
