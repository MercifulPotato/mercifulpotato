Item(by='jbullock35', descendants=None, kids=[25978662], score=None, time=1612024646, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25968446, text='&gt; for an important part of the exam he candidly said &quot;I haven&#x27;t understood what you did here so I didn&#x27;t assigned any points to that&quot; -- which is really bullshit.<p>&gt; You&#x27;ve got a phd in this shit, you&#x27;re supposed to be a world-class expert on the matter, how could you not understand this? It&#x27;s not that you haven&#x27;t understood, it&#x27;s that you didn&#x27;t bother spending 30 seconds to look at the piece of paper.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to this specific case. And awarding no points at all does sound quite unusual. But, speaking as a professor, it&#x27;s disturbing to see how often and how badly students overestimate the intelligibility of their work.<p>Important qualification: I am thinking of student essays and prose answers to exam questions. The situation may be very different in circuit theory and other areas in which answers to exam questions often aren&#x27;t in prose.')
