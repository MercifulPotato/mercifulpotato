The words sex and gender have been used to describe people&#x27;s &quot;social sex&quot;&#x2F;&quot;gender identity&quot;&#x2F;&quot;gender presentation&quot; and their biological sex depending on the context.<p>Like a trans woman&#x27;s drivers license and birth certificate will say female so it&#x27;s hard to cleanly say that sex === biological sex.')
