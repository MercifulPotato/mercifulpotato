Businesses were ordered to close, and that made employees eligible to collect unemployment insurance. A federal program paid those unemployed people $2400 a month (in addition to their unemployment insurance).<p>The US poverty rate went down during the period. So it wasn&#x27;t a lack of welfare protection, it was just a (likely bad) implementation choice, paying individuals instead of paying businesses to keep them on payroll.<p>The lack of response since that expired in July fits your description though.')
