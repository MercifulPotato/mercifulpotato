In python, getting speed can be weird and counterintuitive. In C, a straightforward algorithm can be blazing fast. For example, finding the length of the longest word in a string, you can just iterate through the string keeping track of a few indices. In cases like that, where the obvious simple C function is incredibly faster than the same python, where does Julia fit in? Would that kind of naively written function be closer to C or Python?')
