Does communism not mean what it used to mean any more?<p>- to own a huge company in China, you would have to be a member of the CCP. Otherwise it would be stripped from you and you would be jailed.<p>- as of 2019, companies over 50 employees have a CCP cell in their office. The CCP is now going after even smaller companies in 2020.<p>- communism is totalitarianism. That means the society is strictly controlled top-down, from Dragon Families&#x2F;Xi to the lowest peasant. The families pillage China on a national scale (Three Gorges power generation revenue, etc.), while the CCP has ultimate control of literally everything else.<p>- China has had tremendous growth, funded by the West, but aggressively-managed by local officials with KPIs, etc.<p>- the CCP is modelled on the Soviet Union, but on steroids<p>- It&#x27;s reported that the top 100 CCP officials have personal wealth of around $2 billion each.')
