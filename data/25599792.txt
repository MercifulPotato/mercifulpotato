Today, when people say &quot;you can formalize all mathematics&quot; post GÃ¶del, it means you pick your area and formalize away, knowing that effectively proving consistency of your formal system (within the same system) is out of reach.<p>So nobody tries to claim &quot;all in one system&quot; but many logics and sets of axioms coexist without there being any distinguished one that is better (in the sense of effectively proved consistent and strong enough to be &quot;useful&quot;).')
