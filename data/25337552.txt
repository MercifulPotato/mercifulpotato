The idea at this point is to take the risk and hopefully obtain meaningful results. If the vaccine causes side effects with terminally-ill, then you have proof that it needs further evaluation and the sufficient condition is not met. If the vaccine, however, doesn&#x27;t cause side effects <i>and</i> is proven efficient, it yeilds a sufficient result thus reducing the trial length, saving millions.')
