Or maybe they’ve got a new way to do virtualisation since that is such a key thing these days.<p>Edit: thanks for pointing that out though, that’s why I mentioned it<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;virtualization" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;virtualization</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23922846" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23922846</a><p>And the mentioned Virtio here:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linux-kvm.org&#x2F;page&#x2F;Virtio" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linux-kvm.org&#x2F;page&#x2F;Virtio</a><p>How well this fits in with current virtualisation would be interesting to find out; I guess this will be for a later version of Big Sur, with a new beefier M2 chip.')
