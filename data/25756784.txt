To be fully effective, a system must be designed so that a person is not directly exposed to the light.</i><p>Does this mean that the proposed system should be used for only situations where no people are present? Say, a bus&#x2F;train at a terminus rather than in transit, or a hospital ward emptied for the purpose of such disinfection?<p>I am probably misremembering things, but I&#x27;d long thought that if you irradiated quite a few things intensely enough, they&#x27;d just die off - whether with UV or something harsher. How is this different, other than delivery via (cheaper?) LEDs?')
