Maybe you will eventually, but if you think you still have space to grow your free plan and it the unit economics are manageable for you, that&#x27;s a half million or so and growing hot leads for your paid plan.<p>&gt; The think i am worried is that our growth happened like this, A dev team from a company started using it and then they like it and in few months it will be 5-15 teams from same company will start using it because they liked it and it was free now<p>If an entire engineering organization with multiple teams is using your product, the vast majority will pay for it if you find the right features, pricing and positioning.  A small dev team at an unfunded, pre-revenue startup might want to pinch pennies some, but if orgs that have a significant sized engineering team are starting to use your tool, paying a reasonable amount monthly is a rounding error compared to the cost of their salaries.<p>&gt; Then there is another segment these are large enterprises and they ask us a lot about security, sso and integrations we have quoted them price from 1 USD per user per month to 10 USD and reaction is mixed some thinks even 1USD is high price for this kind of tool.<p>There is always difficulty in getting people to go from free to paid.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how much the pricetag is, there&#x27;s resistance to pulling out the wallet across the board.  You shouldn&#x27;t be trying to minimize the price of your product.  In fact, I&#x27;d personally look at a $1 price tag and wonder if the software is robust enough to use at my organization.  It would make me NOT want to buy it.  Price it reasonably.  Some people will never pay for your product.  Your goal isn&#x27;t to convert all of your users to paid accounts, your goal is to convert enough people at an appropriate pricing structure for you to have a sustainable, successful business.')
