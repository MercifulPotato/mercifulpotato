It means the existing information systems failed to deliver an answer, and the user falls back to manually asking the hive mind&#x27;s tacit knowledge.&quot; I find it&#x27;s usually a failure of the doc search mechanism. It&#x27;s much faster to ask humans a vague question than try to form the right search query for the internal doc system, which is usually much much worse than Google.<p>This can be solved by making docs public, but also by having people respond with a link to the docs. So Slack can still be a good interface to Q&amp;A, as long as a single answer is documented.')
