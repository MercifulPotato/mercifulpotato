A dryness i haven&#x27;t seen before.<p>A dryness which hurt the trees outside of my window as they did not get enough water, which i also have not seen.<p>But don&#x27;t get me wrong. Knowing whats going on is stressful, reading irrelevant drama and not reading about people who are changing and trying to change the world is frustrating.<p>Instead of reading about new and less co2 producing stuff, i read about an idiot trump who plays kindergarden  tantrum on the highest political level. The level which should give a direction and guidance.<p>And yes i&#x27;m not from the USA but if &#x27;not even&#x27; the USA can do it, i can&#x27;t expect a lot more countries not to do it.<p>At least my country is reasonable boring and smart (yes germany go germany :P)')
