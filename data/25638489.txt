Got an offer while I was still interviewing with a few other companies. Accepted the offer then a few weeks later another, significantly better, offer came through.<p>I have absolutely no qualms about it, and I don&#x27;t put the tiny stint on my resume. My work and expertise speaks for itself. It&#x27;s sad that job hunting has become rife with Machiavellian machinations in the past three decades, but this is the world we live in. Acting otherwise is self-sabotaging.<p>Long gone are the days where we&#x27;d become &quot;company men&quot; loyal to CEOs and corporate pillars. We&#x27;d get to retire in our late 50s with pretty wives, a few kids, and decent savings. Job hopping is the most reliable way to get a raise. If you don&#x27;t job hop, you might be on the chopping block come the next layoff wave.<p>This is all on top of the fact that engineers are woefully underpaid. I have finance friends that make literal millions in yearly bonuses. This is virtually unheard of in software, even though we provide orders of magnitude more value.<p>It is what it is.')
