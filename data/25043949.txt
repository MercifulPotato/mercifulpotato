There isn&#x27;t a single country in the world that requires a license to &quot;own a knife&quot;.<p>&gt; let alone a gun. It&#x27;s all tracked. There are targeted missiles, drones, autonomous guns, surveillance, radar, bombs, tear gas, tasers, tanks, bullet and knife proof clothing, exoskeleton, etc available to the knights.<p>However, there&#x27;s a lots of things relatively freely available to peasants that can be turned into a bomb capable of killing any knight who&#x27;s not in a tank. And even a tank can have a bad time in a city full of hostile peasants.<p>&gt; Knights are many times more organized than they have ever been in history.<p>This is a the big one. Organization really matters to make the technological advantage count. And it ivolves knowing in what situations that advantage wouldn&#x27;t work well, and avoiding them.')
