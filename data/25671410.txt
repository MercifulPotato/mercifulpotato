Neither was deleting facebook, at least at the time when it was still being used. Whatsapp has inserted itself into the social fabric as a benevolent offering and now that we are all locked in we get what we payed for.<p>But that is all the more reason to get rid of it. Of course this makes life complicated. But if we don&#x27;t make these hard choices and &#x27;sacrifices&#x27;, it will never stop. They will keep eroding away at our privacy and freedom. It will only become harder the longer we wait.<p>This kind of things will keep happening though as long as we allow monopolies and closed platforms. We should really be more careful with accepting these companies into our lives.')
