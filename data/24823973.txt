You <i>always</i> travel thorugh spacetime with a constant speed (the speed of light). What happens is that you&#x27;re usually going with 460 m&#x2F;s (as Earth revolves around the Sun) and this is not really comparable to your `t` speed in the x&#x2F;y&#x2F;z&#x2F;t coordinate system. So when you are still your speed is something like 230&#x2F;230&#x2F;0&#x2F;299.791.998.')
