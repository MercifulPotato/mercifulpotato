It&#x27;s just a spat between Resolute, a distributor, and the actual brains of the operation. This was done in retaliation over ARK&#x27;s move to seek a better deal. Resolute has a lot to lose if they actually try to exercise that takeover clause, because they simply don&#x27;t have the expertise to manage the fund! ARK doesn&#x27;t want to have to set up a new fund, either, because that&#x27;s a terrible distraction that sets them back months.<p>The obvious compromise they will likely reach: Resolute will drop that overbearing clause, and in return ARK will keep them as their distributor.')
