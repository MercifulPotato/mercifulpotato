Why can&#x27;t the static type checkers like mypy and pyright do this for us?<p>The answer is that the type systems of these languages are not sufficiently developed. They can tell you if you&#x27;re assigning a string to an int, but not if you&#x27;re assigning 200 to an int whose type allows only numbers in [10, 100].<p>So one creates a new class with a validate() method, which is completely unnecessary and doesn&#x27;t protect you against integer overflows elsewhere in the code.<p>F* and OCaml derivatives are our best hope in developing a type system which perform these types of common checks in one integrated framework via refinement types and dependent types.<p>Hopefully, one day that work can hit mainstream languages like python, javascript and whatever ends up being the system programming language of choice replacing C in the coming years.')
