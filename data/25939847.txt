First, PDF is very hard to impossible to scale for people who need big writing, due to reflowing being unavailable or not working properly. Text in PDF&#x2F;A can still be a big image, e.g. in a scan for archival purposes, if you are &quot;lucky&quot; there is an OCR overlay, but then your screenreader reads OCR&#x27;d text which is hit-or-miss. And text ordering is supposed to be &quot;reading order&quot; in PDF&#x2F;A, but many tools, especially DTP tools make a mess of it and jumble up the (screenreader-visible) order of text in textboxes, columns and sometimes even paragraphs.<p>IME PDF&#x2F;A is better than nothing, but far worse than plain HTML for accessibility..')
