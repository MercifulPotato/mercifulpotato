Sometimes I hesitate from posting about this because It&#x27;s a very sensitive topic. The reason for your pain might be totally different from mine and I hate to assume what worked for me would work for you, etc. In any case, I was also changed by reading Sarno&#x27;s books and that&#x27;s the interesting part.<p>My pain started in my chest, left and right. Then it transitioned to the center, I went to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack. Got blood tests and studies done. In the following months the pain took over other parts of my body and my arms, legs and back were hurting a lot. I was having a very hard time working, I had to ask for a couple of weeks off and try to figure out what was going on. \nSometimes the pain would go away for a few hours and then come back. I didn&#x27;t have a clue of what was going on because I couldn&#x27;t find a consistent pattern, it was just moving everywhere and I couldn&#x27;t even play with my kid, which was killing me.<p>I was browsing YouTube and was reading about this guy that had Carpal Tunnel, I was curious because I was trying to avoid making my pain worse. So when I was reading the comments, I saw someone wrote something like &quot;Read Sarno&#x27;s book and thank me later&quot;.<p>I was intrigued and started reading about him. I started with his book: The Divided Mind. From there it all started to change gradually. I found a local physician that specializes in TMS, and that help me so much. after a few weeks it all started to fade away considerably. Today I feel great. All this happened in a period of like 8 months.')
