I can speak more accurately to Philippines, where parts in Luzon will not get serviced&#x2F;it gets cosigned to a local carrier, LBC and even then they rely on the package having a reliable phone number&#x2F;email address as they&#x27;ll have to contact the receiver and pay for the service.<p>Metro Manila is pretty much okay, but, even down south of Visayas (including Cebu, Ilo Ilo&#x2F;Bocold) and especially Mindanao - Philippine Mail is not used at all, packages are cosigned to LBC to be picked up at their place, which ususally is a landmark like a Mall or town center. But usually Mall, if that area has it.<p>The Philippines Mail system is a bit of a fun system, being founded by Spain, then USA take over (but not per se the USPS.)')
