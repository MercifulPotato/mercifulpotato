It seems disproportionately punitive, and the &quot;right&quot; thing to happen only if all you care about is watching things burn.<p>And you haven&#x27;t addressed the precedent that&#x27;s been set that APIs are now copyrightable. Do you like that precedent? Do you ever use anyone else&#x27;s APIs in your daily development, and do you like how that now opens you to huge potential liability? Is all of this worth it just because Google <i>didn&#x27;t</i> acquire Sun??')
