Often times a VFX centric cloud provider will have some robust system in place for uploading and caching out data across the many nodes that need it.

Big budget VFX scenes can often take 40-120 GB of memory to keep everything accessible during the raytrace process, and unless a renderer supports out-of-core memory access, then the speed up you may have gained from the GPU gets thrown out the window from swapping data')
