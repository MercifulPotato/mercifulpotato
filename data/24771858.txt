But:<p>1. on mac os you can press cmd+backtick to cycle through the windows of the current app<p>2. except for some exceptions keyboard shortcuts are pretty unified across all apps on mac os and can even be configured in a single global place<p>3. from my biased point of view of being a software developer myself: If I see a file chooser modal component that locks all interaction then I see a wrong choice in a UI component that does not fit the usecase. But if I see a rendering glitch of a component in a promotional video, it looks to me as if the whole state space of the component or even of the GUI stack is ill defined. Visual states like this [1] should not appear. If they are inside a promotional video I assume that some people have seen it happening and either did not care or it is very hard to fix because the issue is rooted deeply in the system. Maybe I overreact but I stumble across glitches like this all the time I try to use linux on the desktop.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;oNgzmYC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;oNgzmYC</a>')
