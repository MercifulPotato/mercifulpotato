Purpose of the HRV is to attempt to preserve the inside heat (usually both latent and sensible, using a rotating exchanger wheel) while bringing in fresh outside air.<p>They allow you to seal the building up really good, which is good for energy efficiency, without having insufficient ventilation and getting high CO2 levels.<p>Because they&#x27;re not perfectly efficient, you can use them to move the inside temp closer to outside-- but just plain outside air exchange would do it better. :)')
