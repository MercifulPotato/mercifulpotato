Are fact checkers inherently biased?  Probably.  Should we ignore them?  No.  CNN&#x27;s fact checkers called out the distortion on the &#x27;both sides&#x27; discussion, as did PolitiFact and others.<p>When it comes to fact checker bias, PolitiFact is a good example to look at because they publish numbers on all the politicians.  If you look at both left and right wing politicians, you&#x27;ll see that they say plenty of inaccurate things.  Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Hillary Clinton, Biden, all say inaccurate or untrue things to the order of 20 - 45% of checked statements.<p>Trump is in a category all his own.  72% of his checked statements are inaccurate.<p>Of course you should subject those numbers to scrutiny. Certainly there is sample bias in what statements get checked.  But it is easy to find many, many Trump statements in which he makes statements that are so verifiably untrue that it becomes easy to conclude that he has little interest in providing evidence for his opinions.  This graduates him from garden variety bias into active malfeasance.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to recognize bias and fight it, but in the end, the mainstream media at least holds itself to a factual standard, as do mainstream politicians on both sides.  Trump is very, very different.  He himself represents nothing more than a war on factuality itself and a disdain for consensus or evidence of any kind.')
