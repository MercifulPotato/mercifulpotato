So, initially the entire field is one island drawn as a single sprite with a repeating texture, then you add a &quot;1&quot; and now you split the island into 5 different such islands having the same texture. It&#x27;s an also interesting problem to know how many such distinct islands you can actually have, I assume the number mostly depends on the number of mines.')
