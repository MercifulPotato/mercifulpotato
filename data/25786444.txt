This will of course also support any regular web content that the latest version of Chrome does too.<p>Support for playback of other video&#x2F;audio URLs via ffmpeg.<p>Also considering adding a local screen sharing component so you can share your screen with your friends and maybe play games together.<p>I initially wanted to make this work in JavaScript so it could be used anywhere and had a shot at working on my Quest2. Not sure that’s possible so for the moment it’s all in C++11 and non-VR.<p>I have a family and a full time job so I’m only able to work on this evenings and weekends, my 9 year old princess permitting but it’s been fun so far. Haven’t decided how to release it yet but all my other stuff is open source so it probably will be too.')
