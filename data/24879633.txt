Aliens could fall somewhere on the potential intelligence spectrum between sperm and fetus or only one in a billion could reach acceptable intelligence for a soul whatever that is deemed to be. What if they are intelligent, but physically cannot believe in God? Is that just metaphysically impossible?<p>Second is that the Bible doesn&#x27;t claim to be comprehensive. This kind of weird to argue against, basically anything disagreeable in the Bible could be controverted then. It&#x27;s like saying there COULD be an 11th commandment or something of that nature. It makes the Bible not necessarily wrong but difficult to take seriously.')
