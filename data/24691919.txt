Excel gets used because word comes to a director at a health department that says &quot;we need to collect testing results from 500 different facilities in a way their, and our, existing systems do not support&quot; and they&#x27;re given maybe 3 days to get it done along with the rest of their job. Putting together a technical team would take a week minimum let alone requirements gathering and analysis. So what do they do? They fire up Excel, add column headers that represent the data they need, and then send it to a Sr. Manager and tell them to make it happen.')
