How does that make economic sense? These guys walk off with a huge bag of cash, a bunch of investors that were trying to invest positively get screwed, the mall dies,<p>The way you&#x27;ve written this kind of implies that the mall dies because they bet against it.  That isn&#x27;t the case at all.  The malls were going to die either way.<p>&gt; and all that money and economic opportunity vanishes.<p>Live by the sword, die by the sword.  Malls were part of what killed small mom &amp; pop shops.  Things change.  Government programs should be in-place to protect people (especially like, normal people) from the worst&#x2F;unpredictable outcomes of market based economy, but overall, markets are good at allocating capital to what people actually want (whether its actually good for us or not, see: social media).<p>&gt; Are we _really_ to believe that the era of the physical marketplace, the Third Location where you can take your family and kill a rainy day, is really dead? Does nobody want this at all, anymore?<p>Can we please aspire to a better 3rd place than an advertising&#x2F;consumerist mecca?  How about community centers with pools, basketball courts, and arcades?  With a mall&#x27;s food court attached?')
