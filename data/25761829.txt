They are all currently homeschooling in UK lockdown number 3.<p>All of their lessons are delivered via video (Google Classrooms). The quality of learning seems low, they seem unengaged and only respond to teacher when absolutely forced to. As a parent all I really do is IT support and discourage distraction (put your phone down etc).<p>In UK lockdown 1 in March there was no video learning. Tasks were emailed the day before. As a family we sat together round the kitchen table worked together. Questions they didn&#x27;t understand were explained (my wife is a teacher) or googled. They put in about 4hrs each day and the learning experience seemed so much better, even though it took more effort from us as parents.<p>I don&#x27;t really have any answers other than online learning for teenagers doesn&#x27;t replace good teacher lead distraction free instruction in the classroom.')
