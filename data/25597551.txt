In addition, my family is in Europe (I&#x27;m in the US) and being able to call them during the workday spontaneously instead of making it a planned thing to do over the weekend has been a huge perk as well. I think the 4-day workweek sounds great for people who can&#x27;t have the same day to day flexibility but would like the convenience the article mentions')
