Elon and renewables are only becoming a thing because of economic incentives from governments - positive incentives in the form of subsidies on e.g. new EVs, solar panels, etc, and negative incentives in the form of carbon taxes.<p>Take those away and the &quot;green&quot; companies would have NO incentive to push their work. They&#x27;d be working with people wanting to do better first and foremost, and then they would - ironically - be competing with petrol and energy companies, who also have &quot;green&quot; all over their marketing.<p>Renewables and EVs could not compete without government incentives.')
