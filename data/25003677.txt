I&#x27;m not bothered with auto complete or any of that stuff, and it works great for me.<p>In my spare time I dabble in Unity, and what I always get stuck on is the IDE for the C# code. It used to come with an IDE that was pretty good, which I forget the name of. Autocomplete and other things worked out of the box. These days it comes with Visual Studio and I find it a pain. Auto complete, etc  doesn&#x27;t work, and getting it to work seems very complicated. I then go on the internet, and someone says VS code is good, so I try that, but run into the same issues integrating with the Unity libraries and so on, and before I know it I have spend a day just on trying and failing to configure IDEs and it&#x27;s not that much fun to be honest.\nIt sounds like Intellij might be better? I don&#x27;t know.<p>At this point I just go back to writing Go in Vim where I am happy and don&#x27;t have to spend so much time fighting to be allowed to write code.')
