In 1982, feeling that it could not win, Bell agreed to a Justice Department-mandated consent decree that settled the lawsuit and ordered it to break itself up into seven &quot;Regional Bell Operating Companies&quot; (known as &quot;The Baby Bells&quot;), which it did in 1984, ending the original company&#x27;s existence. These &quot;Baby Bells&quot; are now independent companies, and several of them are very large corporations in their own right, such as AT&amp;T, Verizon Communications, and CenturyLink.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bell_System" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bell_System</a>')
