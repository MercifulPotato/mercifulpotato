I.e., different MIPS CPU implementations would have different optimal branch delay slot sizes.\nThis doesn&#x27;t matter too much if your compiler is allowed to optimize for your particular implementation, but we are still mostly shipping binaries and thus you would have to make trade-offs for portability reasons.')
