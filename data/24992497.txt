Building them has no impact on kernel memory usage.<p>(Consider that it&#x27;s possible to build the kernel with all the modules set to &quot;n&quot;, then switch the modules to &quot;m&quot; and build them afterwards. The resulting kernel is identical, save for having a slightly different embedded .config.)')
