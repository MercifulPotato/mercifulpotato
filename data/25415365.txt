All you need is a starter project and an interest. You can Google everything.<p>Pick an easy language. I recommend Javascript or Python. There&#x27;s a wealth of learning material and you can use these two languages to build a wide variety of things.<p>Pick something fun: a simple game, an interactive website, a blog, etc. Make it your objective, and instill in yourself a deep desire to make it. But don&#x27;t get caught up on making it perfect.<p>Read a tutorial or two, experiment, and try to apply what you learned to the thing you want to build.<p>It&#x27;ll take a lot of time. Whatever time you think it takes, multiply that figure by three. Don&#x27;t stress out. You can&#x27;t conceive of all the roadblocks or what you don&#x27;t know.<p>If you get stuck, ask questions on Reddit, StackOverflow, Discord, etc. Learning how to ask questions builds your mental model of how this stuff fits together. Eventually you&#x27;ll be able to answer a lot of your own questions.<p>Block out an entire weekend and go for it.')
