One of my main goals with Synergy is simplicity, which in the context of this discussion would mean a lower level of configurability &#x2F; customisation, so pulling that template functionality out and moving decisions on to the user would (as you say) take the design in quite a different direction. A perfectly valid direction though, and one that would doubtlessly better suit some folk more than my approach - I&#x27;d love to see you fork Synergy and implement these ideas!')
