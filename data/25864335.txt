I am paying too much for a slightly unreliable service and the employees aren&#x27;t getting paid enough. The stores should provide the shoppers, delivery should be a separate service, and the cost should be about a $15-30 premium for a large grocery order (15+ minutes of order picking + delivery similar to a cab ride). That leaves the ordering platform, which might be a nice niche for Instacart to provide across multiple stores.<p>Anyway, this has been a tough business all the way back to Webvan!')
