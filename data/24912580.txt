Amazon gives you their 12 principles and wants you to come up with 36 stories (3 per principle) about how you used these principle at work.<p>My interviews were far and away the least thoughtful hiring experience I’ve ever had. It was clear each person was filling out a form while I was talking, and followed up with pre-written questions. There was nothing non-traditional, and the 6 hour loop definitely did not respect my time. ~50 hours of prep, 10 total hours of interviews ( 2 hours of screening, 6 hour loop, 2 additional interviews for other roles).<p>I had really great interactions... after the forms we’re filled out. Interviews went well - I was put into the “recycle” status but never found a role there that really fit my experience.<p>Nontechnical but still tech consulting, not aws.')
