The little abstract at the top is far more informative:<p>&gt; A Blender user-interface to generate synthetic ground truth data (benchmarks) for Computer Vision applications.<p>And it lets you make stereo images, depth maps, segmentation masks, surface normals and optical flow data from the rendered animation, and export it all in .npz numpy format. Quite interesting project.')
