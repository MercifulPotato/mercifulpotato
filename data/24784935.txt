I have the Apple Smart Keyboard Folio (not the newest magic keyboard) and I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for a way to enable key repeat, to no avail.  Am I wrong in thinking that traditionally key repeat is handled at the OS level, rather than the keyboard level?  It seems weird to me that each individual keyboard would be in charge of implementing that, especially when the settings for it are part of a desktop OS.')
