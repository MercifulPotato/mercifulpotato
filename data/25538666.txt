Instead of getting upset over it, just go through a quick checklist:<p>* The management and most everyone else around me are in fact stupid and incompetent - just leave the place, problem solved<p>* The management in fact &quot;gets&quot; my concerns but doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right time to address them - they may have a point? they may see something that you don&#x27;t see?<p>* The management doesn&#x27;t think my concerns are serious enough to invest resources into - they may have a point?<p>* The place sucks but I get paid a lot and don&#x27;t want to leave - just distance from it and focus on your part<p>Either way seems pretty fixable, not much to get upset about.')
