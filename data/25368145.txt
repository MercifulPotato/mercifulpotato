I use youtube for music and learning about hobbies.<p>I still think it&#x27;s worth talking about the precedent that youtube is setting here, and it&#x27;s not productive to be combative about it. Of course youtube can censor or remove whatever it wants.<p>My main point, anyway, was that I dislike the &quot;just use a different platform&#x2F;site&#x2F;company&quot; argument, for the reasons I outlined above. Not because I think youtube -has- to host any sort of content, nor did I ever state that.')
