Knowing the location of datacentres allows you to deduce what power grid they&#x27;re attached to. Scope 2 emissions depend a lot on where the electricity is coming from, and they&#x27;re likely the vast majority of Amazon&#x27;s emissions due to the size of AWS. Their Scope 3 emissions due to deliveries might also be significant, but it&#x27;s harder to be secretive about that.')
