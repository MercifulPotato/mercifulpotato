Google accepted her resignation and chose to have it effective immediately (as is often the case when you resign and a company feels like it would not be beneficial to have a longer departure period).<p>It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m taking only the words of others.  I&#x27;m reading what Gebru herself chose to put out there.')
