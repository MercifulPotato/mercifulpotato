The extra overhead that you may not want to deal with - and that learning curve - are the exact sorts of things you want to do if you want to write code that is of less questionable quality.<p>Good Python looks a lot like what you would get from a compiled language, and every researcher I work with looks at it and goes &quot;holy shit this is so much extra work I don&#x27;t wanna do it&quot;<p>And like I said, that&#x27;s fair. The code is not the point, it&#x27;s just a tool to get the data - that&#x27;s the point.<p>I equate it to the one time use jigs woodworkers use.  Some can get pretty fancy and be awesome, but most are just slapped together and will probably get chucked in the bin. I don&#x27;t mean to shame anyone - there&#x27;s a reason for it, and it serves it&#x27;s purpose.<p>It&#x27;s when someone hands you that shitty-ass jig, from a language that lets you do some pretty heinous things <i></i>by design<i></i>, the frustration builds like crazy!  I&#x27;ve seen some pretty gnarly Java and C# in my day too, and all I know is the worst Java still is an order of magnitude easier to handle than the worst Python I see on the regular, it&#x27;s wild.')
