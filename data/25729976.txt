Under the &#x27;reasoning&#x27; that people are violating rules on their platform.<p>That doesnt really make sense. Whereas if you look at it from a &#x27;big tech censorship&#x27; point of view. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening. Very clear that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening.<p>Even wikipedia has banned conservatives. For example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Barack_Obama" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Barack_Obama</a><p>Could you show me where on that wiki page they show any of his scandals? Benghazi, the IRS scandal, the AP phone records scandal, Fast and Furious, Solyndra or the Hillary Clinton email server, Obamagate, etc?<p>Kind of interesting how Obama&#x27;s wiki page doesnt list ANY of his scandals. Whereas trump&#x27;s page was clearly not written by any republican.')
