Doesn&#x27;t matter which wsgi server I used, the baseline performance level stay the same. For example, a simple django rest api endpoint with nested serializers took 45ms to render, which is similar to the time it take for freshly installed wordpress running on apache&#x2F;php7.4 (docker) to render the homepage the same test server. All the rest api endpoint did was serializing values from database entries to json, yet it took the same time as a default installation of wordpress to render. Yes, django rest framework serializer is slow and maybe I should use something else, but if cpython is faster maybe there won&#x27;t be a need to replace the serializer just for a performance issue.')
