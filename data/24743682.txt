You can create network attachment definitions for multiple nics, you can specify the contents of a config file via a bunch of MachineConfigs. And you can just not do all of this until you need to, you can go straight ahead to creating Deployments, and load balanced services. With KubeVirt, you can use k8s resources and virtctl to manage virtual machines.<p>Vendor specificness is highly minimized by a management layer.')
