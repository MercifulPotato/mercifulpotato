Office sucks at merging documents so this is more work for all the other “cloudies” or whatever you call people who know how to edit online.<p>I’ve found this is because some users just never used cloud document tools and don’t know how and there’s no easy culturural norm now that everyone is teleworking to teach them.<p>But this should be used to find zero or very low users and then thrown away. I think that trying to see the number or make a metric out of “number of opens” is so phenomenally dumb. It would be like comparing two git commit history grids and thinking one person is better than another.')
