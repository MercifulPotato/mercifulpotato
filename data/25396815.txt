The thing is, you&#x27;re reading an newspaper article on anything where you can evaluate the quality with any kind of confidence, and it is invariably garbage, much too much simplified, glances over the interesting bits, and obviously the journalist did not understand the topic. And then you&#x27;re turning the page, and expect the article on anything else to be much better.')
