These networks come with their own security guarantees, trade-offs &amp; governance pitfalls, but unfortunately do not mention these on their home page of their shiny professionally designed website.<p>I also don&#x27;t see a future for these things on Bitcoin, because as soon as bitcoin block rewards diminish, the miners would need to be paid from transaction fees. However, for the miners to be profitable, the transaction fees would need to increase an order of a magnitude - making solutions such as these potentially expensive and infeasible.<p>There were a few projects like this in the past, one from memory was called Counterparty. Not sure what happened to that. I guess the 10 minute block times and high fees might have been the culprit.<p>Conclusion: Anybody promoting this is just trying to sell their bag of STX tokens.')
