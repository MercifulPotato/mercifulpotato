I think the appeal of BTC is that it&#x27;s a commodity [+] that&#x27;s easily transferable across large distances &amp; incurs very low storage costs. I get that. However, that alone does not necessarily make it a good store of value in my eyes; for that to be true, there&#x27;d have to be an extremely low risk of the value suddenly degrading to less than 1% essentially overnight(e.g. in less than a week). I guess here is where I disagree with lots of BTC proponents - I don&#x27;t see it as &quot;independent&quot; of anything, certainly not of big nation-states. I don&#x27;t see what would persuade people to continue to assign value to BTC in the face of events like those presented in the article.<p>[+] Do note that I do not accept it is &quot;currency&quot; - because it has low acceptability, by design.')
