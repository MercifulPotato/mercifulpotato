However, I think your example is not great and it&#x27;s pretty representative of what I&#x27;ve seen many people who prefer vim use.<p>To me, writing code is a relatively minor part of software development, so auto-complete and such are nice to have features, but not crucial. Dumb auto-complete is absolutely good enough, even for Java.<p>Reading code, especially navigation and analysis, is a much greater part of the day to day experience that I for one have, and here grep is so inferior to code analysis tools that I really don&#x27;t understand how people can use it.<p>Note that I am currently an Emacs user (company won&#x27;t pay for GoLand), but the extra value added by lsp-mode is maybe a quarter of my productivity.')
