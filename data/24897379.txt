Only allow Wayland to take the screenshots, but <i>support</i> that, make it <i>easy</i>, and you won&#x27;t need to worry about either the security model or users complaining.<p>I mean, this is the way other OSes do it...to the best of my knowledge (which is certainly not comprehensive) neither Windows nor macOS allow arbitrary apps to screenshot arbitrary portions of the screen; that&#x27;s handled by the OS itself.')
