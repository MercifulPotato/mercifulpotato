If I were sick is the only remotely common case where I’ll order delivery.<p>Even there, I’m perfectly capable to call my local restaurant. If someone ends up dominating this field, it’ll be because the local restaurants gave up an enormous advantage they started with.<p>I don’t see any amount of “optimized route planning” that’s going to get customers food that’s sat around less, tastes better, or costs less which are the only things I can see durably disrupting the “I give you money and you give me food” market.')
