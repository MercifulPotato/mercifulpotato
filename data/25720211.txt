Usually true facts aren&#x27;t sufficient, and most fabulists throw in additional false elements, some entirely fabricated, some subtly twisted.<p>The effort involved in separating truth from bullshit <i>from someone fundamentally indifferent to truth</i> is too high.<p>If there <i>is</i> in fact truth to be had, there will virtually always be a credible source from whom it can be obtained.<p>In Dante&#x27;s Hell, it was bearers of false witness who occupied the penultimate circle.')
