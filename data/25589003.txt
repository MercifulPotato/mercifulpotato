Never had any problems. Flash player compat wasn&#x27;t perfect but it was more than enough to create vibrant scenes like Kongregate, Newgrounds, and ArmorGames. Anecdotal sure, but it was good enough for the scene to exist.<p>The main thing about the single-file thing is that it afforded the flash portal ecosystem. It was really easy to share your work as a creator without a lot of technical experience.<p>&gt; but if you send someone a link to a canvas-based animation, they are more likely to be able to play it today than they ever were in the days of Flash. They can even play it on mobile.<p>Yeah but the problem is creating that canvas-based animation is insane, so there aren&#x27;t any canvas-based animations, compared to the output of flash cartoons.<p>Nowadays everybody bakes out their animations to 100x the size with compression artifacts and stick them on Youtube with LESS features than flash had, a direct consequence of the decline of Flash and HTML5&#x27;s inability as a platform stack to fill the gap.<p>I love Linux and the open web, I&#x27;m glad they exist and I want things to work on them. I just wish HTML5 as a platform had actually delivered on its promises by not missing the forest for the trees.')
