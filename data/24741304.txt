A reasonably smart student picks up how to work git in a few evenings with some online tutorial and some open source project. Or just when doing their homework.<p>In fact, a proper theoretical foundation makes this really easy. Graph theory and algebra will have taught them about DAGs and partial order, which is what git branches are. A crypto class will have taught them about hashes and signatures. Distributed systems class will have taught them about issues with synchronisation. With all that background it doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s git or whatever system will be en vogue in 10 years.<p>Imagine a student having learnt CVS 20 years ago at university. Completely useless knowledge today. But the same student with the above fundamentals will pick up git in no time. <i>That&#x27;s</i> what universities are for.')
