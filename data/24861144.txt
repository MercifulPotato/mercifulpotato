But here&#x27;s my take:<p>To some degree, wealth taxes break down the idea of private property ownership.  &quot;Your right of ownership is secured by law, but if you own <i>too much</i>, we&#x27;ll take some of it away.&quot;  I know that&#x27;s not the way it&#x27;s sold.  But that is one aspect of the reality of it.  I am in favor of the continued existence of private property rights, and for that reason I don&#x27;t like a wealth tax.<p>Also, such things tend to grow with time.  You&#x27;re going to tax those with more than a billion dollars?  Seems OK, no relevance to me, and those people can afford it.  You need more money this year, and you&#x27;re going to tax those with more than 10 million?  Well, I don&#x27;t have that, either, but it&#x27;s getting closer.  Need still more money, and so you&#x27;re moving it to a million?  I might, by then, especially if inflation kicks back up.<p>On the other hand, you could make a reasonable case that the existence of a wealth disparity of the magnitude that exists today is a threat to our society, especially if it can be inherited.<p>So I lean against a wealth tax, but I can also see reasons for it...')
