I’d imagine the premiums would be super low for such a high deductible.<p>Even the high deductible plans I’ve seen are no more than $3500&#x2F;single or $7k family per year out of pocket max. And those allow you and your employer to put money into a high deductible savings account pre-tax like a retirement account. And it can be used for any qualified health payment for the rest of your life and is passed down upon death. It’s really like a 401k for health payments.')
