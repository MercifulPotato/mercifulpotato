It plays files, supports all the container formats and codecs you are likely to come across both for audio and video.<p>I sometimes reach for VLC still, but mpv is and has been my go to player for most casual video playback for years now.<p>The UI pretty much consists of video playback plus an auto-hiding timeline overlay. On the timeline overlay you can also select which subtitle to show as well as turn subtitles on&#x2F;off.<p>You can install it on macOS with<p><pre><code>  brew cask install mpv\n</code></pre>\nassuming you have Homebrew installed')
