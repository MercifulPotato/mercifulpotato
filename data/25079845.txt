Even more so the older and less active you are<p>- Read the labels and do basic math. A lethal dose of common OTC medicine is not that hard to obtain as well, are you going to ask a doctor how many Tylenols to take or are you going to read the label?<p>- Sure, if you&#x27;re insecure go to the doctor and get it checked.

Yeah you don&#x27;t need to keep cranking high doses every day, the buffer lasts long. In fact for some people 10kIU should be good for a week. Review your dose, test your levels if you&#x27;re taking a high dose for a long time.<p>In all those &quot;Vit D overdose&quot; stories there&#x27;s someone doing something blatantly stupid for a long time OR (for the benefit of the doubt) they might have some other unknown problem or contributing factor.')
