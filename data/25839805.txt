I suspect there isn&#x27;t or at best very limited. It goes like this:<p>1. MPA sends a notice, content is taken down&#x2F;disabled<p>2a) No response to takedown notice is sent, because the next step MPA can take after that is to take you to court. If you win the best case scenario is you recover your legal costs (but not the time). Content stays down.<p>2b) A response to takedown notice is sent, content gets restored. MPA doesn&#x27;t go to court, unless it&#x27;s a slam dunk case or it&#x27;s important enough to bully someone into submission with legal costs (you pay those out of your pocket with hope of maybe getting most of it back at some point, possibly years later). Victim doesn&#x27;t go to court for compensation, because it&#x27;s almost certain that even with a resounding win what they recover is going to be less than legal fees.<p>The actual number of cases that see the courtroom is likely very, very small.')
