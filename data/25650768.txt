Apple also still has a near-monopoly on amazing screens. These might seem inconsequential when you scan them on a list, but the entire package really adds up.<p>Anyway, with that all said, the thread in question is about vendors who explicitly support Linux, which is a very different story. If I had to pick anything in that realm that I&#x27;m excited about, it&#x27;s... maybe Purism&#x27;s upcoming Librem 14, mostly due to them trying to do something custom. Relies on them actually shipping it, tho.<p>I remain surprised that System76 hasn&#x27;t done more towards a non-rebranded laptop shell. I really like their desktop offerings, but I&#x27;ve no need for a desktop in my life.')
