Designing single transistor amplifier was almost impossible in most of them. Ridiculous ui, crashes, simple things like changing resistor value and seeing change required 10s of clicks. I ended up designing scheme in caneda, then I made a screenshot and exported netlist. Then I made simple app in lazarus where I put image in the window and added panels atop of each element, when I scrolled mouse above panel it changed that value in netlist by 1% and instantly run netlist in spice and rendered transient chart. No clicking, no switching modes, no dialogs. In hour or so I had amplifier tuned. Doing this in any of those existing programs would take me a month.')
