Every time you install or update, you run the risk of getting a major software update that could break your app or server config.<p>For servers I want predictability - the same software versions over an extended period with just bugfixes &amp; security fixes, and for <i>me</i> to decide when I want to change major versions. Arch doesn&#x27;t make this predictability an option.')
