In particular, states that lack sufficient current wolf populations can protect them within the state (California and the northeast come to mind).<p>Personal bias:  I&#x27;m glad they are part of the ecosystem.  I&#x27;d like to see one sometime, but probably more comfortable while I&#x27;m in a car rather than a tent&#x2F;hiking, though I understand they are still pretty wary of humans.  I do miss seeing the Yellowstone elk herds that have become much more timid since the reintroduction.')
