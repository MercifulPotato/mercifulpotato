And my point, going up to the top of the thread, is that Congress -- and not the Biden administration -- would be the one making this decision. You can get a flavor of what they might do by looking at their past decisions.<p>What you&#x27;re doing instead is hypothesizing without evidence that they&#x27;ll do something that they have demonstrably not opted to do -- and also implying cynically that the partisan makeup and&#x2F;or public pressure on Congress will not change the outcome. This despite the fact that we have months of Congressional action from both parties to examine, and none of it bears out your predictions.')
