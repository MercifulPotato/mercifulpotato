Can you find me one company that provides a similar feature set to Facebook (cross-platform messaging &amp; calling, personal &amp; business pages with unlimited media uploads, groups, marketplace, dating and the network effects of everyone you know already being on it with their real name and no usernames to worry about)?<p>Furthermore, if Facebook stops or tones down paid advertising and unpaid spam&#x2F;clickbait it will be yet another reason for users to prefer <i>them</i> versus the competition.<p>&gt; Facebook&#x27;s users are addicted to the social-media-crack<p>Are they? Facebook users are primarily there for keeping in touch with their friends, and happen to get sucked down the rabbit hole of bullshit by Facebook&#x27;s algorithms which prioritizes engagement. Removing the engagement-generating crap won&#x27;t suddenly remove the need for people to socialize.<p>&gt; many of Facebook&#x27;s customers -- advertisers and propagandists -- want Facebook to continue to modify user behavior on their behalf; and if Facebook stops doing that, those customers will migrate to the competition.<p>These customers want to go where the users are. If Facebook stops advertising but all the users remain (partly <i>because</i> of the lack of advertising), advertisers do not have a magic wand to move people across to another platform where they can advertise, short of paying those people to move (in which case it would be a win-win situation as people would be compensated for their time &amp; attention).')
