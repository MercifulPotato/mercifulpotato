The developers who couldn&#x27;t live with the problems have already quit. The developers who remained have stopped complaining, because they have given up.<p>A new developer comes, notices the problems, and starts complaining about them. People notice that the newbie makes a fuss, but nothing changes. Later the developer either quits, or gets used to it and stops complaining.<p>Here is how the management probably interprets the situation: &quot;People with the least experience complain most. The correct approach is to ignore them, and wait for them to grow up. More experienced developers have realistic expectations and mature behavior.&quot;')
