Mounting evidence suggest our &quot;democracy&quot; is a dog and pony show run by wealthy super villains, morally bankrupt politicians, and single-minded super-corporations.<p>Our best bet is coalesce around each other, the working class, and build a better system of world governance.<p>This will get downvoted but the truth is the US doesn&#x27;t treat us any better.
