I don&#x27;t think anyone would go to that trouble.<p>&gt; Phishing you to get your password and then bribing or social-engineering someone at the phone company to forward your SMS-based 2FA codes to them.<p>Seems unlikely, I never log into my registrar&#x27;s website. I do often have to enter my Google password though!<p>&gt; Waiting for you to forget to renew your domain and then registering it.<p>It&#x27;s auto-renewing.')
