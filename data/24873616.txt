Playing music offline is broken, browsing playlists is insanely slow, and it lacks so many basic features of GPM&#x2F;other services (like actual random shuffle and not a smart radio that plays the same 10 songs). Combining Youtube Likes with the music thumbs up makes no sense - I now have lecture videos that randomly play while trying to shuffle my library (that I guess Youtube somehow mistook as music). Even how it integrates with Google Assistant is terrible compared to the old product.<p>I understand why the switch to the new service was needed, from a license&#x2F;business perspective. But no idea why they can&#x27;t just listen to their users and at least match feature-wise the product it&#x27;s supposed to replace.\nI&#x27;ve lost faith in Google&#x27;s ability to produce software and not just endlessly rebrand things.')
