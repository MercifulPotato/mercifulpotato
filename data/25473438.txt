(Also, there are cases where classic psychotherapy or psychoanalysis methods led to an alleviation or complete disappearance of somatic pain symptoms, even without focusing <i>at all</i> on the symptoms or pain themselves... although it doesn&#x27;t seem ethically appropriate to somehow assume that that would be the best treatment for everyone.)<p>I agree with the concern that this should not be seen as a substitute for helping reduce people&#x27;s suffering with pain medication. But I think we also still have lots to learn about the mental component of pain and potentially identifying psychological interventions that make a difference in this area.<p>I also agree that the &quot;all the pain people experience is in their heads&quot; angle isn&#x27;t a constructive one, both because of its proximity to accusing people of lying or malingering, and because it doesn&#x27;t seem like a helpful summary of any apparently-beneficial psychological techniques.')
