Most &quot;gaming&quot; mice&#x2F;keyboards&#x2F;chairs&#x2F;computers&#x2F;whatever are just decorated and brightly coloured versions of other products with insane markups. Alienware PC&#x27;s are a great example here - The parts in one of those PC&#x27;s can cost around half the cost of what the company actually sells it for. Other peripherals have similar price increases once they&#x27;re branded as a device for gaming rather than office use as they know consumers are willing to pay more. I realize that there are lots of kids who want &quot;gaming&quot; gear (that their parents will pay for) but the PC gaming market is certainly geared towards mid 20&#x27;s&#x2F;30&#x27;s who have the scratch to be able to afford this stuff. Not that these people are stupid or misinformed for doing so, some simply appreciate the aesthetic (even if it&#x27;s something you or me might not particularly like).')
