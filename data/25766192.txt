It covers the nightly nursing care, she has central sleep apnea and can’t yet tolerate a full mask so someone has to watch her at night to make sure she doesn’t forget to breathe. We don’t even have to pay copays for her doctors visits. We get the EOB with the costs paid sometimes and my eyes about pop out of my head at how expensive a week at the children’s hospital is.<p>Surprisingly enough, because I was unemployed the day she was born, even if she hadn’t been disabled  the birth would have been “free” (no out of pocket costs to me or my wife) because neither parent was employed when she was born.')
