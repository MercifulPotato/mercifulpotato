If you experiment on the cutting edge, you will have clunkers and duds, but also break ground every now and then. Or invent something half-finished that a future composer will improve upon.<p>Works that transitioned from Baroque to Classical are often considered clunky by modern standards, but that&#x27;s because they were trying new things. If those pioneers didn&#x27;t experiment, we wouldn&#x27;t have Mozart and Beethoven.  (I do enjoy Baroque though.)<p>Keep experimenting, Mr. Glass!')
