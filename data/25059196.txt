The myth that you can&#x27;t multithread compute in Python is so pervasive that even when we&#x27;re in the middle of a thread specifically about the topic, and right next to my comment where I show hashlib specifically does release the GIL, there&#x27;s <i>still</i> a comment saying that multiple processes are needed for compute parallelism.')
