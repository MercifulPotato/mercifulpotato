The issue will be, and currently mostly is, the effect you see on performance at scale. Small instances don&#x27;t have <i>instantaneous</i> interactions but they&#x27;re still much faster. Here&#x27;s a quick video (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;8ZJrhMZ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;8ZJrhMZ</a>) of a dev instance (slower than prod) with the new feature. Loading of this view feels way faster than the board does.<p>The work I&#x27;m doing is separate from the performance improvements, so hopefully the two initiatives combined will get us a lot closer to what you&#x27;re asking for! Again, we&#x27;ll have to see what it looks like in production at scale, but I&#x27;m optimistic it&#x27;ll be a much better experience.')
