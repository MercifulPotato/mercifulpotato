Well, and the fact that once a consumer product &quot;brand&quot; hits a bump, it gets scooped up for its previous reputation and then stamped on junk.<p>It really is depressing that the internet has not produced some sort of historical tracker of brands (or politicians) and their actual quality and reputation scores.<p>Maybe consumer reports, which probably has more historical data than anyone in this regard, could produce something like this.')
