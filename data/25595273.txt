Item(by='danso', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609438274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25593864, text='I’m admittedly not hardcore enough for most rogue-ish games (Spelunky 2 absolutely wrecks me), but Hades hits the sweet spot for me. The progression over time is nice, but having a wide range of control — e.g. weapon choice and, essentially, god power up choice — is even more welcoming. What’s nice is that a run in which you cede control is just as fun and addicting. And the endgame mechanic of difficulty modifiers is surprisingly robust. Not just options to increase enemies&#x2F;damage by n%, but a few options that drastically change enemy abilties. My biggest complaint is that the game could use more variety and randomness, but 100+ runs of entertainment is pretty solid value.<p>One thing that Hades’s success affirms for me is the importance of story and world-building for players who aren’t just looking for hardcore mechanics and challenge. Klei (makers of Don’t Starve and Mark of the Ninja) created what I think is one of the pinnacles of turn-based strategy in Invisible, Inc [0]. It’s like X-COM except with a single, small squad and no (tactical) RNG. But its fatal flaw was that it ended anti-climactically after 3 in-game days, and Klei’s reasoning was “well it’s meant to be replayed, and you shouldn’t get too attached to your team”<p>Each successful run in Hades can also feel short and anti-climactic, but Supergiant beautifully overcomes that with persistent story&#x2F;dialogue state. Even when the action feels stale I was still happy to grind to move the story and subplots forward.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.klei.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;invisible-inc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.klei.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;invisible-inc</a>')
