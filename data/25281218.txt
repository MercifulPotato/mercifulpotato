We could wait until we have 600 million doses on hand, to limit the crossover time when part of the population is vaccinated and part is not.  But people will be dying every day in the meantime.  But if we start rolling the vaccine out, there will be a significant number of people who will stop wearing a mask as soon as they get the first shot.  And probably a bunch of people who will stop because they figure this means the pandemic is basically over.<p>What I don&#x27;t think is realistic at all is expecting the population as a whole to continue to wear masks until everyone is vaccinated, and then just everyone goes back to normal at once.  Like it or not, this just isn&#x27;t how it will play with most regular people.  People are itching to be done with 2020 and the pandemic, they just gave up their Thanksgiving, they&#x27;re about to give up their Christmas gatherings, it won&#x27;t take much to push people over the edge into throwing up their hands and saying &quot;all done!&quot;')
