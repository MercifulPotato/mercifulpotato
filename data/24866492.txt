And if you want maintain video quality, you&#x27;ll have to choose a pretty good quality setting like crf=24 and this will take a lot of time even on H.264&#x2F;AVC.<p>You are looking at multiple hours (&gt;2) for a 2-hour movie from my experience. One way to reduce this is to spin up a DigitalOcean droplet (a $80 per month droplet) that&#x27;ll give you a lot of processing power, finish your encoding in 2-3 hours,and shut it down. It&#x27;ll save you a lot of headache and time.<p>Not sure I answered your question, but, hope that helped!')
