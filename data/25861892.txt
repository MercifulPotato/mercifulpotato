This drone, and most subsequent drones until fairly recently, was a gunnery target drone.  It&#x27;s job was to be shot down in training, and was only made to fly once (like a drone bee, which dies after mating)  The term &#x27;drone&#x27; implied a single terminal flight until some years later, when it also came to refer to reusable unmanned aircraft in general.')
