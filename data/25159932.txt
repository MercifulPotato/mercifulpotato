Those are legitimate concerns. This vaccine has only been tested for a small number of months. We simply don&#x27;t know whether it is safe long-term and what exact statistical level of safety it has. This is not some quasi-scientific bullshit about energies, these are simple medical facts. We have not been testing them. Testing is the only scientific method that matters.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is saying that we should never sell any vaccine before it has been tested for 100+ years, that&#x27;s obviously impossible. But to ignore obvious concerns is just religious scientifism in the worst possible sense.<p>These are good concerns for any medication.')
