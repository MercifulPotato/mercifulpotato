Most of the super-simple in-order RISC-V cores that are available on github will do. Just put one of them in an FPGA, and you are set up.<p>Most of those CPUs are designed by CS or EE students taking a computer architecture class, so... in a sense... one can argue that defending against Spectre-like attacks is actually super simple: just use a simple CPU design.<p>To actually become vulnerable to Spectre, you need a very complex CPU design, so in the same way, it can be argue, that making a CPU vulnerable to Spectre is actually hard, since it takes a lot of work to create such a CPU design.<p>Now, if what you want is a CPU that&#x27;s both fast and secure, then I&#x27;m sorry to tell you that such thing cannot exist. Those two goals are at tension. You can either get a F1 or a tank, but no vehicle that offers the same amount of protection as a tank is going to  be able to compete against a F1 car, and vice-versa.')
