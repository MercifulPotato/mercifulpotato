If we disapprove of the population of a certain country growing beyond a particular size, would we any happier if that country were to split in two, and for their citizens to then double in number? Or for it to split into four countries, and for its citizens to increase their emissions and living standards to the level of more developed nations. I understand the temptation to pick the world as it is now as a standard by which to measure what countries ought to do in the future, but it&#x27;s terribly easy for a person to do that if they don&#x27;t then have to live in a country which hasn&#x27;t yet reached the living standards of post-industrial society.')
