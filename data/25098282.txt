When they&#x27;re presented with data, it&#x27;s implicit that it <i>must</i> be correct. You <i>must</i> have walked 12,121 steps - not one less or 50 more. It just...<i>knows</i>...right?<p>Yet, the mental anguish of presenting this data and actions&#x2F;consequence that may follow; what decisions to people make upon seeing this information? Do they book a GP appointment because their smartphone says they must?<p>The Covid apps demonstrate this effect beautifully; apparently Bluetooth is such a well designed and implemented protocol people use it to judge whether to stay at home and isolate...As if I would <i>ever</i> trust what a smartphone says, there is not enough evidence and scientific backing to suggest data taken from sensors is even close to being accurate.<p>Yet these apps were flouted as a way to &#x27;help stop the spread&#x27;, &#x27;protect your loved ones&#x27;.<p>We need legislation over any and all health apps, they need to prove their models and presented data is accurate (how the heck can it be? it&#x27;s just a sensor, it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;know&#x27; anything).<p>Easiest solution: turn these apps off, even better if you can: get rid of your smartphone. It&#x27;s become a hostile enemy spy, not in your favor, but prides itself on selling <i>you</i> to anyone who wants it and supports an insidious industry.<p>I&#x27;m getting used to not having mine with me all the time, I no longer use mobile telephony and mentally, it feels <i>amazing</i>.<p>In the future this will be considered a revolution, as today your phone wants to try and determine every faucet of your life...<p>Maybe it can estimate when I am likely to die, based on this &#x27;data&#x27;?<p>That&#x27;d be poetic.')
