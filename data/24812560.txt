That is on us.  Tech is no different.<p>People have been fooled into thinking that just because the platform is a open to anybody, that Twitter&#x2F;FB has to act without bias.  Bias is allowed.  These aren&#x27;t free speech outlets. There is no such thing.  Your rights are not given, by twitter, they are taken, by you.<p>The double standard is that the platforms can both censor content, while at the same time they are not legally responsible for content posted by users.  It should be one or the other.  They have their cake and eat it, and that is why they have so much power.')
