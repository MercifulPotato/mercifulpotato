If you spent $100 to reach your audience, your ROI would be pretty good for the $100. What if you spent $200 for the same audience reach? You still get results, albeit it&#x27;s a bit more expensive now. But still better than other competitors out there because they don&#x27;t have as much granular data about a user as Facebook does. Not even Google has this level of detail (Who are your friends, what you like to eat, What topics you like to chat about, etc.)')
