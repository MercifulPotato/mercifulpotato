If a certain event would cause me pain and that event happens to you, I can feel for you because I sympathize with your pain. This can easily pass as empathy. But if that same event would <i>not</i> cause <i>me</i> pain but it causes <i>you</i> pain, this can be difficult to resolve as it involves theory of mind which is often weak or missing in those with ASD.')
