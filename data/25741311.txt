Maybe it is because Trump is lying, and everyone around him see it.<p>&gt;This is dangerous, and for any healing to happen I think that all Trumps evidence needs to be brought forward and investigated.<p>Healing also requires payment for actions and atonement.<p>What is dangerous is continuing to pander to the whims of a madman who ignores evidence, court cases, the law, and the Constitution, then riles people into attacking the peaceful transfer of power.<p>Everyone else is finally sick of this nonsense - because it&#x27;s not reality, not according to law, and he had plenty of cases to present evidence, but he had none.<p>Trump had zero evidence. He knew it, which is why he didn&#x27;t spend the $200M he raised from his followers on professional election lawyers like both Bush and Gore did in 2000. They knew there was a legitimate case, so they hired proper lawyers.<p>Trump merely kept the money (as it was stated in the fine print of his appeals), ripping off his base again.<p>I get the impression you don&#x27;t want to consider that Trump is  simply wrong and lying to raise money for himself, but that is what the evidence shows.')
