To quote your link:<p><i>Bobulinski’s overarching claim is that Joe Biden was involved in, and may have profited from, his son and brother’s business dealings in China.</i><p>To also quote your link:<p><i>The Wall Street Journal reviewed his documents and found no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden — or that he was active in his family’s foreign business endeavors, as Bobulinski claimed.</i><p>This new investigation is about Hunter&#x27;s tax affairs in China.
