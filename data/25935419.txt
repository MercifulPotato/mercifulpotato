Also, here are two things I find not great with OO style apis:<p>1. Functions with two arguments of your type (or operators). Maybe I want to do Rational.(a + b), or Int.gcd x y, or Set.union s t. In a Java style api I think it looks ugly to write a.add(b) or whatever.<p>2. Mutability can be hidden. If you see a method of an object that returns a value of the same type, you can’t really know whether it is returning a new value of the same type or if it is mutating the type but returning itself to offer you a convenient chaining api. With modules there isn’t so much point in chaining so that case may be more easily hidden.')
