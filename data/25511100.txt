But I still find the idea of a &#x27;realistic&#x27; dystopian sci-fi more potentially compelling than a sugarcoated &#x27;impossible&#x27; utopia because I fundamentally believe it can&#x27;t exist. I cannot conceive of a real utopia in practice, and what someone else may call a utopia I would surely call some sort of nightmare.<p>Refer to Brave New World as a good example of exactly this dynamic.')
