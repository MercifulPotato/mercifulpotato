Anything they contribute to their Apache License branch can be used by Elastic, but not vice versa.<p>This means Elastic can continue to differentiate from Amazon without worry. Amazon however can keep the code they&#x27;ve not contributed back internally, but they could always do that.<p>Perhaps this is simply an image move they don&#x27;t plan to actually enhance or maintain the fork?<p>Also Elastic moving from Apache to (essentially) GPL is not making it closed source. Just as Amazon was within their rights to maintain an internal fork, so is Elastic to move to a GPL model. Demonizing either over business decisions is dumb.')
