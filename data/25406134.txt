I think that having Python is a neat feature.  I have strong opinions about calculators in general, and have owned a wide range of Casio, HP, TI, and even some old&#x2F;niche ones that only real calculator nerds will recognize (like the Sinclair Cambridge and Elektronika Mk52).<p>With that said, we really need to let calculators go- collectors can still get excited for them, but they are a waste of money at schools.  You know what else can do calculations?  The smartphones and computers that practically every student has access to.  There may be some really poor communities where we can&#x27;t assume that a student has access to a computer and it&#x27;s either a $5 calculator or nothing.  But other than those really poor communities, nobody spends ~$100 on a calculator without alread having access to a more powerful computer.  Smartphone penetration is high even in &quot;kind of poor&quot; communities where most people don&#x27;t own a computer.  Learning Python on a calculator is less transferable than learning Python on anything else.  You can get a Python environment on Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS, every flavor of Linux, and probably a dozen other things that I don&#x27;t know about.  Don&#x27;t buy this calculator for any educational reason, buy it because you&#x27;re the calculator equivalent of a sneakerhead.')
