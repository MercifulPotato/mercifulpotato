Item(by='microtherion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604541232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24992887, text='I admit that I&#x27;m guilty of pretty much what I accused those music databases of â€” passing along unvetted secondhand information...<p>But let me try: An ideal data source has a traceable provenience to a reputable authority. E.g.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iswcnet.cisac.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iswcnet.cisac.org</a> is in the business of establishing songwriting royalties.<p>The Discography of American Historical Recordings <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adp.library.ucsb.edu&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;basic&#x2F;search" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adp.library.ucsb.edu&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;basic&#x2F;search</a>\nhas very sound scholarship behind it and documents their sources (usually ledgers kept by the recording studios).<p>The Encylopedic Discography of Cuban Music <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;latinpop.fiu.edu&#x2F;discography.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;latinpop.fiu.edu&#x2F;discography.html</a> seems to be compiled mostly by one scholar, but he seems to have an incredibly detailed knowledge of the field.<p>Musicbrainz, in contrast, is a crowdsourced collection that is a mile wide and an inch deep. Within literally seconds I found a bogus artist entry: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musicbrainz.org&#x2F;artist&#x2F;729f9e2f-c993-40b6-ae20-bd21b24c4402" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musicbrainz.org&#x2F;artist&#x2F;729f9e2f-c993-40b6-ae20-bd21b...</a><p>I&#x27;m willing to bet that the the last album shown for James Carter is not by him: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musicbrainz.org&#x2F;artist&#x2F;a8880ecc-10d8-4492-b17e-02715d160b56" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musicbrainz.org&#x2F;artist&#x2F;a8880ecc-10d8-4492-b17e-02715...</a><p>This one has a typo in 13, and 12 is completely wrong: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musicbrainz.org&#x2F;release&#x2F;81c40619-26b9-421a-906a-4ef054b9c6c0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musicbrainz.org&#x2F;release&#x2F;81c40619-26b9-421a-906a-4ef0...</a><p>And all of this is just a few random checks. To be sure, the sheer volume is not without value to start a search (Quantity has a quality of its own, as they say), but it should probably not be taken as a sole source of authority without a backup source, and one would have to be careful that the backup source did not, in turn, take musicbrainz as its source.')
