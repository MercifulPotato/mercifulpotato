You simply donâ€™t always have the performance&#x2F;power budget for it.&#x27;<p>So by &#x27;general case&#x27; you mean &#x27;every case&#x27;? Because to my mind, those instances you don&#x27;t have the performance&#x2F;power budget for &#x27;it&#x27; are very much special cases, not general ones. It also seems a curious distinction; I mean, Python and Ruby both allow for mutable data, but are quite slow and memory intensive. Haskell doesn&#x27;t allow mutability, but is quite fast, and also surprisingly memory efficient when written well. What languages do you consider to be able to address &#x27;the general case&#x27;?')
