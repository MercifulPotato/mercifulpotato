Developed country with great logistics.&quot;<p>Which I now realise I misread as &quot;Developed <i>in a</i> country&quot; (i.e. Belgium, where it&#x27;s manufactured). An entirely different, erroneous, reading of the sentence.<p>Therefore my comment addressed the nature of cross-channel shipping which authorities I respect have repeatedly warned about.<p>It&#x27;s too late to edit to add that clarification about the misreading. But that&#x27;s what was missed.<p>If the army steps in to provide logistics at a time of national crisis, that&#x27;s great. But it&#x27;s not what I would expect this government to do based on the recent historical evidence: We&#x27;ve been in a national crisis for a while and the government has routinely preferred to neglect public-sector expertise and go private in a vast array of public procurement. Much of it has been highly questionable judgment (ministers awarding contracts to friends with penalty clauses).')
