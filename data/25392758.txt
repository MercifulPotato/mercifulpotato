A significant chunk of the people at risk are also immunocompromised, which means the vaccine will be counter indicated and they rely on the disease not reaching them.<p>In order for the disease not to reach them, you need herd immunity.<p>Also, do you want to have a normal life again? Take the damn vaccine. We won&#x27;t get to looser restrictions without achieving herd immunity, and herd immunity needs 60 percent of people, not the 3 percent at risk.<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll let others get it and be part of the 40 percent who want to have a normal life ASAP but won&#x27;t do anything to contribute to that&quot; is the most selfish shit.')
