(This is a trade publication that wants advertisers for people who want to buy more freight! Demand is a great reason why!)<p>In reality, I&#x27;m almost 100% sure that the real reason for the congestion is referred to in the one sentence from Hapag-Lloyd - which is that port workers in SoCal have been decimated by COVID. The massive spike of COVID cases in Los Angeles County that started ~11&#x2F;1 and really hit hard by 12&#x2F;1 (discussed many places), which has disproportionally impacted both POCs and workers in heavy-labor industries, is certainly impacting the supply of workers to offload and process. I&#x27;ve heard this anecdotally from two friends who run freight forwarding companies in SoCal.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that the logic around shipping ahead to predict a generic increase in consumer spending doesn&#x27;t play out. Planning for a single date (Halloween costumes, Christmas toys) - of course, ship it as close to the deadline as you can, but don&#x27;t f&#x27;ing miss it. But for a rolling, undated, potential increase in spending? In a world of relatively fast manufacturing, ~4 weeks to get your items from the Shenzhen terminal to offloaded in Long Beach, and with storage costs being exponentially higher in the US than in China - it makes zero sense for what will be a diffuse wave (optimistically!) of consumer spending. No major manufacturer&#x2F;retailer produces that far ahead of unproven demand, and no smaller one can afford to do it (and it&#x27;s not like you can get money for this).<p>This is a staffing shortage, pure and simple. It&#x27;s not going to get better for a while.<p>[Added 30min later]<p>BTW, I didn&#x27;t see this before I posted, but Ryan Petersen (CEO of Flexport) shared on Twitter today<p>&quot;Yesterday there were 800 COVID-19 cases amongst the 9,000 ILWU employees who run the port of LA &#x2F; Long Beach. And there was already a backlog of 29 container ships waiting to unload in the port.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;typesfast&#x2F;status&#x2F;1351942493907034112" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;typesfast&#x2F;status&#x2F;1351942493907034112</a>')
