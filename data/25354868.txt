To the extent that the fees cover paying the driver, then it&#x27;s not really fair to &#x27;blame&#x27; the apps for &#x27;gutting&#x27; the restaurant industry. But I have no idea if this is 30% of the fees or 5%.<p>Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not defending the apps and I have literally never used any of them. I just think it&#x27;s not right to spend so much time framing the issue as if the apps are vampires, sucking the industry dry, without analyzing the extent to which the value they provide (actual delivery of the food) accounts for a portion of their fees.')
