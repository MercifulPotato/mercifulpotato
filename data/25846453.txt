With unnecessary proselytizing&#x2F;virtual signalling, implementing features antithetical to their values (Pocket integration, switching to WebExtensions), pursuing wasteful and fruitless endeavors (FirefoxOS), the company has completely strayed from its main focus: building a solid, open, and free browser. I&#x27;m still with them, but I&#x27;d be lying if I don&#x27;t strongly consider moving to Brave every time they come out with actual innovative and exciting features like this.')
