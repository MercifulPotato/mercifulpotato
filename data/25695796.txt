If they felt ignored by the people in power, then it was THEIR people that THEY elected that were ignoring them. And, apparently they were not dissatisfied with them because they by and large voted for them AGAIN in 2020.<p>&gt;then they must genuinely feel that the normal method of registering protest, i.e., voting, has ceased to function for them<p>No, let&#x27;s just call them what they are: sore losers.')
