It&#x27;s a simple and easy to use graphical environment.<p>Package managers help me keep the software fully updated. There is no need to hunt down sites to download new versions and no surprise pop-ups telling me to download and update something. Installing software? It&#x27;s easy.<p>I still remember the last time I installed an Oracle RDBMS locally.<p>My network printer was recognized immediately. I only realized it was automatic because I forgot to set it up on one of the computers and wanted to print. It then popped up with its model name instead of the name I gave it on the other computers.<p>Browsers work. Office suites (online and offline) work (no local MS Office though). Email works. Slack works. Zoom works. Skype works. MS Teams works. Most of the software I interact with is delivered through a web interface and that, obviously, works too.<p>There is, of course, software that doesn&#x27;t run on my OS of choice (this is why I&#x27;m writing this on a Mac, and this is why there is a small Windows box under one of the laptop stands).<p>I&#x27;m not sure what frustration motivated this article.')
