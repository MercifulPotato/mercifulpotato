I understand that the ecosystem is very diverse but even on Windows most new games only officially support Windows 10. If you&#x27;re on 7 for any reason then it&#x27;s your problem if the game doesn&#x27;t work. Similarly if you&#x27;re willing to go down the Linux route developing and deploying only on Ubuntu, for instance, can be regarded as a &quot;single platform&quot;. It&#x27;s my prerogative to use whatever I want on my Linux box but then it&#x27;s my problem to make sure I have all the required components available for my bespoke setup. I haven&#x27;t used Ubuntu in years but give me a &quot;Ubuntu executable&quot; and I&#x27;ll find a way to make it work on my desktop. And if you don&#x27;t want to limit yourself on Ubuntu Valve is now rolling out their &quot;steam runtime containers&quot; which are reproducible environments for developers to target.<p>There are still issues with the drivers, I&#x27;ll give you that. But at least AMD&#x2F;Mesa is moving fast to adopt features. NVIDIA is going to be NVIDIA but at least they are not skimping on implementing OpenGL and Vulkan extensions.')
