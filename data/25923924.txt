Anything that gets in the way of making that feedback loop as tight as possible---devices, tuners, even conscious thought---is a distraction. In hindsight I think she&#x27;s right. Though I too am still a barely endurable amateur, my intonation has improved to the extent that it feels like I have grown a new organ in my brain that connects my ears directly to my fingers.')
