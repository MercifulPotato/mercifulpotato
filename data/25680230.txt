It doesn’t ship products unless they meet a high bar. It never puts schedule first over product quality.<p>Example: original iPad was canceled by Steve Jobs because he didn’t think it was good enough. Instead he had the team enter the Apple phone competition, where it best out the iPod team with its design for the iPhone. Five years later they got to apply all their improvements to make and release a much better iPad.<p>Apple canceled their AirPower charging mat rather than release something that didn’t meet their standards, even after pre-announcing it.<p>When I ran an product development organization, I made it clear that QA wasn’t responsible for our schedules. Sure they needed to test well and quickly to ensure that Product Management had the necessary info to make good release decisions. But their job was journalistic, to fairly and honestly report all issues. It was up to the engineers to find ways to meet quality goals in our schedules.<p>Boeing had test pilots misleading regulators to hide known issues. That’s the exact opposite of a test Organisation should be run.')
