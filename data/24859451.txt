I honestly don&#x27;t see the appeal of nickel.<p>It is sold as &quot;You use this to generate configuration in other formats like JSON&quot;... but why?  Why would I want to use some language other than the target format to configure things?  Why am I making my configuration a 2 step process?  And even if I bought all of those reasons, why wouldn&#x27;t I just use a general purpose language instead?  Why have some esoteric language dialect whose only purpose is... making configuration files?<p>I&#x27;d much rather use Bash, python, perl, javascript, typescript, groovy, Java, kotlin, C++, C, Rust, erlang, php, awk, pascal, go, Nim, Nix, VB, Hax, coffeescript etc. Really, take your pick.  Any well established language seems like a much better approach than something like this.')
