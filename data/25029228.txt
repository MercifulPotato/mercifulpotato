All but one of my relatives also use Android, and this works perfectly. One uses iOS, which doesn&#x27;t allow background uploads, so I get pictures from them months after the event when they happen to have Google Photos open to reminisce, which is annoying for the rest of us, but a potential privacy invasion for them because we all know when they&#x27;re looking at their old photos.<p>For people who use the phone features a lot, the inability of iOS devices to conveniently use Google Voice and similar proxies is a nonstarter.<p>For gamers, the inability of iOS to support Steam Link and Geforce Now is a nonstarter.<p>For people who value privacy, the inability to install apps or get your location without telling Apple is a nonstarter.<p>These are all due to Apple&#x27;s policies. The hardware itself is nice, but because of all the restrictions, it isn&#x27;t very useful.')
