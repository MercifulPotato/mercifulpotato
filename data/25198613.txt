The usual argument around here for not spending any effort in reducing CO2 emissions is that it won&#x27;t matter: as a nation, we&#x27;re so small compared to China and the US that we&#x27;ll make no difference. Therefore, we should sit on our hands and tell the rest of the world to fix the situation while we watch.<p>By your logic (edit: unnecessarily harsh. &quot;by the logic you present here&quot;), everyone else but the absolute largest single CO2 emitting entity shouldn&#x27;t do anything (because there&#x27;s someone who&#x27;s even worse), and that largest one can point back to the others blaming them for not doing anything either.')
