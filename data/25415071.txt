I’ve been here 2.5 years and my faucet clogged about 8 months after I moved in to the house... with blue plastic particles. They have continued to show-up in my faucet filters every since, so it was not a one off incident. I called the county and sent photos, but who knows if that did anything. I’m lucky in that I have always had additional filtration systems for everything I drink.<p>Edit: Jackson County, OR.')
