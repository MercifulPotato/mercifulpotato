Check out remote companies.<p>I am working for GitLab, am based in Germany and know that it is possible for Ruby Engineers (our compensation calculator was public until recently, and I think sharing a general range that is public info due to public git history is fine). There are other remote companies who pay similarly well (or even Valley &#x2F; NY salaries).<p>If remote is not your thing, I know that even in Jena engineers can earn a 6 figure salaries, so there are surely jobs in Berlin as well.<p>If you are an Ruby engineer with 10 years experience, many companies will consider senior as well, don’t sell yourself short')
