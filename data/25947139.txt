The world of devops isn&#x27;t entirely simple web apps. Nor does it necessarily run (or can run) in the cloud.<p>There&#x27;s an OSS heroku implementation, dokku I think? If it solves the problem well for what you need then you could just embrace it!<p>The challenge in some of the companies I&#x27;ve been is that the code base is 20~40 years old, there&#x27;s a mix of languages, patterns, approaches and OSes generating value to the business.<p>Standardizing that across 100s of developers across 10s of departments isn&#x27;t an easy task. Refactoring the deployment&#x2F;code to whatever was the best practice of the last year isn&#x27;t a good use of time either. People who wrote some of it left, there&#x27;s no resources, etc.<p>The world of startups is quite straight forward, the world of enterprise software or companies that have a decent number of developers and have been around for a while, not so much...')
