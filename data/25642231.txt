While the livecoding movement focuses on providing solutions for performing music live with code, and making changes on the fly -- I focused on simple song writing (one reason why I wouldn&#x27;t consider Handel an esoteric language).<p>One notable aspect of Handel is the behavior of its procedures, which are called chunks. Each chunk is conceptually a song track and all run chunks (from procedure calls) play at the same time. A run of a chunk can be customized by passing in arguments (ex. chords to use). The bpm, instrument, and loop amount of a run of a chunk can also be optionally set to further customize that run.<p>Open to questions and feedback!')
