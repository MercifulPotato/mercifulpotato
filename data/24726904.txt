Watercooling can absorb a LOT of Joules before the cooling system&#x27;s temperature increases, thus helping in keeping the CPU away from its MaxTemp.<p>Plus when attached to a sizable radiator, watercooling system can release all those energy to the environment faster, thus reducing the effective energy absorbed by the system.')
