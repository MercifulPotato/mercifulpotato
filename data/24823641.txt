Many countries tax world-wide income, but USA is one of the few that taxes your non-US income <i>even if you are not considered a resident for tax purposes</i>. For example, if you are a Canadian expat and notify the CRA, you do not have to file a tax return at all unless you earn income from Canada. However, if you are a US expat, you still must file US taxes each year (and pay the difference between my local taxes vs. what you would have owed in the US).')
