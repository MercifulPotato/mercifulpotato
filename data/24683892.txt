The expectation is that there will be a return on this investment.  Jobs are created or whatever, there&#x27;s future increased tax revenue.  Now you have more money to maintain the old infrastructure and&#x2F;or build new.  The fact that in this case the debt is incurred is at the federal level doesn&#x27;t change the system.
