Seven course meal with wine pairings at Chez TJ in Mountain View when I did my Google on-site interview was definitely worth it.<p>I&#x27;m also in my early 40&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve been working nearly 20 years, I&#x27;m just looking at another 10 years in this job, and I don&#x27;t think I can take it. The being stuck behind a desk for a majority of my waking hours during my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s definitely resonates, and despite my passion for software, I (relatively) recently re-learned just how good physical exertion feels.<p>So yeah, I cut back on a number of things to reduce my monthly burn rate, but I&#x27;m not suffering by any means. If anything, I&#x27;m  happier now with less, and seriously considering if I need to continue working, or maybe I can coastFIRE. The possibility has not escaped me that maybe it&#x27;s just not the right job for me, and perhaps I&#x27;d be better off consulting or even trying micropreneurship, but on a more relaxed schedule.<p>I do wish that when I was laid off in 2001 (my early 20&#x27;s) I had hiked the PCT instead of trying to start a consulting business. Burned through my savings, and I probably would have just as much money at the end of the PCT through-hike, and definitely been happier.')
