It already was this way 10+ years ago at the end of WotLK when I started playing it for a bit.<p>&gt; Blizzard has optimised out the massively multiplayer part of the MMO, and with new &quot;features&quot; like PvP&#x2F;mob scaling they&#x27;ve obsoleted the RPG elements too (leveled up? your character is now weaker!)<p>Argh, that is ugly. Does this mean I can&#x27;t farm old Dungeons&#x2F;Raids and Low-Lvl-Areas on my own anymore? This was quite nice to chill from time to time.')
