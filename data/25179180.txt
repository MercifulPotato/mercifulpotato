The fact that we can&#x27;t verify that experimentally is irrelevant; your model allows it and that means that, in your model, the unique ID of a given black hole&#x27;s mass would <i>not</i> uniquely identify the original pieces of matter that formed it, and therefore would <i>not</i> provide the information that you originally claimed it could provide, in the post of yours that started this subthread.')
