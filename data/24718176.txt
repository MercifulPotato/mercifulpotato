I don&#x27;t have tinnitus or anything related, but I have been diagnosed with TMJD after months of visiting different doctors and therelike. At the end, my dentist had the right idea. There are a lot of factors that come into play. I also think that our bodies are simply not made for this much &quot;sitting time&quot;.<p>Anyhow, I have a &quot;popping&quot; noise when I tilt my head back and forth. I simply learned to live with it. After the last sickness, I also developed a &quot;clogged&quot; feeling in my left ear, with my ear doctor telling me that &quot;everything looks fine.&quot;<p>I also learned to live with this.')
