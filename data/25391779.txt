The god we prayed to didn&#x27;t change from Rome, the Vandals, Byzantium, Arabs, and Turks.<p>The language didn&#x27;t change either. Most people spoke Berber languages for 2000 years. Even now there are towns where you can&#x27;t get by with Arabic well.<p>People of the Maghreb were not second class citizens under Rome. Neither were they under the millenia+ in some places of self-rule.<p>It&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t know the difference between pre-modern invasions and colonization, and it&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t really understand the history of the region, but by god don&#x27;t use that to justify imperialism which killed tens of millions of people.<p>In any case, ask yourself this. Why is it that two Africans became emperors of Rome, but that Africans never led modern European powers, nor were even allowed to vote? Ask yourself that, and you will understand the distinction between the two.<p>Not only that, but almost half of the Maghreb was never even invaded by the Ottomans, and even then it was De Jure, and not De Facto, mostly. Same for the Vandals and the Byzantines.<p>So no, your analysis is incorrect. Additionally, it&#x27;s very well known that pre-modern war was much less bloody.')
