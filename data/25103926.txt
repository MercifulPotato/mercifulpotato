I am referring to minimum viable product here.\nI really tried to avoid using the term blockchain for just that reason :)\nAnd you&#x27;re right, this runs a blockchain inspired Merkle tree to handle transactions and we deal with consensus in the standard blockchain way, longest chain wins.\nIt&#x27;s a custom bit of code, a functional implementation of a blockchain that runs in the browser using the Web Crypto API.<p>That merkle tree is where the file based approach comes in. We export the JSON representation of the tree (can be encrypted down to the authentication module), which can be downloaded from the browser. Then that file becomes our source of truth, IndexedDB knows how to read the data, and our frontend plugs into a reactive fetcher on top of that.<p>So we write to the tree and read from the DB.<p>Now the file is saved, it can be shared and that&#x27;s down to the user to chose how to do that. I don&#x27;t have anything extra built for that at the moment, but I&#x27;ve ran a working prototype of a simple <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dat.foundation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dat.foundation&#x2F;</a> implementation with pretty good success for sharing.<p>I&#x27;ve also got in mind how it could work with services like dropbox and cloud drives as file storage. I figure as long as I&#x27;m not storing anything (I don&#x27;t run a server, DB or cloud functions, just a static vercel site) then it&#x27;s decentralized. Being decentralized to me is about providing just an interface, then allow the user to plug in a suitable storage provider<p>(ps. Sorry, I did post up here but then I removed it - that&#x27;s so much for taking the time to reply)')
