Especially the 80s. Everything was also super expensive. Things crashed all the time, I can remember hitting Save and having a program crash and losing work. Because I saved, so I wouldn&#x27;t lose work. It took so much work to do anything back then. I guess it&#x27;s easy to forget how much everything sucked.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with the central idea here though. I do think something that focuses on simplicity, minimalist elegance, and usability is a nice idea. Though I can&#x27;t imagine many people agree.')
