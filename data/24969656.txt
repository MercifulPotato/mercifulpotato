Utterly dominant, untouchable. But needed to keep making more money. So they bring auto loan financing in house, GMAC. Woot, more money. But they forgot how to make money making cars. So upstarts ate their lunch.<p>It&#x27;s a rough analog. Maybe IBM is closer.<p>The point is Google&#x27;s rolling in cash despite their antipathy towards their end users (note that I did not say &quot;customers&quot;). Which will continue to be fine, until it isn&#x27;t. And then it&#x27;ll be too late.')
