Computers are - apart from nowadays being ubiquitous in many everyday objects - sold as consumer appliances for end users to watch TV and store their personal photos, texts, correspondence and conversations.<p>And even if people stop doing that, computers are also used to do banking and contact government agencies, in many places so much so that they&#x27;re _needed_ to do this, creating a massive lock-in for most people to accomplish everyday tasks.<p>I wonder how many people there&#x27;d be who&#x27;d really have to &quot;do work&quot; on computers if the above wasn&#x27;t the case.')
