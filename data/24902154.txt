In fact, most of the production parsers support this mode. E.g. when you try executing a C++ or Java file, it shows you all the errors at once instead of failing on first parse error. The way it&#x27;s achieved is by constructing a &quot;dummy&quot; AST node (caught up to some delimiter, e.g. semicolon in statements) and continue the parsing process as there would be no any error.')
