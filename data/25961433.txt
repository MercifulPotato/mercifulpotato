Please share some of what you know so the rest of us can learn. None of what you wrote here helps anyone learn—it just puts others down, makes you sound supercilious, and makes the community worse. A comment like this stuck at the top of a thread, letting off fumes and polluting the environment with meta nastiness, is one of the worst things that can happen on HN. No one intends it to happen—I&#x27;m sure you had no such intention, nor did the upvoters, but it&#x27;s the default that we co-create on the internet unless we consciously do otherwise.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment&amp;query=share%20know%20learn%20by:dang" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor...</a><p>If you just pour acid on stuff that you scorn, it may get heavily upvoted because everyone is feeling anger and scorning others is a way to relieve that feeling—but you can&#x27;t pour acid without pouring it on the commons, which is extremely fragile. By getting upvoted, the damage you cause is amplified 1000x. People posting here need to take care of the commons, the same way none of us would pour toxins into a mountain lake, leave campfires burning in a dry forest, or litter in a city park.<p>I totally get how frustrating, nay maddening it is when others are wrong and ignorant on the internet and self-satisfied about it. But being a good citizen on HN means learning to tolerate the pressure and metabolize the irritation this activates in you. Then you can come back to the commons with a response that builds it up—for example with interesting, relevant information—rather than tearing it further apart.<p>Our brains are hard-wired to weight painful impressions—like internet comments that seem dumb or wrong—much more heavily than pleasurable ones, like comments we agree with. This makes it feel like HN is dominated by wrongness and dumbness and meanness to a greater extent than it actually is. We all need to become more aware of this mechanism (especially by observing our own reactions more closely) so we don&#x27;t destroy this place by making the mistake of feeling like it&#x27;s already been destroyed. The truth is that it&#x27;s hovering precariously in between.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment&amp;query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment&amp;query=demons%20by:dang" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;so...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23308098" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23308098</a>')
