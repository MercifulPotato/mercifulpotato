Im mostly putting my surplus on self-improvement classes, sending money to my parents and siblings, and putting some in ETFS and some options contracts and stock shares.<p>Im kinda hesitant to buy more stocks&#x2F;options&#x2F;index funds or buy a new car. The return on investment for fully paying my student loans doesnt look good either.<p>Im curious about what you are doing with your extra income or any interesting things other people are doing')
