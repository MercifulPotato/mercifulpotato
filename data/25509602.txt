Basically she has a complication from a spinal defect that causes breath holding, which some kids hold their breath but a normal kid will just pass out and start breathing again. For her, she needs breaths (usually with an oxygenated bag and mask that we keep at home) to get her to wake back up.<p>The first time we tried to give her breaths at home we had to call an ambulance and she went back to the NICU for another 6 months. She spent the first 9 months of her life there. She’s actually a pretty normal two year old now aside from not being able to walk, and the breath holding.<p>Honestly it’s pretty normal at this point for me and my wife so I’m fairly nonchalant about it. Her rate of breath holding has gone way down since we found medication that makes a huge difference. As she gets older it should happen less as her conscious brain becomes better at overriding her emotions. I do what I need to do and if I didn’t compartmentalize I wouldn’t be able to function day to day.<p>Didn’t really expect to get tone policed on Hacker News though.')
