So if you get a 3% dividend a year, the stock price is dropping by the same amount.<p>I will say, it is easier to quantify that Apple&#x2F;Google&#x2F;other company is in an industry and makes things, and has revenue&#x2F;expense to look at and thats why they are worth xyz today.  I can&#x27;t explain why bitcoin goes up or down.  (other than whale buys a bunch, so the sheep follow)')
