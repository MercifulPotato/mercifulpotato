Item(by='rconti', descendants=None, kids=[24937688], score=None, time=1604015207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24936800, text='The conventional wisdom is this is why products aren&#x27;t typically pre-announced, and why Apple says things like &quot;transition will occur over a period of 2 years&quot; and then actually happens in 6 months, like the Intel transition.  That the new machines will be significantly faster.<p>This commentary was all over every Intel-&gt;ARM thread, until today, when suddenly every comment seemed to be that people were obviously buying Intel Macs to avoid having to buy ARM. Which doesn&#x27;t really make sense -- you can always buy an Intel Mac up to and including the day the ARM machines drop. Probably at a steep discount, too. Probably some time after the ARM machines come out. There&#x27;s no hurry.')
