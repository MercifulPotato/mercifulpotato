Still, we want to be able to deliver new features to my users with confidence. That is what I was thinking a lot of times back in the days when I developed apps for mobile phones.<p>FeatureNinjas serves feature flags from within GitHub repositories. Push changes early onto your main branch and use a flag to enable those changes only for you. When you have finished all the work, start with a rollout. If you work in a team, enable those features first to your colleagues. Then, do a gradual rollout to your users.<p>In contrast to other feature flagging services, FeatureNinjas does not provide a UI. Flags are created and managed using Json in your GitHub repositories. FeatureNinjas will pick up those Json files and serve the flags through a simple API whenever you push changes. Define gradual rollouts, conditions, variables, and more fully in Json. We evaluate flags on our servers. There is no need to include any client library. Therefore, FeatureNinjas will work with any programming language, framework, or tool that supports HTTPS.<p>FeatureNinjas is a GitHub app, which is why it has deep integration into GitHub. It is free now and will cost 15$ per month for organizational accounts starting next year.<p>We&#x27;re just getting started and are looking for feedback and early adopters.')
