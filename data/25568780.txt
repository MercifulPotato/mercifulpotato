Around 2015, a measle epidemics broke out between switzerland and Eastern France. less than 2000 cases, 12 dead and a bit more than a hundred children disabled (the fever was too hot for the brain and they lost cognitive functions). Unluckily, in a school where barely 60% of children where vaccinated, lived a child who survived leukemia. Chemo was part of her treatment, so she never received a vaccine, not by their parent choice btw. I took care of her during my youth camp concellor days so i know she was very carefull with infections and hygiene. Well, anyway, she died from measles.<p>I don&#x27;t care if you don&#x27;t vaccinate your child, but if you don&#x27;t, you should have to remove your child from school or club activities the moment an immunodepressed child enter it. Sorry if not vaccinating your child or yourself will deny you from service, i don&#x27;t care. You have a choice, they don&#x27;t.')
