However, it would shift the class of practically computable problems from being ‘like P’ (but with limits on the runtime and memory usage achievable), to being ‘like P^NP’, P with an NP oracle, which is surprisingly a different complexity class from NP.  At least, that’s what I gather based on Wikipedia and Stack Overflow [1]; I’m not an expert on the subject so I could be mistaken.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2712&#x2F;does-npnp-np" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2712&#x2F;does-npnp-np</a>')
