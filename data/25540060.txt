At least, if you take a degree in philosophy I think you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s very much not like this. In my experience, this approach is much more characteristic of online forum argumentation, and subcultures like new atheism and rationalism. (Case in point: I mean &quot;rationalism&quot; in the LessWrong sense, not the Cartesian sense!) I agree with you that the style is irritating and superficial.')
