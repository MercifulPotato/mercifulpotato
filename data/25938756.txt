In the past couple of years, Quora has lost its charm. I used to visit the site regularly to read up on niche fields, since a lot of experts in those field used to write extensively on the platform.<p>However, since then the product seems to have become progresively worse. The feed is flooded with ads that have no relevance to me, the top answers are by users obviously trying to fish for upvotes and engagement. The UX is equally confusing (Spaces, Voices, Topics?). I&#x27;d really love to see Quora back to its old design and format: a site that aggregates relevant topics, with experts answering questions.<p>How did the product get so bad, and how would you fix it if given a chance?<p>Thanks in advance for your time!')
