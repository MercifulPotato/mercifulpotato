CEC worked with that one but for some reason that I don&#x27;t understand I can&#x27;t get another cable that it works with. I&#x27;ve tried old and new cables, microhdmi-hdmi, hdmi-hdmi with a microhdmi adapter, combinations of the above, but no matter what I can&#x27;t find another cable that CEC works with. Would you happen to have any idea why this would be happening?<p>Also when I switch back to the cable that&#x27;s failing CEC works again. I can&#x27;t explain it. And yes, I have CEC enabled on the TV.')
