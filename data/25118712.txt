Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605571142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118435, text='&gt; I remember thinking “Oh, finally!” I figured the executives would be relieved this information was in-house, delighted that their own people were on it, maybe even mad at me for charging an exorbitant markup on local knowledge. <i>Then I saw the look on their faces as they considered the programmer’s offer. The look wasn’t delight, or even relief, but contempt. The situation suddenly came clear: I was getting paid to save management from the distasteful act of listening to their own employees.</i><p>I wonder if some parallels to this story (listening, <i>without contempt</i>) exist within the sphere of political polarization.')
