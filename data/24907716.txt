I, for the past two years, have been using this specific brand of planner I love that is split panes for  Due and To-Do, so that I can track side-by-side what is due and what I should do. I&#x27;ve tried 100&#x27;s of digital apps, but none seem to be able to do this, or they do not have a longform view to see days ahead i.e. Todoist will only let you set a due date, which places the task on the day it is due with no ability to move it up.<p>Can someone help me find a system I might be missing to organize myself digitally?')
