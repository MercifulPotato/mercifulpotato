It&#x27;s great for small, quick visualizations. But I&#x27;ve more than once reached its limits. For one, anything more complex (e.g. custom axis labels that don&#x27;t overlap) requires you to roll your own implementation, making D3 not much more of a tool than, say, jQuery. Also, because it&#x27;s SVG&#x2F;DOM based, if you have a lot of data, it gets slow quickly. Nonetheless, for anything quick but (at least slightly) out of the ordinary, I&#x27;d pick D3 any time.')
