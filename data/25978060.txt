One of the outrageous comments is asking US persons to get involved in this. This is a direct attack on the sovereignty of India. Anyone questioning this line of thinking is getting flagged. The general consensus seems to be that the Western powers are paragons of justice who can dictate what other countries (note that India is a democracy. Most of these people asking to curb India are mum on the actions of countries like China, Pakistan and even the US.) can do to control protests. Combine this with who can flag the comments, HN is now nothing more than an echo chamber that seems to promote only one kind of narrative.')
