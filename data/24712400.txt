For anyone looking for a longer explanation, page 167 of the textbook [0] has the nugget and some examples:<p>&gt;Every dynamic program has an underlying dag (directed acyclic graph) structure: think of each node as representing a subproblem, and each edge as a precedence constraint on the order in which the subproblems can be tackled.<p>[0] - PDF: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-...</a>')
