What is the &quot;life&quot; of a particular product? Sure I could buy a pair of hiking boots that would last me for my literal lifetime, except that I&#x27;m already 50, and I &quot;hike&quot; a short public trail about once a year.<p>My dad, however, always carries a pocket knife (for fishing purposes), and I&#x27;ve seen them get so much wear, the inside of the blade starts getting worn away from being sharpened so often. What&#x27;s a &quot;lifetime&quot; for someone who sharpens a knife every other week?
