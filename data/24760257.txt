As in it’s not until it’s observed later that both particles instantaneously collapse into a correlated state. But the precise outcome of the observation isn’t determined before they’re separated.<p>My understanding of quantum mechanics is far too limited to really dive into this, but my point isn’t that it enables FTL communication or travel directly.<p>Rather my understanding is that it appears to break our previous assumptions - physicists haven’t yet settled on a way to unify relativity and quantum physics [1] which leaves many possibilities open. We still just don’t know enough to say it’s definitely impossible.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Problem_of_time" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Problem_of_time</a>')
