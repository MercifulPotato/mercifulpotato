Namely that biased models are the result of bad datasets more so than the result of bad algorithms.<p>I don&#x27;t think Yann would disagree that biased datasets is a large systemic issue. How should a person like Yann make his point?<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem to me that Yann and Timnit disagree all that much. They both agree biased datasets is a problem. They both agree it&#x27;s a systemic problem. They both agree it does tremendous harm when these biased models are deployed.<p>I&#x27;m very confused as to why there even could be debate between these two people. I cannot find any meaningful difference in their views.')
