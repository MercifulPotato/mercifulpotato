As with everything, it&#x27;s that they encompass a range of things. Many times people have called conspiracy on something that&#x27;s turned out to be true.<p>It&#x27;s just as anti-science to be extremely sceptical of everything as it is to be extremely susceptible.

And why is the BBC, arbiter of shoddy journalism providing me with guidance on how to do it?')
