Its not a entirely quantity related thing, the ps1 and game boy color had plenty of owners but are climbing up the &quot;retro&quot; side of the price curve. But on the other hand the GameCube is a bit more pricy locally, largely  because no one owned it at the time, but the Wii&#x2F;Switch has brought levels of Nintendo interest that wasn&#x27;t here for non-handhelds in the 90s&#x2F;early 00s.')
