They were using Bitcoin to buy supplies like fertilizer and farm equipment, as well as sell their crops, evading border controls in the process. It was a lot safer and less prone to confiscation than carrying around a bunch of USD cash.<p>Another example is how many porn sites and filesharing sites are also accepting Bitcoin. Eg ManyVids allows you to pay with Bitcoin via Lighting, which transfers the BTC almost instantly for quite low fees. There&#x27;s obvious privacy advantages to that over credit card payments.<p>A non-monetary use-case is my OpenTimestamps protocol, which I was able to recently use to prove a specific DKIM key was used in the past: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;peterktodd&#x2F;status&#x2F;1322270551898030082" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;peterktodd&#x2F;status&#x2F;1322270551898030082</a><p>Though that use-case really just piggy-backs on the financial use-cases - if not for them OpenTimestamps in its current form would not be secure.')
