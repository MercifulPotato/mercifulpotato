Item(by='woofie11', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608866796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25525263, text='It&#x27;s possible, but I&#x27;m skeptical.<p>Giving someone a nice office doesn&#x27;t take all that much. Unpaid &quot;visiting scientist&quot; or &quot;research affiliate&quot; positions aren&#x27;t actually very hard to come by. It doesn&#x27;t take more than one decision maker. I&#x27;ve had similar positions at several schools, mostly as a convenience, and all it takes is one prof to send an email or fill out a one-pager form (depending on the school). Office space is largely a matter of availability. If it&#x27;s scarce in a lab, you&#x27;re not getting it. If it&#x27;s plentiful, well, I&#x27;ve had random offices at universities too.<p>I know plenty of people with such positions at MIT with minimal academic backgrounds. The general arrangement was that a professor wanted something done. Someone was willing to do it for free, usually because it was interesting and fun. Professor signed a form. In one case, this was a random person more-or-less off-the-street (at MIT).<p>Harvard is also broken up into silos; it&#x27;s more like a loose confederation of schools than a unified university. That makes things like this even easier, since only one place needs to agree.<p>Most of Harvard seems to take their motto of veritas pretty seriously, still. That doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t keep secrets -- they do -- but I haven&#x27;t seen them openly lie much. Their corruption is different; it&#x27;s more about building out a political power base.<p>As far as I know -- although this is really quite third hand -- Larry Summers was an explicit, planned takedown. Harvard politics are... complex.')
