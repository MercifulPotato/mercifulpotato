In my country, iPhones that can only run Apple-approved apps account for over half of the installed base for smartphones, as far as I know.<p>That doesn&#x27;t really follow. You&#x27;ve gone from &quot;you can&#x27;t sell software&#x2F;hardware without Windows compatibility&quot; to &quot;in the Apple half of the mobile market, you can only do native apps with Apple&#x27;s blessing&quot;. Apple, even in the phone space, does not have anything like the utter market dominance that Microsoft had; Android is in fact a real option. Likewise, although it <i>is</i> more limited, you can in fact do webapps even on an iPhone without Apple&#x27;s approval.')
