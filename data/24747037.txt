So, why is it all mined in China you might ask, knowing rare earths are distributed all over the world? Specifically because developed nations are not interested in bearing the ecological burden.<p>Solar panels frequently contain cadmium and tellurium, which both have to be mined (see above) and then leech out into the environment [3].<p>Then there&#x27;s the human toll. Nuclear energy ends up with about 1&#x2F;4 as many deaths per TWh generated as wind, 1&#x2F;10 as many as rooftop solar, and 1&#x2F;2 as many as industrial solar. [4]<p>[edit] The <i>nice</i> thing about nuclear waste is that radiation is easy to detect. All you need is a Geiger counter and some lead underpants. Cadmium, tellurium, the run-off from refining rare earths? That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m really scared of.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earth.org&#x2F;rare-earth-mining-has-devastated-chinas-environment&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earth.org&#x2F;rare-earth-mining-has-devastated-chinas-en...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2012&#x2F;aug&#x2F;07&#x2F;china-rare-earth-village-pollution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2012&#x2F;aug&#x2F;07&#x2F;china-ra...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5607867&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5607867&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;safest-sources-of-energy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;safest-sources-of-energy</a>')
