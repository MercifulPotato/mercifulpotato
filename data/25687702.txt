She&#x27;s an average non-college educated white lady in her 80s. She&#x27;s always voted Republican because of abortion. She&#x27;s pretty smart, tech-savvy, maintains a household by her self in a rural area. She&#x27;s probably less prejudiced than your average 80-year old American--insofar as she still thinks its okay to make the occasional off-color joke but doesn&#x27;t object to the mixed relationships that led to her mostly mixed 9 great-grandkids. She doesn&#x27;t believe in QAnon or whatever. She probably reads too much Breitbart, which gives her a skewed belief of what the Democrat policy agenda really is, but a lot of the material these days are just tweets from progressives.<p>The stuff she complained about really highlighted for me how the media isn&#x27;t speaking language she understands anymore. For example:<p>&gt; Universities that advocate equality, discriminate against Asian-Americans in favor of African-Americans.<p>&gt; Some people are held responsible for things that happened before they were born, and other people are not held responsible for what they are doing right now.<p>&gt; $5 billion for border security is too expensive, but $1.5 trillion for “free” health care is not.<p>&gt; If you cheat to get into college you go to prison, but if you cheat to get into the country you go to college for free.<p>&gt; killing murderers is wrong, but killing innocent babies is right.<p>These complaints all rest on completely conventional beliefs and assumptions. Increasingly, folks in news media and liberal policy circles not only don&#x27;t hold any of these beliefs, but can&#x27;t even talk to someone who does. For them, these things are axiomatic, and they can&#x27;t explain their beliefs by reference to universal principles my wife&#x27;s grandma shares. And when she reads a steady stream of their tweets, its alarming for her. When people don&#x27;t share a basic framework of how to see the world, they can&#x27;t trust each other or have meaningful policy discussions.')
