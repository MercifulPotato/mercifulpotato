Looking from this point of view, the hardware and software protocols are correctly assigned, everything is perfectly predictable and normal, and therefore this setup should surprise or astonish no one.<p>At the same time, I have a different point: this approach is definitely NOT in my personal catalogue of ways in which modern shells are interfaced with nowadays. Using an antique VT220 over a breadboard serial adapter is a unique hack, rather than something used every day, and therefore this setup is perfectly capable of surprising and astonishing people.<p>For me, the above two points of view don&#x27;t collide with one another.')
