In the current year though, I think a lot of JP web design is just as modern as western design. The main difference is that there are still a lot of JP sites that just don&#x27;t really update their designs so you find them in the mix without having to dive. It&#x27;s rather refreshing that you can see each of the &quot;eras&quot; of web design with JP sites, and when you visit a rather antiquated one it&#x27;s often still active rather than relegated to a nostalgia piece. The &quot;just don&#x27;t update&quot; thing does get taken a bit far in places though -- at my last job obsolete IE support was basically due to pressure from JP customers.<p>One example of a &quot;web 2.0&quot; era site (and it needs JS to work, so you know it&#x27;s <i>modern</i>): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maidragon.jp&#x2F;2nd&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maidragon.jp&#x2F;2nd&#x2F;</a> Flashy intro, bold non-box outlines of content sections and non-straight (i.e. it&#x27;s slanted) text, animated background, static background element. News link button has character to it, it&#x27;s not just a &lt;button&gt; with default browser styling nor with the standard bootstrap CSS and calling it a day. Clicking it goes to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maidragon.jp&#x2F;news&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maidragon.jp&#x2F;news&#x2F;</a> which has a nice vertical column of main content, though again that so nostalgic (to me) slanted design shows at the top. Viewing the source (direct payload) you can actually read the HTML. It might be wordpress based?<p>For contrast one fully modern, including the &quot;why does it need to be&quot; part, is a site like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sephira-su.fensi.plus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sephira-su.fensi.plus&#x2F;</a> Non-standard TLD, google translate doesn&#x27;t even work -- I think because of shadow dom shenanigans. There&#x27;s a dev blog about that site&#x27;s tech that is readable with google translate though: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cam-inc.co.jp&#x2F;p&#x2F;techblog&#x2F;405653224037549201" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cam-inc.co.jp&#x2F;p&#x2F;techblog&#x2F;405653224037549201</a> (The dev blog and the company&#x27;s home page itself is another modern site, it&#x27;s even updated significantly since I saw it last in March, and they blog about other modern tech.) The backend of Fensi is microservices, content served in a &quot;headless CMS&quot; style, the front-end is built as a re-usable theme with web components (LitElement framework) making use of shadow dom...<p>In summary, there&#x27;s plenty of modern web design going on in Japan, and just like here there&#x27;s probably too much.')
