Take for example a sunny day in a well lit room the reduced contrast would make things _harder_ to read. So light mode wins there. Inverse that at night (typically). For me the low contrast of the text and the background is harder to read than HN&#x27;s default.<p>I happen to like the density of information on HN versus the increased whitespace too. HN is compact but not too compact (for my tastes).<p>It&#x27;s contextual, I&#x27;d recommend putting forth your work next time as an alternative and not _the alternative_.')
