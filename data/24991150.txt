Item(by='paxys', descendants=None, kids=[24991772], score=None, time=1604511351, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24990376, text='&quot;Rich tech workers&quot; live everywhere in the city, and all the most expensive neighborhoods (Pac Heights, Presidio, Russian Hill, Nob Hill, Ashbury) actually all voted no.<p>My takeaway is that neighborhoods without access to public transit and where people still need to commute to work voted yes.')
