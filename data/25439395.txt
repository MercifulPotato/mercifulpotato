Item(by='sellyme', descendants=None, kids=[25439590], score=None, time=1608096282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25439319, text='&gt;  Is the value of a future life worth less than a life closer to our present moment? I can’t help but feel like there’s some sort of logical fallacy there, akin to speciesism<p>I think taking the perspective of &quot;the present&quot; is a bit misleading here. Putting $100 in my bank account today isn&#x27;t more valuable than putting $100 in my bank account in 5 years because it&#x27;s closer to the present, it&#x27;s more valuable because it&#x27;ll start collecting interest sooner, and then that interest generates more interest. Putting $100 in there a century ago would be better than either.<p>A live saved now can get to work on adding value to society, and that value could lead to saving more lives later. The sooner you start that process the better.')
