How does this affect Bitcoin? In my opinion it would send it to the moon.  When Tether is exited, where will it be exited to? Not the USD, maybe some into alt coins or USDC, but mostly into Bitcoin.  Tether is scammy indeed, but it doesn&#x27;t change the scarcity of Bitcoin, and the fact that there is still a huge demand and a constant supply for BTC.')
