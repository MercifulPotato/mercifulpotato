Yes, broad forces are responsible for what would be the long-term equilibrium if conditions were static. Conditions change fast enough that the conditions which set the long-term equilibrium don&#x27;t determine the actual Overton Window, or even consistently the short-term direction of change, though they are part of the context which influences change.')
