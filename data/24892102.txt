Those in turn affect banks and their own ability to generate loans, themselves much of the total money supply.<p>When market value of these assets falls dramatically, it has ramifications across the financial system.  The 2007--2008 global financial crisis was the result of a prior crash in real estate valuations.  Japan&#x27;s Lost Decade (1991--2001) was the result of its own real estate-inflated asset bubble collapse.

Money available for business investment (already constraind) will further contract.<p>Additionally, for many people, lacking a defined benefit pension, real estate is a major component of household asset portfolios.<p>Whilst real estate asset inflation is highly problematic, and is <i>not</i> a contributor to economic growth, sudden collapse is tremendously disruptive.  And very much a concern of the Fed.<p>Of course, special interest intervention may be another factor in decisionmaking, though there&#x27;s ample reason for interest without any such.')
