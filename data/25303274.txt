You could obviously make that configuration on the server side, but then you&#x27;re still needing to roll out both the service&#x27;s configuration changes and the database, when if you put all the logic in the service, you only need to handle that for the service.<p>I don&#x27;t mind abstracting the views into another mental layer, but it&#x27;s a harder sell to convince me that reduces a ton of risk because doing operations on the database (even if you have a perfect permission setup) is risky, because you can, by definition, impact that machine that&#x27;s serving live customers.')
