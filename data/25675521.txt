On the flip side of that, in areas where the technology and behaviors are mature, it is totally plausible to achieve 100 year lifespans.  As an example, I have some woodworking planes that are approaching 100 years which are pretty much the same as what you can buy new today.  As another extreme example, the U2 and B-52 planes are over 65 years old and still in active use as they receive updates to meet changes in their customers needs.')
