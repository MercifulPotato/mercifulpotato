Presumably you&#x27;re counting your digestive tract as a hole from the mouth to the anus.  But by virtue of me being able to hold my farts in, my anus is airtight.  I don&#x27;t think that the digestive tract should count as a hole when my anus is in the normal airtight state. I think that normally I&#x27;m a double toroid and I temporarily become a triple toroid when someone pulls my finger.')
