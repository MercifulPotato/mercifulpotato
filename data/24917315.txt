Decreasing the value they get per user.<p>Since Apple knows all the search queries, they can now place the Answer ( Siri ) directly into your Siri Suggestions or Answers from Wiki, Weather, Sports, TV, News etc without ever touching Google.<p>Limiting your exposure to the Web, and Ads directly lower Google revenue.<p>One unintended consequence is that Google tries to increase their revenue in the mist of all that, so they now have even more ads on the search results. Which harms the Web Experience, and more people are turning to Apps.<p>And when people search for Apps on App Store, Guess what Apple does? App Store placement and Ads. ( Genius! ... or not. )<p>$10 per user per year, roughly $10B per year is enough to fund Apple&#x27;s Map and Ax Chip R&amp;D for <i>years</i>. And it is the sole reason why Apple are putting out Services like Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and Apple News+. All of these are very low or nearly <i>zero</i> margin business. While App Store, Google&#x27;s Payment are nearly <i>100%</i> margin. ( Apple only book their 30% cut as their revenue before someone jump in with 70% being paid out as I have seen <i>countless times</i> on HN, Reddit and everywhere else on the web )<p>Without that $10B payment per year from Google, its whole Services Strategy will fail. Also one reason why Apple is pushing the IAP so hard in the recent 12 months. Google&#x27;s payment used to grow as Apple&#x27;s Active Users grow. But I think Apple is projecting a slow down in their Active Users count ( Mac, iPad, iPhone ) so they are starting to push IAP to further increase their Services revenue.')
