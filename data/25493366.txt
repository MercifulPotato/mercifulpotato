Either that or file a charge dispute on the cards website. Most CC&#x27;s these days will reimburse transactions (up to a certain amount) if the dispute falls under what they consider somewhat legit parameters.<p>Anecdotal: \nI used to be a brilliant subscriber myself, albeit one who fell into the annual subscription fin trap. Meaning, I slowly stopped using it and ultimately forgot I had a subscription. So I ended up shamefully charged a full year and a half of non-usage. I thought about disputing it but knowing that it was ultimately on me to have been more responsible my only legit option was to just cancel the subscription and do some proactive checking that I didn&#x27;t get charged again. Which I just did after reading your post. Would love to hear what kind of life hacks other folks do to stay on top of subscriptions (outside the obvious ones which I&#x27;ve already admitted too not doing of course) ;)')
