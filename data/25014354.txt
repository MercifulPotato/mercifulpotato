I mean, if in addition to manager you act as a code reviewer then as a code reviewer you might suggest a name. Or if you are an architect in addition to a manager and you came up with a name for a thing that was your idea, then cool. But if Jim or Jane came up with a thing and named it, global or not, then ideally they have an established process to have that reviewed (like as part of normal code review) and ideally the manager stays out of it unless they are part of that process as a reviewer (not as manager). The reviewer-not-as-manager part is crucial since it establishes trust: you’re saying to your folks they can have that authority at an equal level to you if only they are a code reviewer. Flexing the manager muscle isn’t the right thing there IMO.')
