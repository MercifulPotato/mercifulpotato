They spent years teaching the Chinese, the Chinese would disassemble all molds sent over to China and often break them, so my fathers team would have to fix &#x2F; rebuild them.<p>They spent years training the Chinese side-by-side in the US.<p>In the end they still haven’t exactly caught up to the quality we had in the US. However, they now have 5x the tool &amp; die makers in China.<p>To compete, you really do have to cut minimum wage. You have to loosen regulations, and importantly, you have to do massive tariffs &#x2F; sanctions on China for the next decade.<p>There are enough people still here to teach and expand the Industry. However, if you don’t start now. Like today. We won’t ever recover. Once enough manufacturing is gone, it’ll be impossible to come back - we are almost there.<p>You are competing against a foreign power who uses slaves. You either let free people work for what ever wage they can achieve or we risk becoming slaves ourselves.')
