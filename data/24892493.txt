Item(by='anuragsoni', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603681508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24892354, text='&gt; You are correct that Ocaml has a ref type (though I believe it is actually a special case of a mutable record with one field).\n&gt; There is a small difference between an immutable record of which one property is a reference to changing data and a mutable record where the record itself changes. I prefer the first though I realize this is mostly preference.<p>In OCaml ref is defined as<p><pre><code>  type nonrec &#x27;a ref = &#x27;a ref = { mutable contents : &#x27;a }\n</code></pre>\nso it is an immutable record which contains one item which is mutable.<p>&gt; In any case, the idea of outright changing a formerly mutable structure to an immutable one would be unthinkable in most languages due to all the breakages it is likely to cause.<p>I agree with you. I started using OCaml in 2018 but I believe many linux distributions stayed on OCaml 4.05 (the release before safe-string was default) for a while because of breakages.')
