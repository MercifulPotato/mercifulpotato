(They have blessing rituals etc. they&#x27;re not marrying you)<p>In some places, the Religious Clerics manage it, in others the Civic Cleric, in other places, both.<p>Someone mentioned &#x27;it&#x27;s a legal thing in the US&#x27; - which isn&#x27;t quite right either.<p>A &#x27;marriage contract&#x27; is a civic formalization of the social institution, used in some places wherein the civil state governs the rules about it.<p>Even language such as &#x27;right to be married&#x27; is really misleading: &#x27;the right to have a <i>recognized</i> marriage&#x27; would be more appropriate.<p>Edit: To help your understanding: &#x27;Sweden&#x27; is the formalized  state of the &#x27;Swedish people&#x27; (historically ethnic group). But if there were no formal nation state, the area &#x27;where the Swedes live&#x27; may still be referred to possibly as &#x27;Sweden&#x27; ie a social construct exists without formal recognition. Some aboriginal communities to this use the the term &#x27;Nation&#x27; to describe their people, even with there are no civic formalities involved. The point being &#x27;a Nation&#x27; exists independant of formal recognition, which is a civic construct. Marriages are an ancient kind of social organization and existed long before we developed the civic (or religious) notion of &#x27;law&#x27;.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buddhanet.net&#x2F;funeral.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buddhanet.net&#x2F;funeral.htm</a>')
