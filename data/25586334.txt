Maybe it&#x27;s only something you enforce after you hit a threshold of deliveries per day&#x2F;week or something? Today I can place a single amazon order for multiple small items (think batteries, toilet roll, etc), and there&#x27;s a decent chance they&#x27;ll all come on separate trucks, maybe even from different mail carriers. That doesn&#x27;t feel much different? I can&#x27;t think of too much more beyond a fresh cup of coffee that a drone could deliver that you can&#x27;t already get today with services like UberEats et al. Should my neighbors pay an annoyance fee when they order pizza and the 18 year old delivery guy swings by with his radio on full blast? I&#x27;d love if the answer was yes, but that doesn&#x27;t feel realistic.<p>Re: holding new technology to a higher standard... Sure, but we have to make sure not to disadvantage the new tech so much as to completely prevent adoption. If it costs $50 to get some batteries delivered in the next hour via drone vs $0 on an old ice-powered truck in the next day, we&#x27;ll never move on. Even if we electrify the delivery trucks, they still cause significant wear and tear on local roads, and still pose a hazard to pedestrians (especially kids playing in otherwise quiet residential streets). We should be incentivizing companies and consumers to move away from this as fast as possible in my opinion. Make triple-glazed windows cheaper, invest in quieter drone motor tech, whatever it takes. If we regulated car emissions in the early days like we do today, we might still all be on horses...')
