The amount of paramilitary activity on the left is minimal, especially when compared to the right, adherents of which been caught in several (edit: at least one, Governor Whitmer, I can&#x27;t find evidence of others right now) plots over the past few months to kidnap and even murder Democratic government officials.<p>I&#x27;m not denying that the left has ever used extreme violence in the US. The Weather Underground is the most famous example.
