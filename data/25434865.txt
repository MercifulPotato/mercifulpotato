If you want to make better pictures here are some things that are infinitely more productive to achieve that:<p>- try to do some exercises like trying to move about, compose and visualize your shot before taking the photo,<p>- try another exercise and for 6 months only take a single photo whenever you see an occasion to make photos,<p>- try another exercise and for 6 months only go about with a single primary lens (I have used original Fuji X100 to not be tempted, with great results),<p>- try to learn zone system. Learn to evaluate highlights and shadows and adjust your exposure without any meter. Use it to make pictures <i>you</i> want in lighting with extremely high dynamic range,<p>etc.<p>Camera gear and RAW are just tools and will not make your pictures better.')
