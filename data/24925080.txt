I&#x27;ve certainly seen the usefulness of wireless charging--I&#x27;ve had two tablets power connectors die on me and was saved by wireless charging (HP Touchpad, and Nexus 7 2013 that I still occasionally use)--however, not having a USB port available is massively inconvenient: my Nexus 7 takes ages to charge, and needs to be positioned just right. If I bump it during the night, grab the wrong cable, etc, it falls off and I may not notice. Worse yet, data transfers without the cable are insanely slow; the main reason I got a new tablet was so I could put files on it in the morning (music, video, work, etc) and still leave on time. Wireless data transfer isn&#x27;t just slower than wired, it&#x27;s also massively more battery draining, and the wireless charger can&#x27;t keep up if the screen is on--not that it matters, since you can&#x27;t actually use a wireless charger with a device in your hand anyways.')
