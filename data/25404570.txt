I can&#x27;t imagine naming something &quot;flag&quot; but I can imagine &quot;enabled&quot; or &quot;visible&quot;<p>In my experience it&#x27;s not common to name members&#x2F;properties taking other classes into account so I might have a Window class with &quot;visible&quot; and Shape class also with &quot;visible&quot; and Player class with &quot;visible&quot;. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a project where they made those &quot;someWindow.windowVisible&quot;, &quot;someShape.shapeVisible&quot;, &quot;sompePlayer.playerVisible&quot; just for the sake of searching regardless of if they person is using an IDE that could tell the difference or just notepad&#x2F;nano.<p>All of my experience is they would all be just &quot;someWindow.visible&quot;, &quot;someShape.visible&quot;, &quot;somePlayer.visible&quot;.  In other words, that choice has nothing to do with IDE or no IDE.<p>Is there some other example you were thinking of?')
