But when taxes are high, I see that as an incentive to hide the profits by investing in the future.<p>I know this isn&#x27;t always the case with everyone. And especially investors have a case that higher corporate taxes reduce the value of their investments, possibly to the point of not making them.<p>But this incentive is so blatantly obvious in other cases and so rarely understood. I can only assume that the vast majority of people think businesses are taxed like people. You pay taxes on all of your income. But businesses only pay taxes on their profit. It&#x27;s a big, big difference that changes the incentives.')
