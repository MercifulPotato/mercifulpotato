I blame mostly the language rather then the level. C++ is just a pain in the ass. If you get a low level programming job that uses rust things might be better.<p>Basically at the higher level, when you hit an error it is (generally) much more trivial to solve... not so with C++. With C++ you can hit crashes and not know where it even came from, this is much more rare in higher level languages.<p>I know several people who vehemently hate C++ with a passion and if you&#x27;re going into low level stuff, very likely you&#x27;ll have to deal with C++.')
