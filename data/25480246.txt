I see that as a point of no return. The only sane outcome is, one of the two parties bailing out.<p>BNS doesn&#x27;t mean it only happens between neighbors, just that that&#x27;s what it feels like even if it happens between two parties that are not necessarily neighbors, e.g., two coworkers, two classmates, two CEOs of rival corporations. The list is endless.<p>BNS is the bane of my existence. I&#x27;d do anything to have a life where I&#x27;m not in a BNS match with anyone.')
