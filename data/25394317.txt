Republicans selected an asshole to represent them, and he&#x27;s now lost the election.  He can throw a fit with his lawyers, which will doubtlessly fail, and I fully expect Biden to take the presidency peacefully, as has happened in past American elections.  That&#x27;s the process at work.<p>People telling you that <i>this time</i> it&#x27;s going to be a war or coup are trying to scare you.  In retrospect, you will probably laugh at trump for being such a pathetically poor loser, and laugh at yourself for worrying about it.')
