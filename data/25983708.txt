They listed only long puts in 13F, the max they could lose is the premium they paid. So there must be some other securities that they didn&#x27;t disclose (mostly short calls as @tchanglington mentioned) which resulted in the loss. I was asking if hedgefunds can disclose selectively? If so that can be exploited in so many ways.')
