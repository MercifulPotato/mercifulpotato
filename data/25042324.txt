Nexus1) -&gt; Galaxy Nexus -&gt; Nexus 4 -&gt; Nexus 5 -&gt; Nexus 5X -&gt; Pixel 1 -&gt; Pixel 2 -&gt; Pixel 3 -&gt; ?<p>My favourites where the N4 and P2. The P2 fixed the shitty cameras, and now it looks like finally the P5 will fix the shitty battery life. Can anyone with a P5 comment on how it compares. I&#x27;m glad they finally realized the 4 was a mistake. And from the reviews&#x2F;specs&#x2F;features the 5 seems perfect - but I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;m missing something. I don&#x27;t want to keep changing phones, it just happens because there is always one deal breaker built in.')
