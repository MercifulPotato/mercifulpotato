Just in case it does...<p>It&#x27;s only alluded to in this article, but Clojure has a semi-community-standardised metadata format [0] for indicating how a function should be indented. It isn&#x27;t very impressive, and I&#x27;m not saying this is a solved problem because it isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve never seen well indented lisp code in the way that Python is excellent. But the technical aspects of how to solve it are implemented, the answer is &#x27;add semantic metadata to the functions, have a Well Known Standard for indenting code semantically&#x27;.<p>There is no reason in principle that Clojure couldn&#x27;t have Python-good indenting except nobody seems to have any good ideas for how to format code usefully. Probably a style breakthrough waiting to happen.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.cider.mx&#x2F;cider&#x2F;indent_spec.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.cider.mx&#x2F;cider&#x2F;indent_spec.html</a>')
