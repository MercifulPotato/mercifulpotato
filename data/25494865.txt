I&#x27;m merely talking about the guys who are <i>seen</i> as pros, but might just be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;above average&quot;. They gain the benefit of accumulating a lot of knowledge and experience, while someone with more talent might have made better use of it.<p>I also believe you&#x27;re assuming a little much about organizations, especially in the direction &quot;mediocre perceived as great&quot;. Often, it is also a great developer perceived as mediocre because they don&#x27;t have the skills to sell themselves well. Considering many managers don&#x27;t even have a technical background, let alone a developed one, and how many environments don&#x27;t allow the great developer to shine without playing office politics, I highly question the idea of &quot;organizations will find a way&quot;.<p>Given what you said, despite the difference in perspective, what we are saying doesn&#x27;t differ a lot. I just don&#x27;t believe a developer who avoids politics and tends to hang around to do the dirty work in a large enterprise app can get very far, or at least leaves a lot up to fate (despite maybe having a ton of talent). Nor do I believe &quot;plays office politics well&quot; should be a requirement for someone to be seen as a great developer.')
