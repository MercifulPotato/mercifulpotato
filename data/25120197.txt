Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=[25122292, 25120233], score=None, time=1605586405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25120097, text='&gt;The score is a reduction that&#x27;s intentionally lacking tons of information that defines the essence of a performance.<p>This is precisely part of my point, or would be if you corrected it. The score contains, either implicitly or explicitly, <i>global</i> performance clues that will tell the performer what to do about timing (and if it doesn&#x27;t that&#x27;s because it is expected to come from a conductor or other similar source). It&#x27;s a highly efficient mechanism precisely because it is a global property of the score (or perhaps locally scoped to sections). Much better than providing timing information for every note (as MIDI would do). The MIDI version is an inefficient means of information transfer.<p>BTW, things do not get even crazier with &quot;world music styles like samba&quot;. Samba is an extremely regular groove that is very easy to understand. This is true of most Afro-Cuban derived rhythmic structures - the complexities come from layering a set of very simple patterns. Things do get &quot;even crazier&quot; with rhythmic traditions from Indian, Balinese and some parts of Africa, places where conventional western ways of describing things really don&#x27;t do a good job at all.')
