No Windows user ever asks me for &#x27;tech support&#x27; to get a printer working. But the few Mac users need it all the time.<p>It is so odd to me that setting up a printer on Mac is so much harder for the average user, apparently. My current printer worked by just plugging it into the computer. Windows downloaded the drivers and it all just worked.<p>If your printer is well supported out of the box in CUPS you might do ok, but that does not seem to be that common if your printer is new-ish.')
