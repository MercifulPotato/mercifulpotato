I don&#x27;t take any medication for anxiety&#x2F;depression but I regularly smoke pot and that does wonders for my anxiety.  Of course, for some people pot can have the opposite effect which is why using it to self-medicate is a risky proposition.<p>Honestly my best advice is that, if you aren&#x27;t having a good experience with your psychologist&#x2F;psychiatrist you should find a better one.  I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to be with a therapist who worked well for me as a teenager that I recently started seeing again for my anxiety.  He recommends me to a local outpatient psychiatry department for my ADHD meds so I don&#x27;t have to switch, but I don&#x27;t know how much use the meds would be if I wasn&#x27;t able to talk to him regularly.')
