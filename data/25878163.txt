His is a wooden geodesic, which you can get kits to build starting at $30k or so for a smallish one.  They can be erected in a week by two people with power tools.  They can also be multi-story.<p>$11k is a significant amount of savings, though I’m wondering about the logistics of running plumbing and electricity.  (That might be covered in the video, I’ve seen it before so didn’t watch through again.)<p>I’m in no position to undertake such a project anytime soon—missing the land, time, and funds—but it’s always cool to see it pop up.<p>If you like alternative house styles, and especially this kind of some, you should check out earthships too.  Even higher efficiencies&#x2F;lower carbon footprints, but friends who stayed in one say they haven’t really worked out the bugs yet.<p>In any case, stick frame square housing is a “good enough” idea that we have been treating as “solved” when we really shouldn’t.  In a lot of places, even building a wood-frame dome home requires all kinds of extra paperwork and time investment with codes enforcement because it’s unfamiliar to them.  Not sure how to change that situation.')
