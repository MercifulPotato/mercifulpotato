It’s usually faster to apply a patch over solution than to go and reduce complexity in the existing system. Also the larger the system, the less willingness there is to risk changing something that already exists - technically and politically.<p>As an example, imagine that you have a very slow service. You could dig in and find the bottlenecks, and rewrite the service to remove those bottlenecks. Or you could just add a caching layer on top. The cache layer likely solves the problem quickly, but it adds more complexity to the system overall.')
