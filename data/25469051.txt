Each one (especially outside the context of a cell) requires custom environments to be kept stable. And the processes to manufacture them require other organisms - from which you must now purify that (unstable) protein. And it’s not self-replicating so if you need weekly doses of Ng of material for X doses, you need to produce that much material. RNA solves all of these issues. RNA is a template of common composition that can encode any protein (same chemistry, but in different orders can encode for any arbitrary protein). It can be synthesized in a chemically defined system. And it can persist long enough to produce many generations of proteins. And it can even sometimes be designed to be self replicating. From a theoretical perspective it’s so much better than delivering a custom-purified shot to your blooodstream - different for each virus.<p>The second question is the hard part - delivery. With the advent of ‘gene therapies’ we needed easy to deliver DNA and RNA to living human cells. We’ve come a long way here and have a number of technologies (oftentimes co-opted from viruses) that range from permanent integration into the cell’s genome (lentivirus) to transient (AAV [see Oxford’s vaccine]) to chemical transfection (Pfizer and Moderna). The RNA in these vaccines is chemically more stable than normal RNA, so it will have half-lives of weeks rather than hours inside cells - but it will degrade after a time and the cells will no longer produce the protein.  Proteins in a cell have half-lives of hours to days and even stabilized RNA will be less than a month.  After that the material produced by this &#x27;vaccine&#x27; will be degraded and gone.  However, at that point, the immune system will have permenantly &#x27;encoded&#x27; antibodies for the shape of the produced spike protein.')
