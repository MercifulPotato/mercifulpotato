Rarely does documentation delight me in the sense that I&#x27;d leave feedback. Generally, my interaction with documentation is one of &quot;It works as expected&quot;; &quot;pretty bad but I still managed&quot;; or &quot;bad, didn&#x27;t help, or didn&#x27;t exist&quot;.<p>The thing that has the most effect on my is the last one. That is what will get me to drop a system. The first one &quot;it works as expected&quot; comes with a little but of surprise and delight. But, perhaps paradoxically, even though it surprises me, it still only meets my expectation. With a &#x27;was this helpful&#x27; prompt, I&#x27;d need to click &quot;it was helpful&quot; on every successful search of documentation I ever do. This seems still too unremarkable for me to explicitly mention it was helpful.')
