Each country has contract law like this, with lots of legal precedents on what can and cannot reasonably be expected in certain situations.<p>Part of the reason there are all these terms and conditions documents that nobody reads is to prevent this ambiguity (to a point). Although legally it&#x27;s a bit weak because you cannot really expect people to have agreed to all terms (but it does reverse the burden of proof somewhat, so it&#x27;s still useful).')
