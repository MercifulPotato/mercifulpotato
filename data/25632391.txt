It&#x27;s oh-so-easy to say how things <i>should</i> work when we can conveniently ignore all the other complexities of international diplomacy. All of this is hypothetical. Including, I am not trying to come to a conclusion on Assange in particular, just form opinions on how things ought to work â€” and from there, of course, there <i>will</i> be compromises.<p>---<p>I am imagining a scenario like the UN countries all agreeing on a common standard for extradition.<p>The guiding principle I&#x27;m working off of is that if B and C share the same law against X, then extradition is reasonable. The fuzzy line is where B and C both outlaw X, but each have their own laws against it.<p>On one hand, it is reasonable. If B and C both outlaw murder, then C should extradite the murderer, because the citizen can&#x27;t claim ignorance, nor can they claim that &quot;murder isn&#x27;t illegal here in C.&quot;<p>On the other hand, I have trouble seeing how you&#x27;d write a consistent standard here. Sure, it&#x27;s easy to equivocate premeditated murder across different laws, but what about even manslaughter? Then it requires both countries to have the same definition of negligence, etc.<p>So basically, the only form of extradition treaty that doesn&#x27;t seem to pose an unreasonable burden on tourists is, &quot;Here is a set of laws that are enforced in both B and C. If you break these laws in B and then flee to C (or vice versa), you are still under jurisdiction of the law you broke, so you may be extradited.&quot;<p>In practice, that might look like CHN and KOR signing a treaty that unifies their libel law. Then, if you commit libel against someone in CHN while in KOR, you may be extradited. This is quite reasonable, since a tourist would be expected to learn KOR libel law before travelling there.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ll just note that in your example, if C is just trying to stay neutral and acting of its own accord, then the correct term would be that C would deport the suspect to A rather than extradite the suspect to A, unless A is seeking extradition in its own right.<p>Thanks, edited.')
