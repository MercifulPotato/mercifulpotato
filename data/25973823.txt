It OCRs and pushes them into Evernote.<p>I use PDFPen Pro on Mac to OCR longer documents scanned in using the office scannner&#x2F;printer. This is triggered when I drop a file into a monitored folder. My applescript fires PDFPen, performs OCR and then imports into Evernote.<p>I have another monitored folder to import PDFs that don&#x27;t require OCR (just import into Evernote)<p>And lastly if I get an email with a PDF attachment, I forward it to my special Evernote email address where it&#x27;s automatically imported.<p>The main reason I haven&#x27;t moved away from Evernote is because I want access to my files on all my devices and at any possible moment, and I want the service I use to outlive me. Evernote so far hasn&#x27;t failed on either of these promises (though the latter does possibly worry me)')
