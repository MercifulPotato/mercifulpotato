I like Polar for reading, storing, and annotating them - but I&#x27;m considering moving away from it. I also use Zotero for storing meta data about the papers because it has a really great automatic meta data retrieval [0]. It&#x27;s also good for searching, sorting and what not based on this info.<p>My current thoughts are to move more to Zotero because it also has some annotation functionality, but primarily use it as an extraction point to then store these annotations&#x2F;notes in plain text or markdown. Which then I&#x27;ll manage with git or something.<p>I&#x27;ve personally realized it&#x27;s more important to me to have my notes about the papers easily accessible (hence plain text in git) than to have PDF annotations stored in an app alongside the PDF. I&#x27;ve also realized this has been a little bit of a shift in how I read, making me more focused on extracting information. Not sure how I feel about this yet.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotero.org&#x2F;support&#x2F;retrieve_pdf_metadata" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zotero.org&#x2F;support&#x2F;retrieve_pdf_metadata</a>')
