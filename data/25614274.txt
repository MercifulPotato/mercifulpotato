By the end of the\ncentury Venice had sixteen opera houses open to the general public.\nInterestingly, as Henry Raynor observes, “The Venetian audience consisted of all social classes” (ibid: 171). Bernard Zelochow argues that\nthis remained the case throughout the next two centuries.<p>By the late eighteenth century and in the nineteenth century the opera\nplayed a preeminent role in the cultural life of Europe. The opera was\nenjoyed and understood by a broad cross-section of urban Europeans\nand Americans.The opera house became the meeting place of all social\nclasses in society. . . . The absence of the concept of a classical repertoire is an index of the popularity and vigor of opera as a mode of\ncommunication and entertainment. (Zelochow, 1993: 262)<p>By the nineteenth century, then, opera was established as a widely available form of popular entertainment consumed by people of all social\nclasses. As Lawrence W. Levine explains, referring specifically to the US\n(but also the case in most of Europe), opera was an integral part of a\nshared public culture, “performed in a variety of settings, [it] enjoyed\ngreat popularity, and [was] shared by a broad segment of the population” (Levine, 1988: 85).<p>For example, on returning to the United States in the late 1860s from England, where he had been American Consul, George Makepeace Towle noted how “Lucretia Borgia and Faust,The Barber of Seville and Don Giovanni are everywhere popular;\nyou may hear their airs in the drawing room and concert halls, as well\nas whistled by the street boys and ground out on the hand organs”\n(quoted in Levine, 1988: 99–100).')
