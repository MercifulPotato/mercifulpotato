It&#x27;s blindingly visible on the web, and half the reason it&#x27;s in such shitty state it is, but it also applies to desktop software. The problem is that for a vendor, application&#x27;s UI and UX are <i>marketing space</i>, and they want total control over &quot;user&#x27;s journey&quot;. For the user, UI&#x2F;UX are things that stand between them and the work they want to get done, so they want it to be effort- and bullshit-free. For non-tech-savvy users this implies &quot;consistent with all other software they use&quot;; for power users, this means &quot;able to be altered or removed&quot; - but both of those viewpoints require vendor to not have the final say about presentation.<p>In context of dark mode, an OS-level control over UI styling is a user-friendly feature. Unfortunately, it got defeated by vendors who want the UI to be their branding space, and now they have to begrudgingly add dark mode themselves.<p>EDIT: see also <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24918296" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24918296</a> upthread, it seems to be a quite accurate description of what will happen if we let the vendor side win.')
