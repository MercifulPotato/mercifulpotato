Camera vs lens - who cares. The lenses and sensors are good enough on these smart phones for their use case. They aren&#x27;t meant to replace pro gear.<p>That&#x27;s why I think smartphones are great. They lower the barrier for taking pretty good pictures. You don&#x27;t have to worry about balancing exposure or figuring out how to merge multiple photos into one - etc. The smartphone does it all for you. It&#x27;s an automated photo editor with some intelligent tricks that are very hard (or impossible) to do on a traditional camera.<p>No one is saying a smartphone is going to replace a pro-camera. If you want to do birding with a 1200mm equivalent, you&#x27;re going to have a hard time doing that with a smartphone. But if you know the limitations (in the same way that all cameras have limitations) then it can do really well in those parameters.. and I find those parameters are more than enough for 90%+ of consumers out there.<p>Most people are fine with zooming with their feet.')
