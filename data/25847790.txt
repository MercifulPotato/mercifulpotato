And this something that is pretty hard to get right.<p>When using Adobe software, there were so many moment such as &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t this work?&quot;, &quot;How do I use this tool?&quot;, &quot;How do I do x?&quot;, &quot;Where is x?&quot; and I had to search for solution. With Affinity however, everything works just as I expect them to and it is very rare for me to actively <i>search</i> for solutions.')
