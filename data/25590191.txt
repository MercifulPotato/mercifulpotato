I personally enjoy in-depth explanations, that does not contradict the fact that there are situations in which pedantry is simply misplaced or even used for the sole purpose of &quot;one upping&quot; each other and not for actual precision, and that is something that can be done just as well on higher levels and among practicioners even. Or it is used in situations where the pedantic correction is not related to the actual subject of the conversation.<p>It is my interpretation that these are the situations the video actually parodies. NOT situations in which a related oversimplification is corrected.<p>To be more precise myself I&#x27;d update my agreement with the OP comment to &quot;I agree that the general sentiment of being pedantic in inappropriate situations is bad, I still enjoyed the facts presented in the video&quot;. Which is what I wanted to convey with my comment. This would also mean that I only partially agree with the OP comment, because I enjoy the facts themselves.')
