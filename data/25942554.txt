Modern cars automatically (most with an option to disable) lock the doors, yes. This is to maintain crash integrity BTW. Not anti-carjacking as many folks seem to assume. But also, it&#x27;s required that the doors mechanically unlock when you use the interior handle.<p>In this case:<p>&gt; That’s because the car’s retractable door handles, which are supposed to “auto-present” when they detect a key fob nearby, malfunctioned and first responders weren’t able to open the doors and save Awan, the suit alleges.<p>It didn&#x27;t matter. Clearly Awan was unconscious or unable to extricate himself. As you said, most cars auto-lock the doors. If the doors were locked (we don&#x27;t know from this article), it wouldn&#x27;t matter if the handles &quot;auto presented&quot; themselves or not. They wouldn&#x27;t be able to open them from outside the car. If the doors were unlocked, well that&#x27;s a different story.')
