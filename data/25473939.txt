I don&#x27;t know the author, but I don&#x27;t see the purpose of this article. There is so much more to C++, and so much more to the computer book publishing industry. The former is hard to capture in one text because it is so radically diverse, the latter floods the market with crap. I really have a problem with articles like this one: paper thin and disposable.')
