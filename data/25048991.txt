I always see side projects at the top of the front page and many of these projects are not making $1k MRR, or even $100 MRR, but they&#x27;re on the front page because everyone knows how difficult it is to make and launch a side project here. I love this community. Yes we have big expectations, yes we all want to do great-things and you see the extremes of that when you see the comments that $1k MRR is not that good. You also see comments that 1000 Inserts Per Second is not that good. It gives you perspective on the amazing people here; who have big dreams and big expectations and I would not want it any other way.')
