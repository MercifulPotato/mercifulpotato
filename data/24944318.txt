Some of it was just fun stuff to setup, and do originally. And since it was unlimited, I did a lot of things that were just fun to do for the heck of it. Once paying actually comes into play, over 90% of the actions I have setup are NOT worth paying for because I hardly ever actually use them in real life. They were just simply fun passive things to set up to show friends&#x2F;family for fun mainly.<p>Example: Making a smart light flash red every-time President Trump tweeted was just a silly goof to setup to show friends. Not something I&#x27;m actually going to pay for. haha')
