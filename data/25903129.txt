The last flight was neat, just seeing it perform the belly flop maneuver. Today we might see it land if there&#x27;s enough pressure in the reserve tanks.<p>What&#x27;s insane about this flight profile is that fuel tanks aren&#x27;t supposed to do this. The flip it does right before it hits the ground makes all the liquid fuel splash around and slosh to one side. So instead, it uses some of the hot gasses from the rocket engine to pre-heat a small amount of fuel and use it to pressurize a small reserve tank that is used to get the engines going. One of the causes of the explosion from the last test was that they ran out of pressure in the fuel tank, causing oxidizer rich combustion which eventually burnt up the engines. So hopefully they tweak the system a little and we get to see a belly flop and a successful landing!')
