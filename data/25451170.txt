They just asked if the case was any good or not.<p>Since 7 justices said they didn&#x27;t have standing, and the other 2 said it was impossible to grant relief, it&#x27;s pretty clear that the case as a whole was not any good. Using a misleading legal phrase to imply that the case had non-legalese &quot;merit&quot; that the courts chose to ignore is.. misleading.')
