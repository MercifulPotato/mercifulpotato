That&#x27;s working as intended.<p>It&#x27;s sort of an oxymoron to expect to use every C++ or Rust feature in your user-facing ABI and have it be stable.  They are incredibly rich languages, with drastically different notions of &quot;function&quot; than C has (let alone other constructs like data layout)')
