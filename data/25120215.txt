I want Kubernetes even in a single node scenario because I want Kubernetes-like packaging, deployment and network services for any app I work on, as they are a net simplification of what was previously an ad-hoc world of init scripts, language-specific supervisors, logging, monitoring, etc etc., and rearchitecting an app deployment from scratch simply because its resource requirements increased.<p>If people want to continue trying to scale it down further, where is the harm in this? There are plenty of legitimate cases where it makes sense. There&#x27;s no real limit to that work either, it&#x27;s conceivable with the right implementation improvements (in k8s and the container runtime), it might eventually be possible to reuse the same deployment model even for extremely small devices.')
