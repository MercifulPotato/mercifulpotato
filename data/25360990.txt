I&#x27;m on Thunderbird 68 and the latest release seems to be 78. I think I only need the features of Thunderbird from 15 years ago, so that&#x27;s ok.<p>VLC is 3.0.9.2 and GIMP is 2.10.18. No Kdeenlive, Darktable and Minecraft. I&#x27;m using KeePassX (not XC) version 2.0.3.<p>Of course I would install snaps if I absolutely needed an app distributed only as snap but I&#x27;d rather use debs.')
