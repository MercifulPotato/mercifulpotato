Complaining about public healthcare almost seems like it&#x27;s a national sport, and it&#x27;s true that you can get shorter queues and faster response in non-emergency cases if you go private, but the quality of public healthcare as a whole still doesn&#x27;t suck, and especially emergency care and treatment for serious conditions is still pretty good.<p>Doctors get paid less than e.g. in the U.S., but they&#x27;re still among the most well-paid professions.<p>What I think leads to disaster is if funding to public healthcare is poor <i>and</i> the quality is low, which leads to people not appreciating the service and thus towards further devaluation of the public system, which becomes a vicious cycle.<p>It may also make sense to not have healthcare entirely free so that people don&#x27;t start going to see a doctor <i>too</i> easily for reasons not requiring a doctor, but I think a system where it&#x27;s potentially way too expensive does at least as much damage.<p>I don&#x27;t claim to know what happened in your country of birth, but there could be factors other than just free healthcare.')
