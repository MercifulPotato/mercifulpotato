I figure I lose the money and not make rent, just as if I&#x27;d done nothing, or it makes the money back and then some, and I&#x27;m able to cover another month. If I&#x27;d sold about a week into holding, I&#x27;d have made ~50%. Then our Fed Chairman made the totally sane and not completely unprecedented decision to pump $2 trillion dollars into the economy. The underlying stock shot up and my options values evaporated overnight, amidst the issuing corporation announcing that all of its revenue streams would be effectively dead for the foreseeable future.<p>Just sensible market behavior.')
