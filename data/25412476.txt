There&#x27;s no big difference between a Toyota Yaris, a Honda Fit, a Kia Rio, a Ford Fiesta, and similar cars from every other brand.<p>They&#x27;re all within a few hundred bucks of $15k. They all cost do the same thing, cost the same to produce, and I imagine the margins are razor-thin. If any of the brand could lower prices by $500, they&#x27;d own the market.<p>Tesla sells a unique product, with unique technologies.<p>If Tesla has 5% of the market, but 10x the margins of its competitors, which doesn&#x27;t seem an unlikely outcome:<p>1) Its profits will be roughly 1&#x2F;3 of the total profits of the whole market<p>2) It will be much more stable. Razor-thin margins mean companies go bankrupt with even minor instability. If Ford&#x27;s costs rise by 5%, it&#x27;s dead. If Tesla&#x27;s costs go up 5%, it&#x27;s a almost a rounding error.<p>I think the key question is whether Tesla can execute, but right now, things look promising, although far from certain.')
