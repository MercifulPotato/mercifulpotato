It changed the reward profile away from inventing cool new stuff towards lowest-common-denominator monetisation.<p>The real change was the change in the culture of computer use from original creation to consumption and distribution of certain limited kinds of creation - which are mostly imitative, nostalgic, and either backwards- or (at best) sideways-looking rather than genuinely original.<p>Real invention is now actively disfavoured. Google did a fair amount in the 00s but has slowly abandoned most of it, Amazon does a bit of blue sky but is mostly focussed on consumerism, Musk&#x27;s idea of blue sky is straight out of a 1950s Tom Swift novel, and Facebook and Twitter are both hopeless. Netflix is cable TV done right - finally. But it&#x27;s still cable TV.<p>There are some exceptions at Apple, which still has a kind of legacy tradition of doing cool new stuff (see also, M1) but even that is a mix of invention for the sake of it and strategic lock-in as a goal.<p>The result is a landscape full of development geared to comfortable suburban consumerism and associated corporate bureaucracy. There&#x27;s very little interest in game changing technical development for the sake of it - which was more or less what NeXT was about. And there&#x27;s even less interest in computing as subversion and empowerment, which was - believe it or not - a big interest in the 70s.<p>FOSS doesn&#x27;t change this. (It likes to believe it does, but practically it really doesn&#x27;t.)<p>Quantum computing and AI may be on the cusp - but even if they do something interesting they&#x27;re going to be coopted by ad tech as soon as the paint dries.<p>So it&#x27;s not about technical scope so much as imagination failure. The real loss is the loss of <i>imagination</i> - something that tech and media have both done a lot of damage to over the last couple of decades.')
