They don&#x27;t even care about the law these days (see Uber, AirBnB, Facebook &amp; privacy, etc. etc.)<p>If OSS wants companies to behave in certain ways, it should be encoded in the license that comes with the software, at a minimum.<p>My suggestion would be to have a license that makes the software free to use for anyone and companies with a maximum net profit of (say) $1M. Above this, companies need to negotiate a different (paid) license. This would enable OSS authors to have an income from their work, while not changing anything else about OSS as the price of software is basically pennies for big companies.')
