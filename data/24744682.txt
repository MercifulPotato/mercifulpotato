I have a Pixel 2 XL and was considering OnePlus Nord, but I think I&#x27;m fed up with Android and will buy some model of iPhone 12 as soon as it&#x27;s released. People might say that iPhone is a &quot;luxury item&quot; but for me and surely for many users, not having their phone randomly disconnect with Bluetooth devices&#x2F;restart&#x2F;take literally 5 seconds to launch the camera does not count as &quot;luxury&quot;, but instead is a bare minimum for something you use heavily day-to-day. Therefore spending e.g. 600 euros more is a no brainier especially given the payment can be made over 2 years. I won&#x27;t upgrade my phone every year but 36 months sound about right.<p>By the way the similar logic applied to my laptop and I felt much more at ease and productive after returning to Mac after three years with X1 Carbon + Arch Linux. The cost was easily worth it (the one thing I missed is a proper window manager like Xmonad but I can get by with Amethyst just fine).')
