I don&#x27;t need sunlight in the morning when I&#x27;m commuting to an office with no windows, or even if I&#x27;m working from my home office.<p>&gt; My view is that we already start our workdays too early, particularly when you take commute times into account.<p>Again, this just sounds like some people need to be accommodated for time shifting their work days. There are those of us who naturally wake up with the sunrise, even when we don&#x27;t have to, and getting up when it&#x27;s dark to get to work early is routine for us. Offsetting working shifts by an hour (or more) would also help reduce traffic congestion.<p>ETA: You sound like those people who insist that everyone has to work in an office building because otherwise they will be goofing off at home, neatly ignoring all the water cooler time wasters distracting everyone in the open office by talking about celebrities and sports.<p>Not everyone has children. Not everyone is the same.')
