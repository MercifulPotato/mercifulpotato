Though, I&#x27;ll also say that my experience and expectation from medium articles and SO are different too.  Medium lends itself to more end-to-end stories (here are the steps, combining these 3 libraries, to accomplish this task), whereas SO feels like it&#x27;s more focused (Why does this part of my toolchain break?).  The upvote&#x2F;downvote mechanism also doesn&#x27;t really lend itself to tutorials. I feel like if you wanted tutorials on SO, you&#x27;d want to branch SO itself into a different entity.')
