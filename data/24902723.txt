Both of these groups were just following incentives (both to make money and also just survive in a competitive landscape).<p>On top of that there&#x27;s also two other groups that further complicate the picture: end users and advertisers.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me that we need to go through the motions of trying to persecute one of these groups in particular, since the situation is already evolving. End users are starting to become wise to the ways in which they are manipulated by all three of the other groups, and not necessarily always in a conscious way -- I personally had a turning point where I was just tired of the cycle, it got boring, and I didn&#x27;t even have to try to consciously cut out these things, they just kind of fell away while I spent my time elsewhere.')
