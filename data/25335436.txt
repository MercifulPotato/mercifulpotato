You can do any combination of same die same ram, different die same ram, etc etc.<p>The advantage of GPU having it&#x27;s own memory is you can use super high throughput ram that the GPU needs, while using higher capacity&#x2F;lower energy&#x2F;cheaper ram for the cpu.<p>The downside of using separate ram is that you have to shuttle data back and forth from one ram to the other quite a bit, as well you get less flexibility in how your total memory is used.')
