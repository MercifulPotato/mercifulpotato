(Today&#x27;s marketers would call this AI generated content.)<p>The idea was that your small indie team could keep up with the big content demand since you had algorithms generating seemingly evergreen content for your players.<p>What happens in practice is that the players begin playing your game at a meta level, learning how the generative process itself works; effectively removing the benefit of procgen content. As an example, consider Spelunky which claims it can generate millions of unique caverns to explore. If you assess that claim visually, it&#x27;s true. But watch the streamers play and you will see that they &#x27;speak&#x27; the algorithm. By observing the shape of a cavern in one area of a map, they know the algorithm had to make a specific concession elsewhere in the map. So this content isn&#x27;t really procedural for them anymore.<p>Even if the &quot;AI&quot; content generators get more intelligent, it won&#x27;t free up resources. Mechanically interesting content, as demonstrated by the indie games of the last decade, is just a different form of handmade content. A designer hand made the procgen algorithms. Players ultimately bond with the designer(s), no matter what meta level they build the content at. In a hand-built game you might start to get a sense for where the designers hide treasure chests. In a procgen game you learn the algorithms themselves and how to predict and abuse them.<p>There&#x27;s another form of game content, story content, which remains an edge for humans. Algorithms, or &quot;AI&quot; if you must, can&#x27;t compete here. It would be the same as waiting for AI that can write award winning movie scripts.<p>The marriage of story content and mechanical content is a superior game-making formula to the procgen approach. So the _some point_ you refer to is probaby far away still.')
