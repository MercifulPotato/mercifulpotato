Guess i&#x27;m bored.<p>&gt; Time will no doubt teach us all a lessen.<p>I doubt it. You need to actually have a position that can be shown to be true or false with the passage of time before you can learn something from the passage of time. You have a bizare, logically disconnected, rant that does not make any predictions. I don&#x27;t think any course of events would prove you right (or wrong).<p>&gt; You may want to reevaluate your knowledge about the rest of the world<p>In  context, we were discussing afluent countries, canada europe, etc.<p>&gt; Also, that vaccine probably won&#x27;t cost &quot;just&quot; $40 equally for everyone.<p>They will cost $0 directly. As you say there will be indirect costs based on taxes. However that will be true regardless of if you get the vaccine and be scaled based on your income, so im not sure how you think that applies to your argument sbout class divide.')
