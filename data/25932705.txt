Detroit is full of alleys, the vast majority can no longer be traversed.  As a kid I do remember trash trucks moving along the alley.<p>I also remember a black man with a horse and wagon who bought scrap metal and rags.  He would ring a bell, my Mother didn&#x27;t always have something to sell but she would always come out and visit.  He also acted as a neighborhood sentinel and if he saw a crime being committed he would get someone to call it in.<p>As a young kid we&#x27;d use the alleys as our own private system of trails.  I never saw the city kept them clean but I&#x27;m assuming they did.  Then sometime in the eighties it stopped.  Then a dozen years later they stopped mowing the grass in the city parks.')
