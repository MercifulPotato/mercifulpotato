I’d been thinking through the summer that we need to expand what we do with our money and had been dithering, put together a short list of companies (like kid summer) and slack was one of them. I faffed about, put it off and then last night just decided “you know what, just place some trades and pull the plaster off” so I bought like 50 shares across a handful of companies - I own 3 slack shares so I’m not all that bothered.<p>I’ve risked very little money in my first share purchases - I couldn’t even buy a new low end mountain bike for what I’ve got at risk.')
