I’m not comfortable with commenting on China topics, since (a) there’s a very good chance my comment would be voted to oblivion so no one would see what I wrote anyway (this one was instantly downvoted, then voted back); (b) I would be called a shill; (c) correcting people who use a circlejerk of questionable sources to support opinions about things they have absolutely no experience with yet feel very confident about is both exhausting and mostly pointless. This post is a good example. Zero references, but will be used as fact in the next round of discussions.')
