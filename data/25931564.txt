Basically to get the job, you needed to have a better-than-average knowledge Linux, Apache, and PHP. Because of the wide variety of questions and problems you would come across, you would fill in any gaps very, _very_ quickly. I got to work alongside many excellent people that I still touch base with occasionally to this day.<p>There were two groups that sometimes had it rough, though. From time to time, everyone gets the &quot;fun&quot; of picking up the call from a verbally abusive customer (who you can&#x27;t just hang up on because of company policy) but I really felt bad for the women who had to deal with misogynist pricks. I never got a chance to hear both sides of the conversations but I could tell from the tone in their voices when they had to deal with one of these guys. Along the lines of, &quot;No, I am the only one available right now, how I can I help?&quot; &quot;Sorry, my manager isn&#x27;t around at the moment.&quot; That sort of thing.<p>One particularly egregious case was when some asshole kept calling in because he broke his site and wanted us to fix it. One woman kept picking up the call (by chance) and every time she tried to help him, he demanded to speak to someone else. After the 3rd or 4th time of this, she quit on the spot. My word of advice: If you&#x27;re going to be sexist douchebag, at least have the courtesy to just hang up without saying anything instead of berating the human being on the other end for their crime of having a vagina.<p>The other group I felt bad for was those with non-US accents. Every so often, they would find themselves on a receiving end of an anti-outsourcing tirade from out of our customers. Even though they were sitting in a call center in the middle of a Midwest state.')
