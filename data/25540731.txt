(The iPads also emit a subsonic signal that allows other macs to autojoin the meeting.) Source: I run this setup for a startup.<p>And - well before this request from ZoomPrensence.app - we were weekly rebooting these mac minis via launch daemon. Would continue to do so no matter the specific meeting app - macOS updates often require a reboot.')
