Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605717899, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25138429, text='&gt; You really think that laypersons have any idea of what DKIM is?<p>The layperson doesn&#x27;t have to understand the intricacies of email protocols, it&#x27;s enough that they <i>consider email to be non-repudiable</i>. This is why a copy of an email typically suffices as &quot;proof&quot; of a contract. If you successfully run a campaign to make email repudiable, then laypersons will no longer consider email to be non-repudiable, and emails no longer suffice as &quot;proof&quot; of a contract. If you disagree with something I said here, can you specify which part it is exactly that you disagree with?<p>&gt; You seem to be arguing that the world would be better with non-repudiable email.<p>Yes, the world is better off now, at a time when laypersons consider e-mail to be non-repudiable, compared to a hypothetical future where this is no longer the case.<p>&gt; But then I ask how many disputes have been resolved with DKIM and you have no idea. So basically your argument has zero basis in reality.<p>So if I can&#x27;t give the exact number of times that DKIM has helped in dispute resolution, then my argument &quot;has zero basis in reality&quot;? This doesn&#x27;t make any sense. If I said that &quot;the existence of courts prevents vigilantes&quot;, you could say the same thing: &quot;well what&#x27;s the exact number of times that the existence of courts has prevented vigilanteeism? ha! you don&#x27;t know the exact number! your argument has zero basis in reality then.&quot; We could apply your logic to many other scenarios: what&#x27;s the number of times that existence of guards has prevented prison breaks? What&#x27;s the number of infections prevented by vaccines? We don&#x27;t know the exact numbers for any of these things, and yet we can logicly deduce that courts prevent vigilantes, guards prevent prison breaks, vaccines prevent infections, and DKIM prevents breaking contracts.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re asking for every email user to have non-repudiation enforced unwillingly to them in every email they send so that someone maybe someday may solve some imaginary dispute with Amazon by using DKIM.<p>Laypersons <i>already</i> believe that emails have non-repudiation property. People are free to use secure messengers to communicate privately. When people choose to communicate with email, they are choosing non-repudiation over privacy. You are the one who is asking to change e-mail protocols so that they would work differently than people currently expect. I&#x27;m the one saying e-mail should work like people expect e-mail to work.')
