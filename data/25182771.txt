I don&#x27;t like Bolsonaro but he is very far from having any real power in the country. And I would say the same of Trump. I don&#x27;t know anything about the others.<p>&gt;On your first paragraph it seems to me a reasonable argument that if all the chemical companies in Germany<p>Why would they do that? Hitler was popular because he actually fixed a lot of problems in Germany at the time. Either way, my argument is still that businesses shouldn&#x27;t support or not support any particular politician. They should just move on with their business impartially, even if &quot;democracy&quot; is being threatened or if their product is being used for evil. It&#x27;s not your job to judge how people use your technology.')
