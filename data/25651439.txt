They are (to some extent) competing for donors. If it&#x27;s zero sum, then more marketing spending means the least efficient charities &quot;win&quot;.<p>2. It might even be negative sum, as donors turn away from charity in general.<p>3. A focus on revenue changes the way charities operate, and might change the type of people who work there.<p>I think there&#x27;s a sweet spot to engagement. You don&#x27;t have to send the donor out there, but sending them photos does help. They get the personal connection and the feeling that their money was well spent without needing to waste a lot of money. Obviously it&#x27;s not 100% efficient, but it brings a lot to the table - a certain level of accountability, engagement, and not too much inefficiency.')
