GTX 3090 at 35 TFLOPS is what Apple needs to compete with for Mac Pro. Those chips are reticle limited which means there&#x27;s simply no room to add a CPU, let alone 32 cores. You need separate dies.<p>Also, Xbox uses GDDR which trades off CPU performance for GPU performance. Apple probably wouldn&#x27;t do that for a Mac Pro. The high end needs separate memory so the GPU can have bandwidth and the CPU can have low latency.')
