If it does break up into pieces then you have a slowly dispersing shotgun blast of heavy metals polluting a wide range of orbits. If it doesn&#x27;t, you have one tiny hard-to-track but very massive cannonball lurking out there waiting to strike.<p>The heavier the fragments and the less eccentric the orbit of untracked space junk, the more dangerous it is, because the longer it&#x27;ll be hanging around before it gets close enough to Earth to de-orbit itself.')
