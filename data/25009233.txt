Why can we not agree that single party rule in any city, state, or nation, is simply a recipe for corruption? Look, I&#x27;m a registered republican, but I too would be uncomfortable if literally every office in my state were held by the republicans for decades. Meanwhile, most cities have decades of rule by the same party. Many times the races are not even contested meaningfully.<p>Yes, this is a major problem. One party rule is what we should expect from 3rd world countries like China. Having a single party on the ballot is what I expect from countries like North Korea (which does have voting believe it or not, just with one candidate on the ballot), not America.<p>Why is this idea so resisted? It doesn&#x27;t even mean that we need to elect republicans. We can elect the Greens for all I care. However, there is a huge problem when all political positions are held by people that know the same power brokers, the same political party machine, hold the same ideologies, are unwilling to go against their &#x27;side&#x27;, etc.<p>Oh and BTW, remember that Hacker News is filled with rational, non-biased people &#x2F;s.')
