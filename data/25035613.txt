As an open source (and non-open source too) developer I appreciate every idea of how to improve my app, by fixing a bug or by adding a feature (or even by rewriting my app entirely in a particular language - this is unlikely but may happen to be a good idea occasionally). Surely nobody should rely on the idea I will actually do what they want and when they want but nobody should ever hesitate to tell what they want.')
