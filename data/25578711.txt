A bit oversimplified: Any VASP (virtual asset service provider ~= private business holding, transmitting, issuing or exchanging digital assets on behalf of customers) are expected to request and verify information of wallet holders (the usual KYC&#x2F;AML with name&#x2F;passport&#x2F;etc) for any ingoing and outgoing transfers. They are also expected to send this information onward to any other VASP they transfer to on behalf of users (e.g. if you transfer BTC from your Kraken account to a friends&#x27; Coinbase account, Kraken and Coinbase are on the hook to coordinate this information between each other).<p>In practice, forcing any business that touches digital assets to draconian regulation can be very effective in hampering adoption - IMO we&#x27;ve already seen a similar thing play out where tax requirements for both individuals and businesses coupled with regulatory uncertainty have made it an accounting nightmare to be fully compliant with retail payments in crypto.<p>I don&#x27;t see an outright blanket ban on individuals holding or transacting Bitcoin. But overly restrictive and draconian regulation in some shape or form is very much likely.')
