And the public transport is definitely world class if you can’t bike.<p>However this is very polarizing in France because living space is very costly within the city. And it will not decrease as building any residential space may imply destroying an historical building and disfigure the skyline.\nTherefore, middle and lower class, needed to run a city like this are pushed to live in the suburbs. Where public transport is not as good as in the city center, so people need cars...\nI hope this decision will help find solutions to solve this inextricable problem, which might be the challenge of the decade for the city of love.')
