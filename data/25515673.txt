However, Apple does not use NVIDIA, so that increases the chances for problems on Linux.<p>For the smaller MBPs, with Intel Iris GPUs, the GPU drivers should also have been OK, even a couple of years ago.<p>The greatest chances of problems would have been on MBPs with AMD GPUs. Nevertheless, the AMD drivers have been improving during the last years, so today there should be better chances that they would work OK.')
