Apparently in huge parts of the country you can only choose one single provider? Is that true just in &quot;regional areas&quot; or in suburbs and urban areas too? Are there stats about how much of the population has no choice?<p>Edit: the article gives numbers in terms of how many people have access to broadband (and how many haven&#x27;t) - but what I&#x27;m asking is different - what percentage of the population can connect to one and only one broadband provider, based on their location?')
