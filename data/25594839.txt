Item(by='oftenwrong', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609436211, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25591116, text='The larger problem is that you cannot (AFAICT) edit the markup directly in Confluence or JIRA. I believe this used to be possible, but has been removed in the cloud version, and will die with the server version.<p>The markup you write gets turned into in-editor &quot;objects&quot; (for lack of a better term) as you type it out. This makes editing an incredibly painful experience. I am occasionally asked to document something on Confluence for a client and every time I feel like I am fighting a battle just to make a basic document.<p>For example, I strongly dislike their implementation of ordered list editing. They have tried to make the ordered list editing mode &quot;smart&quot;, but it mostly just gets in the way, and is harder than writing it out manually. Additionally, you cannot embed other &quot;objects&quot; in an ordered list. If you attempt to insert a file object, or something similar, it splits your ordered list into two, with the second list starting its ordering at the beginning. This would seem to defeat the purpose of having a rich editor with embeddable objects, since I cannot use them if I am making an ordered list, such as set of &quot;how to&quot; steps.<p>I usually give up an hour in and switch to writing in my text editor instead, but even then Confluence will mangle my input in surprising ways when I paste it in. Rule #1 of making an editor in my book is that it has to be, at a minimum, as easy and useful as a basic text editor. Microsoft Word and LibreOffice, in spite of their faults, are quite good at this. I would guess most software shops could not implement a WYSIWYG editor at that level of polish, and they would be better off just providing editable markup.')
