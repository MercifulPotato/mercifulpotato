The reasons I switched to Chrome to begin with...<p>- Firefox was slower<p>- Worse, Firefox was <i>laggier</i>, with a drunk feeling when interacting with UI elements<p>- Firefox became increasingly buggy. For about two years it was impossible to use Firefox with a PIV&#x2F;CAC card on Mac (after they broke loading external security modules and before security.osclientcerts.autoload &#x2F; security.enterprise_roots.enabled were stable)<p>- Breaking webpages intentionally with &quot;experiments&quot; (Mr. Robot)<p>- Forcing Pocket down your throat<p>- Other similar user-hostile behavior<p>I&#x27;m glad Firefox is better again, and I&#x27;m glad to be back on it, but it&#x27;s a bit ridiculous to wage war on your users and then wonder why you lose market share.')
