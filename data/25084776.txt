The election is still in progress.  There are allegations of malfeasance and even fraud that need to be investigated and adjudicated.  This has been true in many previous elections.  The rule is to count every legal vote and only legal votes.<p>Once this all plays out, and it will in the near future, then we can determine the &quot;legitimate election result&quot;, per the Electoral College.<p>Should Biden continue to prevail, I&#x27;m not expecting any significant unrest.
