If more RAM means it&#x27;s <i>slower</i> RAM then <i>maybe</i> it can be better to have less of it in some workloads. But otherwise it&#x27;s never better to have less RAM than more RAM. Better memory management can make the <i>impact</i> of less RAM be less severe, but it&#x27;s still unambiguously <i>worse.</i><p>Especially if you have workloads that actually need the RAM like large ML models or editing 8K videos.')
