I find that more difficult to justify for college football, where (in the most generous interpretation) many students are playing unpaid as their only route to getting a (in-name-only) college education.<p>I can&#x27;t see a justification at all for high school or youth football, where it&#x27;s not at all clear that the participants are in a position to consent to the damage they&#x27;re risking on themselves.')
