That isn’t the case at all and shows your bias.<p>The suburb I live in has few tech jobs. In fact it has relatively few jobs at all. Most revenue comes from property taxes. Furthermore, it has shown no interest in attracting tech jobs. It doesn’t even have many fish traps. I think it has two such fish traps for perhaps 50-100 people out of a total population approaching 27000.<p>It seems to be attracting people due to geography, quality of life, and relatively good schools. The number of children has gone up something like 70% in the last 10 years. It was also rated a top 10 small town&#x2F;city in the US.')
