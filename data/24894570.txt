Read more about when we do this.<p>On the phone<p>When you call Samaritans, your number is not displayed to our volunteer. The phones we use don’t have caller display information on them.<p>We might ask your name, because it’s a natural question to ask in a conversation, or because of something you have said to us, but you don’t have to tell us if you prefer not to.<p>Via email<p>If you&#x27;ve emailed us, your email address will not be shown to the volunteer.<p>In person<p>You don’t have to tell us your name if you don’t want to. In the unlikely event that you see the Samaritan volunteer that you spoke to later on the street, the Samaritans volunteer will not acknowledge you, unless you do so first. This is to respect your privacy and the confidentiality of your visit, unless you wish to recognise it.<p>By Letter<p>We will need your name and address to reply, but to maintain confidentiality, your letter will be shredded once we have sent you our response.')
