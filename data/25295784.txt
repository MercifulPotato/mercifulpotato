Item(by='quesera', descendants=None, kids=[25296178], score=None, time=1607032840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294484, text='&gt; CDC specifically states that transmission occurs with prolonged (15+ minutes) contact in close quarters (less than six feet).<p>No, that&#x27;s not correct at all. But if I may take a guess at what you meant to write..<p>Those are guidelines based on estimated inflection points where more time or less distance increases the <i>likelihood</i> of transmission.<p>They are presumed to be good-faith estimates, but they are based on difficult-to-collect data. It&#x27;s probably reasonable to draw the conclusion that, if fully observed, the guidelines would drive R0 below 1.0 and the trendline would follow.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean that <i>no transmission</i> occurs in other situations. People sometimes sneeze unexpectedly. It takes a fraction of a second to put on the mask that prevents that event from becoming risky, or at least uncomfortable. Cheap insurance.<p>It&#x27;s also important to realize that &quot;walking by someone while outside&quot; can take many forms, so it&#x27;s not clear that we&#x27;re all talking about the same thing. Jogging on a narrow path is very different from strolling on a beach.<p>Different measures are appropriate for different cases, but it&#x27;s never <i>harmful</i> to use the mask, it&#x27;s a reasonable habit to get into, and it makes people around you more comfortable. What&#x27;s the trouble?')
