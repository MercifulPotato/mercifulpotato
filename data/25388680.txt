Today I realized, yesterday I apparently threw away the bathroom trash bin with the trash.... (It was upcycled, so no big loss.)<p>Another ADHD compromise: I don&#x27;t use the &quot;eco&quot; soaps (e.g. sugar surfactants) because, their remains are easily feeding algae (the orange one) and I, realistically, won&#x27;t clean my shower every week. (Hope less than a week isn&#x27;t considered the normal XD)<p>Honestly, I feel it&#x27;s really important for ADHD people to allow themselves feeling a little disabled: We mostly endured so much misguided anger and being called lazy and such, it&#x27;s healing to give ourselves that break. We&#x27;re literally killing ourselves (life expectancy; suicide) over keeping up with an outside almost mechanical and estranged to human &quot;nature&quot;. It&#x27;s okay to search for our own pace and only comply with what&#x27;s obligatory and possible.<p>(Not saying therapy and medication aren&#x27;t necessary; not that it&#x27;s all down to modern life.)')
