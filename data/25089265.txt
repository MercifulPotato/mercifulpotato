If Windows is an idea of a &quot;sick joke,&quot; consider how much processing power and capability you&#x27;re leaving on the table. Just losing the first-party GPU driver alone costs you. It costs you more for RAM, for more SSD storage, for higher memory bandwidth. If that&#x27;s worth it for you, great. I&#x27;ll enjoy 128 gb of ram, photoshop loading instantly, and fast compile times thanks.')
