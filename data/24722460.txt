Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=[24722942], score=None, time=1602183364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24722147, text='&gt; What a wonderful advertisement for working at Stripe.<p>Exactly, which is why some of this should be taken with a grain of salt.<p>By all accounts, Stripe really is a good place to work and their success speaks for itself. Yet, it&#x27;s important to remember that this article is at least one part advertisement. I&#x27;m not suggesting anyone dismiss the contents, but keep the context in mind. The article goes to great lengths to speak about the positives of working at Stripe, but the section about terrible work&#x2F;life balance is written vaguely enough for the reader to dismiss it as a personal quirk, for example.')
