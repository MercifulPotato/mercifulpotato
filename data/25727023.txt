I did.<p>The press was happy to castigate Trump for two full years over it - until it just started to show that he was in fact innocent - at least of having colluded with Russians.<p>I hate Donald Trump, he&#x27;s a psychopath who tried to overthrow the Republic in the end - but - he was actually treated unfairly during the Mueller investigation by the press as they banged &#x27;Mueller + Collusion + Russia&#x27; over his head daily.<p>It turns out there were some shenanigans there, but definitely not Trump &amp; Co. working with Russian.<p>The press never really cleared him from that.<p>In a way - Trump&#x27;s mass lies about the current election is just him taking the same story but pushing it right up to the line of legality. Unfortunately, he pushed it way too far, and directing election officials to overthrow valid election results is definitely sedition, and he&#x27;d be in jail were he to note have the status and political protections he has as President. He&#x27;s done much worse than Watergate.')
