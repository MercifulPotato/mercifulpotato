In fact, given how similar react&#x2F;vue&#x2F;svelte are, the tooling makes a big difference.<p>Other than that, I like that vue (ironically) has less magic than svelte. If I wanted to switch over to react, I could just use react+mobx for pretty much the same experience. Vue&#x27;s reactivity is basically very simple observables that I can easily envision in my head. Even though it uses a dsl - there are like 6 directives that I have to remember that are pretty much common to any template engine (i.e. v-for, v-if, etc). Whereas, svelte has a lot more magical syntax that makes it perhaps more pleasant to program in, but not something I am willing to invest in until it becomes more mature.<p>I use the object style for components and really like it because it makes things more explicit and clear. I know svelte is smaller and so it&#x27;s more productive for smaller use cases, but in the long run, I like the more explicit nature for when I am switching between front-end and back-end.<p>Also, vue is a lot easier to integrate incrementally since it does a fair amount of stuff during runtime in contrast to svelte which does the main work at compile time. The latter obviously makes it a little bit faster, but the web environment is slow enough that my other techniques (like lazy loading) are enough to cover for it.')
