As a child, my DPT vaccine was given in the morning and by the afternoon, they had to cut my sleeve off my shirt due to swelling in the arm where I got the injection.  As an adult, even the flu vaccine is something I schedule for a Friday because I know that I will be worthless for a few days.<p>I am two days past my first COVID vaccine dose and still feel lousy, although I can finally lift my arm up ninety degrees now without a lot of pain and the swelling is mostly gone.  I&#x27;m dreading what Dose #2 will do.<p>I know, everyone perkily says &quot;That means your immune system has noticed!&quot; but good grief, I often wish they would make vaccine variants without adjuvants.')
