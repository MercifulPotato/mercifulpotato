And who knows when that will be.<p>In the meantime, I&#x27;m in the process of building my own &quot;alternate prelude&quot; for several R7RS Schemes that chooses the latest SRFI for most of the common features you&#x27;d want (strings, hash tables, console text formatting, etc.) and polyfills them for Schemes that don&#x27;t have them: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ar-nelson&#x2F;schemepunk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ar-nelson&#x2F;schemepunk</a><p>Also, the compatibility story in R7RS is better than you&#x27;d think. The biggest problem is that a lot of R7RS implementations are incomplete and don&#x27;t conform to the standard. For the ones that do, it feels similar to JavaScript in the early 2000s: lots of little inconsistencies, but they can be polyfilled over with enough work. Someone just needs to give it the Crockford treatment and isolate the &quot;good parts&quot; that can be shared between implementations.')
