They would just send both video streams along, and record both sides.<p>Signal does have the capability to have a verification phrase displayed, which is generated from the session key. Reading that off can make the video more difficult to MITM, because then they&#x27;d have to morph the audio to match the phrase, and if it&#x27;s done after the video is setup, morph the video as well. Not impossible, but difficult.')
