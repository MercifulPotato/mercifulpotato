I find these kinds of papers and the general discussion surrounding lock-downs seem to miss this first step.<p>If the goal is to preserve the maximum number of human lives, lock-downs are probably reasonable (particularly since lives saved keeping the highways closed alone meets or exceeds lives saved from COVID) - this logic also would have probably kept it out of WW2, kept us from sending humans to the moon, etc.<p>If the goal is prevent the maximum damage to the economy possible, then lock-downs should probably be extremely brief and extremely intense.<p>If the goal is maximum human freedom, again, the choices are obvious.<p>Any discussion that doesn&#x27;t first define the goals is useless with this topic.')
