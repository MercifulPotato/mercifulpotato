I actually did a fair bit of work related to mooring system analysis.<p>Basically, the rig would be towed on station. Each of the four columns in the corners of the rig largely consisted of chain lockers and there were two big anchor windlasses at each corner. Each anchor would be lowered down in sequence and a work boat would carry the anchor out some distance with the chain playing out and drop it. It would then be tensioned using the windlass so that the anchor digs into the sea floor. This operation was then repeated. So you basically end up with a pair of anchors coming from each corner in some sort of a spread configuration.<p>I&#x27;m sure there were later designs that used dynamic positioning rather than anchors but those were just on drill ships when I was working.')
