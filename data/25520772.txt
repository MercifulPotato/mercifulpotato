Especially at the IC level, it is 99% technical, given a normal-human-being-behavior. Then, technical the way they (individual interviewer and company) evaluate it and you don&#x27;t know about, since I had a few interviews in which I was confident I did a very good job (I am not a junior...) and they got back with a rejection on technical grounds.<p>One striking example was when I solved the coding problems posed to me in 15 minutes out of the 45 available, the interviewer said &quot;that&#x27;s great, I don&#x27;t have any more questions, please use this time for you to ask about the company&quot; and then the recruiter told me I was rejected because I did not do the coding part well enough.')
