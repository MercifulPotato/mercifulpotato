Item(by='haswell', descendants=None, kids=[24771923], score=None, time=1602630541, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24768996, text='I&#x27;m pretty deep into the Apple ecosystem (iPhone, Watch, iPad, MBP), but when it comes to smart speakers, I&#x27;ve always used a combination of Echo and Alexa-compatible Sonos devices.<p>The Alexa devices have always bothered me. Not just because of the baseline privacy concerns, but because it seems so damn easy to activate the trigger word on accident. The absolute worst part being a false positive activation of my Sonos system while watching a movie&#x2F;show. When this happens (and it happens a lot), the audio volume of the show is lowered significantly to allow Alexa to hear the rest of the command.<p>Pause the show, wait til &quot;she&quot; stops listening, rewind the show very slightly because I missed whatever was just said due to the volume shift, resume the video, instantly pause again at the moment she was originally triggered until she stops listening, resume the show, this time without having to rewind since I paused soon enough not to miss any dialog.<p>Maddening.<p>And the fact that all of these false positives get sent straight to Amazon doesn&#x27;t make me feel great.<p>I didn&#x27;t need a HomePod for its audio quality since I already have great quality with the Sonos system, and couldn&#x27;t justify the original HomePod&#x27;s price as a command&#x2F;control-focused smart speaker with a home already filled with Alexa devices.<p>All of that to say, HomePod mini is perfect for me.<p>I can throw out my Echos, disable Alexa on the Sonos system, and scatter a couple of Minis to replace the Echos.<p>This is something I didn&#x27;t realize I wanted.')
