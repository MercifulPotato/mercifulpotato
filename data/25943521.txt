It is the time tested pump and dump OR dump and pump and the street is behind it all in my opinion.<p>Sometime in Sept 2020 GME  had purchased sum of shares  reducing float or outstanding shares. Such purchases would create the current imbalance and the war between various parties involved.<p>I can not believe that the whole scheme has not been by design. I recall seeing GME pump starting right about then in Sept. I am also convinced that the shorting hedge funds could have been playing it on the up side via options. They could have sold puts; bought calls. There are a lot of dark pools and each party can have multiple arms. It is pretty naive to believe that all these hedge funds dabbling in these type of games are the sheep and not the wolves and have been silent through it all .<p>Both the new shareholders who are now the insiders and the hedge funds are likely to be aware of the small float that would have kick started the short covering pyramiding scheme and reddit would have provided the pawns to spawn it really fast by pumping the forums.<p>Don&#x27;t be naive. They fundies have been hitting all the high volatility stocks with small floats + high short ratios.')
