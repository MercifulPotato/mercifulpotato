I was trying to think of a way to phrase &quot;Jeff Bezos is probably better at compounding his personal wealth than most people&quot;.<p>I think what you&#x27;ve noted is perhaps the best counter-argument, but it&#x27;s difficult to balance out and do the math. There is obviously some trade-off at which compounding is better than instantly donating, but it&#x27;s quite possible that the compounding effects of certain classes of donations can be much stronger than what would reasonably be attained, so maybe that is where I&#x27;m wrong if I am.<p>I <i>think</i> this is the usual EA argument, but it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t know of any way for it to really be backed with the type of quantitative analysis I&#x27;d prefer to see to change my mind on it.')
