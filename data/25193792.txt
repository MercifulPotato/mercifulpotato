Very strict there - you can&#x27;t pay a bribe to get business or as part of business development.<p>However, if you need to pay a &quot;facilitation fee&quot; to exit the country (called routine govt action) that is not about securing business or getting a competitive advantage such as a customs waiver, then paying the fee may be permitted (for a number of reasons).<p>What I think US folks don&#x27;t realize is some dept&#x27;s overseas basically pay their staff through these unofficial fees, they set some rates for service, but nothing goes through treasury and no enabling legislation exists. But they also don&#x27;t get money from their treasury to operate (or its stolen by folks above them) so that&#x27;s how they keep operating.')
