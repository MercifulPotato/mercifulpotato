It is a very high-level software engineering management sort of talk which actually becomes pretty clear pretty quickly.  While at FB they may be engineers, at many other companies they could almost have been MBAs.  I take Araq&#x27;s comments as simply a lack of interest in discussion at that level, and his need to make said comments just an explanation to the conversor there and hardly worth making a big deal over.<p>In any event, even if you radically disagree with Araq&#x27;s personal communication style, I think you should still give Nim a try.  Many people do not like Linus Torvalds&#x27; communication style and still use Linux with great joy...')
