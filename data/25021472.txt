If they told netflix &quot;we have to approve each movie and tv show on your service, and possibly take revenue from you on a per-video basis&quot;, then netflix would walk and would be smart to do so because it&#x27;s pretty likely apple would come up the loser in that fight. Again, huge number of users, existing expectation of the status quo (i can stream from netflix on my device) from those users. Game streaming is new and not yet established to the general user base. Apple is in a huge position of power relative to game streaming and is using that to get the best possible deal.<p>As a devoted apple product user, these kind of behaviors really worry me. I understand that this is normal behavior for powerful organizations, but apple is making the user experience worse for money. I don&#x27;t see how that ends well.')
