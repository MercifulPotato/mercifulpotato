I&#x27;d love to code on my tablet with a stylus.<p>But personally I find these very hard to use. Scratch drove me insane, I couldn&#x27;t work out which order things were getting executed, it was a real pain.<p>Despite this, non-programmers actually seem to like visual programming systems. So my question is, what aspect of programming is the visual system removing (or adding) that makes it appealing to non-programmers? The syntax is still there, the semantics are the same, all the usual variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc, are there, just harder to read.<p>But something must be changing, or maybe it&#x27;s just a perception thing? Or is it the removal of text? Or maybe it&#x27;s the bricks, you can&#x27;t accidentally plug something in the wrong place.')
