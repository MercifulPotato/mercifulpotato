If autonomous vehicles can be tweaked to increase throughput (better reaction times, shorter follow distance, less accidents, higher speed through chokepoints like tolls, not distracted or not accelerating slowly on light changes) you might see significant traffic reductions as a result. Little&#x27;s law is applicable here.<p>The problems with bus or commuter lines is it&#x27;s hard to get people to share a route efficiently. I&#x27;ve had it work in the past but only where I picked my housing according to an effective commuter line for my school or work. But that&#x27;s hard to arrange at scale.<p>Where effective commuters line don&#x27;t scale instead if you combine the above wins with an uber pool like service where 3-4 people are efficiently routed together. You could be looking at 2-3x fewer cars on roads that have better throughput and fewer bottlenecks.')
