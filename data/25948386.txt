Aren&#x27;t all Signal users also email users?<p>I suppose the reverse isn&#x27;t true, and there are machines that send people transactional emails (e.g. receipts for online purchases) which it would be nice to secure with PGP.<p>The real problem with securing email, from my perspective, is the difficulty of creating a UX which accurately and intuitively conveys to the user whether the message they are sending is secure (and what &quot;secure&quot; means).  By using a separate app which never sends plaintext, that&#x27;s basically a non-problem.')
