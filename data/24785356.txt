Then you have vault and you can use terraform to configure a consul TLS backend.<p>And then there is a little hitch, because consul-template cannot easily create multiple files from a single vault API call, so you cannot use consul-template directly to create the necessary certificate files. We&#x27;ve written a small messy tool there. But once you have that, it&#x27;s fairly straight forward to generate consul + nomad TLS certs for the trust and then you&#x27;re set.')
