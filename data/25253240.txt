I promise that if you educate me (somewhat a bit famous in the &quot;hating on Apple&quot; space) I will help educate others. (Though, FWIW, I do know that a lot of Apple&#x27;s hardware is semi-custom design, and so if the argument is that I know but find it irrelevant for this comment thread. I am focusing on the belief that Apple makes it hard for others to source parts, which has a lot of history to it.)')
