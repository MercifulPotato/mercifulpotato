At work we make use of most of the features of gitlab so its a really great thing they include them all.<p>Honestly I&#x27;m not sure how you could even be confused by it as an individual developer either. I used it for my individual projects before getting a real development job and didn&#x27;t have any issues. It different to github but not worse or less correct. Its just github has become the standard on what the default layout and names should be.')
