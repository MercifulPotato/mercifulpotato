Maybe it&#x27;s some combination of being multiplicative &#x2F; reshaping? If you can multiply&#x2F;reshape you or others&#x27; efforts towards the project, the project (hopefully) becomes easier.<p>There&#x27;s a bit of an assumption that someone is &quot;modifying&quot; work in a useful way--multiplying a shape won&#x27;t help if more of that shape isn&#x27;t useful.')
