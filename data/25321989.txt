He has some amazing lines, and they just keep hitting hard.<p>Steve Jobs had great philosophy, arguably laying the foundations upon which Apple was built. Many great entrepreneurs share this pattern.<p>Einstein and Feynmen are known for their philosophical genius also.<p>Great philosophy can come from politicians, artists, writers, and even comedians. George Carlin and Patrice O&#x27;neal are my favorite. There&#x27;s great philosophy surrounding sports too. The Last Dance is a great watch.<p>My only point is, don&#x27;t marginalize yourself to the field of philosophy. Philosophy is deep thinking, and the ability to articulate and navigate those thoughts. The books under the philosophy section are the thoughts that have nowhere else to be. Great philosophy about computation will be under Computers.<p>If you&#x27;re serious about your personal philosophy, then start writing your thoughts down. Then organize them and edit them and pursue them. Pick up books that answer your questions and read the organized thoughts of your role models. Every field has its great philosophers, and more often than not, they&#x27;re the trail blazers of their field. They will not be found under philosophy.')
