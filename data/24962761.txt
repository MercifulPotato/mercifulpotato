If you simply disagree, it&#x27;s called click trolling and it&#x27;s a cowardly behavior when some downvote and run away without expressing what they don&#x27;t agree with because they can&#x27;t stand their ground in an argument.<p>Using downvotes for disagreement is simply a bad practice. They should be used for off-topic or inappropriate posts.<p>Ironic, how some actually downvote this post but don&#x27;t comment :) This demonstrates the point.')
