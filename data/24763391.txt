Very convenient if you have small children and don&#x27;t want the random calls from grandparents or old friends checking in at inconvenient times (apparently if they don&#x27;t have children but working a lot they don&#x27;t consider 9pm to be &quot;a bad time&quot; - how should they?).<p>We used Airplane mode at nights before (even before we had kids), but were stressed about missed emergencies from relatives and stopped doing that.<p>Disclaimer: I get approx. 2 calls per week, and this is mostly businesses calling back, etc. I still don&#x27;t want to miss emergencies though.')
