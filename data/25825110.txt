And even then there is the issue that 2-3 providers never really compete even if they&#x27;re not colluding...<p>I honestly think that free market healthcare is doomed to failure.  The information a-symmetry, the size of hospitals compared to populations, localization, the degree of specialization, strategic nature of services, and the social externalities are just too great to ever really have a market.
