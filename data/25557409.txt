This sort of thinking about cell phone use is incredibly lazy.<p>When I&#x27;m reading a book, I&#x27;m not just staring at a binding of paper. When I&#x27;m listening to music, I&#x27;m not just sticking earbuds into my ears and staring blankly at the wall. Has the author ever used a phone before? Or are they just glowing rectangles to them?')
