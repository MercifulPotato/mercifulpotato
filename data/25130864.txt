Then the MFC clause can remain, but it will have a different meaning.<p>Like, if the customer A pays me $10 in cash, and the customer B pays me $11 using credit card, and the credit card company then takes $1 from me, in some sense I have provided &quot;the same price for each customer&quot;: each of them ultimately gave me $10.')
