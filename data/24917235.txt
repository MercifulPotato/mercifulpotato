Genuine customers will only ask for help when they actually need it and do it in a way that respects everyone&#x27;s time.<p>Instead, it&#x27;s more about taking time away from your business to deal with people who have no intention of buying from you but are just bored, lonely or mentally ill.<p>While the latter group might only represent 25% of the people who contact you, attempting to fulfill their needs is  literally impossible and will eat up as much of your productive time as you allow it.\nOnline reviews (which basically represent the &quot;appropriate amount of public outrage&quot;) have only made this worse.  If one of your non-customers feel slighted, they will drag your name through the mud in the foulest way possible.\nThe whole &quot;Karen&quot; meme didn&#x27;t come from nowhere (although in our case, it&#x27;s usually 30-something single men).')
