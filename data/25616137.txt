I think that&#x27;s really the same kind of powerlessness that the article gives as a motivation for &quot;conspiratorial thinking&quot;.<p>btw, at the risk of sounding exceedingly cranky, here&#x27;s some little kernels of truth I can see if I squint at the ridiculousness we started with:<p>- CIA is keenly interested in mind control<p>- Globalist ideals harmed the response to COVID (e.g. by insisting on continued air traffic)<p>- Weather modification is real (e.g. cloud seeding)<p>- The possibility of high-energy physics experiments doing some fundamental damage to our little corner of the milky way should at least not be completely dismissed out of hand. Which nuclear bomb was it, where they calculated beforehand whether it would not set the whole atmosphere on fire?<p>- Political influence is absolutely being exerted through universities<p>- Don&#x27;t know about sandy hook but false flags have happened and oppressive regimes have taken people&#x27;s guns away before oppressing them a bit more<p>- Can you really read the wikipedia article on &quot;deep state&quot; and say none of that is happening in the US?<p>I don&#x27;t think Krapp was really arguing against any of these things, but it just annoys me to no end that all you hear is &quot;bill gates 5g vaccine nanobots&quot; when there are legitimate issues to be discussed.')
