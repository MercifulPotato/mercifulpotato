Item(by='tarleb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603652033, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24884944, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve decided to evaluate pandoc and see if it might be useful for supporting Markdown and Word formats, etc. If it is, then I&#x27;ll reach out to John McFarlane and ask about a commercial license (or just something in writing), perhaps in exchange for sponsorship on GitHub.<p>Better to just use a GPL compatible distribution method: pandoc has 349 contributors; none of them signed a copyright assignment, so you&#x27;d need permission from each and every contributor to use the software in a way not permitted by the GPL.<p>If you need a freelancer with deep pandoc knowledge, please do reach out. I&#x27;m happy to help.')
