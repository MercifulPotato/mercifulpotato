It was a whole ecosystem of food producing organisms. Fish in the water, herbs like dill, tomatoes, all sorts of stuff. He&#x27;d sell it at 4x grocer prices to pricy restaurants near-by. His reasoning in putting it in a sea container was that he could always find a spare place to park it &#x2F; electrify it with all his friends in the construction industry.<p>Made enough to live in Kensington Market, which is a hipster &#x2F; hippy part of Toronto.')
