I check it maybe once every 2-3 weeks at most. But,.... It really depends on who you follow. I follow a few indie game dev friends and unfollow if one of them starts posting political stuff. My feed is mostly cool info about indie games in unity, unreal, pico-8, some graphics info. Very little bad stuff except for twitter itself with it inserting ads and trying to get me to follow &quot;popular&quot; people I have zero interest in or posting &quot;trending&quot; crap. Some of that I&#x27;ve managed to ublock origin away though of course it&#x27;s extremely frustrating that both twitter and facebook obfuscate their css')
