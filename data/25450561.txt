I actively dislike &quot;abnegation&quot; type games, but the idea of being transported to somewhere else, exploring different realities, amazes me (I&#x27;m dying to try Myst on VR), and putting physical effort on it adds to the fantasy. So maybe VR isn&#x27;t for you, simple as that.<p>I&#x27;ve seem lots of people (online, yes, but still) keep coming back for Pavlov, Population One, Half-Life Alyx, Star Wars Squadron, VR Chat... I really think there&#x27;s something there.')
