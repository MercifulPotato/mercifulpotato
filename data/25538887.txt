This is a bog standard approach that many SV firms take. Even non-SV firms have to deal with this sort of thing when the IT department reports to the CFO.<p>Yes, Alphabet has &#x27;side bets&#x27; but there are still _many_ products and services under the Google umbrella, and has even rolled some into their own. As best I can tell, this was a tool to quarantine specific executives from infecting the rest of Google -- when your acquisitions are holding quarterly all hands with an opener of &#x27;Fuck being Googley&#x27; then you have a problem to solve.<p>It&#x27;s hard to reconcile the &#x27;ignorance is strength&#x27; argument you&#x27;ve offered here -- if employees aren&#x27;t allowed to know what anyone else is doing, or even what the org chart looks like, then you can&#x27;t have the collaboration it would take to make things work together well. And you would expect to end up with a lot of duplicated efforts, since middle managers are kept in the dark about one another&#x27;s work.')
