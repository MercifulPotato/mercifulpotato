The thing is sending data all over the internet, I can&#x27;t even write a diary because I feel like I live in the USSR where I have to pay attention to everything I say or the KGB will get me (to be clear it&#x27;s just a metaphor, I understand I can write whatever I want on my PC without consequences but I don&#x27;t like the feeling that my inner thoughts would end up on a server somewhere).')
