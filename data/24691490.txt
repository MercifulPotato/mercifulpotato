Not random gestures.</i><p>In the paper, the rituals associated with the carrots were &#x27;...behaviors such as using their knuckles to rap on the desk, taking deep breaths, and closing their eyes for a moment...&#x27;. n.b. none of those were natural to the context and &#x27;product&#x27;.<p>The &#x27;not random gestures&#x27; part is actually referring to where participants in the study performed similar gestures, but did different ones for each carrot that they tasted.<p>So I think they seem to be drawing the wrong conclusions from this study.')
