Item(by='tomcam', descendants=None, kids=[25512372], score=None, time=1608676224, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25505865, text='&gt; What are good reasons for not having this right by default?<p>Getting tired of such free use of the word “right”. [EDIT: see bottom of this post!]<p>I will assume you’re not from the US, or are using hyperbole when you use the term “right”. Here in the USA our rights are clearly defined in the Constitution &amp; Bill of Rights and they have a special quality: Our military and politicians literally swear not to defend King or country, but the Constitution, which represents a set of rights no human is allowed to abridge.<p>Rights are things we send our sons and daughters to die for in war.<p>So maybe you mean something a bit less dramatic?<p>EDIT: After my bloviating I reversed my position based on something the parent posted regarding government subsidies. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25506982" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25506982</a>')
