These take home exams are much, much harder than anything they can give you in a timed in-person exam.   It’s not even close.<p>This is simply because the set of problems a person can solve in 3hrs limits the scope of the questions that could be asked.  In fact, my friends and I would make lists of things we were sure wouldn’t be on the exam due to time constraints.<p>I have to say that nobody cheated.  This was partly due to my physics graduating class being 12 students.')
