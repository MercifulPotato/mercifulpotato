Murdering ourselves for this and that reason is not part of the daily routine and one can&#x27;t just decide to go an murder rampage, because \n - &quot;meh, it&#x27;s just that time of the day.&quot;<p>Murders do happen, it&#x27;s a thing, but that doesn&#x27;t make them normal.<p>Your smallpox example it&#x27;s as sensationalist as the stupid article. Everything around us can be turned into a weapon. One can murder another with a rock. Are rocks deadly now? Do we need to ban fire, because it can be used in incendiary bombs to level down cities?<p>Compare this pandemic to other pandemics. What about this is so hard to comprehend? Don&#x27;t compare it to states of war, because that is stupid. I know it&#x27;s clickbaity and such an irresistible lure for easily influenced people that bite on anything without giving it an ounce of though, but it&#x27;s so trivial to catch it.<p>Again - Compare this pandemic to other pandemics.')
