A certain political party spent that last six months forcing rule changes on swing states vis a vis mail in voting that you can&#x27;t compare this year&#x27;s election to any that came before.<p>Most of the fraud allegations (at least the ones where the numbers would be large enough to make a significant difference) revolve around these unsolicited mail in ballots and the extended deadlines which we&#x27;ve never had before in this country.<p>And please, kicking out GOP poll watchers (and only GOP poll watchers) and blocking their ability to observe and inspect ballots might not prove fraud took place, but it does prove criminal intent in my eyes, and the eyes of millions of other Americans.<p>These concerns need to be addressed.')
