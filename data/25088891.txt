My information is a few years out of date, but I think most of it is still current. I&#x27;ve also used Ghidra (9.1) for maybe 50 hours or so.<p>First, let me say: Both are leaps and bounds above _anything_ else out there. Stuff like Hopper is basically just assembler code in a different syntax; Hex-Rays and Ghidra are real, working, useful decompilers. Hex-Rays charges four-figure sums for single licenses, and it&#x27;s because the product is utterly worth it if you do this kind of thing for a living (or at least was before Ghidra came along). I would estimate it speeds up reverse-engineering by 10x. There&#x27;s a wonderful interactivity where the decompiler does all the boring book-keeping for you, and you keep feeding it info and it tells you stuff in return. Decompiling is often about figuring out data structures; both will infer a lot of struct types and sometimes even names based on usage and surrounding code. This is _so incredibly useful_. When you give a field a type or a name, it propagates throughout the program and gives you new understanding.<p>Both products are weird and have arcane UIs. IDA&#x2F;Hex-Rays feels more ergonomical to me, though (for instance, highlighting happens automatically instead of having to middle-click), perhaps because it&#x27;s what I started on. Both have strange bugs that you eventually learn to work around.  Both have lots of bells and whistles only advanced users will get to use.<p>Hex-Rays&#x27; output feels much more polished to me. It recognizes a lot of compiler idioms, and every new release recognizes more. On the other hand, Hex-Rays only supports a few select platforms (when I started, it did 32-bit x86 only; now it does x86, x86-64, arm, aarch64, ppc, ppc64, mips), and you have to pay for it separately. Ghidra supports decompilation for almost all targets it can disassemble! This either is huge, or doesn&#x27;t matter to you at all.<p>Hex-Rays&#x27; support is amazing. You report a bug, include a specialized program database by means of a function in the GUI, and four hours later, you receive an email with the bug fixed. On the other hand, Ghidra is free and Hex-Rays is the most expensive software I&#x27;ve ever used, which is obviously a huge deal for anyone not doing this full-time. (The Hex-Rays license lasts for only a year, but after the license is expired, you can still use the software. You just don&#x27;t get support or newer versions.) If Ghidra cost $500 (for a permanent license), I would probably consider getting it, but it happens to be $0. Fantastic value for money.<p>If I could choose only one, and cost didn&#x27;t matter? I&#x27;d probably go with Hex-Rays.')
