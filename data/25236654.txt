Probably true, but this is the first I&#x27;ve heard of it (Disclaimer: I am not a Chemist or Chemical Engineer... in fact, I&#x27;m not even a real Scientist! &lt;g&gt;)</i><p>Unless there is a detail that I&#x27;m missing, this is very similar to the process used to transform Aluminum oxide to metallic Aluminum on Earth. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult_process" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult_proc...</a><p>The mix of molted salts is the liquid where you dissolve the Aluminum oxide. IIRC, you can theoretically try without the molted salt, but the temperature to melt the oxide is much higher, so it is not a practical method without the salt.<p>One difference is that this process to produce Aluminum you don&#x27;t make Oxygen. You have big Carbon electrodes, and they get burned.<p>If you want to produce Oxygen, you probably can replace the Carbon electrode with a Platinum electrode. It would require more energy, and the bubbles will make the process even more complicated. (This should work in a laboratory. To make this safe an efficient at industrial scales, would require a few years of tweaking with the additives, shapes and temperatures. Amway, using Carbon is more efficient, and this variant is too expensive as a method to produce Oxygen for the Earth market.)')
