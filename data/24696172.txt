A week&#x27;s worth of food, the caloric density is astounding. I then only need to make salads or play with frozen veggies.<p>All of this is really cheap and quick to make. Almond&#x2F;coconut&#x2F;soy milk costs nearly three times as much as cow&#x27;s milk in my country, and the substitute &#x27;meats&#x27; are hard to find outside supermarkets. Veganism here might as well be money laundering. To my knowledge, beyond burgers and such food is still pricey in the USA as well, for instance.<p>I&#x27;m just pointing out what makes me consider vegetarianism or veganism is eating more food, better food, for less money, and less pretentious heat treatment. I&#x27;m not finding it right now. Hopeful for the future, though.')
