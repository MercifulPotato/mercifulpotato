We don&#x27;t know if the historical data on traditional vaccines are applicable here.<p>This is not how decision making under uncertainty works. When you don&#x27;t have rigorous proof of whether something works or doesn&#x27;t work you have to make educated guesses based on various priors and make the percentage play. You can&#x27;t refuse to incorporate priors into your decision making just because you don&#x27;t have a peer reviewed p&lt;0.05 study validating it.<p>Uncertainty about the result cuts both ways. You can&#x27;t claim that we can&#x27;t do X over Y because we don&#x27;t have rigorous proof that X is better than Y, when we don&#x27;t have rigorous proof that Y is better than X either. Regardless of what you do you&#x27;re taking a leap of faith.<p>&gt; We just don&#x27;t know and it would be way worse if it turns out we have to re-vaccinate everyone because we were impatient.<p>If there&#x27;s probability p that it doesn&#x27;t work and we have to spend X extra months re-vaccinating everyone that&#x27;s an expected delay of p * X. But if it does work then not pursuing the single dose strategy will delay the vaccination schedule by X&#x27; months also.<p>If p * X &lt; (1-p) * X&#x27; then the former is a perfectly acceptable risk.')
