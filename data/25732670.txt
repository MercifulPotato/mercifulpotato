Add higher than average price and most smaller retailers just sell samsungs, lg and random chinese brands.<p>The biggest problem remains, manufacturers are not required to sell repairable devices and parts everywhere, requirement is only applicable to EU, so they will continue to manufacture trash and will never have their parts available outside EU.
