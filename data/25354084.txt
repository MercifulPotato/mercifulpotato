One of the factors the Justices look to is whether the </i>issues <i>in the case can be resolved in other cases in the lower courts, even if not between the same parties. Thus, the Court usually denies leave unless it&#x27;s a</i> uniquely <i>state-state dispute (again, like borders&#x2F;water).</i><p>&gt; <i>6. Among lots of other things, that&#x27;s almost certainly fatal to this crazy new Texas suit. As we&#x27;ve seen, these claims are already being brought in private suits in each of those states. Texas offers no explanation for why the issues can&#x27;t be (and aren&#x27;t being) addressed there.</i><p>&gt; <i>7. And it&#x27;s not for nothing that the Justices don&#x27;t</i> like <i>&quot;original&quot; cases, partly because they don&#x27;t come with a well-developed record and set of opinions from lower courts.</i><p>&gt; <i>Indeed, the &quot;original&quot; docket has shrunk to an average of &lt;1 argued case per Term in recent years.</i><p>&gt; <i>8. The other reason they don&#x27;t like these cases is because they&#x27;re worried about opening the floodgates. If Texas can sue these states over how they conduct their elections, what&#x27;s to stop Vermont from suing Texas over how it regulates the oil industry, or other permutations.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;steve_vladeck&#x2F;status&#x2F;1336329907400425488" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;steve_vladeck&#x2F;status&#x2F;1336329907400425488</a><p>Another case against PA was dismissed today:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;08&#x2F;supreme-court-rejects-bid-to-overturn-bidens-win-in-pennsylvania-443751" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;08&#x2F;supreme-court-rejec...</a>')
