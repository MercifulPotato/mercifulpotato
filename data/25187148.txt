That V8, the implementation of the JavaScript, is faster than the Zend engine, the implementation of PHP, but the event based NodeJS platform is not faster than the PHP(Apache&#x2F;Nginx) platform.<p>NodeJS performance has evolved massively thanks to V8 R&amp;D, as you already mentioned, Zend Engine has also gained a lot performance but of course not comparable to V8 for obvious reasons, the prior is a Google based project, the latter is a volunteer community based project. However the PHP stack also consist of a web server, and they has also evolved massively the past 20 years, Nginx is relatively new on the scene with an event based asynchronous architecture and Apache has evolved with a new PHP module.<p>I think your personal attacks against muglug, regardless if he was right or wrong, is not appropriate for this forum, especially when you yourself is not entirely up to date.<p>Edit: typo')
