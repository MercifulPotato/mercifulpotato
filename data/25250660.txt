We pivoted an MVP and landed customers within a month which was really exciting and it helped us land so some meetings with huge potential. Queue my social anxiety. I tend to ramble and that can lead to me being a bit defensive. I am just curious how others deal with accelerator or VC meetings and more specifically the rapid fire questioning. I love what I do and spend my time trying to ensure our customers\nare as happy as they can be. I just donâ€™t want to get flustered and ruin things for my partners, if that makes sense. We try not to mock interviews or focus too much on our couple competitors but instead find what our customers want. Thank you so much for making it this far, I greatly appreciate any and all advice.')
