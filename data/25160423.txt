Just looking casually, it appears that the ratchet mechanism is used to convert an oscillatory energy into a mechanical energy. Most suspensions just turn it into heat.<p>It may make more sense by analogy to an electronic rectifier. The ratchet is like a diode and the spring is like the capacitor.<p>The energy still comes from the legs, but it helps capture losses. I can think of a lot of ways to improve it, and make it simpler, but it’s the first time I’ve seen something like this actually built.')
