The revolution in data networks happened when they shifted from circuit-based (telephony) systems to packet based (IP) systems.  There were significant benefits to be had in the switching of standardised packets with standardied equipment, allowing us to cheaply build and manage complex networks with a mix of underlying technologies.<p>I can see a revolution coming in the &quot;packetisation&quot; of energy, meaning that we will be able to switch units of energy with the same ease and versatility with which we switch data bits.  Any load will be able to consume a standardised &quot;packet&quot; of energy from any source.  Data and energy will be mingled, in that each energy packet will be accompanied by a data packet describing its properties.  Complex networks will be able to be safely constructed and automatically managed by non-specialists, as the network will use the data portion of a &quot;data&#x2F;energy&quot; packet to safely and efficiently manage the energy portion of the packet as it passes through the network.')
