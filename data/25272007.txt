Item(by='MajorBee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606869692, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25271609, text='Personally, I do like the concealed nature of threads within the main conversation, but I do not like how they are presented when opened. The whole &quot;displayed on a narrow pane on the side&quot; seems too cluttered to me. I&#x27;d much rather have it expand in the main conversation pane, maybe even create nested threads inside (kind of like reddit&#x2F;HN).<p>Thread notifications are another pain point, as others have also noted. For some reason, all thread updates&#x2F;notifications are clustered together in a separate tab called &quot;Threads&quot;, regardless of what channels these threads belong to. If a thread (that I am following) belonging to a channel has an update, shouldn&#x27;t that channel be highlighted? Now that I think about it, if that channel is highlighted and the user clicks on it, how is the user going to know which thread to check... all I can say is, threading in chat rooms is a non-trivial problem and while Slack gets some part of it right, there&#x27;s still a ways to go.')
