Two off the top of my head are &quot;very active users&quot; and &quot;very technical users&quot;.<p>The foremost often can be maintainers of communities. Example: Reddit or Discord. These same communities might end up being the main part of your product. Other examples include social media like Youtube, or even Instagram.<p>To these users a different set of power tools are needed, than for the &quot;technical power users&quot; who need different kinds of power tools.<p>For the &quot;very active users&quot;, you might want to be able to provide things like UI customization, social media linking, statistics and easy tools for moderation.<p>Examples of tools for &quot;technical power users&quot; might be providing a large set of actions that can be custom-key-bound. A macro&#x2F;scripting API. An alternate API to your service completely (REST-ful), or support for modding. You can guess what those tools will later be used for quite simply I&#x27;m sure. :)')
