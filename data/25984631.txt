WHERE. IS. IT?!?<p>I missed backing the original project (in, what, 2016 or so?), then there was an interminable delay before anyone could order again (until the second Kickstarter), then they shipped units to what felt like a gazillion YouTubers who gushed all over it in maybe early 2020, except that nobody else could buy it at that time, then they finally got round to running a second kickstarter for a second run (after plenty of people, including me, had screamed at them for upwards of two years to take our money and been completely ignored), then I hand over my money at the earliest opportunity (which happens to be August 2020), and despite raising £1.8M or thereabouts, 6 months later I still don&#x27;t have my ZX Spectrum Next.<p>I don&#x27;t think the ZX Spectrum Next is a scam, but I&#x27;m pretty jaded about Spectrum kickstarters because some of them have been scams, and I&#x27;ve well had enough of how long this is taking. I&#x27;m also pretty fed up that, at least at times, critical comments about the project have been deleted from YouTube channels supportive of it (none of my comments that have been deleted have been any more strongly worded than this one).<p>You have £335 of my money, gladly handed over in August 2020, so where&#x27;s my computer?<p>I don&#x27;t want to be a dick about this but it&#x27;s frankly unbelievable how long this is taking, particularly since at least one revision of the device appears to have been successfully shipped last year, and you&#x27;ve been hawking working prototypes for at least a year or two before that.<p>Where is it?')
