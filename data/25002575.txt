Never corrupted a mailbox.  I&#x27;ve had to reindex a mailbox once or twice to get search working, but that was many years ago.<p>I recalling having a problem with excessive CPU use after it&#x27;s been running awhile (weeks to months.)  That seems to have gotten solved at some point; I looked into the problem a bit (strace, etc.) and found the IO multiplexing (select, poll, epoll, whatever) code was spinning.  Solution was to bounce it.<p>My only complaint now is that dark mode isn&#x27;t fully hammered out.  At least not in the non-snap version available in bionic beaver.  Anyone know if newer versions have got this right yet?')
