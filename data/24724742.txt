If both of us write the exact same method name, and we can both prove we didn&#x27;t copy the other&#x27;s, that&#x27;s enough. We both have copyright over our own api call that we wrote.<p>Copyright probably shouldn&#x27;t apply in any case that we could both independently create the same thing (in the same way the sentence &quot;Hi, how are you&quot; isn&#x27;t copyrightable, but a chapter of shakespeare is -- the former is not a real expression of unique creativity).<p>So no, copyright does not determine the &quot;1 true owner&quot; of something that was not copied. That&#x27;s patents.')
