That&#x27;s just math, not a value statement or judgement.<p>Probably the outcome of preferential attachment and compounding interest (rewards). I&#x27;ll let others talk about economies of scale, financialization, regulatory capture, and so forth.<p>If society determines that winner-takes-all is undesirable, we&#x27;ll have to choose otherwise. That means forfeiting economic efficiencies, adding friction to open markets, some kind of profit sharing (redistribution).<p>A policy of robustness over efficiency could make a lot of sense. There will always be shocks to the system. In vesting in resilience is a pretty good idea.<p>Note that I wrote &quot;open markets&quot;. The taxonomy of markets includes open, closed, gray, and black. &quot;Free markets&quot; is double speak for pro-monopoly laissez faire winner-takes-all.')
