That&#x27;s why &quot;Hello world!&quot; is so fundamental. And that&#x27;s why a counter stored into a database is <i>one of the biggest steps you can make</i> - you&#x27;ve wedged the door open and it can&#x27;t possibly fall shut again. Everything else is incremental from there. And if something doesn&#x27;t work, you know you can just go a step back and reassess, without starting from zero. Writing code is beautiful like that.<p>I wish you many productive struggles and subsequent successes in your journey!')
