It’s a fantasyland.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;for-american-pundits-china-isnt-a-country-its-a-fantasyland&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;29&#x2F;24ba60e0-0431-11e5-a428-c984eb077d4e_story.html?utm_source=reddit.com&amp;utm_term=.15e8748766f8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;for-american-pundits...</a><p>&gt; The people telling these tales aren’t interested in complexities or, really, in China. They’re making domestic arguments and expressing parochial fears. Their China isn’t a real place but a rhetorical trope, less a genuine rival than a fairy-tale bogeyman.<p>&gt; [But] when we treat China as a fantasyland of instruction for ourselves, we end up ignoring the Chinese. Like Voltaire’s mandarins or the happy peasants of Maoist propaganda, they cease to be real people and become perfect puppets deployed for rhetorical ends.<p>I read it having just arrived in China after many years away and it helped contextualized just how vastly different the China was that appeared in even sophisticated English language publications and the raw truth on the ground.<p>It gave me a powerful lens to critically analyze media from, about how people are reduced to symbols to feed a story that the audience wants to believe rather than the data driven complexity of real ground truth.')
