I&#x27;d have meetings outside typical hours morning&#x2F;evening.<p>The company was fine if I was regularly out of office and taking part of the day off as my job was getting done so it worked.<p>If I had managers that were &quot;why is he coming in at 11am today&quot; it would have been a nightmare.<p>Also it can run quite well for task lists, work getting done while you sleep. Often I leave tasks at the end of a day and they are done when you wake up. This offset if you miss resource access during your day depending on setup.<p>Personally I find it fine, but I&#x27;ve always been ok with doing a bit of work out of usual hours.')
