I get that it&#x27;s a controversial choice, and it goes hand in hand with their proprietary standard model, which I think is what feeds my suspicion that there is actual bias at play, as opposed to strong opinions being voiced without the bias.<p>There seems to be as much shared experience in ragging on Apple as there is in using their products and maybe in supporting their positions in the face of naysayers. Other providers offer similar integrated experience. Google has entries in most hardware markets, and Amazon certainly exercises a ubiquity across more than just the IT industry.<p>I wondered about &#x27;bias&#x27; being the right thing to talk about, of course I was influenced by the complainants characterisation.  I imagine I have a pro-Apple bias to some degree. Certainly I know I like the products, infrastructure, and integration, and I&#x27;m largely supportive of their technical direction. Is it bias, or are these conversations purely opinion based?<p>I don&#x27;t fully understand what you mean by &quot;a reflection of people actually knowing what the company is doing.&quot; There might be some misinformation floating around, but I would expect that to balance over time and subject matter. If you mean that some people chime in to these conversations without enough information I suppose my lesson here is not to feed the trolls :)<p>Great to hear the young one is interested!')
