If you enable it and also disable Rulers and Text Boundaries then you see only the pages, the text, and a scroll bar at the edge of the screen (unless your GUI toolkit has vanishing scrollbars enabled, which is IMO more distracting). Run it on a laptop without Internet access and nothing else installed for minimal distraction.')
