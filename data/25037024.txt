Orange was derived the same way -- from the fruit. Prior to the 1500s, when the fruit was introduced to England, things were described as &quot;saffron-red&quot;, &quot;yellow-red&quot;, or simply &quot;red&quot; when we would today call them orange. (There&#x27;s a really interesting perceptual thing going on here -- if you don&#x27;t have a word for a color, you don&#x27;t perceive the color: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;clarkesworldmagazine.com&#x2F;hoffman_01_13&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;clarkesworldmagazine.com&#x2F;hoffman_01_13&#x2F;</a> )<p>As for non-English: you can trace the spread of the fruit across the Mediterranean by tracking the word appearance.
