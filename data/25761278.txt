For some use cases they can be more power efficient. If you need some oddball I&#x2F;O that isn&#x27;t widely available in existing systems you can implement it in gateware.<p>In general I would say there aren&#x27;t a whole lot of cases where it makes sense to use an FPGA over a microcontoller or SBC given how cheap and fast they are these days. Of course like a lot of hobbyist tech stuff people will choose to use a certain technology for fun&#x2F;learning.<p>Note that the Pi didn&#x27;t exist yet when this CPU was designed, the embedded world was very different 10 years ago.')
