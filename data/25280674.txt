Item(by='site-packages1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606938522, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25279892, text='The basic idea is that there are different information systems governed by different agencies. The FDA, to use a random example, has its own data systems and obligations under NARA to preserve various things. It is illegal to delete these records. At a high level, the office of the POTUS has these data systems to manage their own records, but because of a level of executive privilege, they don&#x27;t have the same NARA obligations as normal government agencies. There is a lot of controversy here over exactly what POTUS office has to preserve, and as you can imaging their office, regardless of administration, fights for a high level of executive privilege to keep those records secret. There are also a number of offices within the office of the POTUS, and it&#x27;s unclear whether some are executive agencies or not, as there are arguments to be made either way, so who knows whether they really are bound by NARA&#x2F;etc. guidelines on preservation.<p>Furthermore, destruction of records between administrations causes a wealth of issues for the non-political people on the ground because there is a lot of institutional knowledge captured in things like emails, how situations were handled, etc. and the wheel keeps needing to get reinvented.<p>I&#x27;m basically a socialist by the way, there&#x27;s no political gain for me to mention that Obama did this and I&#x27;m not equivocating in the least Obama vs Trump actions, just saying overall records should be preserved.')
