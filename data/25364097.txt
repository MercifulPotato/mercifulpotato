Echo chambers <i>deliberately</i> implemented by Big Tech has led us here. It is a permanent damage.<p>If consumers of social media were shown both sides, perhaps we wouldn&#x27;t be here in the first place.<p>Truth vs. Falsehood are like a special place on the nyquist plot and its stability criterion is like of an inverted pendulum.
