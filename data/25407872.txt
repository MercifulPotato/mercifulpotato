It (and gold) have no intrinsic value to humans I would argue, and are simply assigned arbitrary psychological value. They could have industrial or even aesthetic uses, but those are culturally defined and not something innate to the material.<p>IMHO the only things with &quot;intrinsic&quot; value for humans are air, shelter (especially against &#x27;extreme&#x27; temperatures), water, and food.')
