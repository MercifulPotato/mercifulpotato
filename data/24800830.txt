Nim isnt quite as simple as Zig (to compare to another compiled language with a smaller ecosystem), but the more advanced features stay out of the way until you need them. If you&#x27;ve worked with any static language, you probably know 80%-90% of what you need to write productive Nim code. The dev team has worked hard over the past year to improve documentation, and the website links to some great tutorials.')
