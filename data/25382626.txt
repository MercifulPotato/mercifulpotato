And Migadu just gave one month’s time for users to switch from the previous free tier (with a footer ad) to a paid tier. During a worldwide pandemic with debilitating effects on many people, this was a move that wasn’t thought through. I’d personally not trust Migadu to care much for customers based on trying it in the past and seeing this move unfold.')
