But they rarely have the lowest prices anymore. Certainly not the kinds of bargains you find on RyanAir or easyJet. SWA also doesn&#x27;t give refunds unless you fly unrestricted, which is usually 3x the price of a restricted fare. To their credit, they don&#x27;t charge change fees.<p>The way I think of RyanAir or easyJet or the like is a bit like gambling. Maybe 90% of the time you&#x27;ll get a super cheap flight and everything will go fine, but the other 10% you&#x27;ll lose your money. In the long term, though, it&#x27;s a good deal for the passenger.')
