Item(by='FridgeSeal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603148730, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831504, text='I use Sublime Merge pretty much every day, and it&#x27;s nothing short of fantastic.<p>It&#x27;s properly fast, the diff&#x2F;stage&#x2F;commit&#x2F;etc UX is excellent. I particularly enjoy how straightforward it makes it to hand-pick lines from multiple files really quickly. The interface abstracts over enough of the Git ux&#x2F;api to make it get out of your way, but in a way that doesn&#x27;t make what it&#x27;s doing a mystery or too out of your control - hovering over a button will often yield the equivalent git cli commands for example.<p>Personal preference here, but it&#x27;s also <i>not</i> an electron app, so it&#x27;s very resource light.')
