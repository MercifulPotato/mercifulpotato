Also, nuclear energy (like most pretend-green energies) does not work without considerable amounts of fossil fuels, from extraction to actual energy production. If only that, building a nuclear facility is going to take a lot of fossil fuel to power the machines, and use a lot of concrete, which requires even more fossil fuel to produce and bring over.<p>Water and wind turbines are a little different. Their ecological impact depends on their size. The problem here is most countries insist on urbanization which concentrates energy production and therefore tends to centralize energy production away from usage, in big power stations.<p>Producing a little electricity with turbines has a quasi-null environmental impact, and is good for local usage for a small village. You&#x27;ll find that people on the countryside are opposing industry&#x27;s project not because they&#x27;re new and ugly, but because they have actual concerns about the damage produced by such installations. How much resources does it take to build a wind turbine? How many tons of concrete does it take to anchor so many tons of steel? How does this considerable of concrete affect the local ecosystem?<p>People are not entirely stupid. They protest the nuclear industry and windfarms because they&#x27;ve seen the damage, and they understand these proposals do not bring required change. We need momentum to reduce energy&#x2F;resources usage, not to produce ever more energy.<p>If you want to understand why many people from here (France) strongly oppose nuclear power, i recommend you do some reading on Areva&#x27;s many failures (engineering-wise) and on Fran√ßafrique, the french neocolonial system which ensures uranium supplies.')
