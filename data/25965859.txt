With 50% population immunity you need far (far) less natural immunity to reach an R number less than one, at which point outbreaks don&#x27;t grow anymore.<p>Obviously these magical mRNA vaccines with their 95% numbers are going to be more effective.  But that&#x27;s just a (very) happy scientific accident that they worked out.  Historically vaccines haven&#x27;t been anywhere near that effective and have still controlled disease.   Hell, the flu shots we get are like 30% effective and they still save lives every year.')
