Or someone with no college degree who spent time working in &quot;low-status&quot; tech roles but has one popular GitHub project.<p>The parts about &quot;hot&quot; startups and popular GitHub projects do sound a lot like prestige to me. Incidentally I have worked for quite some time at a &quot;hot&quot; startup (in Europe) and I can tell you that its &quot;hotness&quot; was in no way justified by tech fundamentals - it was mostly fueled by great sales and marketing. GitHub popularity is also not necessarily related to fundamentals - remember things like the isEven, isOdd etc. packages?')
