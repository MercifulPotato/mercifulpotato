I did get a bit of a headache trying to use thinc at the time, which was just when you guys did the redesign I think, so the docs were different from what I was seeing. I might not have searched enough though.<p>I didn&#x27;t try it yet, but it seems that transformers got added to spacy v3 with first class support.<p>I did gain something from rummaging though spacy source though! NN layers were composed into module-like pieces, then added to this REGISTRY variable though a decorator. That way some things could be defined at runtime. It was super elegant.<p>I nicked the concept of that for my data preprocessing pipeline. Saved me a lot of time when trying new things.')
