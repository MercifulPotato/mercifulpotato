Not only is it profoundly useful for lidar and stuff, dense arrays of lasers could also be used for all kinds of display technology.<p>If we can somehow make cheap VCSELs that emit blue or green light, red, green, and blue VCSELs could even take over general purpose lighting. One imagines a TV where each subpixel is a VCSEL. It would potentially be better even than microLED displays. The spectral purity would give really amazing colors.')
