A traceroute to the only ASN in Eritrea is over 1200ms from the US and contains hostnames like &#x27;asia-broadcast-sat&#x27; or &#x27;absatellite.net&#x27;. 2G mobile calls within the country are $0.20&#x2F;minute and a 64 kbps connection is USD$300 a month.<p>The retail site on Eritel advertises 9 megabit down, 1 megabit up for $16000&#x2F;m. This is &quot;new pricing&quot; updated 2018.')
