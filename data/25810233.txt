No more Wechat, TikTok, Alipay, or League of Legends or Valorant, until China gives equal treatment to foreign internet firms.<p>That&#x27;s not how the US Judiciary systems works. You can&#x27;t ban dozen of apps based on &quot;suspicious behaviour&quot;. You need to start an investigation , then you need to collect proofs , then based on those proofs prosecutor we&#x27;ll be able to decide to sue or not , and ultimately a judge will decide to ban those apps or not.<p>It&#x27;s why our western constitutional democracy are doomed to fail.<p>Our democracies move and react slower than authoritarian regime like China , Russia plus we have many economic interest with them. It&#x27;s unlikely any politician would ban those apps .<p>Trump tried with Tik Tok, a judge blocked the order[0], and I agree with the justice.
