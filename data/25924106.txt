E.g. &quot;if you see this code, I automatically grant to you a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to do whatever you want with it, including re-mixing it, re-distributing it under any license you want, or anything else you might think of.&quot; Or is this _worse_? Any lawyers in the room? :)')
