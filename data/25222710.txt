Almost every build at Google is extremely parallelized, and if you need to run flake tests, running a suite of tests 10,000 times is almost as fast as running it once.<p>This is available outside Google now - start at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bazelbuild&#x2F;remote-apis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bazelbuild&#x2F;remote-apis</a> or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.bazel.build&#x2F;versions&#x2F;master&#x2F;remote-execution.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.bazel.build&#x2F;versions&#x2F;master&#x2F;remote-execution.ht...</a> . It&#x27;s a standardized API, supported by a growing set of build tools (notably Bazel, Pants, Please) with a variety of OSS and Commercial implementations. At this point almost anyone can set up Remote Execution if they wish to, and remote caching is even easier.<p>Minor terminology correction: RBE generally refers to Google&#x27;s own implementation of the same name; Remote Execution (RE) and the REAPI are used to refer to the generic concept.<p>(Disclaimer: I work on this at Google.)')
