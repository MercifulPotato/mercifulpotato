That said, as a Mac user—a system with a great deal more common heritage with Linux—knowing that such a compatibility approach for (say) Docker hasn’t even been attempted, despite the huge amount of developer goodwill it could generate, because the OSes are so significantly different... I’m impressed that WSL 1 was even tried.<p>Also as such an outsider, I have to wonder if a similar approach in the opposite direction (bring core Windows APIs more in line with *nix, build traditional Windows environment compatibility layers on top for existing software, eventually become a Linux) might have been a more expensive but more successful and future proof approach. Even so, that sounds (even in the abstract) a lot to ask. Even from one of the largest software vendors in existence.<p>I’m sure there’s a ton of details I’m missing or getting confused, but it’s interesting brain food for me as someone fully in the Apple ecosystem but perpetually casually watching the MS ecosystem and its improvements as a backup plan.')
