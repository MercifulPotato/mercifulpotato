What I did find was a load of circling around the subject from a distant philosophical perspective, all boiling down to essentially &quot;you know what, there exist problems that ownership semantics aren&#x27;t suitable for&quot; (but using lots of wisely-sounding language), forgetting to present the problems.<p>The article also suffers from the syndrome of taking a feature of a language and pretending that everything has to be seen through the lens of that feature. Well, newsflash: ownership semantics apply to only some things in Rust. They apply to values and bindings. But they don&#x27;t apply to e.g. indices. I can take as create as many i&#x27;s, where i=5, all referring to the same Vec, which later are going to be used to mutate the Vec, as I like, and Rust won&#x27;t stop me. Similarly, there is Rc and Arc.')
