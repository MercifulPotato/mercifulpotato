Do you think Bush and Trump couldnâ€™t have matched the popular vote share of congressional Republicans<p>Those aren&#x27;t independent variables, though.  Those elections are on the same ballot.  In fact the republican house vote in 2016 was about 3M votes <i>less</i> than Clinton got.  So... no, Trump wouldn&#x27;t have been able to win the popular vote in that election merely by getting all the votes republicans got in the house.  Because he already got them.  Lots of voters voted for Trump in those competetive house districts who <i>didn&#x27;t cast a vote for a representative at all</i>.<p>I know that argument sounds good, but it doesn&#x27;t work numerically.')
