I could use my property to make X, or I can just buy X from my neighbour and make the claim that my property isn&#x27;t used to make X, and is therefore uncontaminated and clean.<p>You can&#x27;t get China to make your polluting garbage, and then blame China for being the worlds polluter.<p>It&#x27;s Americans who demand massive trucks to drive on hours-long commutes every day instead of building public transport; who fight wars for fossil fuels to burn.<p>&gt; Interesting how America is always to blame for the world&#x27;s problems.<p>Not interesting at all.
