Why aren&#x27;t <i>you</i> doing it? Are you also afraid of repercussions inside your own country if you call them out? Knowing it&#x27;s a crime and keeping quiet makes you complicit. Unless you don&#x27;t actually care about the crime, just the perpetrator, which invalidates the premise of your comment which was:<p>&gt; A government should not be able to act like that and still get to to interact normally with the rest of international society.<p>Obviously it can. Other government and the hundreds of millions of people they represent prove it.')
