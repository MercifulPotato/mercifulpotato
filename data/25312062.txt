Item(by='jkaplowitz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607146354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25308861, text='I don&#x27;t want to work for a manager who will never think: &quot;Huh, this situation is serious enough for someone to make this kind of ultimatum. Who is right and why? Let me take a moment to think about it with an open mind and pick the most appropriate reaction regardless of what I previously thought.&quot;<p>Sometimes the person making an ultimatum is right, sometimes they&#x27;re wrong. It shouldn&#x27;t be as adversarial as viewing yielding as weak. Insisting on always &quot;winning&quot; is in my view the weak position.<p>Additionally, firing someone is not always legal in some countries, even after an ultimatum, assuming they pick the wording of their ultimatum carefully (e.g. &quot;I may very well resign if&#x2F;unless [desired condition]&quot;) to retain control over whether they will later finalize their conditional decision to resign.<p>As one example, in Quebec, employees who don&#x27;t qualify as &quot;senior management&quot; and who have been employed at a company there for an uninterrupted period of at least 2 years <i>cannot</i> legally be fired without what the law considers good cause, period, not even if the company gives them a notice period or pay in lieu. Any alleged noncompliance or misconduct that falls short of the most extreme examples must be first dealt with a graduated process of progressively stronger discipline, and it must be possible for someone to recover from that instead of having the outcome of the process as a foregone conclusion. There is a government tribunal to which an aggrieved party can appeal if they aren&#x27;t happy with the outcome, with the power to order remedies including back pay and even reinstatement.<p>Similar things are found in many European countries, though certainly not all.<p>Of course, ultimatums with more definitive wording like &quot;I resign if&#x2F;unless [condition that the listener has control over]&quot; -- note the absence of hesitating words like &quot;may very well&quot; -- can irreversibly become an effective resignation worldwide, based on choice of the listener on whether to satisfy or reject the condition.')
