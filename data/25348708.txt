Imagine Amazon stepping in and funding the CentOS replacement.  They&#x27;d capture a huge chunk of the SME market within two years.<p>Amazon already has its own distribution in the form of Amazon Linux, a derivative of RHEL.  Seems like a short walk to provide an unsupported, Amazon branded, bare metal RHEL-based distribution that also happens to align its users with AWS.  The really smart thing would be to start there but then fork slowly and eventually diverge from RHEL in fundamental ways.')
