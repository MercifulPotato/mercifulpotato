My issue is mostly that Twitter isn&#x27;t using that as a policy (at least not as a stated policy) but a more vague thing like &quot;can&#x27;t contain information gained by unauthorized access&quot; and then applies that selectively.<p>I kind of understand why they don&#x27;t, because that would likely be hard to quantify and you&#x27;d have to decide what basket a company goes into, which would act as a gate keeper (if you don&#x27;t have a good track record, or none at all, you can&#x27;t publish visibly) and they&#x27;d likely have to constantly monitor for changes. Not something that scales well or can be automated, and definitely something where they&#x27;d get roasted each time the NYT commits a faux pas.<p>&gt; If the current publishers don&#x27;t suffer any repercussions for anything, how will it be different if Twitter is considered the publisher?<p>True. In a post-fact world, consequences for publishers reporting falsehoods might need to come back on the table. On the one hand that&#x27;s a problem because it stifles reporting, on the other hand they have been playing very loose and saying &quot;oops, sorry, we&#x27;ll do better next time, promise&quot; every time doesn&#x27;t work.')
