I was looking for weeks for this special model as it was the first 13&quot; model with the right ports that offered 2 so-dimm slots, so I emailed them about it before it was listed to be among the first to receive it.<p>Funnily enough HP in their own specsheet made the mistake of declaring it as only supporting 32GB which then lead to me having to very forcefully demand them to just order the memory at my risk and install it anyway. \nOf course it works beautifully.')
