I bind them with either:<p>* Staples -- For when I don&#x27;t care. Staples are the lowest quality by far and are only used if I&#x27;m disposing of the document very soon.<p>* 2-hole + prong fastener -- 2-hole binding is extremely cheap. Prong fasteners are not as cheap as staples, but still come in packs of ~100+ and solidly bind documents.<p>* Comb-binder -- The comb binding machine is on the order of ~$100+, but combs themselves are only a ~dime each. Not as cheap as staples or 2-hole prongs, but combs have the best quality (lays flat, strong binding, turns smoothly, etc. etc.)<p>----------<p>What&#x27;s listed here is book-binding as an art. Stitched binding + glue will offer strong and beautiful books. Which is certainly useful for one-off projects, for weddings or something special like that.')
