You are <i>privileged</i> not only to have <i>Americanized</i> parents, but you are <i>privileged</i> because you are an <i>American</i>. Your world is way better than that of a common Indian student. Most Indian students <i>need</i> a job, just to be able to <i>feed</i> their families. \nQuoting from the article:<p>&quot;When push comes to shove (which is the permanent state for most Indians), we only care about one thing, survival.&quot;<p>When it&#x27;s about survival, everything else goes out the window.
