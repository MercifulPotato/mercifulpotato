One of those has the potential of causing very immediate panic and potential injury or death as people rush to escape a non-existant fire. The other leads to people thinking dumb things about politics.<p>&gt;For example, they typically refer to things like mail-in voting as &quot;fraud&quot; to begin with.<p>Ok, so wouldn&#x27;t it be the people who seek out and watch these kinds videos that would be the ones that would be too afraid to use mail in ballots? Seems like the people who think those videos are nonsense won&#x27;t believe them anyway.<p>&gt;All of this has a chilling effect on democracy and people exercising their lawful right to vote by post<p>How? From what I understand, there was a record number of mail in ballots this year, seems like it did nothing of the sort.<p>&gt;More Senators (from both parties) should be joining the named ones about cracking down on misinformation.<p>No, the government should not be allowed to decide what is or isn&#x27;t real information, that&#x27;s called propaganda.')
