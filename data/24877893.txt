The MBP is my main computer. The bulge developed around the release of mac os high sierra when for some reason the external GPU was running full tilt and the computer would get pretty hot pretty often. Changed the battery after the heating situation subsided, no bulge since. That was 2.5 years ago.<p>Ditto for the GS5 which I would often use for wifi connection sharing and would also heat up quite often.<p>The tablet and phone both sit around doing nothing all they long so they basically never heat up.')
