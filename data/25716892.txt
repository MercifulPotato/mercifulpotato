It was because of the ratio of that kind of content to all the content.<p>Turns out if your only differentiator is you allow X that your competitor doesn&#x27;t allow, you get a ton of X.<p>Whether it&#x27;s porn, hate speech, illegal products, you name it.<p>You&#x27;re inviting yourself to become a haven for X.<p>-<p>Also please confirm: You said Twitter only removes Right Wing content&quot;<p>Do you stand by such a statement? Because further discourse with you from me will rely on speaking  within the realm of reality.<p>-<p>Reply to both comments since now I&#x27;m rate limited:<p>Two comments back to back showing a tendency to read things in the most convenient way...<p>Those images, literally just those images, are not why Parler was banned.
