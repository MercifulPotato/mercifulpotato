I was so excited, then they lost me at Go.<p>Dream bigger: why is Kubernetes so complex? Re-inventing what we already have. Why is it so complex? Lack of standards, lack of flexibility, too much focus on features.<p>A Linux system has a lot of complexity, but it very rarely gets in the way of the other bits, and it can [mostly] all be replaced as needed. Why? ABI compatibility, kernel-userland split, a big collection of independent composeable tools, a framework that provides everything you need but doesn&#x27;t force you to use it in the most difficult way, and definitely doesn&#x27;t force &quot;patterns&quot; on you (like &quot;deployment&quot;).<p>On top of Linux, we&#x27;ve built the world&#x27;s most advanced and wide-ranging systems, particularly because it&#x27;s <i>not</i> opinionated. It gives you just enough rope and bamboo to build a hovel or a skyscraper. It is <i>not modern</i>, it isn&#x27;t the best design, it doesn&#x27;t force you into the minutia of understanding the system.<p>A new Kubernetes should either be stupidly simple, or incorporate itself into the OS, since the OS already has most if not all of the components of Kubernetes. They&#x27;re just not being used properly.')
