For local apps accessing hardware or data, I can often control whether it sends that data elsewhere.<p>A web app almost by definition uses the network, so if I give it access to my camera or my file system then it’s very hard to know exactly if or where that data is sent.<p>This isn’t perfect for native either, the dialog to accept network usage is basically a blanket grant to connect anywhere or send anything.')
