The 2008 business plan proposed a 2028 completion date for Phase 1 and a one-way fare of $55 from Los Angeles to San Francisco. In 2012, the Authority re-estimated the project&#x27;s cost at $53.4 billion ($2011) or $68.4 billion (YOE). Federal funds are dependent upon rail service, though not necessarily high-speed, starting on operational rails by December 2022. In 2018, the Authority pushed estimated costs to between $63.2 billion and $98.1 billion (YOE) and delayed initial service to 2029, with Los Angeles to San Francisco service in 2033. Environment reviews for the entire San Francisco to Anaheim route would continue.The cost for Bakersfield to Merced is $12.4 billion.[..]')
