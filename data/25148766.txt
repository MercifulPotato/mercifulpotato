I&#x27;ve used every OS you can imagine going back to VMS. I like Mac OS the best.<p>I missed the whole &quot;keyboardgate&quot; thing. My daily driver is a 2012 MBP with 16Gb RAM and 512Gb storage. It still does everything I need to do. From the development side that means running multiple VMs, running Docker and general application development. From the creative side that means writing and recording music with Logic Pro and working with photos in Adobe&#x27;s Lightroom.<p>That&#x27;s what Mac does so well - it gives me a good platform for both development and my creative outlets. I was recently thinking about my options for moving off of the Mac platform and they&#x27;re rather bleak. On the software side Ubuntu Studio looks like the best option but on the hardware side? Slim pickings. For starters there&#x27;s nothing, and I mean <i>nothing</i>, that compares with Apple&#x27;s trackpad. Then there&#x27;s the fact that the &quot;Apple Tax&quot; has largely evaporated - by the time I get a similarly-configured PC I&#x27;m in the same ballpark price-wise as a Mac. But I have a worse software experience.<p>I&#x27;m looking hard at the new MBA. I&#x27;m likely going to need a new machine in 2021&#x2F;2022. At a minimum homebrew and Docker need to be working before I can make a switch. I&#x27;ve been stoked hearing that the performance of x86 applications are as good or even better than their performance on the current generation of MBP&#x27;s. That&#x27;s an impressive feat! Plus I figure if I ever need a &quot;genuine x86&quot; I can always spin-up an EC2 instance.<p>For development <i>and</i> creativity it&#x27;s hard to beat a Mac!')
