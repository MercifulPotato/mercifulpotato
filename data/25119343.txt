Neither of these arguments are supported by the FT data.  To be fair, it&#x27;s not clear how to quantify people that might be dying due to lockdown-related causes (eg. suicide, untreated health issues), but this appears to be smaller than Covid-19 deaths.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m curious why this is getting downvoted.')
