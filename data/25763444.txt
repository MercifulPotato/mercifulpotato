That kind of is the point of vendoring and static linking: not making to much assumptions about what is there and what version it is in. Works great at the cost of a few extra MB, which in most cases is a complete non issue for the user.<p>Debian self-inflicts this breakage by trying to share libraries and dependencies between packages. That both locks you in to obsolete stuff and creates inflexibility. Third parties actively try to not have this problem. Debian is more flaky on this front than it technically needs to be.<p>Kind of the point of the article is that to vendor or not to vendor is a hot topic for Debian exactly because of this.')
