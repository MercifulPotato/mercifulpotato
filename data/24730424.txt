If &quot;no-code&quot; or &quot;low-code&quot; was such a godsend, then we&#x27;d all be using visual programming tools instead of writing code directly. Now, why is it that visual programming tools haven&#x27;t taken over? It&#x27;s because, at the end of the day, textual interfaces are vastly more performant and efficient.<p>The entire gist behind these tools that try to get away from &quot;code&quot; is based on the assumption that code somehow makes things more expensive or difficult. I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true.')
