There is no technology which dominates us both as individuals and collectively. There is technology which some humans use to dominate other humans, and technology which collectively we seem to be somewhat defenseless against, despite it having very little agency itself.<p>But neither of those two cases are caused by a &quot;more&quot; dominant intelligence.')
