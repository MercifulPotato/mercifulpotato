It will be better to make a seamless DSL based on general purpose language like D language and you do not have to re-invent most of the libraries (and C library support in D is second to none). Arguably the most successful recent effort on array based scientific programming language is Julia and it is still very much dependent on some Fortran based libraries for speed. While with D you can go &quot;turtle all the way down&quot; and still meet the speed requirements that are needed in scientific computing [5].<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Array_programming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Array_programming</a><p>[2]<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sac-home.org&#x2F;doku.php" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sac-home.org&#x2F;doku.php</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futhark-lang.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futhark-lang.org&#x2F;</a><p>[4]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Comparison_of_vector_algebra_and_geometric_algebra" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Comparison_of_vector_algebra...</a><p>[5]<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mir.dlang.io&#x2F;glas&#x2F;benchmark&#x2F;openblas&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;23&#x2F;glas-gemm-benchmark.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mir.dlang.io&#x2F;glas&#x2F;benchmark&#x2F;openblas&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;23&#x2F;...</a>')
