Additionally, I blocked news sites in my browser and subscribed to both the Economist for current events and the Athletic for my sports addiction.<p>At first, it was strange- there was a constant feeling that I was missing out on things happening that all my friends and family were in on. I realized, after a while, that I now spend more time improving myself personally rather than worrying about what others are doing.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say I am less distracted.. but it&#x27;s a different kind of distraction. Rather than finding myself aimlessly browsing a never-ending stream of posts on Reddit, I am now trying to answer questions on Stackoverflow. Rather than reading through posts of my peers landing internships and stressing myself out, I spend time on my resume and learning Go.<p>Also, people text and call me now rather than shooting me a message on social media which is honestly really nice. Even more so with the current COVID climate.<p>The most important part though is that I feel as if I have spent more meaningful time with my significant other.<p>Another change is that I separated my devices.<p>My laptop ONLY has stuff for school and programming on it. Our iPad has the entertainment in books, games, etc (radio.garden has been fun exploring). My phone has all the default Apple programs only. Since doing so, I can&#x27;t count the number of times I picked up my phone subconsciously, swiped through it realizing there isn&#x27;t anything on there, then asking myself why I even picked it up to begin with.<p>Sorry for the rant.. it&#x27;s just been a strange adjustment that is showing benefits personally.')
