Why simulate a whole universe when you can just simulate one localized area, what we perceive of as the whole universe could just be &#x27;fed&#x27; to us existing, while not really existing.<p>But the voyager probes too could ink out of existence, and the signals they&#x27;re sending back wouldn&#x27;t expand the map, they would just be hijacked by the simulation to send back whatver the devs wanted it to.')
