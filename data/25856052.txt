Prior to this I had a coworker that really liked using the convention:<p><pre><code>  &quot;{value}&quot;.format(**locals())\n</code></pre>\nI thought it was clever at first, but this made refactoring really hard because you would move around these strings or variables and lose track of what&#x27;s happening. Maybe IDEs are better at helping with this in recent years?')
