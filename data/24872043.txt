Along our PotE lies most of our solar system debris. Shouldn&#x27;t that be obstructing alien views?</i><p>Space crap is a lot less dense than you might think. Generally speaking, flying through the asteroid belt edge on looks like... well, just flying through space.<p>Turn it around: the space crap doesn&#x27;t really prevent us from getting good views of Jupiter, Saturn, etc. Right? And it wouldn&#x27;t prevent us from seeing Mars or Venus if they were outside of the belt either.<p>The total mass of the asteroid belt is estimated at something like 5% of the Moon&#x27;s, and a third of it is accounted for by Ceres alone. It&#x27;s spread pretty darn thin.<p>The Kuiper belt is <i>much</i> more massive, but is spread out even more thinly. Same again for the Oort cloud, where the average spacing between comet-sized bodies is about the same as the distance from Earth to Saturn.<p>A favorite quote from a relevant reference work: <i>“Space is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist’s, but that’s just peanuts to space.”</i>')
