The combustion energy in a kilo of wood is measured in megajoules; the amount of energy needed to elevate the temperature of a kilo of wood by a degree is measured in kilojoules. So while you&#x27;re right that the energy budget needed to combust new fuel goes up by 40% or so if the fuel is at -50Â°C, the energy budget going into that is only a percent or so fo the total energy the wildfire is putting out. The rest of the energy beyond what&#x27;s needed to bring fuel up to combustion point is going into making massive walls of glowing flames, mile-high convection columns of air, sending smoke thousands of miles, etc., etc...<p>That is, in many ways, precisely what makes it a wildfire, rather than a smouldering ember.<p>In the limit - when a fire is dying out - then I guess, for sure, changing the fuel temperature can sap a larger part of the energy budget.')
