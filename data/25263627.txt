Did some ranked games, and within just ten or so matches the blurb came up saying I &quot;beat&quot; 70% of the players. I&#x27;m fairly sure that just means there&#x27;s a very long tail of players who haven&#x27;t played as much. I&#x27;m sure I could get top 10 or even 1% if I just play more often, moreso than if I get good at the game (because I like to think I&#x27;m very middle of the road, and &#x2F; or that other players are bad because they&#x27;re 8 years old).')
