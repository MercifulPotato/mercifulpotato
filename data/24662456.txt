Sort of a collective, areawide PTSD?<p>Tangentially, I personally wish people would stop using the &quot;culture&quot; excuse for a group&#x27;s bad behavior. Culture doesn&#x27;t develop in a vacuum. Certain cultural practices could potentially come from really problematic sources. Changing one&#x27;s culture isn&#x27;t an insult to anyone if you&#x27;re changing it for the better. And in this case, even if Indian culture is to prostrate before those you see as your superior, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an element of the culture that needs preserving.')
