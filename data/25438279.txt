Users not only report bugs, they even fix bugs and send in fixes. Users work together, conversing by email, to get to the bottom of a problem and make the software work trouble-free.&quot;<p>And Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS) takes away your freedom: (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;who-does-that-server-really-s...</a>)<p>&quot;The basic point is, you can have control over a program someone else wrote (if it&#x27;s free), but you can never have control over a service someone else runs, so never use a service where in principle a program would do.<p>With free software, we, the users, take back control of our computing. Proprietary software still exists, but we can exclude it from our lives and many of us have done so. However, we are now offered another tempting way to cede control over our computing: Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS). For our freedom&#x27;s sake, we have to reject that too.<p>With SaaSS, the server operator can change the software in use on the server. He ought to be able to do this, since it&#x27;s his computer; but the result is the same as using a proprietary application program with a universal back door: someone has the power to silently impose changes in how the user&#x27;s computing gets done.<p>Thus, SaaSS is equivalent to running proprietary software with spyware and a universal back door. It gives the server operator unjust power over the user, and that power is something we must resist.&quot;')
