The &quot;conditioning access&quot; quote is not directly about Facebook. The 400-page linked document talks about conditioning access in reference to google pushing search use via its android apps, analogous to what I stated above with facebook pushing their network.<p>As for the statements specifically about Facebook which the linked article did quote, they describe Facebook doing exactly what I said is the problem, namely not allowing competitors to use its platform.')
