It is opinion at best.<p>Please know that the whole world doesn’t hate you, and just because a publication writes words that do not align with your beliefs it does not make them a “propaganda machine.”<p>I cannot meet you further in the middle than this, because I cannot accept conspiracy theories as truth. But I am here to talk if you want to step away from that darkness.')
