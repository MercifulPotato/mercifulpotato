Esp. public sector unions? They may not have their fingers in the pot, but they still likely a massive barrier.<p>&gt; What about exposing the fact that a ton of workers in infrastructure are in the country illegally? Who&#x27;s going to &#x27;clamp down&#x27; on that and pay the political price?<p><i>Unions</i> are going to clamp down and pay the political price of squashing illegal labor. That&#x27;s their whole purpose of existing! Anti-union sentiment in America reflects significant cognitive dissonance on this issue.<p>Public unions are a different matter. They&#x27;re entrenched largely because private sector unions have disappeared. With greater private sector unionization public employees wouldn&#x27;t dominate union lobbying as much as they do, and politicians wouldn&#x27;t feel as obliged to protect them if there existed a larger pool of well paying, stable private sector jobs for the working class.')
