If you are using an accelerator behind a bus you always have to make sure there is enough work for the accelerator to justify a data transfer. GPUs are built around the idea of batching a lot of work and running it in parallel. You can make an FPGA work like that but you are throwing away the low latency benefits of FPGAs.')
