VMs don&#x27;t meticulously emulate all attached virtual devices.  Paravirtualized device drivers more or less forward the I&#x2F;O request to the hypervisor which handles it in a VM-specific way.  For example, it&#x27;s not super useful for a VM to emulate all the bitwise register-twiddling dances needed to talk to a SATA controller, it can simply have some &quot;backdoor&quot; channel into the hypervisor that says &quot;Queue request to write X to LBA Y for this VM&quot;.<p>Since paravirtualization requires specific drivers, it will always be detected.')
