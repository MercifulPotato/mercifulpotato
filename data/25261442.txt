Item(by='tachyonbeam', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606788035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25259465, text='Personally, when I think of biotech, I think of gene editing, growing organs in a vat, etc. I would tend to put brain-computer interfaces in a different category.<p>That being said, I think that biotech is not progressing much because there&#x27;s a lot of regulations slowing down research, and nobody has really demonstrated a &quot;killer app&quot; yet. I think what could happen, is that we will eventually be able to use gene therapy to really effectively kill cancers, and then funding is just going to pour into the field at 50 times the current rate.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of other cool things we could do with gene editing, like fixing incurable depression, life extension, fixing genetic diseases, curing irritable bowel syndrome and dangerous allergies, but there&#x27;s currently not enough funding, and there&#x27;s not enough excitement, people are too worried about &quot;ethical&quot; implications.<p>I think it might be similar with brain-computer interfaces. Someone needs to spend a lot of money to get the first version working. It&#x27;s possible that Elon Musk will win that race with Neuralink. If we can have a brain implant that allows a paraplegic person to move a robot arm, send texts and make themselves dinner... 10 years later you will have disabled people walking with exoskeletons and hackers hooking themselves up to computers. It could all happen within our lifetime. We just need someone to make that first killer demo, then funding pours in, 100 startups pop up overnight, and innovation really takes off.')
