He succeeded in becoming, for a while, the type of wealthy person he imagined as a young man that he wanted to become.<p>Success achieving a <i>higher purpose</i> may be illustrated by Terence Fletcher from Whiplash. He succeeded in turning musicians with talent into accomplished performers.<p>Both personalities could be considered &#x27;dark&#x27;. One succeeded by being a charming pathological liar. The other by dismissing any sense of empathy and driving others with severe, manipulative criticism.<p>But in the end, it was type a) that eventually flamed out and type b) that had an enduring impact on his profession.<p>I think the notion of &#x27;how to get the most out of people&#x27; actually depends on the people you are trying to get the most out of. Many musicians quit under Terence because the achievement was not worth the suffering along the way. Others were motivated to excellence by his style, and he didn&#x27;t care that they hated him for it.')
