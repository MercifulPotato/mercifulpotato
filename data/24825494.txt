Now, imagine tracing (0,0,0) when you are at (500,500,500). Trivial.<p>Now, trace (0,0,10^100). That is a huge Z-line you would say. This is the side view.<p>Now, move to (0,0,10^100) from (500,500,500).\nThis is the top view. What do you see?<p>Another example:\nWhen viewed from perpendicular to X-Y plane, a circular motion on X-Y plane looks properly circular.<p>When the same motion is viewed standing far away on the X-axis, the motion resembles an oscillation.<p>Same motion, different perspectives, seemingly different results.')
