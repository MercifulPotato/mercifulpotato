I was wrong, you are more interested in attacking people and defending yourself than discussing anything.<p>&gt; &quot;Through the credible threat of violence, the racketeers deter people from swindling, robbing, injuring, sabotaging or otherwise harming their clients.&quot;<p>Ok, so the CIA approaches their mark, in this case their own government. They say we will threaten other actors that threaten you, in exchange for money. You&#x27;ve just described the Pentagon, DoD, and every standing army on earth. A &quot;broader protection racket&quot; can literally mean any security service, from mall guard to 4-star general.<p>Besides, you are being disingenuous. When people think of a &quot;protection racket&quot; they think of extortion and the mob, not the broad security guarantees of an army or intel service.<p>Or as clearly stated on wikipedia:<p>&gt; &quot;Protection rackets are indistinguishable in practice from extortion rackets&quot;<p>You a deflecting from the accepted definition of a term you used in order to make your original claim less fantastical and attention seeking. I don&#x27;t blame you for making such a claim, social media and websites that allow for upvoting are made for such actions.<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean you are anywhere near correct.')
