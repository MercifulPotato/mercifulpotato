That&#x27;s a failure mode for this site and we ban accounts that do it, regardless of which politics they&#x27;re battling for. We have to ban them in order to have a chance of surviving for the purpose the site exists for.<p>Btw, generalizations like &quot;HN has always had a libertarian&#x2F;right leaning nature&quot; are in the eye of the beholder. I could give you a long, long, long list of the other side saying that the site is dominated by left&#x2F;etc. views. In both cases it&#x27;s a cognitive bias, basically a variation of sample bias: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dat...</a>.')
