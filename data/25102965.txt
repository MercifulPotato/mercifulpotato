I am extroverted (for a SWE) and bad at staying focused when nobody is around to peek at my screen. Work at a company where everything needs to be signed off, things need to always be clearly communicated, etc. so constantly having to context switch projects while I’m blocked on waiting for someone else to stop ignoring me.<p>The one thing that makes me happy about my current job is fixing support tickets. But nobody in my management chain really cares about it so it’s pretty much just a work-hobby. Ironically that makes it much more enjoyable because nobody else (managers, tls, product managers, etc.) will take credit for my work and I don&#x27;t have to get signoff on every little thing.')
