The definition of coup is not “attack on the government”; it’s an attempt to take <i>over</i> the government by force. There is no plausible path to take over the government by seizing a courthouse. Even if they’d successfully held it, they would have no real power over any territory outside the building. Disruptive, yes, but not a power grab.<p>Arguably some of the stuff happening with the autonomous zone wasn’t a coup attempt, it was an attempt at secession. A stupid and doomed attempt, I’ll agree, but a different thing altogether.<p>There is a plausible path from taking over Congress <i>while they’re certifying the electoral college and declaring the next president</i> and power. I’ll admit that it’s not a likely outcome, but it’s plausible. It wouldn’t be the first time a government has been toppled by a mob taking over the legislature, ask France. If they’d succeeded they would have re-installed Trump contrary to the will of the voters, the rule of law, and the constitution. Hence, coup attempt.')
