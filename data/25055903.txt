A democratic (small D) atmosphere where the newspaper’s hierarchy does not seem to matter. Interesting that the tech and data workers of the times feel as justified in opining on the paper’s direction as the writers and editors. This article makes it sound as if the insurrection from within is driven partly by those who are not producing the main content of the paper.<p>I was surprised to read that the opinion section garners 20% of the reads despite being 10% of the content. I personally avoid the opinion section because it feels impotent; the republicans control the government and indignant opinions change nothing about that.')
