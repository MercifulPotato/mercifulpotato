We know that one of the primary tools of activists (or insurrectionists &#x2F; terrorists depending on your point of view) in other countries are WhatsApp groups, and other encrypted chat platforms.<p>If one is organising a serious insurrection, then I believe one does not normally broadcast their plans to the enemy. That’s kinda strikes me as op-sec 101.<p>Only in a free and open society could you possibly hope to organise an insurrection in public, on broadcast platforms, without direct and immediate consequences brought down by the state. We must be so pampered to believe that the right to organise in public is a requirement insurrection.')
