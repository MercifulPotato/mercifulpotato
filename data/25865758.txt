The change in license goes into effect in the 7.11 release. Code contributed under Apache stays that way.<p>Typically open source projects have only a handful of core developers - with a large majority being pass-by contributors interested in fixing their problems&#x2F;use case. Characterizing it to sound like all these developers are being slighted is strange.<p>Not being able to reap what you sow is a problem with open source. I don’t doubt we are seeing less great software being shared in the open because of it. If we want more useful software shared as open source we should fix this. The Amazon problem doesn’t help.
