Why do you think I didn&#x27;t understand the rather limited independent variables in my measurements or not understand the experimental setup well enough to debug experiments which I hadn&#x27;t been involved in?  Make good measurements of the right things.  That&#x27;s what advances experimental science.  Obviously have a basic understanding of statistics for guidance.')
