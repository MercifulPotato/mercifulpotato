If you want to know how much of that is true and how much is wrong just watch this video <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;FBF6F4Bi6Sg?t=703" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;FBF6F4Bi6Sg?t=703</a><p>I don&#x27;t think I can do it justice with a butchered summary on HN but I&#x27;ll keep it long enough to get you hooked. There are two phases during a deglaciation and CO2 lags in the first one and leads in the second one.<p>We have basically skipped the first phase by emitting CO2 directly. If anything, this should worry us even more because there is evidence that increased temperatures drive CO2 emissions as well. So we haven&#x27;t skipped the first phase at all, it&#x27;s going to happen in the future.<p>Feedback loops have been predicted by many scientists. What could happen is this: &quot;man-made CO2 -&gt; higher temperatures -&gt; more CO2 -&gt; even higher temperatures&quot;.<p>I recommend you to watch the entire video. Not just the segment I linked.<p>That same content creator also made a whole playlist concerning climate change: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=52KLGqDSAjo&amp;list=PL82yk73N8eoX-Xobr_TfHsWPfAIyI7VAP&amp;index=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=52KLGqDSAjo&amp;list=PL82yk73N8e...</a>')
