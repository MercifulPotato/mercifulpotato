It was based on repeated terms of service violations (as proven by the emails from AWS that Parler itself leaked).<p>Whether AWS was able to make that decision because of the political calculus had changed (e.g. there was demonstrable evidence of real-life violence stemming from plans made on Parler; others had taken action against Parler; AWS&#x27;s employees were publicly calling for Parler to be removed from AWS) -- that&#x27;s a different question.<p>The timing can be political but the decision apolitical.<p>This is ignoring that Parler&#x27;s continued prior existence was likely in part due to the politics (i.e. American conservative allegations that Big Tech&#x27;s pervasively censors right-wing and Republican voices).')
