I have a 4k TV I&#x27;ve been using connected to my gaming computer for awhile running windows 10. I&#x27;ve had no end of issues with various programs becoming horribly confused by display scaling. Some applications ignore the display scaling entirely and end up tiny, and other applications (particularly some games) end up with 4x size on UI elements - which looks utterly awful. Its pretty clear lots of game developers never test with HiDPI displays.<p>In comparison I&#x27;ve never had a problem on macos. All macos applications I run seem to render correctly no matter what resolution and dpi settings my various displays use. And I can move most applications between displays just fine - with no pop-in or strange behaviour as the resolution of the containing monitor changes. (Except for some web browsers - which detect the transition and re-render content at the new resolution).')
