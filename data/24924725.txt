The wind turbines in the illustration are comically small - wind power increases with the square of the rotor diameter and the cube of the wind speed - which is why modern wind offshore turbines are absolutely massive. They can extract so much more energy from the wind.<p>There&#x27;s enough challenges in just solving wave or tidal power on their own - it seems like a waste of effort to try to do everything in one package.')
