Illegalization and stigmatization of psychedelics was largely political and antagonistic towards the scientific community that was doing actual research. Also anyone curious enough to try out psychedelics will realize they&#x27;re very different from narcotics. In the US there was always a subculture that accepted use of psychedelics, information passing through books, writings, unofficial journals etc. So to say the information wasn&#x27;t accessible just isn&#x27;t true. It may have been hidden, but if it was it was in plain sight and to anyone curious this world was easily accessible and accepting.')
