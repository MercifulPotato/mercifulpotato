I am very much not a genius (check the user name) and it took me less than a minute to understand the payload operator (which IIRC was taken from Ruby or something).<p>Let&#x27;s say `for (x in y) {}` replaced the payload operator. It would still exist in:<p>- if(some_error_union) |value| {} else |err| {}<p>- if(some_nullable) |value| {}<p>- while(some_nullable) |value| {}<p>- switch(some_tagged_union) { .some_tag =&gt; |value| {} }<p>And any that I might be forgetting. Is your suggestion that each of these should have separate syntax, thus complicating the language with one-off syntax?')
