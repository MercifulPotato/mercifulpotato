Not every comment needs to be interesting to everyone.<p><i>&gt; Every major thread on HN has at least one comment trying to force the America Bad angle into the conservation</i><p>This is an extreme exaggeration. Plenty of large threads don&#x27;t discuss this. I&#x27;d wager the vast majority.<p><i>&gt; If the primary conversation - derived from the linked article - is about the US and about a topic having to do with something negative about the USâ€¦</i><p>There are plenty of sub-conversations on every thread that aren&#x27;t explicitly about the main topic. On this post alone, there are comments about the definition of terrorism, bitcoin, health insurance laws, American military action, etc. It seems like you&#x27;re singling out &quot;criticism of America&quot; as the only taboo topic for no real reason.<p><i>&gt; Imagine if every large thread had someone trying to force comments about all the bad things France or Britain have done.</i><p>Nobody is &quot;forcing&quot; comments. People are leaving comments. About all sorts of opinions, including those criticizing other countries. And absolutely none of this happens on &quot;every large thread&quot;.<p><i>&gt; someone being triggered and unable to control theirself</i><p>Didn&#x27;t sound like the commenter was triggered at all.')
