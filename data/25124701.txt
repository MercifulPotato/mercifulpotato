It&#x27;s just that at the time our email protocol was defined,<p>email supports unsending in exactly the same ways you described for packages. It most definitely is a property of messaging.<p>Your fron porch is called &quot;outbox&quot;. works the same - you can delete from outbox before sending.<p>If both you and your recipient are on a properly configured Microsoft Exchange server, you <i>can</i> unsend a message, which is similar to the university department.<p>And if you aren&#x27;t, you can still send a message saying &quot;hey, please don&#x27;t open the last email&quot;, and it&#x27;s up to the other side if they do or don&#x27;t.<p>For better and worse, email has a lot of similarity to real mail, down to the distinction between content and envelope.<p>The main difference is the speed of delivery - you would not expect any of the ways you suggested to work 3 months after you&#x27;ve sent your package -- and yet, compared to the 500ms or so that it takes the email to reach the recipient, that&#x27;s what attempting to unsend after one minute is.')
