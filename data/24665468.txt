Over the last three years, this has progressed from a pilot project to running almost all of our production services at immense scale.<p>Besides Kubernetes, we are in the process of rolling Istio out, and use Terraform, AWS and Chef extensively. Our team mostly uses Go but it helps to have familiarity with (or a lack of fear of) Java and Ruby, which most of our product teams use.<p>Airbnb has a large number of engineers and users, which creates interesting technical and organisational challenges.<p>The job opening for senior staff engineer is here (and a staff posting will follow soon): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.airbnb.com&#x2F;positions&#x2F;2245198&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.airbnb.com&#x2F;positions&#x2F;2245198&#x2F;</a><p>Note that these positions are for highly experienced engineers and it helps if you have 8+ years of experience and&#x2F;or have acted in a similar capacity in prior roles.<p>Please send me a brief note and resume at sunil.shah@airbnb.com or apply online.')
