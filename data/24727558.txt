Obviously I run the Linux battery tools, but so do the other OSs their own.<p>i3 here is the ‘magic’ part because with other, more mac&#x2F;windows like window managers, the battery life is comparable, however, I cannot turn those off on mac&#x2F;win so I cannot test if that is really the case. But if I use, say, unity, the battery life drops to at or below what it does with it’s native system.')
