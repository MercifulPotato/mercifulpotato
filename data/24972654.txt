Item(by='Igelau', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604348086, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24969631, text='&gt; A number of journalists have decided the technology is entirely confusing and deceitful.<p>It&#x27;s not the journalists I&#x27;m worried about. It&#x27;s the advertisers.<p>&gt; Deepfakes are just the next wave of photoshop. People don&#x27;t use photoshop to steal elections and win court cases. They use it to make memes. It&#x27;s the same deal with deepfakes.<p>You say that now. By 2024 we&#x27;ll be getting served political ads depicting &quot;Person who looks like my cousin&quot; in a riot, &quot;Child that looks so much like mine&quot; being shoved into the backdoor of a pizza parlor, or &quot;Sad sack that looks like me&quot; standing in an unemployment line. Fairly certain we all signed away the permission to use our likenesses in the various TOS.<p>It&#x27;s also going to be a whole new vein for bullying, e.g. &quot;Goofus hates Gallant. Most kids hate Gallant. Goofus posts low-grade deepfakes of Gallant dying and committing acts of self-harm. The bodies and the hair don&#x27;t match at all since the source GIFs are from movies and tv, but it&#x27;s definitely Gallant&#x27;s face. Goofus gets a short term dopamine burst from his fake internet points as his peers pluslike and cross-post. One day Gallant decides, &#x27;maybe they&#x27;re right&#x27;&quot;<p>I know it sounds like panicky, theatric, Black Mirror script stuff, but there are no missing pieces to keep either of these from being a button click away. It just might not be quite cheap enough <i>yet</i>.')
