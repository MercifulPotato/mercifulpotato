And you know what? I LOVE IT. I love it so much I&#x27;ve migrated all other API&#x27;s in the business over and got to delete thousands of lines of code that weren&#x27;t necessary anymore. 99% of the time, REST API&#x27;s are just glue code, mapping HTTP data to database data and vice versa. And for that 1% that you need, for example backwards compatbility with an earlier version of your API, there&#x27;s computed columns, set returning functions, views, etc... You can keep your API compatible with older clients and keep moving your schema forward.\n But the most liberating thing about Postgraphile is that I get to spend a lot more time on the datastructures and frontend development. And it&#x27;s really paying off, features can be delivered much faster, and you don&#x27;t feel useless writing glue code all the time. This thing for real improved my life.')
