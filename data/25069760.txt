If their CPU&#x2F;IC design segment were its own company, the M1 would never have seen the light of day. Period.<p>Eh, that&#x27;s some very biased thinking.<p>In the real hardware world of both mechanical and electrical. I can approach a company and say &quot;we want something with these specs, we&#x27;ll buy 10 million pieces per month, what can you do you us?&quot; and that kicks off R&amp;D efforts after some ground contractual agreements to commit both parties.<p>You know, exactly what Microsoft did with AMD when they commissioned unique SOC designs for their consoles with a host of never before implemented features such as direct gpio &lt;-&gt; ssd io.')
