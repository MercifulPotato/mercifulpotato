Despite being a bunch of different forums, Reddit has a certain feel.<p>Design choices in the software influence people&#x27;s behavior, as well as influencing which people join and participate to begin with.  I imagine Facebook groups are largely different than subreddits for the same reason.<p>I was a pretty early Reddit user, I think 2007 or so.  And it definitely got worse, so by ~2012 I had almost entirely stopped using it.<p>But since ~2016, there are a couple communities I like, so I&#x27;m back on there.  There could be gems on Usenet for sure ... but I checked the forums I used to frequent and you know what happened :)')
