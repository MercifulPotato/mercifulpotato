What his editor wanted him to take out was his insinuation that other news outlets&#x27; failure to come up with corroborating evidence is evidence that they are protecting Joe Biden, despite the fact that he, just like them, is a high-profile professional journalist that has looked into the story and found nothing to corroborate it.  On this topic, there is nothing that separates him from any other journalist except his desire to communicate, through his coverage of the same lack of evidence that they already reported, his confidence that the evidence exists.')
