The results in the paper are a little confusing because they report mean and standard deviation while t-tests use mean and standard error.<p>In Table 3, they report the 95% confidence interval for the treatment condition (i.e., receiving cookies) as 0.67â€“11.62, so it seems that the difference between the two conditions is significant at the 5% level. Interestingly, the reported p-value here is &quot;just&quot; 0.02 instead of the &lt;0.001 that they include in the abstract.')
