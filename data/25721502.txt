One example[1].<p>&gt; You know, actually listen to and address their complaints instead of just saying &#x27;you&#x27;re a crazy conspiracy nut.&#x27;<p>There were attempts to address their complaints. Re ounts and audits took place. Those recounts and audits didn&#x27;t change the result or uncover any further evidence of fraud. This didn&#x27;t align with Trump&#x27;s claims so his base dismissed it as lies. The interesting thing coming out of this is that they&#x27;re now turning on the rest of the republican party who accept what their own observers are telling them.<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out that this was all happening while Trump was privately pressuring the Georgia secretary of state to &#x27;find&#x27; him enough votes to win[2].<p>Uncovering fraud was never the motivation here, it&#x27;s a cynical attempt at destroying trust in the election process in order to corrupt the result.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;us-election-2020&#x2F;georgia-recount-trump-biden-cobb-county-b1780298.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;us-electio...</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;10&#x2F;trump-call-georgia-election-find-the-fraud" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;10&#x2F;trump-call-g...</a>')
