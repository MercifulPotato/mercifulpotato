Or rather, nothing very productive. After a couple of years they just seem more dull, intellectually speaking. Unless you have an iron will and very self-driven, it can be hard to motivate yourself to do something at the same level as when you&#x27;re employed, or there&#x27;s lots of risk involved.<p>It&#x27;s really no problem if you&#x27;re in your sixties, and will likely never work again - but retiring at a very young age, there&#x27;s lots of risk and uncertainty involved. Doesn&#x27;t mater how well you plan, you could get forced back into employment.<p>So with that said - I wouldn&#x27;t retire entirely. Rather, become more selective on the work you take, work part-time on projects. Try to become highly competent in some specialized skill, just to keep yourself up to date and motivated.<p>As for money:<p>- Move somewhere cheap\n- Invest enough that you&#x27;ll go in plus after all expenses \n- Live frugally. Lifestyle creep is real, and can obliterate retirement savings.<p>Of course, investments are inherently risky - but speak to some professional about this.')
