It strikes me as dreadfully cynical. Rationalizing one&#x27;s emotions is the entire point of life. We experience something, it confuses us, we try to figure it out and explain it, model it so that we can better predict in the future. In other words, it&#x27;s called &quot;understanding&quot;. Understanding is a good thing, not a bad thing.<p>I think the criticism is better and more narrowly targeted toward those that don&#x27;t prioritize consistency. Yes, from your experiences and emotions, try to derive (or infer, rather) your principles. That&#x27;s <i>fine</i>! But then, don&#x27;t stop there. From there, try to remain consistent with those principles. And if they conflict, use that emotional experience to again understand and update your principles and then try to remain consistent with those.')
