Does God exist?<p>The only answer that makes sense comes from Goethe&#x27;s magnum opus:<p><pre><code>    MARGARET: Do you believe in God?\n\n    FAUST: who dares to confess: \n           ‘I believe in him’?\n           Yet who, in feeling,\n           Self-revealing,\n           Says: ‘I don’t believe’?\n</code></pre>\nHow can a person find meaning? I don&#x27;t think anyone can <i>find</i> meaning. Everyone can <i>give</i> meaning though and that is divine.<p>I like philosophy because enables a person to <i>choose</i> who this person <i>want&#x27;s</i> to be. Not because someone else said so but because he made that choice consciously.<p>If being a Christian has meaning for you, by all means do it! I want to believe that a person is good mannered and kind not because he&#x27;ll go to heaven by doing so, but because he firmly believes that being good mannered is &quot;good&quot; for his spirit, as Socrates would put it.<p>I&#x27;ve came across a talk by Roberto Saviano, the other day. He said something that stuck with me because it was the second time I came across that quote: &quot;Be kind. Random, daily actions of kindness is the most terrifying form resistance!&quot;.')
