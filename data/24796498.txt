It would just turn on at certain times in the day and I&#x27;d find myself humming it.  I have around 3500 CDs, mostly jazz but boatloads of classical stuff too.  For days I rifled through bins of CDs (which is something I love doing) looking for the source.

And it was kind of raspy, which was weird, because the melody seemed more classical and classical clarinetists have super clean tone.  I immediately knew to start looking for Don Byron albums, because he probably makes up 90% of my clarinet jazz albums.  Sure enough, after a couple hours I found it.
