Anyone can log into a government website to pay moneys and get a code.  Have an API for companies to self-issue codes too.<p>If anything arrives at the border without the code affixed, someones gotta pay the taxes before the goods are released.<p>It&#x27;s awfully similar to a system existing in postage for centuries...
