Only HOW they organize it. It looks to me from the article they are using every “cool” tool and seem to care more about the how than the why. And that’s fine if it’s the point of the article which I guess it is, but it seems like it’s “reliably” structuring a husk.<p>I defend the costs of IT and in this case the costs of an SRE approach - but these aren’t the things that make you money and keep your business afloat.<p>When I spend a couple weeks making a system wide event bus to get messages from n to m that’s cool and I need it... but customers don’t pay me for that. They pay me to fix a problem they have.<p>I’m very cautious of articles like this that say all “the right” things but don’t even hint at solving customer problems.')
