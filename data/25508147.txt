And most linux distributions come with or can easily install the qt v4l2 package which can show you a live feed and let you adjust all the webcam&#x27;s parameters that are exposed over UVC - for my current Logitech that&#x27;s the common stuff like resolution, FPS, brightness&#x2F;contrast&#x2F;saturation, but also hardware-specific things like exposure (or autoexposure), pan&#x2F;tilt&#x2F;zoom, and focus &#x2F; autofocus.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure the situation is the same on ChromeOS and Macs. And I&#x27;ve seen that webcams these days also tend to be pretty plug-and-play on Windows.')
