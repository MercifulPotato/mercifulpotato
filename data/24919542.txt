Resolving the conflict of different library dependencies that arises in almost all languages. And with docker I can solve it in a uniform way. If you install something in the system, it will mess it up for others. Some languages do have &quot;native&quot; ways to avoid that, e.g. python has virtualenv, ruby has bundler, java classpaths?... but I still can mess up the system. And it isn&#x27;t like there are different ways how it is then solved.<p>But with docker, I package and isolate the whole OS. So, as a consumer, I do not have to know how to do that for each language, and as a producer, I can do (almost) whatever I want within the container without fearing to mess up other containers or the hosting OS.<p>Yes, this whole approach has its own downsides. But those things are a plus, I would say.')
