Suddenly the &quot;get rich quick&quot; mentality that had caused the 2008 crash was being adopted by senior leadership at Big Tech firms. &quot;<p>Stop with these &#x27;blame wall street&#x27; populist fantasies.<p>The &#x27;fault&#x27; of &#x27;whatever&#x27; is happening is 100% tech and it has nothing to do with bankers.<p>In reality, young people coming into the industry with a different set of values than those that came before them are driving this. A generation that simultaneously declares to be more &#x27;socially conscious&#x27; is literally driving these activities, which is quite hypocritical.<p>The shift is easy to see: people having grown up more separated from their communities, with culturally secular values (not bad one&#x27;s just more intellectual than rooted in relationships with those around them) can simultaneously detach themselves from the consequences of their outcomes at work, while at the same time participating in a &#x27;protest&#x27; about something or the other in order to validate their self-identity as &#x27;socially conscious&#x27;.<p>We&#x27;re going to need a broad set of basic regulations, hopefully not too harsh, probably led by the EU as the only institution that seems to have enough power and wherewithal to care enough.<p>While note making any statement about politics - Biden&#x27;s &#x27;side&#x27; would be the most likely group to be concerned about privacy, and yet we haven&#x27;t heard a peep about them on the issue. The other &#x27;side&#x27; is deeply concerned about &#x27;freedom of expression&#x27; which is good, perhaps they can find a way to make some legislation about it.')
