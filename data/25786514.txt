There’s the ‘idea’ guy and a man&#x2F;woman with ‘vision’. The difference between these two is that someone with a vision enables others to see and feel what they see and feel about the future of a project in a manner that produces action on everybody’s part. The visionary man&#x2F;woman would act in accordance with their vision, because there end goal is to create and&#x2F;or share something truly valuable to others. I could think of a couple of people with visions many of them startup founders: Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Peter Thiel, Paul Graham, and Sam Altman. Visionary man&#x2F;woman take risks on their vision and put their plans into action. Sometimes they’re the business manager, or the scientist, and at other times the engineer, but in some way shape or form they lead others toward a goal through their tremendous clarity in their own and other’s collective vision.')
