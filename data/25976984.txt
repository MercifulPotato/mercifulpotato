Item(by='growse', descendants=None, kids=[25978203], score=None, time=1612079356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25976914, text='&gt; Signal would grow immensely in my eyes if they made the server code open source [SEE EDIT], and allowed an easy way to set the centralised server address in the Signal app. The current server would be the default, and perhaps changing the server would be hidden in Advanced Options for now.<p>I feel like this misses the point of what Signal is. It&#x27;s not <i>just</i> software, it is <i>the network as well</i>. The client is a client that lets you communicate on the Signal network, which is operated centrally. A client that lets you choose a server endpoint is no longer a &quot;Signal client&quot;, it&#x27;s a Signal-compatible network client.<p>People seem to have an expectation that Signal server API is public, and that it should allow any compatible client to connect, or that a given client to connect to any compatible endpoint (in the spirit of public client&#x2F;server internetty stuff). From what I can see, part of the whole point of the centralisation is to take that client&#x2F;server API private so that the &#x27;official&#x27; signal server only ever has to support a single client that they also control (hence allowing rapid iteration, avoiding legacy support etc).<p>&gt; Unfortunately, you cannot change the server address in the app as downloaded from any app store, so my criticism remains.<p>What&#x27;s preventing someone maintaining a client fork where you can do this? We have the code to run a Signal-compatible networks and software that can support this, so why does nobody?')
