You need to get a ticket on an airplane or a boat, which makes travel time a minimum of 1 hour usually and costs a whole bunch of money.  This creates a natural barrier where people on islands don&#x27;t interact with people on mainlands nearly as much.<p>Look into covid numbers and you&#x27;ll notice cities even in the same country that are on an island of some sort have significantly less covid numbers, such as Hawaii or Vancouver Island in Canada.')
