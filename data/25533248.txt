Take people&#x27;s postures in front of a computer: it&#x27;s often terrible. Bad posture, bad keyboard usage, non ergonomic hardware etc... Yet we survive. Sure, it can create problems after years of constant abuse (RSI etc...) but generally that&#x27;s true for people who spend multiple hours every day doing it wrong.<p>If you learn to play piano 30 minutes every day for a year you&#x27;d really have to be doing it critically wrong to manage to maim yourself.<p>Of course if you manage to stick with it long term and really commit a lot of time practicing, you better learn good posture sooner or later, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth front-loading all stuff. It just raises the barrier for entry without huge benefits IMO.<p>&gt;This is something that you don&#x27;t really notice several months in, but will bite you when you start to play a lot.<p>Sure, I completely agree, but unlearning bad habits, while annoying, is part of getting good at anything I think. You need to pick your battles when you&#x27;re starting, there&#x27;s so much to learn.<p>For me the equivalent would be teaching a programming course, but insist that everybody must be touchtyping in Dvorak on ergonomic keyboards when they&#x27;re coding. While it&#x27;s not necessarily bad advice in the long run all it&#x27;ll achieve is make your students think that programming is a lot harder than it really is.')
