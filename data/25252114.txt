On a $200k salary in SF your post-tax income is $10667&#x2F;month. If you spend $4k&#x2F;month on rent (there are plenty of decent apartments and even houses if you commute a little at that price), $2000 on bills, food, your remaining salary of ~4500 usd is now still greater than a mid level engineers gross pay in the rest of the world, including most of europe.')
