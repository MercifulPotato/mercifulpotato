That&#x27;s the real story, and it stinks.<p>The computer repair shop thing is laughable, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the obvious conclusion is dastardly russians did it.. Hunter doesn&#x27;t look like a model in operational security, any number of motivated people could have hacked him.  Or maybe it was entirely made up to get the underlying scandal back in the news.')
