This should give you an idea of how slow re-encoding is going to be on your machine, and what the quality of the result is going to look like.<p>What you ideally want is that your rendered video has approximately the same bitrate as the original, and the same visual quality. You can play with the -crf parameter to get the quality the same, and the -preset parameter to get the bitrate the same.<p>For reference, when I&#x27;m rendering 720p video I&#x27;m getting about 4x speed on my 10th gen Core i5. 1080p should take about twice the time.<p>I&#x27;ve played around a bit with using the gpu-accelerated encoders in ffmpeg, but I could never get the same quality or bitrate as the cpu encoder, it seems to me that they&#x27;re tuned for quickly turning raw capture into something that can realistically be streamed and handled.')
