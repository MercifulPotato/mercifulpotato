DAI is not backed by fiat currency specifically, although it can use other fiat-backed stablecoins as collateral.<p>Why this method over fiat? One reason off the top of my head is that I typically convert what would be an international wire into a domestic wire. So I inherit a lower compliance burden and also the same day settlement capability. I have the capability of avoiding exchange rate and interchange fees when that matters to me. Even apps like Revolut and Transferwise are more expensive and would still have transaction limits. They are also quite restrictive on businesses they will bank, compared to an actual bank, and this list often complies with a foreign standard (usually some carve-out of an EU&#x2F;EFTA banking license)')
