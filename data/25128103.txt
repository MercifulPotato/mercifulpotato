I have one and people can pry it from my cold dead hands.  I paid $12 for it.  It can do voice, text and simple jpg pictures.  I would prefer it could only do voice and text.  It can idle off the charger for weeks on end.  Malware?  It doesn&#x27;t even know what to do with it.  Just shows up as garbled text.  Spam?  Default ring and message tone is silent.  Phone is registered to a fictional movie character.<p>I empathize with your grandfather.  I hope Microsoft see your message and consider reflecting inward.  The pessimist in me does not believe they will however.')
