I wanted to build a place that&#x27;s mission focused on conversation, and tries to mimic the real world as much as possible. There are no plans to add likes, voting,  or public &quot;karma&quot;, and I&#x27;m split on whether or not to show follower count. In real life people &quot;vote&quot; by either walking away from a conversation, or chiming in with an alternate viewpoint. The relevance algorithm is based on conversation metrics such as activity and publish date, and I&#x27;d like to explore further ideas around that.')
