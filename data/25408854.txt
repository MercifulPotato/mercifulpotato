I dont even know what setup you have, but I&#x27;ve run linux (mainly Mint) on countless laptops&#x2F;stationary pcs the last 10+ years and never had any network problems. Coming from win XP&#x2F;7, swiching to linux was a breeze. Driver problems? Try XP&#x2F;7, nothing works out of the box. To be fair, yes, now and then there are some issues that needs to be resolved. Just duck it and there&#x27;s usually many links to ppl who&#x27;s solved the problems. Also good foruma to get good help. I would never recommend Mac today. &quot;Everything works on Mac&quot; is a straight out lie')
