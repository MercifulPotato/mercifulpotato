I don&#x27;t like Electron, and I&#x27;d set up my machine such that installing Electron apps was technically difficult anyway.<p>IMO, the UX was horrible. I tried to keep Slack as a pinned Firefox tab, but it was far too easy to accidentally move over to a different website, at which point I stopped getting notifications. I also felt like I had to constantly keep my web browser openâ€”I can&#x27;t say why that&#x27;s substantially different than having to keep a Slack application open, but for some reason, the separate dock icon helps me to mentally compartmentalize.<p>When I finally switched to a standalone Slack app, it felt <i>much</i> nicer.')
