It&#x27;s easier to publish disinformation than it is to disprove it, and while some people are clearly better at sifting truth from fiction than others, I suspect everyone has beliefs that are based upon false information.<p>Moreover, this isn&#x27;t censorship by the government, but by Google. Why should a private company be made to disseminate disinformation when it doesn&#x27;t want to? A key part of freedom of speech is the freedom <i>not</i> to speak, and mandating that a company publish information it doesn&#x27;t want to is surely just as bad as forcing it to censor information it <i>does</i> want to publish.')
