There are in-built expectations for word processors, including keyboard commands, selection &amp; cursors, speed, permanence &amp; permission, etc, and Notion violates many of them for no good reason. The result is an unpleasurable writing environment. That should have been the easiest thing to get right, the foundation upon which amazing new features are built.<p>I use Notion for a few things, mostly because existing tools have yet to move from document-centric to project-centric designs, but it is not a tool that I would foist on the average user nor one I especially enjoy using. So much potential is held back by bad UX, which I think a lot of people don&#x27;t see because Notion does have good graphic design and a few really stellar capabilities.<p>My impression is the team has probably concluded their rapid growth is a validation of the UX, rather than other positive factors of Notion, namely being the first halfway decent project-centric editor. Hoping they do a UX refactor soon.')
