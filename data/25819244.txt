In an close-to-ideal system (like Japan) you could reach major cities 1200km apart (by rail) in 4h, 300kph average. For longer distances than that, the plane becomes indeed more reasonable. That means in US terms, you could do NYC - Chicago in roughly half a day by train, arriving relaxed and being able to work all the way through. If you&#x27;ve never taken a Shinkansen - please try it when you go to Japan. I&#x27;ve never experienced a smoother, more relaxing and more comfortable train than this.')
