I trade primarily technicals so I scout positions and entry&#x2F;exit points rather than coins themselves. If that makes sense. It&#x27;s pretty transient. If you want to make profit while you sleep on a coin, I&#x27;d look for low and sideways positions on quality projects when you can.<p>This weekend a lot of the alts are at higher positions and there&#x27;s lots of optimism, so it may be better to wait until there&#x27;s more fear and then cost-average into a long hold position, effectively buying low.')
