Outrageous! His backpedaling comment on why he chose those words was even worse. Given how long he&#x27;s been in that role, I believe there are powers at work keeping him in, from Big Pharma or something else.<p>But I really want to know who decided to abandon HHS&#x27; plan to mail masks out to every household. If that person or team can be held accountable, I can overlook Fauci&#x27;s addiction to being a TV star.')
