Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=[24917831, 24917772], score=None, time=1603885246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24917190, text='&gt; That paper seems like a window to an alternate reality in which everything that&#x27;s currently hot in tech has been done 20 years ago, except programming language-agnostic, using saner (i.e. binary) protocols, offline-first, and with advanced security built in from the start.<p>Honestly this happens all the time. Not only do we seem to reinvent the wheel but we almost invariably reinvent it worse. Take &#x27;dark mode&#x27; for instance. Everybody lauds that they can switch to a different theme that they feel is easier on their eyes, apparently oblivious to the fact that we could do that in Windows 95 with significantly greater and more granular control at the OS level. This industry is overrun with complexity fetishists who keep piling on more and more abstractions and calling it progress when they manage to catch up with the less-abstracted past.')
