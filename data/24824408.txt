Go to a flea market, used furniture store. It can probably be gotten for cheap as it is a nuisance. It weights a ton, it is hard to move, it is less ergonomic (though I have some beef with some current Ikea stuff) etc<p>Yes it will last forever, but it does require maintenance (which most of the time can&#x27;t be done in-situ, so take that heavy thing downstairs, to a shop, etc, back, etc). Not practical<p>So thanks but no thanks')
