I find it reductionist to the point it loses it&#x27;s meaning.\nActually the whole human body is constantly growing, not just cancers. I&#x27;m am growing new skin cells as we speak, approximately every x3 weeks I shed old skin cells so need new ones. The problem with cancerous cells is that the body stops recycling them and so then they grow unchecked. Modern companies are more like skin cells, they need to grow new capabilities and shed old ones as the environment changes. If they don&#x27;t then they will die, the same way I will die if my body stops growing new cells to replace the old one.\nSaying a company purpose is merely growth is nonsense, different companies have different purposes, mostly they want to survive which involves both growth and decay.')
