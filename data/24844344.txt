The easiest way to do this (And in the late 19th century the only way) is with a transformer, and therefore AC.<p>However, since the 1930s we’ve been able to build high voltage DC lines, and costs have plummet in the last 30-40 years (as we moved away from Hg rectifier tubes to Si high power electronics).<p>DC has many advantages:<p>- No capacitive coupling to ground\n- No reflections due to Z mismatch\n- You can lay a cable underwater (basically impossible with AC) \n- you can connect incompatible grids<p>HVDC is still fairly expensive (obviously compared to a lump of laminated steel) so it’s used for very long lines, or other special needs.<p>But it’s revolutionized the field.<p>AC still has many advantages and won’t go anywhere, especially last-mile to medium range:<p>- arguably safer since an arc fault can self extinguish\n- switches are much cheaper to build \n- cheap electric motors\n- cheap ability to scale V')
