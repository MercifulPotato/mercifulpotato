I don&#x27;t just watch Don Draper and Pete Campbell be petty, I escape to the 1960s and experience the ups and downs (more downs honestly) of the time period.<p>Likewise with the Mandalorian. A bar fight is a bar fight, yet the opening scene of the Mandalorian is a bar fight in the Star Wars universe, with a different set of rules and personalities. Being immersed in that itself is fun, it&#x27;s why Galaxy&#x27;s Edge at Disneyworld is so great. The fact that it has enough of a plot to be interesting sort of just seals the deal.')
