The financial industry is rife with corruption, but because its been legalized, we don&#x27;t call it that. Same shit as &quot;lobbying&quot;. Its bribery, period. Its lipstick on a pig.<p>Another person wanted to call WSB toxic because people don&#x27;t know what causes a stock to go up or down in price... well goddamn, neither do they. I remember when analysts were squawking about AMD a little over five years ago, downgrading it to a sell. Only a feeeeeewwww analysts had it marked as hold and maybe 1 or 2 as a buy.<p>However, if you knew jack shit about the semiconductor industry, and you saw they hired Jim Keller and Lisa Su, you would have dumped a ton in there. I know I did... I bought 100,000 shares when I heard Jim went back, for the bargain price of $2. I was elated when they hit $16. I was floored when they hit $50. Now that they&#x27;re thoroughly dominating Intel, I intend to hold until 2022&#x2F;23, when Intel should start to be competitive again.<p>Most people have no fucking clue why a stock goes up or down... and the years it takes to learn an industry well enough to know not just the companies in play, but the technologies in play, and the people in play...? Most analysts don&#x27;t have the wherewithal.<p>I&#x27;ll buy a stock recommended from a 30 year veteran of an industry that knows the players over any Ivy League big shop analyst any day of the week.')
