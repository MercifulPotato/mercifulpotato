The most &#x27;incriminating&#x27; file is &quot;api_uploader_v2.py&quot;, which lists categories such as &quot;6_2 - Software - Games&quot;. Which is not infringing at all.<p>While unrealistic, it&#x27;s technically possible that some of the files have changed (significantly) since June 12 2019, the last commit of [1]. However, it&#x27;s very unlikely that the database migration file, 2bceb2cb4d7c_add_comment_count_to_torrent.py, would have been changed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;marwanpro&#x2F;nyaa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;marwanpro&#x2F;nyaa</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;crf444&#x2F;nyaa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;crf444&#x2F;nyaa</a>')
