They call it the &quot;ThumbDV&quot;.  It looks like a serial port to your machine, and you can just poke it with the right commands and it&#x27;ll turn raw codec data into raw audio data (and vice-versa).<p>I used it for decoding the AMBE+2 stuff on newer P25 systems.  It wasn&#x27;t great but it did mean I didn&#x27;t run afoul of any patent issues if I wanted to sell the system to someone else.  OP25 is great but I didn&#x27;t want to take the risk.')
