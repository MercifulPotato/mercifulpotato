People who own cars must park them somewhere, and all those somewheres can have utilities installed if someone&#x27;s willing to pay for it, it&#x27;s just a matter of figuring out how to make it happen (whether via mandates or incentives or just market forces).<p>They don&#x27;t have to be superchargers, either, just good enough for overnight charging.<p>The transition will probably take a while, but I expect that eventually people will stop calling them &quot;electric cars&quot; and just call them &quot;cars&quot; and charging stations will become part of the ubiquitous infrastructure of cities, like sidewalks and fire hydrants.<p>I don&#x27;t know if people stealing charging cables is a common problem now.  People complain where I live about catalytic converter thefts.  There are probably ways to solve the issue of people stealing expensive charging equipment and re-selling them, but if people steal cables simply to recover ten dollars or thereabouts of copper, I don&#x27;t know how to fix that (aside from &quot;move to a nicer neighborhood&quot;).  Maybe use less valuable metals like aluminum, if that can be made to work in this application?')
