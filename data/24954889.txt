I think you meant to write `type Id a = a` or `type Id f a = f a` instead.<p>But I get your argument now. What you are saying is that we want some kind of a way to define functions that are either pure or return a monadic value. Currently that&#x27;s not doable because these two have distinct types. It may be difficult to unify them via the type system. This is even more difficult for higher-order functions that take other functions.')
