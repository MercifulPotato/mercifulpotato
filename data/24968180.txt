I know, it&#x27;s much more incremental than it is revolutionary, but I think the form factor achieves a much greater degree of access for many people than a typical Pi whose bare hardware may be a lot more intimidating. Now, it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; a computer, which happens to expose a 40-pin connector for the standard Pi hardware fun. And unlike other options you might find, this has the massive built-in community that comes with Pi<p>It reminds me of what Apple does when it redefines a product category by &quot;just&quot; bringing together existing technology into a more convenient form factor and UX.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this will quite have that level of impact, but I see the potential, especially now with remote learning: My kids are on a hybrid schedule. I&#x27;m fortunate to be able to provide them their necessary computing resources. Not everyone can: The district couldn&#x27;t secure all of the necessary Chrome Books, and some students have been left attempting remote learning via their parent&#x27;s phone, or simply left behind. A cheap mass market device has some truly amazing potential to fill in these gaps at the same time that it enables more advanced S(T)EM learning than you could get with a typical cheap Chrome Book.<p>I&#x27;m also old enough to remember when you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a desktop computer for under $1000, perhaps $1500 adjusted for inflation. One for $70-$100 really just hammers home how far we&#x27;ve come.')
