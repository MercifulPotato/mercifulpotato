Babies know to stare at faces, even when they cannot recognize one from another.  It is a common evolved trait.  Dogs, lions, deer, seals, chipmunks, crows, some would say even sharks ... all sorts of animals will &quot;look us in the eye&quot;.  We expect to see a certain code of behaviour re eye contact.  When a person or animal is subject to something that alters that covention we interpret that as &quot;crazy eyes&quot;.  A dog in pain will look a human in the eye.  A dog on hallucinationogenic drugs will not.  We must be careful whenever we are interpreting such things as our interpretation can be based more on expectations than reality.  The shark is probably not meeting our gaze.  Rather, we see an eyeball and expect that it is acting a certain way.<p>Spend time talking to someone with a false eye.  You might not understand why their face seems a little odd.  You probably cannot tell which eye is fake (false eyes are far more common than people realize) but you know something is not right.')
