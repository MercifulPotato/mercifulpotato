We also reported that although DHS had developed metrics for measuring the performance of NCPS, the metrics did not gauge the quality, accuracy, or effectiveness of the system’s intrusion detection and prevention capabilities.The department had also identified needs for future capabilities, but had not defined requirements for the capability to detect threats entering and exiting cloud service providers. Further, DHS had not considered specific vulnerability information for agency information systems in making risk-based decisions about future intrusion prevention capabilities.<p>The department had also identified needs for future capabilities, but had not defined requirements for the capability to detect threats entering and exiting cloud service providers.
