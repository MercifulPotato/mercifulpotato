This translates into real-time needs that vary considerably, depending on context.<p>At one firm I used to work at, the spread was several orders of magnitude. On one end, people were counting nanoseconds, and even C++ wasn&#x27;t fast or predictable enough. At the other extreme, some teams didn&#x27;t care about anything finer than a millisecond, and a big chunk of the stack was written in managed languages. It all counted as high frequency trading.')
