Yes QC should be catching this, and perhaps is (this might be one either not sampled or which passed).  QC isn&#x27;t magical, and as I learned from working in the pharma business: &quot;You can&#x27;t test quality into a product&quot;.<p>This seems from reports to be a more serious Q<i>A</i> issue. Incoming materials QC is part of QA and presumably this passed (the automotive glass suppliers are pretty used to making auto glass and most cars don&#x27;t have this problem).  But QA should have reviewed the design so that breaking stresses can&#x27;t occur.  <i>That</i> (lack of proper design review) is the problem, and appears from reports to be chronic through certain parts of the Tesla process.<p>When I say &quot;certain parts of the process&quot;, for example I mean battery fires are pretty rare so presumably that team takes QA seriously (batteries are no joke!).  While body defects and failures are rampant and very widely attested.  (I believe the big touchscreens also have a lot of problems but as I don&#x27;t follow it closely I might have just seen an unusual number of complaints.)<p>So: fixable, thought there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a culture of addressing these things.')
