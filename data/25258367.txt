Intel&#x27;s mobile parts are already SoCs (the U and Y models have the PCH on-chip, and the U&#x27;s TDP range is probably the closest to the M1). These are not the reasons the M1 is faster than x86, but the article focusing on them so much means I&#x27;m more skeptical about the claims around OOP.')
