A few thousand dollars worth of Facebook ads, mostly written in broken English, is unlikely to have caused a massive swing in voter turnout or opinions.  It seems clear from the Mueller report that Russians <i>attempted</i> to engage in election interference.  There is zero evidence that it had any effect on even a single vote.<p>If you turn on CNN for a second or two today, you&#x27;ll hear them use the phrase &quot;no <i>widespread</i> voter fraud occurred&quot;.  In other words, there is evidence that <i>some</i> fraud occurred, as it does in every election.  Just not enough to have swayed the results.  The same can be said about any Russian interference.<p>So the two things are equivalent, because both happened to some degree, and it is extremely unlikely that either had any effect on the outcome.')
