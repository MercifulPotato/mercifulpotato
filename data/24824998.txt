People said the same thing 20 years ago and when I asked my parents they told me people also said it 40 years ago. Each time IKEA changes to a different production method the old &quot;shit&quot; gets magically elevated to &#x27;very good and far better than their new things&#x27;. If that trend was real most new IKEA furniture should fall apart before you assemble it.')
