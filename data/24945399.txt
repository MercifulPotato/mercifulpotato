In the UK we have a law preventing pretty much any form of white-hack hacking.<p>The broadcast industry is awful. If you use censys to search for<p>&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;WMT&lt;&#x2F;title&gt;&quot;<p>You will find hundreds of video servers, from Saudi Arabia to Poland, from Brazil to India, open to the world on the internet.<p>Half of these have the default password which is available fairly easily online, and hasn&#x27;t changed for years (I won&#x27;t write it down here, but it&#x27;s insanely easy to crack. Try it once per minute on those servers and you&#x27;ll get it in a month. Nobody monitors the logs.)<p>The company that makes these devices (mobile viewpoint) doesn&#x27;t care - they don&#x27;t make you change the password on first use, they tell you to open port 80 and 443 up to the world (or port 7071 and 7072 - because their application doesn&#x27;t work if you do block port 80 and 443, so they run the same server on those higher ports too)<p>If you know what you&#x27;re doing you can pull the rtmp preview stream and see whats going on, once you log in, you can shutdown these servers. If you really know what you&#x27;re doing it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if you could replace the video with your own stream, as the OS they run is years out of date.<p>It&#x27;s not just mobile viewpoint servers though, I&#x27;ve just logged into an NTT encoder in Japan with a username of &quot;admin&quot; and the default blank password. Again, the manufacturer could have insisted on setting a password on first login (which you need to do to configure it), but they don&#x27;t. No idea what it&#x27;s streaming, other than it&#x27;s going into a decoder elsewhere in Japan (which is also admin&#x2F;blank). While a WMT is easy to DOS and theortically possible to replace the stream, these are trivial to replace the stream.<p>Can&#x27;t really do much about it, including writing an article lamenting the state of the industry for various industry locations, because it&#x27;s illegal in the UK to even try to log in to these machines with the default credentials.')
