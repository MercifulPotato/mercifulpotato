A 5 cost Chapel would lead to extraordinarily unbalanced games where a good starting hand basically sets you up to win.<p>Having the cost be 2 means that everyone gets access to it in the first two hands with out there being much swingy-ness in terms of the initial shuffle.<p>Maybe an argument could be made for 3 or 4 in the sense that everyone would still have access to it, but 5 just seems too high.')
