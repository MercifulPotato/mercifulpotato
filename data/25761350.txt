A dozen or so states and localities have implemented Ranked Choice Voting (RCV).<p>Is it enough?  No.  And it never will be unless people all over the country stand up and demand it.<p>It&#x27;s not as hard as it sounds.  Election laws are made by the states and election systems are run by each county.<p>26 states have ballot initiaves&#x2F;referenda.  All you need are enough signatures to get changes on the ballot.<p>How many people voted for your state assembly person in 2018?  For your state senator?  You can go look it up.  I&#x27;ll wait.<p>Not very many, right? Those are the people who make the election laws for the state.<p>And how many people voted for your council member in your city&#x2F;town&#x2F;county?  For your mayor&#x2F;county executive?  They set the rules for your local elections (sometimes the state has a say too, but not always).<p>But in order to make changes like non-partisan redistricting and RCV and open primaries (although those aren&#x27;t always so fabulous either, cf. California) and term limits and public funding of elections, etc. you need to pound on your elected representatives.<p>And if even a few hundred people pester your state assembly person or city council member, it&#x27;s likely you can get some movement on these initiatives.')
