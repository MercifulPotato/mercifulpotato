WSL (both 1 and 2) are both very polished, and configuring VS Code w&#x2F;Remote WSL setup was very simple (Windows GUI + Linux dev environment). The hardest part for me was getting past the gut-wrenching fear of using Windows Store to install something, but the experience from Windows Store &quot;Install&quot; to Windows Terminal &quot;Debian&quot; shell was actually... enjoyable.')
