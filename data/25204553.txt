These seem like solid guidelines to me.<p>One trick-of-the-trade that I&#x27;ve learned about diagrams is to avoid hardcoding English text into the diagram if you&#x27;re working on an internationalized doc site. Instead, insert numbers like &quot;(1)&quot; and &quot;(2)&quot; and then provide a numbered list after the diagram explaining each number from the diagram. This makes the content easier to translate. E.g. if you hardcode English into the diagrams, you&#x27;ve got to translate that diagram for every language or (more realistically) your non-English docs are going to have English text hardcoded into their diagrams. Hat tip to David Friedman for teaching me that trick.<p>I&#x27;ve sometimes had technical people take issue with analogies precisely because they&#x27;re not completely technically accurate. When that happens I compromise with them by adding an explicit sentence right before or after the analogy along the lines of &quot;This is just an analogy to help you develop an intuition for the topic. It&#x27;s not 100% technically correct. See X for technical details.&quot;<p>I think the importance and helpfulness of examples is majorly underrated across docs sites.')
