Used to work in a large corporation with a major office in NYC (I am in London).<p>Also recruiting C++ developers, had a few folks with 30+ years of experience.<p>I think the key is to have developers who are good, but not too great that they can pass interviews in other places (tech interviews are getting impossibly difficult nowadays).<p>Give them decent work-life balance, decent pay&#x2F;perks, and decent teammates&#x2F;manager. They will stick around for a while. Not looking too hard and if they look there&#x27;s a good chance it doesn&#x27;t conclude (interviews are too time consuming with a family and too difficult).<p>There&#x27;s still quite a bit of attrition though. NYC has a lot of strong opportunities (FANG, banks, hedge funds) and C++ developers have niches in demand (finance&#x2F;high performance).<p>Top developers will get a better opportunity eventually. I&#x27;ve seen the case where another company decided to take over somebody or a whole team, it&#x27;s unstoppable.')
