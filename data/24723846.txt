Increasing ambition by a little can result in large increase in impact on the other end.<p>Another idea that caught my attention:<p>&gt; <i>Silicon Valley was a place. It has become a metonymy for a community of practice. You can find outposts of Silicon Valley in Tokyo cafes, in WeWorks in Bangalore, and on the coast of Cape Town.</i><p>If we can inspire ambition all around the world that bodes well for our future.')
