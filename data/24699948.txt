The effect is that these large retailers don&#x27;t buy the product until after it&#x27;s sold.</i><p>This is false. Net payment terms don&#x27;t change who holds title to the product, just when the money changes hands.<p>Additionally, retailers only force manufacturers to accept returns of unsold product for products that <i>overwhelming</i> failed to sell. They don&#x27;t return small batches of unsold product.<p><i>They also just rent shelf space to companies and have little if anything to do with what is stocked there and how it&#x27;s priced. </i><p>True, but this is such a small portion of the retail market that it would be a rounding error of a rounding error. Generally, most retail companies don&#x27;t do this.')
