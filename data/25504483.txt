From my experience, cross pollination of ideas from alternatives makes both the person and the product much better.<p>I personally always try to use some alternatives at the same time (XFCE, KDE, macOS &#x2F; C++, Python, Go, etc.) to see what others are doing.<p>This allowed me to think both out of the box and carry good ideas between systems. Some examples:<p>- Implement just works approach in a set of python utilities developed for a project. Extended development time a little but, removed setup from so many nodes so it compensated itself and allowed me to sleep well at night.<p>- Copying GNOME2&#x27;s desktop layout to KDE with some macOS influences allows me to become extremely efficient in my Desktop systems. Since it contains something from everything, everything other DE is familiar and I&#x27;m also more efficient in them (&quot;This is UNIX, I know how to use it!&quot; effect).')
