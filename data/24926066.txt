It feels like only yesterday that GNOME2 was scrapped in favor of Unity despite everyone&#x27;s wishes. Or the day GNOME unilaterally required all distros switch to Systemd. The GNOME project has a long history of stirring the pot and helping Linux to continually destroy itself. The project itself was actually born from petty drama and unwillingness to cooperate with the Qt developers, who unlike GNOME actually had a decent API and went out of their way to address community concerns, but were ignored.')
