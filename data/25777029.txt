And social networks that exist as landing pads for people who aren’t tolerated on mainstream platforms naturally have targets on their backs.<p>I really don’t think this is liberal vs conservative, left vs right. Mainstream social networks are full of conservatives. YouTube is basically Fox News mixed with Drudge Report once you start down that path. Even Reddit —- once you get past the post titles you realize that Reddit commenters are actually right leaning now. They look different than the stereotypical portrayal of gods and guns conservatives but the views are same save a few social issues. Scott Alexander called them the “grey tribe” and I expect they’ll start being called the “new right” eventually. HN is basically entirely left-passing conservatives.<p>But then there’s this tiny subgroup of legit insane people who with nothing better to do than get angry at the internet all day and push conspiracy theories. They keep getting passed around and banned from social networks while more mainstream right-wing talking heads use them as the poster children for their victim complex.')
