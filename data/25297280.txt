The project will span 30 countries on at least 4 continents and the rollout will function differently in every country (some countries we will only handle logistics, some we will be directly taking part in vaccination, some others we may only coordinate, etc.). I need something flexible, easy, and comprehensive. I am admittedly over my head but I have a track record of getting the job done in hard situations. If you have any advice on a project management software or other tool, I would appreciate it very much!')
