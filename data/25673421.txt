Not that it&#x27;s not valuable or worthy of some of the growth it&#x27;s seen, but almost 10x in one year looks like a classic bubble to me.<p>LE: Also, I don&#x27;t really understand how people keep falling for this stuff. I have no doubt that some are very well aware that it&#x27;s a bubble and just think they can time the crash correctly, but I see _a lot_ of people with incredibly bullish views on this. And to be honest, it&#x27;s the same with Bitcoin.')
