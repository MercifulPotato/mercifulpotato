Why does the US owe the world any more than other countries?<p>At some point people have to make their own self determination —as leftists used to clamor for a couple of decades ago.  Now they want a shortcut instead of doing the hard work to build viable economies.  It took us a few hundred years to get where we are.  It didn’t happen overnight.
