Otherwise it would be impossible to hear bass through (good) headphones.<p>The issue is that, because of reflections, waves whose wavelengths are on the same order of magnitude as the distance from the speakers to the wall are getting cancelled out, depending on where you listen from.  It is a well-known phenomenon.<p>(Higher frequencies which are multiples of the missing bass frequencies will also be attenuated, but this is less immediately noticeable.)')
