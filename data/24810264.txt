There&#x27;s also D, Rust, Nim, Zig, Python, Java, C#, even Javascript (when calling WASM modules), etc... those would all benefit from a more modern (and standardized!) approach to language bindings (even if the target languages would only be C or C++, but why stop there).<p>Apart from that &quot;grand idea&quot; I think a more realistic real-world solution for the C++ =&gt; Swift situation is to simply wrap the C++ API into a C API first, and then create a Swift API on top of the C API, instead of trying to somehow translate the C++ API directly to Swift. E.g. every C++ library should come with an optional C-API to simplify language bindings, or even just compiling that library into a DLL.')
