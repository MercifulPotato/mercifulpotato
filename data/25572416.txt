I have a server running a dozen VMs and I&#x27;ll be damned if I can remember the IPs for all those services.  DNS exists for a reason.<p>Moreover, the only time I might be working with those raw IPs is with services using static IPs.  But in that case my IPv6 addresses aren&#x27;t actually that much more complicated.  On the v4 side I might have:<p>192.168.1.122<p>And on the IPv6 side (where I have a &#x2F;48 allocated) I might have:<p>2600:ABCD:XYZW::11')
