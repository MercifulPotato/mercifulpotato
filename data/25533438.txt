As soon as I installed 11.1 on my M1 Mini that is connected to my TV&#x27;s receiver, I could no longer get a stable connection to it via screen sharing unless I unplugged the HDMI from the Mini. The resolution constantly flipped back and forth, and eventually threw an authentication error. I had no such problems on 11.0.')
