This sums it up pretty well:<p><pre><code>    I also think that it would have been appropriate to notify about the\n    ulterior motive behind this defect report at the latest when the paper got\n    published. This underhanded approach of reporting a defect just leaves a bad\n    taste, really.\n\n    The behavior may be an actual defect in the classical sense, but I&#x27;m just\n    wondering what would have happened, had this been addressed &quot;in time&quot; by the\n    developers. It would seem that the researchers would then have triumphantly\n    proclaimed that all major browsers are prone to their newly found attack.\n    Must be somewhat disappointing that it didn&#x27;t get fixed &quot;in time&quot; to make it\n    into the paper that way.</code></pre>')
