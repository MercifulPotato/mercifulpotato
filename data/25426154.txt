It&#x27;s still not as good as IntelliJ or AppCode but it&#x27;s usable.<p>I remember around when Swift came out, Xcode was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t even use it because typing was ~1 character&#x2F;second and it would crash every few minutes. It&#x27;s definitely recovered from that and I can actually type without lag now.')
