I.e., if a reasonable person might think it is a variant of USB-C, and USB devices seem to work for long periods of time without apparent damage, then Nintendo is liable by virtue of resulting damage to the consumer&#x27;s property (not to the USB organization). There&#x27;s a certain liability for negligence in that case. But I could also see reasonable arguments that if Nintendo were explicitly saying it is not a USB port, that they shouldn&#x27;t be liable (I don&#x27;t agree but see it as a reasonable argument).<p>But if Nintendo is advertising it in anyway like that, they should be held liable. I just don&#x27;t see a reasonable argument for why that wouldn&#x27;t be the case. You can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it too.')
