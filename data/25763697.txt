Item(by='JamesBarney', descendants=None, kids=[25763787], score=None, time=1610553618, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763180, text='&gt; - The aggregate situation of de-platforming of individuals and entire platforms from the Internet by a few unilateral decisions by corporations reveals a power structure we ought to not want (it has always been there, but now it&#x27;s undeniably shown itself willing and able to exercise its power when needed) since it will inevitably be abused given incentives and the lack of checks and balances on it.<p>When it&#x27;s more than five separate organizations that all independently decide to deplatform is it still a unilateral decision?  I also doubt these decisions were made unilaterally in the companies themselves.<p>In this specific circumstance do we need to regulate these businesses to keep them from removing content related to organizing a violent insurrection?<p>No one even removed this content until these groups literally stormed the capital chanting about hanging members of congress.  I don&#x27;t see the problem.')
