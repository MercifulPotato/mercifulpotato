The Arabs attacked Israel with the intent of destruction (and genocide, most plausibly) and lost the war. One consequence was the mass exodus of Arabs who, correctly or not, assumed the victorious Israelis wouldn&#x27;t treat them kindly. I&#x27;m sure plenty of terrible things happened during those wars, but to say they are the same or similar to the holocaust can only be done when you don&#x27;t know the history. A hint for starters: the Jews did not invade Germany with the intent to destroy it.<p>&gt; And you needn&#x27;t publicly enumerate your disgust for all atrocities by all peoples in order to denounce the single action of a single people.<p>Your credibility would be much better if you did though. If the police completely ignored crimes committed by white people and vigorously enforced the law against black people, wouldn&#x27;t you question their motives?')
