The contents of a commit doesn&#x27;t change. Just the link to its predecessor.<p>It&#x27;s the exact opposite. When you rebase, you want to apply the changes you&#x27;re rebasing atop other existing changes.<p>If you just copy over the snapshot, you break everything. Rebasing a snapshot basically smashes your history and is utterly useless. That would make a rebase-pullâ€¦ implicitly revert every intermediate commit.<p>Although AFAIK Git really uses the merge machinery to perform rebases: conceptually (I don&#x27;t know if it does that technically) it merges each commit to rebase onto the rebase target, then copies over the commits without the old (rebased-from) parent.')
