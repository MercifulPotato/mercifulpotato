After 20 years of using their products may be I know something more than a regular Apple wannabe in 2020. In 2006 paying equivalent of 4000EUR in cold cash for a laptop was no small feet in my country - actually this was a price for very good second hand car at the time. And surprise: it was worth every god damn penny. Since then all of my office computers and computers of my staff are made by Apple. For a long time this company offered a perfect blend for any kind of production. Since the big success of the iPhone things slowly faded away. At first Apple killed Studio Suite, then made Final Cut Pro from professional software to semi pro kids toy, started telemetry without user consent (I use Little Snitch from second version of the software, etc), touch bar nonsense, keyboard quality nonsense, repairability nonsense and still no good web camera. But hey, M1 will change everything. For good.:)\nIn the future Apple will be old IBM on steroids. Personal Gatekeeper for common good. Enjoy your prison kids, war is peace - freedom is slavery - ignorance is strength.')
