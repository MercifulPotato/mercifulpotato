Lots of people have never even heard of fellow dwarf planet Ceres, but it spent almost as long as a full fledged planet as Pluto.  The only reason most people defend Pluto&#x27;s inclusion among planets and not Ceres is because Ceres was recategorized a century before most of us were born.  It shows that the primary objection from laypeople is that we don&#x27;t like when something we were taught as children changes.')
