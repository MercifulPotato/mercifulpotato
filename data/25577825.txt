One of the things about the Xbox OS is that the OS itself gets a fixed timeslice each frame to do whatever it needs while the game is running, in order to make it so the game can get the rest of the frame to run. This sounds to me like a decision that has far-reaching consequences.<p>I’m sure that it shares plenty code with Windows. You might say that the OS is based on Windows. But it’s definitely not Windows.')
