Item(by='hombre_fatal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607700070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383365, text='Fwiw, it&#x27;s the only way to post something on Youtube&#x2F;Instagram&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;etc. that: doesn&#x27;t have a like count, has no comments, it&#x27;s ephemeral, and anyone who responds to it basically is just sending you a private message than writing something everyone can see.<p>It&#x27;s much better than posting the content normally and having to feel somewhat like a loser when nobody even likes&#x2F;comments on it.<p>On Instagram I have like 6 photos uploaded the normal way. For years I&#x27;ve only used the &quot;stories&quot; system to engage with friends. It&#x27;s far more personal. Don&#x27;t knock it too quickly, you may find it&#x27;s a step in the right direction.<p>I don&#x27;t want it at the top of Google search as a marketing apparatus, though.')
