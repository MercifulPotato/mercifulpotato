I am also no longer a fan of Material design either, so I slowly started to get rid of some of the Material stlyes, but the UI is built on top of the MaterialUI React framework, so it might always somewhat resemble Material design in some way.<p>I agree about the name, I was told multiple times by multiple people that the name sounds &quot;evil&quot;. I have not gone forward with changing it as the SEO value of the domain and the userTrack brand has some traction and changing it might destroy the last 8 years spent on SEO and marketing.<p>One good thing about the name is that people searching for &quot;user tracking&quot; and related keywords, which could lead to invasive solutions, now lead to a self-hosted option that has multiple privacy settings and is overall a better choice for the users than most hosted alternatives. I think of this consequence as something like getting &quot;eartisflat.com&quot; and putting there actual information proving that the earth is not flat, so although the user might have been looking for something else, he is now better off with the answer he got.')
