If you want to know your code works you want to treat the error handling as carefully as the happy path. You can’t just skip over it. I’ve found so many bugs in Go that come down to shadowed err variables or forgetting to check an err on one case of 7. Haven’t you? This comes directly from the mental habit of filtering out the error handling.<p>In well written software error handling is a majority of the paths through the code. But they are all very similar. So it’s a natural programmer inclination to both (a) want to handle them all explicitly, and (b) want to abstract away the similarities so it’s easier to see correctness.<p>Languages with exception optimize for b and ignore a. Go optimizes for a and ignores b.<p>But languages like Rust show that it’s possible to actually do both well. That’s what people are complaining about when they lament Go’s approach to errors.')
