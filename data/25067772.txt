Meanwhile they’ve redesigned the app in a way that seems less useful to me. Users always hate app redesigns so maybe it’s just something I need to get used to, but they’ve eliminated the ability to do a custom fine grained search and see a bucket of results.<p>Anyway I was a paying customer until I noticed they came out with even more expensive plans. I don’t want to be nickled and dimed so I’m back on free.')
