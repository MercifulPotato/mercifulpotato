This would be a showcase, how well Windows can run on ARM, and as Apple machines gain market share push Windows developers to provide ARM-native versions of their software.\nWindows on ARM so far faced two obstacles, the lack of native software and the lack of great machines.<p>Having Windows running on ARM Macs could deliver a helpful push here and also keep Windows relevant for Mac users. On the other side, there is no greater risk, as Apple isn&#x27;t taking over the PC market any time soon. Apple will likely increase their market share, but even then it is just a fraction of the total market.')
