Item(by='int_19h', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602368970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24737077, text='&quot;Hello, world&quot; is a rather poor example, because there&#x27;s little practical value in a mobile application like that. The real value comes from being able to reuse many existing Java libraries.')
