It can also be a great replacement for scripts that need to be run via a cron job (its surprisingly hard to create a highly available idempotent cron system using servers) provided all of the dependencies fit in the small space allotted.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand your point about not needing a deployment chain. I developed a framework (open sourcing it soon) using Jenkins Pipeline DSL for deploying Lambda functions and its very useful and helpful.<p>Regardless of the target environment the reasons for using a deployment pipeline are still there even if you use a server less platform.')
