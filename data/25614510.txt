How should I start coding", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Firstly, i am a first year electric and electronic engineering student and I learned c programming and matlab in class. (Exactly, I do not know my level). I finished HTML and HTML5 lessons via freecodecamp.org. (I don&#x27;t know what will help me if I finish the 300-hour course and get a certificate from that page). I&#x27;m new to writing code and I&#x27;ve researched what to learn, but since there are so many things and i am confused, it would be more helpful for me to know what to learn. I know the code languages that are popular today (Java, Php, Javascript, Pyhton etc.). But which one of them should I start, how I can find a job (I don&#x27;t think to join a company, I want to work freelance becasue my university doesn&#x27;t leave me much time). If you could help with this situation, I would greatly appreciate it..')
