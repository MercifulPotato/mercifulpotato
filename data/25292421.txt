JDE Edwards, IBM AS 400, etc...<p>AWS is a substrate platform, thus is does not look like lock-in in any other respect other that price.<p>if you marry with Oracle, JDE, AS-400 etc you are mapped to an APP and not a platform on which you can build WTF you want... so only noobs think of AWS as a lock-in because they are only looking a price&#x2F;cost as opposed to the entire ripple effect of what it means to move&#x2F;migrate core ops (typically finOps) between platforms...<p>Look at the underlying phys infra thats required to do at scale shit...<p>Thats the cost benefit analysis thats really overlooked. That hourly cost per comput&#x2F;service&#x2F;resource is mortgaging a SHIT TON of physical infrastructure that would cost a single company MILLIONS - yet - Amzn is literally investing everything that one company should in physical and digital security and executing it well...<p>And for that, I respect them and support them.<p>Anecdotal: I once had a dev (I was DEVOPS director) check in creds to github after it was the 251st repo (where our account only paid for 250) and by default at the time, Git made any repos above your account limit public, and bots scanned ALL of these - they got our creds in this devs post, and launched - from Germany - THOUSANDS of G-class instances for bitcoin mining.....<p>Anyway, an all-nighter - but Amazon refunded &#x2F; canceled the tens of thousands of dollars in compute time without hesitation....<p>Cloudability proved to also be an invaluable resource - and While I am concerned over the bezos-new-world, Amazon never fails to make me appreciate their customer service... (they sent me the wrong SSD and sent me a new one, refunded my money and sent me a second one as well....)')
