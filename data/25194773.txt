I feel it&#x27;s important for content creators, executives and the many javascript developers on HN to be fully aware that javascript is a dangerous technology, which is not trusted by people like myself who care about their privacy and security.<p>I try to point this out every opportunity I get, and will continue to do so, so people can&#x27;t claim they had no idea that javascript was so horrible because no one ever told them.<p>Javascript <i>is</i> horrible, and requiring your viewers to expose themselves to security vulnerabilities in order to view your content is not ok.')
