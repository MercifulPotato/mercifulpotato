It&#x27;s a new computer with an Apple IIe built-in, a bit like the C-128, which was essentially a C-64 with two other computers built-in. In many aspects, the Apple &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; was more of an Apple II than the IIgs.<p>The gs was also limited in performance so it wouldn&#x27;t cannibalize Mac sales. A slightly faster 65816 would run rings around the 68000 in the Mac.')
