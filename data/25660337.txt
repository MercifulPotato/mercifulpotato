I just searched for microSD card, and there is nowhere on the left side to filter by seller.  There used to be an option where you could check mark which sellers you wanted to see offerings from.<p>I definitely remember 10+ years ago, being able to restrict searches to items sold by &quot;Amazon.com&quot; by clicking the check box.  Then they gradually removed it for certain searches.  Sometimes, the option to filter by Amazon.com would show up, and sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t.  I thought I was going crazy for a while.  Then I realized what they were doing, and then in a few years they got rid of the option completely.<p>Not that it would make a difference anyway, since Amazon commingles inventory with other random sellers so you never know which supply chain you&#x27;re actually getting the item from.')
