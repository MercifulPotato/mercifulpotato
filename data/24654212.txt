The KKK was founded in 1865, just after the US Civil War, and had as a bedrock principal the re-establishment of white supremacy.  It&#x27;s initial actions were to frustrate Reconstruction-era policies through violent action.  Today, they&#x27;d be labeled a terrorist organization.  Their aims were inherently racist, political and their tactics violent.  Through a variety of means, they more or less achieved their goals such that by 1876, the entire south was once again under Democratic control.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until the revival of the &quot;second wave&quot; of the KKK during 1910&#x27;s and 1920&#x27;s that they even started taking on anti-catholic stances.  It was during this era that the burning cross, anti-communist, anti-catholic and anti-jewish stances came into being.<p>Finally, I have no idea where you got the idea that the KKK had &quot;many black members&quot;.  As far as I&#x27;m aware, no credible evidence for that has ever been put forward.')
