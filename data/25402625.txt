People would &#x27;brand&#x27; YouTube this way about as much as they do Chrome for letting you browse websites claiming the election was stolen, or web search for letting you find it, or your ISP for letting you download the HTML. Nobody would give a crap, they&#x27;d just argue about other platforms where the owners <i>were</i> engaging in censorship.<p>Political censorship isn&#x27;t just morally wrong, it&#x27;s bad for business and bad for your brand too. The moment you allow that camel to put its nose under the tent, you&#x27;re inviting in a whole world of pain. Suddenly every zealot out there will be demanding you silence the people who disagree with them, because they know that maybe if they make enough noise you will. They&#x27;ll attack your brand hard because they know if they do you might cave. A hard core libertarian &quot;everyone is served on principle&quot; attitude keeps the fighting at bay because people know it&#x27;s not worth putting in the energy.')
