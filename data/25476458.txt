I can go to &quot;Song Radio&quot; or &quot;Artist Radio&quot;, and browse through related artists and the like. But the latter still requires a significant amount of effort on my part, and the autogenerated radio playlists are nothing to write home about. I think it&#x27;s fine that things like the &quot;related artists&quot; features exist, they emulate to some extent the old ways of discovering music, but they&#x27;re also obvious and they would be part of a music service MVP nowadays. What I miss are solid <i>automatic</i> recommendations, more intelligent than those that are available.<p>As I remember, Pandora blew Spotify&#x27;s automatic recommendations out of the water as far back as the mid-2000&#x27;s. The idea of analyzing the song itself is so powerful and I think Spotify barely does it or weighs it way too little, favoring instead social aspects (such as the preference of other users). I discovered insane amounts of music with Pandora when I was able to use it, like dozens to hundreds of songs per week. Whereas with Spotify I go through these bad droughts that last weeks where I&#x27;m not discovering anything new that really clicks. I&#x27;d definitely pay for Pandora if it was available here in Spain.<p>It&#x27;s weird to me that Spotify being the kingpin is so far behind Pandora in this regard. Is it that they don&#x27;t care because users don&#x27;t know any better or demand it? Or that what Pandora did was a technical miracle and can&#x27;t be replicated at Spotify scale? Maybe it&#x27;s some business model decision (eg, intelligent recommendations would stray users too far away from Taylor Swift)?<p>Maybe someone on HN can shed some light on this. And if anyone has any ideas for music services with intelligent recommendations available in Spain I&#x27;d be sure to give them a try.')
