Cutting these disinformation sources off gives us freedom <i>from</i> some amount of manipulation. Meanwhile, if we&#x27;re more concerned with the freedom <i>to</i> say anything anywhere, whatever limits imposed will be perceived by default in a negative light.<p>There&#x27;s merit in examining from both perspectives for any given issue. However, if our objective is a better signal-to-noise ratio of truth in the context of slamming every human&#x27;s stray thoughts, emotions, and urges into each other in realtime, the &#x27;freedom from&#x27; perspective is probably a better approach right now.')
