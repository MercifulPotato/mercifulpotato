I distinctly remember after SCOTUS refused to hear the Texas v. PA case, posters saying they wouldn&#x27;t mind if some justices were assassinated.<p>The site&#x27;s code of conduct prohibited making threats, but very thinly veiled ones went mostly unmoderated. Including the practice of simply using CoC (code of conduct) as a euphemism, such as &quot;Somebody needs to CoC that bitch (angry red grrrrr emote)&quot;.<p>The site cracked down MUCH harder on that stuff right after Twitter banned Trump and Parler went down. They moved politics to a separate, paid-members-only board and closed most of the political threads in GD. But apparently it wasn&#x27;t enough and GoDaddy doesn&#x27;t want to be associated with it.<p>I don&#x27;t believe AR15.com ever made any official posts that advocated for violence in any way. It was all user content.')
