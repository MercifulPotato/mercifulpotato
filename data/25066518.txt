That makes tactics a bit dangerous.<p>Now there is also a school of thought the finds this reliance on metaprogramming (imperative of other) ugly and a site indication the languages and libraries are not good enough yet. I&#x27;m sympathetic, but currently the pro-tactic crowd seems to have the edge.<p>Lastly, &quot;Lean&quot; is kind of the epitome of &quot;success at all costs&quot; in more ways than tactics: implementation in C++ rather than a nice functional language for dogfooding, willing to sacrifice some intuitionist sacred cows not strictly needed for classical compatibility, etc.')
