Most of those kinds of shops have a 90ish day policy that you sign and after that its theirs. That would not be hacked material.<p>Also, if the policy on hacked material was enforced; wouldn&#x27;t the NYT story on the tax returns hacked&#x2F;leaked from Trump also apply? Most of the controversy here is that Twitter has selectively taken action, and now that they changed their policy, they still wont reactivate the account even though its no longer in violation until the NYP deletes the original violating tweet.')
