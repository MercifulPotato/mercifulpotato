It was my first job after school. The business owner was a diehard Windows enthusiast, but after a streak of problems with our customer-hosting IIS&#x2F;ASP setup he asked me to &quot;look into Linux, maybe it&#x27;ll work for us&quot;.<p>We had a set of old unused Mac Quadras in the office that I were allowed to tinker with, and I came upon either Linux-m68k or Slackware for 680x0, cannot recall which. I had never been in direct contact with anything Unix or Unix-like. Despite having programmed computers since the early 1990s, and being very stubborn with getting things to work, my memory of installing and trying to use that Linux distribution was something along the lines of &quot;created by mad scientist, for other mad scientists&quot;; a complete lack of user-friendliness and severely deficient documentation. I gave up.<p>Some weeks later a friend recommended me OpenBSD. It was a night and day difference. The installation was simple, clear and mostly intuitive, and documentation was top-notch. Within a single day I had both a working desktop environment and an Apache web host environment with Ms Access + ASP capabilities (through something called ChiliASP I think), and account-based FTP access.<p>I&#x27;ve been using OpenBSD ever since, and just a couple of years later I moved from Windows to Mac OS X as my primary desktop system because of growing so fond of the power and versatility of Unix-like environments.')
