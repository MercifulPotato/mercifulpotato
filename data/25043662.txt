I think that the US had a corrosive atmosphere even before Trump already, think about the whole &quot;candidate X is socialist&#x2F;fascist&quot;. Not to take a political stance, but there are definitions for those terms and checking if something is untrue is just a matter if the reality of what candidate X says or does fits that definition.<p>This is what media was supposed to do and this is what public discourse was meant to be before parties became tribes, before the footballification of politics.<p>Media has no incentive to do this nowadays, as they have to fight about your brain time with much nicer and more exciting media products.')
