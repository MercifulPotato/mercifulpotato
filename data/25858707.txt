I&#x27;ve known for 20 years that catnip works as a mosquito repellent; there was a 2001 paper that showed that its essential oil, nepetalactone, was 10 times more effective than DEET[1].  Soon after this a variety of &quot;natural mosquito repellent&quot; products based on catnip appeared on the market.  I&#x27;ve made homemade repellent myself by soaking catnip in alcohol and it works great, although it wears off faster than commercial DEET-based repellent; have to keep reapplying.<p>Anyway, another patent that shouldn&#x27;t have been issued.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2001&#x2F;08&#x2F;010828075659.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2001&#x2F;08&#x2F;010828075659.h...</a>')
