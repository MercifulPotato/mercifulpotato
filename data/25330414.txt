The weight is one thing, but other one is that the operation really isn&#x27;t point to point, but series. So starting from China empty(probably not) the ship is filled and then it visits multiple ports. And neither the ship or the ports want to waste time to move containers out and back in so containers going to later ports have to be below containers going to earlier ports. And containers travelling to the later ports can also be added on the way.')
