I would be surprised to find a school that doesn&#x27;t include discussions on current events at pretty much every age level.  Obviously the teachers had to be careful because even though they may feel strongly about an issue, most of them don&#x27;t want to consciously bias the discussion.<p>I can even remember a teacher having us write a letter asking that a government facility in our region not be closed down because it would affect people in our class.  I was probably in 3rd or 4th grade at the time.  In 5th grade we had to write letters to soldiers fighting in the Gulf War - something that I have very mixed feelings about today because I do feel that supporting troops fighting in a war overseas is a highly political act.')
