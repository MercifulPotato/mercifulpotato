I began the year with a similar idea of creating small projects weekly, although my goals were less ambitious. In the beginning of it I already felt in the &quot;insane schedule&quot; hole and realized that it wouldn&#x27;t work, so I changed plans to at least creating a blog post each week. With that, I could create a better habit and manage to (almost) handle it.<p>This approach didn&#x27;t block me from creating small programs&#x2F;game clones in this period, which I&#x27;m keeping in my blog[0] as well, but seeing projects like yours motivates to push harder for bigger projects.<p>I wish you luck on keeping your pace as well!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cgreinhold.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cgreinhold.dev&#x2F;</a>')
