In a lot of cases, like Zoom, there&#x27;s a stupid amount of free capital floating around due to effectively-zero interest rates, and not many places with decent returns to invest it.  So anything that gets hyped as a good place to put it (like tech stocks) gets blown out of proportion and underlying fundamentals don&#x27;t really come into play.  Basically, investors (and the market) aren&#x27;t rational right now.')
