I am interested to see how things like Kafka and this might come together somehow.<p>In my opinion, we have evolved to a point where storage is not a concern for temporal use cases - i.e. we can now store every change in an immutable fashion.  When you think about this being an append only transaction log that you never have to purge, and you make observable events on that log (which is what most CDC systems do)... yeah it works.  Now you have every change, cryptographically secure, with events to trigger downstream consumers and you can really rethink the whole architecture of monolithic databases vs. data platforms.<p>It is an exciting time we are in, in my opinion.')
