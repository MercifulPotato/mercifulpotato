Item(by='est31', descendants=None, kids=[25212353], score=None, time=1606327978, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25212092, text='Facebook should definitely make it explicit that by reporting, you share the last N messages with that account with Facebook and make them accessible to Facebook employees&#x2F;contractors.<p>Regarding the iMessage backup thing, I fully agree with you that it&#x27;s a major problem. But it&#x27;s a different thing.<p>Also, again, the feature already exists. You can already make screenshots and share them with facebook, with the world, etc. There are entire subreddits that publicly share IM histories with people. This is nothing that facebook can initiate. If the feature gets changed to something that they can initiate, I would agree that it&#x27;s bad. But this isn&#x27;t.')
