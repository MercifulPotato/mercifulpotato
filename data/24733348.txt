The two concepts are actually commutative. You could in theory create syntax that looks like this:<p><pre><code>  FROMCLAUSE * SELECTCLAUSE * WHERECLAUSE = SQLEXPRESSION\n  SELECTCLAUSE * WHERECLAUSE * FROMCLAUSE = SQLEXPRESSION\n  ...\n</code></pre>\nThe issue is that not only does SQL syntax force an artificial order on these clauses, but that these clauses Cannot be decomposed to be used elsewhere. I cannot reuse a WHERECLAUSE or a SELECTCLAUSE in another expression.')
