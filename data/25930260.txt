Lashing out is not a slow release of the pressure within that will save you from popping your balloon, it&#x27;s the pop itself.<p>Not all people have set up a structure in their lives that allow them to slowly release that pressure. We do not all have people in our lives that we can talk to about our feelings. Social media might help these folks.<p>If I were to lash out at you during lunch or while we&#x27;re in meeting, people would probably ask me to calm down and say &quot;hey dude, what&#x27;s going on, you&#x27;re acting irrational, where is this anger coming from?&quot; and &quot;can we help you in some way, so that you won&#x27;t feel the need to be so aggressive?&quot;<p>Social media, however, has not only made flame wars easier to achieve, it has also made it much easier to ignore any concern we might have for the lasher-outers, the people who are clearly in need of some love and affection. In social media, we burn these people by stripping them of their karma.<p>I find poorly designed karma systems, not social media, to be at fault.')
