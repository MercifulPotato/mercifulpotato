It&#x27;s just that our motivations jump around all over the place.<p>For a long time my response to this tendency was to try to control, direct, pin down my motivation so that I could stick with something until it was done. Doing this caused me to actually have a real deficit of motivation, instead of just an always-changing motivation. Once I stopped trying to control it and embraced jumping-around, following my interest wherever it led me, I actually had much more success seeing tasks through to completion (and even circling back to ones I&#x27;d left behind, because I wasn&#x27;t feeling guilty about having left them behind). It&#x27;s like my attention is highly fragmented, but I still have the same amount.<p>An ADD person&#x27;s motivation is like a wild animal that you just have to give room to so it can do its thing. Hitch a ride to it, instead of trying to tame it, and you&#x27;ll eventually get where you want to go.')
