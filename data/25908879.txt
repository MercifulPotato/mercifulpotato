AMD&#x27;s Zen 2 and later desktop&#x2F;server CPUs split the northbridge back out to a separate die (&quot;IO die&quot;).<p>All recent x86 processors that I can think of off the top of my head have the PCIe ports provided by the northbridge (which means it&#x27;s usually part of the CPU die itself). The southbridge is connected to the northbridge&#x2F;CPU by PCIe (usually four lanes), and part of the southbridge functionality is to act as a PCIe fanout switch.<p>And the terms &quot;northbridge&quot; and &quot;southbridge&quot; have fallen out of common use, largely because the northbridge being on the CPU die was standard practice for both Intel and AMD for over a decade.<p>DDR5 is coming, with the significant change of splitting a DIMM into two separate 32-bit memory channels rather than one 64-bit channel. That allows doubling bandwidth again without the burst length becoming longer than the standard 64-byte cache line size.')
