The problem with Java is its culture, which cannot be fixed by same thinking which created it.<p>And by culture I mean, java attracted people who think that lines of code are cheap and see nothing wrong with a 200 line class which has no actual behaviour beyond boilerplate. People who measure their output by the number of lines of code added per day, not the number of features added to a project per year.<p>Any &quot;fixed&quot; version of java needs to either bring those people along - and in the process import a lot of java&#x27;s stale thinking. (Some corners of the C# world struggle with this). Or leave those people behind and build a new community around your new thing (eg Scala, Clojure). You can see this in the java community already - there are plenty of tools in the modern JVM for doing terse functional programming. But as far as I know that stuff remains unpopular. Why? My theory is that most of the people who really care about writing terse, efficient, maintainable code jumped to better languages years ago.')
