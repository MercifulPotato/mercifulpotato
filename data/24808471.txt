But I think there are a lot of areas where FOSS is becoming a clear answer.<p>Think of the jobs that require people to use a cloud based software for 90% of their work, these jobs just need a good browser like Firefox and a office suit like LibreOffice[1].<p>Take 2D&#x2F;3D design work. 10 Years ago it was almost impossile to get any decent 2D&#x2F;3D work done on foss now there are powerful tools like GIMP[2], Inkscape[3], Scribus[4], and Blender[5], Godot[6].<p>I agree the non FOSS alternatives are a lot more smoother than the FOSS alternatives, but this is a compromise worth making when we consider how user hostile some software companies have become in the recent years and if more people turn to FOSS their pain points can be converted in to tools that helps us all improve FOSS.<p>We are at a time when a few software companies have so much power they are even able to play with our ability to participate in a democracy and I think its our responsibility as software folk (most of us here) to help guide people in the FOSS direction than trying to nudge everyone away from it because of a few pain points.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.libreoffice.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.libreoffice.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gimp.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gimp.org&#x2F;</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inkscape.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inkscape.org</a><p>[4]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scribus.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scribus.net&#x2F;</a><p>[5]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blender.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blender.org&#x2F;</a><p>[6]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;godotengine.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;godotengine.org&#x2F;</a>')
