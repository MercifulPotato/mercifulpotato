For my previous non-Bluetooth pair, the earpads eventually wore out and sort of disintegrated (after something like 8-10 years), but I bought a pair of replacement pads online and everything was back to new again.  Haven&#x27;t had that issue with my QC35II&#x27;s yet.<p>All that to say -- I&#x27;d think all things being equal, good-quality plastic &amp; lighter would be the way to go.')
