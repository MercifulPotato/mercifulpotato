I used Emacs for a long time, but slowly got weaned off it.<p>- I used it for email, then I had to collaborate with people who wrote &quot;please see my comments in orange below&quot;.  (Of course, they were Outlook users.)  Emacs did not show that orange color, so I didn&#x27;t know...  Maybe these days it&#x27;s possible to read Outlook emails nicely in Emacs.<p>- I used it for development, then the Java software I worked on got too big to internalize all APIs and Eclipse completion and refactoring really helped.  I did try to build the Eclipse &quot;quickfix&quot; thing in Emacs, but all I got done was to add a missing import (because JDEE, I think it was, provided that functionality).<p>- I switched from Linux to Windows because the world around me was like that, and so I could help junior colleagues with their EOL problems...<p>- I used Mercurial (hg) for a while and TortoiseHg was really nice, so I didn&#x27;t feel the need to use Emacs for this.<p>It&#x27;s a pity, really.  Some aspect here, some aspect there, and then you get pulled away from Emacs.<p>Now, with LSP, perhaps Emacs could offer code completion and refactoring, but the Java app I work on builds with gradle, and I have no clue how to tell the Java&#x2F;LSP thing about the class path...  So I&#x27;m on IntelliJ...')
