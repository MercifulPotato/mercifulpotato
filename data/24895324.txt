Stop it completely in its tracks.  That&#x27;s true for some, but it&#x27;s not that simple for others.<p>Unfortunately a measured immune response does not ensure:<p>- That the virus can&#x27;t be transmitted to others<p>- That you are less likely to catch and replicate the virus<p>- That you can&#x27;t get ill from the virus<p>- That you can&#x27;t get &quot;long covid&quot; symptoms<p>- That you can&#x27;t die from covid<p>- That the immune response lasts for more than a few months (this is why we keep getting some of the same cold viruses; our immunity to them doesn&#x27;t last)<p>- That the R number goes down (if it doesn&#x27;t prevent transmission)<p>- That the R number doesn&#x27;t go up (if people change behaviour in response to knowing they or other are vaccinated)<p>- That the virus won&#x27;t evolve a workaround in response, like the rapidly mutating flu viruses<p>An immune response certainly <i>suggests</i> those things.  But we can&#x27;t be certain from immune response alone.  Consequences need to be measured as well.  We&#x27;ll have a real solution when those sorts of things can be demonstrated, but it will take much longer to find out unfortunately.  Probably we have to deploy a vaccine on a large scale somewhere before we can even find out how effective it is in the ways that ultimately matter.<p>Still, if a vaccine combined with uptake and people&#x27;s behaviour reduces R below 1.0 at scale, that&#x27;s enough to be a breakthrough.  The greater the reduction the better, but 1.0 is the magic number.<p>Even if there&#x27;s one good vaccine, having multiple good vaccine types in the world will be better.  The virus is less likely to evolve a defence against multiple vaccines than against a single type deployed everywhere.<p>The fact this vaccine targets the spike protein is also good news, because even if the virus evolves, there&#x27;s evidence that the spike protein is key to its harmfulness, so any evolved strains that keep it will likely trigger an immune response, and evolved strains that change the spike protein seem likely to be less harmful too.')
