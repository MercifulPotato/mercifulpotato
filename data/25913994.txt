If you&#x27;re like me, that terrifies the F out of you. I&#x27;m 42, have a great family, a good 9-5, but everyday of my life i think only of leaving my 9-5.<p>There&#x27;s a quicker and 100% reliable way of getting out of the 9-5 grind: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;earlyretirementextreme.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;earlyretirementextreme.com</a>. TLDR: reduce your expenses as much as possible (ideally to 10-20% of your post-tax earnings), save the rest and, over a couple of years, accumulate enough to just live off the savings (and investment income off the savings) till the end of your life. It&#x27;s easy, certain and thus non-stressful - basically the opposite of the startup route. The drawback is that, for someone who&#x27;s been living their life as an ultraspecialized consumer whose only skill is what he does at the well-paid job, while everything else (food production and preparation, home repairs etc.) is outsourced, it could be a shock to switch to a rennaisance man model.')
