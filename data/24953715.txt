But I have a genetic disorder that impairs fat processing (so I had no real fat stores to draw on while fasting) and I began fasting or semi fasting while homeless at times when I was too broke to afford food.<p>Initially, it was extremely hard on me. I routinely threw up on fasting days and usually managed to get <i>something</i> into me so was really only light rationed, not actually fasting. It took <i>years</i> for me to get well enough for fasting to stop being horrible torturous drama and I still have extremely severe diarrhea when I resume eating.<p>Second, there is a thing called Refeeding Syndrome that can occur when you break a fast. It can be deadly.<p>I think it benefits a lot of conditions, but if you have a condition, it&#x27;s also potentially dangerous to try it and we need to get a lot more savvy about how people with conditions can safely try it.<p>With asking around about Refeeding Syndrome and some best practices for how to effectively break a fast plus some experience, breaking a fast has gotten to be a lot easier on me.<p>I could have potentially died from fasting and it likely wouldn&#x27;t have been blamed on fasting. My condition is serious enough they would have blamed my condition.<p>But it has proven beneficial and I hate it less than I used to.')
