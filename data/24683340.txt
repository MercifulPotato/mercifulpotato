Item(by='whoevercares', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601856812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24683035, text='Yes, The Chinese college entrance examination has been the only hope for the huge amount of people in poverty(cheat and corruption are surprisingly rare) and the brightest ones get full PHD scholarship in the US. For those people financial safety is absolutely the No.1 concern. I’d say discrimination aside, the huge hope from their family is also a strong motivation.<p>Btw as someone who went through the preparation of the exam in China(tried 2 times actually), the last year of high school is like a living hell. My teacher was yelling at the class “it’s 6:30am already and the classroom is still not full. Do you fking want to go college?”<p>I don’t blame her, one point difference in score turns out to be 2000+ people in the regional ranking')
