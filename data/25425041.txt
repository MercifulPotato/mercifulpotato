Universal carbon-tax with increasing fee schedules. Everyone pays for their carbon emissions. The sum is then distributed back to everyone evenly as a Green Dividend minus admin costs. Net zero cash to the government, whopping undirected green energy subsidy possible by tuning amounts. It already worked for Sulphur Dioxide.<p>As a matter of personal preference? Well, I get nothing from this except the right to brag I&#x27;m carbon negative so really it could totally be equivalent to indulgences. As it so happens I do care to be doing my part, but you&#x27;re right in that there&#x27;s no incentive for that.<p>&gt; <i>How many emissions in the US come from the use of AC and heating due to basically zero federal building standards for energy efficiency?</i><p>Right, but I live in California and have no AC.')
