Item(by='greggman3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605009713, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25043731, text='only related by &quot;git&quot; but while I believe i&#x27;m fairly proficient in git I&#x27;m not sure how to go about explaining to an inexperienced person how to fix a merge conflict.<p>It feels like not a simple thing to explain.<p>As an example someone sent me a PR with 15 commits. github claims only 1 file has changed and it&#x27;s a new file so no conflicts (which AFAIK is correct) but git complains that somewhere around commit 4 there&#x27;s a conflict.<p>The person sending the PR is not git comfortable, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have this PR with 14 old unrelated commits showing up.<p>I have no idea what state they are currently in as well. meaning, I know the state of the PR but I don&#x27;t know the state of their local machine.<p>I can clone their branch and make the merge myself but their next PR will just be the same branch they continue to work on.<p>Explaining to them how to fix what they have and how to proceed going forward seems like it requires a very large reply. Several pages. (here&#x27;s how to fix this PR, this how to fix the state of your main&#x2F;master branch, here&#x27;s how to make different branches, here&#x27;s how to update after each PR, here&#x27;s what to do if the conflicts are real, here&#x27;s what to do if you haven&#x27;t made any more changes to your main branch., here&#x27;s what to do if you have already made changes to your main branch.<p>I have no suggestions for solutions except to try to point them to other articles&#x2F;pages&#x2F;tutorials on the web')
