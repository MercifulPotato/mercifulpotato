Item(by='filoleg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609802683, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25638946, text='&gt;I&#x27;ve rejected a good bunch of candidates that can pass coding tests while not having any good understanding of theory, hardware, OS, networking, security<p>Those are valid points, fully agreed. I think the discussion of those topics must be included in an interview process and discussed in-depth too, leetcode-style problems are not sufficient enough on their own.<p>&gt;Leetcode focused on tricks and memorizing algorithms.<p>Strong disagree on &quot;memorizing&quot; and only partially agreed on &quot;tricks&quot;. Those &quot;tricks&quot; (like knowing that you should use a hashmap when you need a key-value datastructure, or memoizing [aka caching] repeated operations) are very useful in real life problem-solving situations at work. I can tell you for a fact, I don&#x27;t remember almost any particular problem from leetcode, and I ended up solving certain problems multiple times on leetcode, because I couldn&#x27;t recognize them at all. However, thanks to leetcode, I obtained a pretty solid intuition on which approach to use in a particular situation, and it helped me out in the workplace immensely (even if I don&#x27;t directly implement those approaches or remember the specifics 99% of the time).')
