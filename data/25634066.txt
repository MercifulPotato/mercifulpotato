There&#x27;s no reason I can see that they would have had to join the CWA.<p>The advantage of affiliating with a larger organization is their weight becomes a part of your collective bargaining strength. That is, if Google does something the union doesn&#x27;t like then the entire CWA might get mad at them. I don&#x27;t know that there are any clear disadvantages from a union&#x27;s perspective, which is why basically all organizing efforts do it.<p>From a bird&#x27;s eye perspective, the disadvantage is that there&#x27;s no meaningful competition or innovation, because all new unions see themselves as part of the traditional union movement where solidarity is prized. If someone else formed a competing union with a clever new idea for how to organize Google workers, the CWA-backed union would denounce it and demand that Google refuse to talk to the second union.')
