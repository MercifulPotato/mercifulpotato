The First Amendment protects the freedom of speech, but how many people feel comfortable to freely speak their mind at one of the corporate training courses on diversity and inclusion for example? People everywhere are smart and learn that if if you know what&#x27;s good for you, there are some things you should say and some things you shouldn&#x27;t. The set of things you should or shouldn&#x27;t say may be different in China than in the US, but the curtailment of freedom is present in both places and different only in a matter of degree.')
