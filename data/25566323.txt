Item(by='rossnordby', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609211372, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25565444, text='I think there might be a couple of things going on here:\n1. Slightly differing definitions of what constitutes &#x27;angry&#x27;, and\n2. Dramatically varying subjective experiences of anger.<p>For example, in the case of #1, I usually separate &#x27;frustration&#x27; from &#x27;anger&#x27;, but I could see someone else bundling them together. They share a lot of physiological effects, but I generally think of anger as a more focused and <i>directed</i> feeling. I could be <i>frustrated</i> while failing to debug something, but not meaningfully angry, because the bug is not an agent with malicious intent (or other common target of anger).<p>And for #2, I&#x27;ve known people who get mad and have an extremely hard time controlling it. Someone or something slights them, it ruins their mood, and then <i>sustains</i>. And they&#x27;re aware of it the whole time, wishing they weren&#x27;t mad, because they hate feeling that way. But they&#x27;re still mad.<p>In comparison, I seem to be lucky. I <i>have</i> gotten genuinely mad before, but exceedingly rarely- maybe a few times in my entire life, and only then mostly in response to years of sustained bad behavior, and only when I was much younger. I wasn&#x27;t trying to be a paragon of stoicism, I just don&#x27;t get angry very often by default.<p>Stack a little bit of effort on top of a baseline like that, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to go beyond merely <i>not acting</i> on anger to smoothing away even the subjective experience of it. Maybe a short and mild response, here and there, but it almost always immediately fades.<p>I strongly doubt I&#x27;m the most placid person in the world, so there are probably people out there who are even less angry by default. I bet others have put more effort into controlling their anger, too. It seems likely that &quot;eradication&quot; of anger is within the realm of possible for some.')
