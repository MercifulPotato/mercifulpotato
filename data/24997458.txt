They never generate gigabytes of local data and never modify local data other than dragging an email attachment (or scanning a paper lab result) and dropping it into a clinical IS from time to time.<p>How is it possible that ransomware can wreck this (windows computer) and hundreds like it?\nHundreds of similar hospital scenarios are happening all over the world as we speak.
