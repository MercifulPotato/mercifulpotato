Fox news is a high profile example, but many news sources do this. The inter mixing of news and opinion without clearly defining what is opinion, leads to the spread of opinion as truth.<p>* encouraging social media sites to require political ads be transparent of who funds them and make it clear to a viewer.<p>* require political ads to provide sources for their claims.<p>* Bring back some form of the fairness doctrine to prevent hyper partisan news.<p>Accountability to me means, there should be transparency to the consumer of news of where the content is coming from, differentiating news and opinion ,and providing them with the direct means to learn more.<p>A large part of the article is about how there&#x27;s no easy paper trail for the lay person to verify their source.<p>I would like to take the emotion and deceit out of politics and news. Free speech is great, but it hasn&#x27;t scaled well with the unfettered ability for deceit to be part of it. There should be solutions to provide more free speech while allowing people to curtail the inherent deceit that it also allows, by arming them with the mental tools to do so.')
