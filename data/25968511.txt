Has existed for the past 10 years to support enterprise MDM. Only catch is that to install the DPC you have to factory reset your phone to place it into the special state where no accounts have &quot;ever&quot; been signed in to, which is what allows a DPC to be installed. (Removing all accounts from the device may also work)<p>The nice thing is that once the DPC is installed you can `adb install -r` (reinstall, ie update) it without needing to factory reset. Just don&#x27;t uninstall it accidentally :D')
