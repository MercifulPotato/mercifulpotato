Bonito is rich in protein. If unprocessed, it has a 25% protein content, and if used to make katsuobushi, its protein content increases to 77%. It is also rich in inosinate, an important umami substance; the umami is multiplied many times over when combined with glutamate.\nThis is the mechanism behind ichiban dashi (“first soup stock”) in Japanese cuisine.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.umamiinfo.com&#x2F;richfood&#x2F;foodstuff&#x2F;katsuobushi.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.umamiinfo.com&#x2F;richfood&#x2F;foodstuff&#x2F;katsuobushi.htm...</a>')
