Because I did and have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about. BTW the README can be found at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;ytdl-org&#x2F;youtube-dl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;ytdl-org&#x2F;youtube-dl</a> if anyone wants to see for themselves.<p>As for the test cases, this is what the article has to say about it:<p>&gt; they are automated test cases where the test just downloads the first 10KB, which amounts to a couple of seconds at most. This is certainly fair use, but the project is fully functional without these test cases.<p>So what part of this article are you agreeing with? I doubt we read the same article.')
