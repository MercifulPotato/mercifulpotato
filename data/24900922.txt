Item(by='LeifCarrotson', descendants=None, kids=[24902100], score=None, time=1603743779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899976, text='The &quot;How <i>to</i> digital photography&quot; guides are more like a cookbook, which tells you what steps to follow to get a result, where this is more like a technical reference, that tells you what the camera is doing and why you&#x27;d want to take a given action to get a certain result. Personally, I don&#x27;t consider myself to really understand a subject until I find (or reverse-engineer for my own use) a good technical reference: I might be able to get results, but if the black magic doesn&#x27;t work as expected, I&#x27;m stuck calling someone who does understand the &#x27;why&#x27;.<p>I suppose a better question might be why hasn&#x27;t Panasonic updated this guide?  I don&#x27;t think the subject matter has been nearly constant enough. What about Panasonic might have had the finances and institutional willpower to task a group of engineers, web developers, and technical writers&#x2F;drafters with the job of creating this, but not had the power to keep it updated or recreate it today? It&#x27;s very old - are their customers all 15-year veterans who got into the field needing this reference, but subsequently kept informed of news developments with piecemeal updates?')
