This is exactly the type of thing it&#x27;s designed to protect us from.<p>But I think with the current high bar for anti-trust, it can be argued that Apple is &quot;hurting consumers&quot; through the lock-down of their platform.<p>It&#x27;s fine that Apple should offer a safe, curated experience of using their devices through the App Store.  I&#x27;m even fine with the App Store having some OS-level integrations which would not be available to 3rd parties.  But the App Store should have to compete on its own merits for how it delivers value to the customer - it should not be the only option by fiat.  Maybe at the beginning, but not when smartphones are the dominant computing platform and the main way people use software on a daily basis.<p>The 30% cut which Apple requires is simply not justified for how much value Apple offers to businesses which drive revenue through the App Store.  Again, maybe at the beginning, but the App Store no longer offers any meaningful benefit in terms of discoverability.  Losing almost 1&#x2F;3 of revenue out of the gate can make the difference between viability and not for a lot of companies at the margins, meaning this policy costs the user access to all those products which might be able to exist were it not for the &quot;apple tax&quot;.<p>Even under the current legal framework, I just don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s justified.')
