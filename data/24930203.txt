This is why they went after geek hobbies specifically: science fiction, open source, comics, cartoons, video games, and tabletop RPGs -- because geeks are sensitive and accommodating, and shouting at them how racist and sexist they are is bound to make them stop and reflect -- leaving them wide open to further attack. Had they chosen to attack pastimes rife with actual racists and sexists -- tailgate parties in rural Georgia, say -- they&#x27;d be routed, because racists and sexists don&#x27;t have the fucks to give about their behavior.<p>As I&#x27;ve said elsewhere, &quot;SJWs&quot; aren&#x27;t really geeks. They are more like mentally deranged normies who long to sit at the cool kids&#x27; table, but don&#x27;t stand a chance of ever sitting there, so they take over the geeks&#x27; table, because better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.')
