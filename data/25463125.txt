The reality is more boring than what people believe - it&#x27;s simply that the manufacturers who falsely declare CE compliance don&#x27;t even bother to get the correct drawing of the CE symbol (which is the maximum possible level of non-compliance, not even the logo!). Yes, the logo is a forgery, and the nickname &quot;China Export&quot; is a humorous way to describe it, but it must be emphasized that there&#x27;s no &quot;China Export&quot; symbol - it simply doesn&#x27;t exist, not defined by any government agency or trade association in China.')
