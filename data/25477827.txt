English is my second language and by performance I assumed the overall performance within all the constraints, that is, temperature, noise, and battery included. If I was to type everything explicitly, the article would be very exact, but very long and hard to read. The exactness wasn&#x27;t so important in this sentence, as I think it&#x27;s clear I&#x27;m aware of how it is given I earlier mentioned I enjoyed articles where this is considered and explained.')
