I seriously doubt they’ll release the details necessary to develop independent drivers for those... whether it’s Microsoft or Linux.<p>So there’s good reason to believe it may be macOS only.<p>Personally I’ll believe it when I see it... because right now there are no 3rd party iPad or iPhone operating systems. So a better question is probably: what makes you think there will be 3rd party OS support?')
