I still always felt groggy and had a head fog. For the last 2 years I decided to discipline myself to get roughly 8 hours of sleep every night (a sleep mask to block out excess light has been a God send). Also no caffeine after 5pm and only 2 cups of coffee max per day. Oh and less carb, more protein diet with daily exercise. In essence, I quit giving myself excuses for being a lazy whinner. Other than the Thanksgiving food coma, I dont take naps because, and sit down for this revelation, I dont need to since I get a proper amount of rest nearly every single night. Look, sometimes life throws shit in your face and a nap is a great stop gap remedy to pull you through. Nothing wrong with getting stitches when you get a cut. Theres a problem when you keep cutting yourself because you jump into a pool of knives everyday. It&#x27;s just weird that we are fetishizing piss poor health habits and then glorifying the bandaid fixes instead of simply addressing the main problem. But hey, that&#x27;s the great evil self-responsibility everyone wants to avoid.')
