We have a projector setup that we plug iPhones&#x2F;iPads&#x2F;MacBooks into, so we can AirPlay the audio from those to the speakers at the front of the room. Currently we AirPlay to an Airport Express (c. 2009?) that sends sound out to speakers. This works around the challenge of having video going out at the back of the room (to the projector) and needing audio to come out at the front of the room.<p>This system doesn&#x27;t work when we&#x27;re playing Nintendo Switch, in which case the audio just comes out of the projector. For our purposes, that&#x27;s fine; but I could see how someone playing Xbox would want that to be hooked into their audio system. I wonder if there would be some way to pipe audio through an old Mac mini to accomplish this. At that point it&#x27;s probably worth just paying the Sonos tax.')
