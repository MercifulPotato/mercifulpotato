No other place would have given me such amount of wealth in a relatively short amount of time (10 years now). Growing up poor, I appreciate it tremendously and it enables a lot of freedom for my future self.<p>- Live a very frugal and minimalistic lifestyle. I live on about 4% of my gross income (crazy! See previous point) and I love it. I eat healthy, exercise a lot, have a wonderful partner, plenty of discretionary time because we don’t have to care for material belongings.<p>I am also firmly in the camp of not wanting kids, and firmly believe it is the right decision for me: I’ll let you know in a few decades if it was a good call or not :-)')
