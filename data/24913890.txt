Only by outsmarting it at every turn, and having safeguards against every mishap, can you go home at the end of the day.<p>When something happens despite all that, just step back and realize how much worse it could&#x27;ve been, and how successful your safeguards have been up &#x27;til that point.<p>Then look carefully at the procedure. Is there something about the naming or structure that could be more clear? Can you think of near-misses that resemble the failure you just experienced? Are you using boobytraps in production? Symlinks and overlay filesystems seem clever in the moment but they&#x27;re bound to subvert our intuition someday. Perhaps you should get in the habit of always using full absolute paths, for instance.<p>There&#x27;s always another gotcha, but if your workflow doesn&#x27;t look as over-the-top safety-silly as aerospace, you&#x27;re not doing as much as you could be. (Hint: It&#x27;s not silly.)')
