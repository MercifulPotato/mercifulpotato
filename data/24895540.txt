He can&#x27;t really do anything to control what is sent to him, so verifying that these emails were sent doesn&#x27;t really prove anything. If he had <i>forwarded</i> the emails in a way that indicated his agreement, or if they had been sent by someone else connected to the candidate, that would be a situation in which DKIM would be relevant.')
