We had wars in Yugoslavia, Chechnya, and more.<p>But, in general, I do have a sense it was a uniquely optimistic decade for many people in the former First World, mainly because the Cold War ended and there was a sense that we had &quot;won&quot;. Western Europe in particular demilitarized a lot as a result, the EU was formalized, the Good Friday Agreement was signed, Oslo Accords happened, end of apartheid etc.<p>For Americans I think 9&#x2F;11 derailed things again.<p>Outside of the former First World, I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;d see the 90s the same way.')
