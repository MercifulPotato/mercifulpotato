That was a hard day, it was his life, and his fathers life. His father and his grandfather moved to Florida and homesteaded the land, it was a hard pill to swallow, but he knew there was no future in it for the future family given the realities that it is the way America was aligning farming resources. I totally get it that is why I convinced him to sell the land, but it sucks when you are on the receiving end of policy set to realign a segment of the American economy, that being said, there are always going to be winners and looser of policy decisions, I am happy with the way life turned out, he was proud of me and the path I choose before he passed.<p>I was just noting that there was a human toll that happened for all this farm land to be rolled up by the conglomerates. Not implying that it was the wrong decision on the larger geo-political scale.<p>I would like to see the return of small farms if someone can make it viable, I would not trade the life I lived as a child for anything, but as I said above, I will never again scratch a living out of dirt, unless it is absolutely necessary for my and my families survival.')
