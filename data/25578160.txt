I always referred to Python when I needed to quickly write some tool for personal use, but never professionally, even though I am a professional programmer. And recently while writing something like this I was struck with how bad <i>my</i> Python actually is in 2020, compared to how other languages I know currently look. Quick lookup shows that it seemingly has pretty powerful typehints system now, but I never used it. I have no idea, which parts of standard library you aren&#x27;t supposed to <i>actually</i> use anymore, and use some well-established 3rd part library instead (like it was with requests). And stuff like that. And is it even a good idea, to finally switch to the newest versions of Python and to never look back?<p>So, basically, what&#x27;s the best way to catch up?')
