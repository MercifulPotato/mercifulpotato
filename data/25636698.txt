Item(by='ordu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609788888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25636267, text='&gt; Would one turn into the quality downvote while the other turned into the feelings downvote?<p>No, they wouldn&#x27;t. The problem is that if considered intrapersonal, different buttons could get different qualities, but when considered interpersonal they probably wouldn&#x27;t.<p>There are different possible ways to fill multiple downvote buttons with a sense. For example, it could be &quot;feelings downvote&quot; and &quot;quality downvote&quot;. Or &quot;quality downvote&quot; and &quot;feelings downvote&quot; from left to right. Or it could be &quot;slight downvote&quot; and &quot;strong downvote&quot; and &quot;slight+strong downvote&quot; which is even stronger. Different people will use buttons differently, so in average it would be the same mess. Probably if a PhD dug into the raw data, she could make sense from it by categorizing downvoters and summing up their votes with normalizing coefficients, but I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Lichess recently changed their puzzles and forced me to vote for each puzzle. I really do not know which puzzle is good and which is not. I struggled to find a way to vote, and finally came to a simple strategy &quot;upvote each puzzle&quot;, because I do not know any better. I&#x27;m sorry I did it, I wish to help lichess, but do not know how to. When faced with two downvote buttons I probably would struggle to make sense of it, then I&#x27;d find some simple strategy which I could verbalize and stick to it. It would be improbable, that the strategy would be &quot;feelings&quot; vs &quot;quality&quot;, because how could I separate my feelings from a perceived quality?')
