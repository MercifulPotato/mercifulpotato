It feels like embarking into an entirely new field.<p>I know Google works for these questions, but I&#x27;d like to hear opinionated responses if people have experience:<p>How do you manage &#x2F; version assets? Git? Git LFS? ...?<p>How do you import photogrammetry assets? Do you need to process them in other software first, and is there a desired format to put them in? What&#x27;s the best way to import and version them?<p>Is networking support for multiple players something that works out of the box? Or do you have to hand roll this and the server code?<p>Are there tools for integrating sensors like VR tracking and Kinect? What about adding real time point cloud data into the scene?<p>How do you tweak shaders? Is there a good guide to shader development that is Unreal Engine aware?<p>How do you delve into raw C++? Is Rust supported?<p>How might I find people with experience to work with, review my code, or potentially hire?')
