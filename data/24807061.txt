Bcp38 would help here.<p>Botnets generating a ton of UDP to destinations. Hosters, cloud providers (especially those with vulnerable&#x2F;open EMR clusters) and broadband ISPs with easily compromised customers are the problem here. Kudos to those who take down the botnet command and controls.<p>Memached&#x2F;ntp&#x2F;cldap amplifiers. Still out there, still a problem.
