I wouldn&#x27;t call my experience with them &quot;extensive&quot;, but neither am I a blushing na√Øf, and I&#x27;ve never found them to be pleasurable for their own sake. Granted, this may in part be due to the fact that my only encounter with heroin was as part of a luckily failed attempt at sexual assault, but it&#x27;s not as if I&#x27;ve never tried prescription opiates for recreational purposes, and I&#x27;m told by those who should know that IV Dilaudid, which I was once given during an ER visit for what turned out to be a stuck kidney stone, is comparable to heroin in its effects and subjective experience. Later in the same visit, I was offered a second dose, but turned it down; something about the CT contrast I&#x27;d been given had by then moved the stone and alleviated the pain, or maybe it had just moved on its own, and I found nothing in the effects of the drug to desire for its own sake.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve known people who haven&#x27;t been so lucky, and have ended up badly hooked. I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t have spoken so positively about what opiates are like, when I can only really speak with confidence about what they&#x27;re like <i>for me</i>.')
