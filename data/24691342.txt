Should academics be judged on performance? If so, how?<p>Thank for the question. It is, indeed, easier to criticize rather than offer constructive suggestions.<p>Here are my thoughts on the reward system:<p>- I would like to see published conclusions challenged (if conclusions are based on data observations or empirical evidence). And if the challenge is clean and results are fair, then:<p><pre><code>   (1) The challenger gets a credit (regardless if the paper they challenged withstood the challenge or not)\n\n   (2) The original authors of the paper get credit if the paper withstood the challenge(s).\n\n</code></pre>\n- I would like to see a different credit system for papers in applied sciences,  based on whether the result is accompanied by an implementation. Where implementation is either a working inference system (if this is all based on data), or a prototype. The discoveries that are accompanied by a working, publicly consumed implementations, in my view deserve higher credit score.<p>In other words, I would much prefer that our academic discoveries are encouraged to build consumable implementations (unlike US Patent law that does not require an implementation of an invention).<p>-if an published paper or a conference presentation was incorporated by the same team into a patent, I would remove any academic credits received by the team&#x27;s researches.\nIn other words, I would prevent double-dipping, if I may call it that. If the given paper is incorporated into a utility patent by completely different people (and it withstood the USPTO scrutiny), then that&#x27;s ok.<p>- if a specific field of study is theoretical in nature (eg mathematics, may be theoretical physics). I would specifically reward joint publications, discoveries where \nthe theoretical subject matter is incorporated into applied field.<p>- I would include into the reward system  books, blogs and article posts that further public understanding of complex science topics (I would apply it for STEM subjects only).\nSuch that online video lectures, and other forms of free&#x2F;unpaid public education are specifically encouraged.\nI am not sure how exactly to measure effectiveness of this, but I am sure minds, brighter than mine, could come up with a fair, automatically-correcting model.')
