Get two so you can have one in the monitor and one in the laptop (or laptop bag). Also, you don&#x27;t need a USB c key for the monitor.<p>2) there&#x27;s the specific question of &quot;what is the surface area of attack?&quot;\nWith a yubikey, you limit that surface to &quot;people who have physical access to your device&quot;<p>I didn&#x27;t make the case that security is binary. I simply pointed out that they are severely compromising their security posture by re adding remote users as a surface of attack.<p>If someone compromises their machine and watches what steps they take to access eg a production network, the attacker will trivially see the yubikey being triggered. They don&#x27;t need to know what it is or why it&#x27;s being run. They&#x27;ll just know that after you ssh you run this script.')
