Eventually, we’ll be able to build fully-artificial self-replicating protocells (more “artificial cell” than “small robot”). Being fully-artificial will help us integrate new tech that nature hasn’t quite discovered&#x2F;made-full-use-of yet — like different battery techs, RF communication, transistors, etc.<p>Here’s a good paper exploring the topic:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2075-1729&#x2F;5&#x2F;2&#x2F;1019&#x2F;htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2075-1729&#x2F;5&#x2F;2&#x2F;1019&#x2F;htm</a><p>Imagine a blob that could wash along the floor, clearing 100% of detritus and intelligently depositing it — or perhaps even recycling it.<p>Imagine being able to repair a worn hip joint by injecting then commanding these protocells — no surgery required.<p>Imagine them self-assembling into structures to transport, deposit and combine material like an advanced 3D printer, building objects to incredible detail, or massive structures quickly, or both: massive structures with incredible detail.<p>Imagine programming them to kill all COVID-19 virions!')
