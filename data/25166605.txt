You are correct in what you should be focusing on. Only very large systems will see a return on investment in optimizing a system for hardware costs (bad code and crummy implementations should be worked out as tech debt). Focus on product, features and serving your customers. Get your market fit and burn your investor capital. Then when you reach that next stage, either sell to a company that is good at management or start hiring for performance.')
