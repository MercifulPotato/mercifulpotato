It is a bit too slow for me, and the features are pretty lacking. I don&#x27;t think a spartan &quot;no javascript&quot; take is what&#x27;s needed to cure the garbage that is  full reddit web experience. Still it&#x27;s a good first attempt.<p>I&#x27;m hoping someone will come along and create a lean, mean, yet functional semantic reddit web frontend.... That is, before reddit kills their API.')
