The thing is, a program written with non-blocking IO has a lot different structure than with blocking IO.<p>It can feel clearer and easier to reason about what happens on a single connection if the code is like:<p>accept, read, process, write and somewhere else handles the concurrency<p>Especially if the one system does a lot of different things, but they&#x27;re all related enough to be in one OS process, mashing together a lot of isolated non-blocking IO can be pretty tricky, and hard to keep track of.')
