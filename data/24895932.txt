It&#x27;s up to us to jump in and help people get heard. If we start running into the same problems as real life, then we&#x27;re going in the right direction.<p>I think a &quot;request the floor&quot; button still has its place in much larger group events (imagine a seminar), but for small to medium meetings it&#x27;s pretty overkill.
