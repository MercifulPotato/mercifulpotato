I think incentive is like a couple hundred euro a month on top of your base salary. I don&#x27;t actually work in ops even though I&#x27;ve been taking more op responsibility as time goes on, so being on-call isn&#x27;t part of my job (even though the on-call people have called me at least once in the past to help sort out issues).')
