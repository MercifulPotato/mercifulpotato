But I think the author should make it clear that he disabled text anti-aliasing for some reason. A lot of people in this thread are complaining how bad the text rendering is. As someone who uses GNOME (build with GTK) for years, I want to make it clear: GTK supports both anti-aliasing and hinting. The text rendering looks great! It&#x27;s really just one web search away to check the effects.')
