How do some people can work in the IT industry and promulgate the parent&#x27;s fatalistic outlook? Internet Explorer would be the dominant browser, Windows the only operating system, and we&#x27;d be discussing it in an MSN forum.<p>If people believed in this outlook, there was would be no democracy, human rights, and rule of law (in countries around the world), everything would be corrupt and would be the same everywhere, women and minorities would have made no progress, etc. To say it has no effect and nobody cares is edgy and cool these days, but obviously wrong.
