Claiming that Bannon was <i>unambiguously</i> not using a provocative&#x2F;hyperbolic figure of speech, but rather was <i>literally</i> calling for someone&#x27;s execution...seems a bit like cutting off your nose to spite your face (note: I am using that expression figuratively - I do not mean that people here or elsewhere are <i>literally</i> cutting their noses off).<p>To me, much of Western civilization seems like the Movie Lord of the Flies [1].<p><i>Lord of the Flies is a 1954 novel by Nobel Prize-winning British author William Golding. The book focuses on a group of British boys stranded on an uninhabited island and their disastrous attempt to govern themselves. Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality.</i><p>Except in our case, I don&#x27;t think there are going to be any adults showing up on the scene to stop us from killing each other.  Sadly, real life is often not rescued at the last moment as it often is in the movies, as anyone who has read history would well know.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lord_of_the_Flies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lord_of_the_Flies</a>')
