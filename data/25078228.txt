Claiming that Bannon was </i>unambiguously* not using a provocative&#x2F;hyperbolic figure of speech, but rather was <i>literally</i> calling for someone&#x27;s execution...seems a bit like cutting off your nose to spite your face (note: I am using that expression figuratively - I do not mean that people here or elsewhere are <i>literally</i> cutting their noses off).')
