For senior football, the playing field is an oval, typically between 135–185 metres (148–202 yd) long goal-to-goal and 110–155 metres (120–170 yd) wide wing-to-wing. Grounds can vary from long and narrow to almost circular, and are not necessarily symmetrical, depending upon how and where the field was constructed. At least 5 metres (5.5 yd) of space between the boundary line and any fence is required for safety.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Australian_rules_football_playing_field" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Australian_rules_football_play...</a><p>Canadian Football:  150 yards length overall, 65 yards width overall.  2.0144628 acres area, 0.81522418 hectares.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sportsknowhow.com&#x2F;football&#x2F;field-dimensions&#x2F;canadian-cfl-football-field-dimensions.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sportsknowhow.com&#x2F;football&#x2F;field-dimensions&#x2F;canadian...</a><p>The other question is if you&#x27;re looking for <i>length</i> or <i>areal</i> metrics.')
