Item(by='bonzini', descendants=None, kids=[25105006], score=None, time=1605473762, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25104222, text='It&#x27;s peak usage that is a problem, the average doesn&#x27;t matter much if everybody charges from 6 PM to 8 PM, does it? Is the grid sized for 50% of the households sucking 3 kW at the same time?<p>Peak usage also means that uncommon cases are going to be a problem. For long trips I am not sure that the supercharger networks can scale.<p>When travelling for vacation, for example, planning multiple 30-60 minutes stops at the supercharger station might not be feasible (and the fastest charging only fills the battery by about half of the capacity, so that means more stops) and there&#x27;s also going to be a problem with waiting times without massive infrastructure improvements. Right now a typical highway gas station has at least 5 pumps and it serves one customer in 3-5 minutes. That is roughly 60000 km-vehicle per hour. To reach a similar capacity, a supercharger station would need (at 30 minutes per 300 km and 150 kW per station) about 15 MW of power and its own high-voltage transformer.<p>Yet this capacity would be needed only when everybody moves for spring break or summer vacation, and it would be vastly more expensive than a gas station. Is it feasible to have such a thing every 50 km of highway or so?')
