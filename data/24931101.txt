They could require state ownership as condition of funding, but choose not to.  A sibling comment cited the Bayh-Dole act, which created the current paradigm of private ownership of inventions stemming from federally funded research contracts.  The nominal motivation was that the state had proven to be ineffective at promoting the commercialization and use of the technology resulting from its research contracts.  Since then, federal research agencies have implemented programs specifically meant to guide researchers through early-stage commercialization [0] and to provide additional funds to support commercialization [1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nibib.nih.gov&#x2F;research-funding&#x2F;concept-clinic-commercializing-innovation-c3i-program" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nibib.nih.gov&#x2F;research-funding&#x2F;concept-clinic-co...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sbir.nih.gov&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sbir.nih.gov&#x2F;</a>')
