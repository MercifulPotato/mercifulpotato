What matters is it’s performance as an asset class relative to your other options.<p>[edit] The point of inflation is manifold but to answer your question specifically inflation is meant in part as an incentive to invest. It’s function in a capitalist society is to encourage group evaluation of equities and help pick winners and trim losers. It sets the benchmark rate of performance for your investments.<p>Money is only useful when it moves. If it’s not collateralizing loans, and changing hands, economic activity slows and stops.  This economic activity is jobs people do day to day.<p>Deflation slows activity because if your money is worth more tomorrow than today it encourages inaction. In its worst incarnation you get a deflationary spiral where prices fall to stimulate buying but deflation continues anyways, and so on.<p>We can talk about whether that’s a good thing or not but it’s very much not what the coiners are advocating for.')
