The Economist has a journalist over in China, and he was interviewed recently on the economist&#x27;s podcast. He said covid has popped up a bunch of times since the pandemic started. Each time they&#x27;ve immediately launched strict lockdowns and border controls for the region involved. He&#x27;s personally been tested 7 times or something since covid started - apparently getting tested is often a requirement to travel anywhere in China.<p>Those policies sound even more strict than what we&#x27;ve been doing in Australia, and we had 2 weeks with 0 locally transmitted cases. With procedures like that it makes sense they have covid under control.')
