We&#x27;ve used it to &quot;devops the database&quot; in that all migrations are deployed via CI jobs triggered by git commits.<p>I do sometimes wonder if Liquibase or Flyway would be easier, but I love the encouragement to write _migration tests_, which do not always look like the unit tests you might write with pg_unit.<p>Something we struggle with is naming our migrations; the name you assign a migration is the only organizational control you have over it, and it becomes essentially impossible to introspect the current state of the database through the migrations alone.')
