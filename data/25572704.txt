It seems like you are saying that this lifestyle still exists in other places <i>than the place depicted on the Simpsons</i>. Another way to say that is &quot;The Life in the Simpsons is No Longer Attainable.&quot;<p>Saying that someone could have a similar lifestyle somewhere else doesn&#x27;t mean people are wrong when they imagine they can&#x27;t have it where they are now. It seems like you agree with that? Also, FWIW, working in the trades pays pretty damn good in cities too.')
