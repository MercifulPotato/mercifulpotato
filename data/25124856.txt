If you were doing development back then, you are likely familiar with &quot;ftp&quot; (or maybe &quot;sftp&quot;) and using it to upload files. Or maybe with CSV or SVN.<p>Question from the blogpost: &quot;I git pushed and I want to undo it&quot;<p>Compare with: &quot;I uploaded the file on the server with FTP, overriding previous version. How do I undo this?&quot;<p>Or: &quot;I did &#x27;svn commit&#x27;, how do I undo this?&quot;<p>Or: &quot;I have sent an email. How do I un-send it?&quot;<p>I am not sure where does the original author&#x27;s expectation that you can undo any action comes from. &quot;thrwyoilarticle&quot; seems to says this is because they started from &quot;github&quot; interface which has nice friendly UI which warns you about actions which cannot be undone. This sounds reasonable to me.')
