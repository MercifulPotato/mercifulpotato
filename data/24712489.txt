This is deeply embedded in the German approach of doing things.</i><p>&gt; <i>MARIN: That is part of a cultural thing: people trust each other.</i><p>&gt; <i>This culture, Marin says, also manifests itself in management style. Her research has shown that German C.E.O.’s are more willing to grant decision-making power to lower management. And that, she argues, improves quality. Because those are the managers who have the best sense of what customers want. This requires C.E.O.’s to have quite a bit of faith in their managers.</i><p>&gt; <i>You may be surprised to learn that German workers willingly accept a wage lower than the one their union negotiated. But they’d learned from history. Specifically, from their own history at the end of the Cold War.</i>')
