Right now I use a spreadsheet.  The &quot;killer feature&quot; I&#x27;ve been looking for is the ability to compare things.  Like, if I paid an extra $100 a month, how much faster would I pay off the loan and how much money would I save in interest.  Also maybe different repayment strategies.  Like one where your payments get gradually lower every month and one where they get gradually higher every month.')
