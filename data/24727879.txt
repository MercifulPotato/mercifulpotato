Give away the whole concept of API&#x27;s free of copyright? The reputational damage would be immense and probably spell the beginning of the end for Google.<p>I had the same thought (that Google is intentionally throwing the case) when I read over the Google lawyer&#x27;s approach, there&#x27;s no way the guy is that out of touch.<p>The Google of today is not the Google that started this case all those years ago and the Google of today is working alot harder to create its own walled gardens. They have alot more to gain from suing the pants off anyone who tries to interoperate with them, than they stand to lose from a few $billion payoff to Oracle.')
