Makeswift sites aren&#x27;t just a &quot;presentation&quot;, though. They&#x27;re hybrid (server-side rendered on first load and client-side rendered after) React apps. And because of that you can have components that do all sorts of things a &quot;presentation&quot; can&#x27;t do. For example, you can pull in data from third party APIs, you can build dynamic UIs with dialogs, you can animate components, you can submit forms, etc.<p>Not all of this is exposed just yet, which is why we&#x27;re in early access. But a Makeswift site couldn&#x27;t be further away from a &quot;presentation builder&quot;.<p>That being said, it does seem the way we&#x27;re presenting ourselves leaves much to be desired. So I appreciate you pointing that you!')
