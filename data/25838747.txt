You&#x27;re trying to represent a diverse set of people and industries. We shouldn&#x27;t screw over farmers because laws that work in cities are disastrous in rural areas and we shouldn&#x27;t screw over cities because of laws that work well in rural areas. We need the farms, mining, energy (solar and wind as well as coal and natural gas), fishing, etc that comes with rural areas. They provide us with food and many of our essential resources. Similarly we need cities and the resources they bring us: tech, finance, logistics, etc. We need both for a highly functioning state. So it isn&#x27;t so much land as voting but labor and utility.<p>And I want to be clear, I&#x27;m talking about equitable not equal. It seems weird to me that we don&#x27;t talk about it this way when we do in so many other conventionally left topics (race, gender, culture, religion, etc). So why screw over the other side just because they disagree with us politically? I&#x27;m all for proportionate representation but at some point you have to strike a balance. You need both sides of the country to be operating as efficiently as possible and while now we favor the rural states swinging in the opposite direction isn&#x27;t a balance, it is still a skew. Fairness doesn&#x27;t always mean equality because the nature of reality isn&#x27;t equal. Pretending that doesn&#x27;t exist just creates inequality.')
