Fred said it was Etsy, Paul said it would move up into hotels. Neither are really what happened.<p>Turns out in most places it&#x27;s profitable to arbitrage long term property cost and AirBnB income.  So you have a bunch of small time operators buying or leasing property and putting them on AirBnB.  AFAICT that seems to be the bulk of AirBnB business.  Not Etsy (person to person) nor Hotels.  But a new kind of &quot;hotel&quot; that consists of one person running a handful to a couple dozen apartments.')
