But you are really renting if apple can lock you out.</i><p>Only in the same way that you&#x27;re &quot;only renting&quot; a safelock if you can lock it and are not able to open it (e.g. by forgetting the lock, or having some key inside).<p>&gt;<i>My non technical wife managed to lock herself out of her device and icloud with no recourse as I didn&#x27;t preserve the reciept.</i><p>That&#x27;s a security feature. If there was a recourse then locking the device (when you&#x27;re done using it for the moment) would be security theater.')
