And they can come close to the power consumption of a pi, especially the somewhat newer ones.<p>A quick google shows reports of those HP SFF systems idling at between 3-10 watts, depending on how old they are. The Pi4 uses about 3 watts at idle. This matches my experience with that vintage of CPU.<p>They will use more power when active, but with better performance per watt, optimistically using less power for a give unit of work.')
