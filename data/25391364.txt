The amount of engineers scales very badly with respect to application complexity. I.e. you may need 100 or 1000 engineers to do something that &quot;looks&quot; about 2x as complex as something 10 engineers can do, and<p>2. The more complex solution tends to win in the market because on the one hand people value the application handling edge cases better, having shiny graphics, having slightly better UX, etc. and on the other hand you redeem the cost of paying those 1000 engineers thanks to software being free to copy and network effects &#x2F; monopoly.')
