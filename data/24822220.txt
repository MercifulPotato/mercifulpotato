I think i have listened to nearly all of them now. Melvyn Bragg is an acquired taste, at first i didn&#x27;t like the way he interjects very much but now i am used to his style it&#x27;s fine.<p>The main attraction is the calibre of his guests who tend to be excellent. Some people have had problems with the direct downloads in the UK, i think maybe only streamed in the UK. I find it odd (ironic?) that it can be easier to get BBC content abroad!<p>I particularly like the physics podcasts. The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximal[1] is one of my favourites.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;topics&#x2F;Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Thermal_Maximum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;topics&#x2F;Paleocene%E2%80%93Eo...</a>')
