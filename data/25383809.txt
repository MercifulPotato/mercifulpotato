As a person with ADHD (but on meds), and a possible CFS, I ask myself this sometimes.<p>While I wouldn&#x27;t use a disabled parking spot<i>, there are some exceptions from social norms that I allow myself:<p>- segregating trash (keeping an apartament clean and organised is crazy difficult by itself, and I still learn to put things into trash after using, at the age of 36)<p>- getting a sitting space in a crowded bus, even if there are old people around<p></i> As for the disabled parking spots, when I was ~25y.o., I had a knee issue for half a year. I didn&#x27;t limp much, but every single step was painful and difficult.\nIt was just half a year, and I didn&#x27;t bother to get a disabled license plate, but still fully deserved to use the spots.<p>Since that time I always have doubt whether to point out to someone that they took a disabled parking spot. The way I handle it now is by asking someone who leaves a car, who doesn&#x27;t look disabled, if they need some help (instead of pointing out that they are assholes). If they are indeed disabled, they won&#x27;t mind, if they aren&#x27;t - they feel like assholes :)')
