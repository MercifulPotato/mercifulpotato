See Hayden Publ&#x27;g Co., Inc. v. Cox Broad. Corp., 730 F.2d 64, 69 n.7 (2d Cir. 1984) (&quot;[A] party may have monopoly power in a particular market, even though its market share is less than 50%.&quot;); Broadway Delivery Corp. v. UPS, 651 F.2d 122, 129 (2d Cir. 1981) (&quot;[W]hen the evidence presents a fair jury issue of monopoly power, the jury should not be told that it must find monopoly power lacking below a specified share.&quot;); Yoder Bros., Inc. v. Cal.-Fla. Plant Corp., 537 F.2d, 1347, 1367 n.19 (5th Cir. 1976) (rejecting &quot;a rigid rule requiring 50% of the market for a monopolization offense without regard to any other factors&quot;).<p>And even IF Apple has not the dominant market share (which it does), it can still be engaged in anti-competitive practices, which it is currently being trialed for.<p>And last but not least, we (be it me as a consumer, Epic as a company, or Spotify) are not asking Apple to play by our own rules, but by the rules of LAW.<p>I feel like a lot of people are missing this point, this is the reason Epic is taking Apple to court, not because it won&#x27;t play to Epic&#x27;s rules but because of free market rules on which this country has been built.')
