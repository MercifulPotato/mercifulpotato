Does the government need a warrant to e.g. read comments on Hacker News?<p>The purpose of a warrant is to override the usual protections of privacy and against government intrusion. If the information in question is not private in the first place, there is no intrusion.<p>To be clear, I strongly agree with the conclusion that the <i>end result</i> is distasteful and we should make some sort of change in our society to avoid it. But I don&#x27;t think the right step is to say that certain information which is publicly available is somehow not available to the government - it doesn&#x27;t seem like either a sound argument or an enforceable restriction in practice. I think, if the information is too private to reveal to the government, it is certainly too private to be in the hands of an unaccountable unelected unauditable corporation in the first place.')
