So how can someone like that be so disingenuous about this topic?<p>There is currently basically no evidence whatsoever that Omouamoua is an alien constructs. If we are generous we can consider this at most a plausible explanation among others (certainly not the most plausible), and yet he is just pretending like this is not the case and putting on the front page of his book definitive statements like &quot;The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth&quot;, or saying that since all other possible explanation have been excluded (which is categorically wrong) then we must accept the remaining explanation that this an alien object.<p>What can push an Harvard academic to just disregard any scientific ethic and just go full-on junk science? Is it just a concession to sell more books or gain more fame?')
