But suppose BTC it is much higher on Binance. You&#x27;d then take USD and transfer them to Coinbase:<p>USD (Coinbase) -&gt; BTC (Coinbase) -&gt; BTC (Binance) -&gt; USDT (Binance) -&gt; ??<p>Now you need to take these USDT and turn them into USD, to keep the arb running. But that is precisely what doesn&#x27;t work.<p>So: the chain you outline is NOT a way to &quot;directly sell USDT for USD&quot;, as links can break down.')
