The story was worth reporting and it wasnâ€™t until the election was over and verified that major news sources decided to push it to the public.<p>&quot;Hunter Biden&quot; is not one monolithic story.  IIRC, Giuliani&#x27;s story was all about that laptop (and trying to make it look like <i>Joe</i> Biden was involved), but that laptop may in fact have <i>nothing to do</i> with this tax probe.  The existence of the latter doesn&#x27;t necessarily validate the former.<p>According to the story you posted:<p>&gt; Hints of the investigation emerged after President Donald Trump&#x27;s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, helped orchestrate news stories centered on a laptop purported to belong to Hunter Biden and said to include his business documents and other personal material.<p>&gt; The FBI took possession of the laptop in late 2019, according to a computer repairman in Delaware who showed reporters a copy of a subpoena. The subpoena is real, according to people briefed on the matter, but the FBI and prosecutors in Delaware have refused to confirm the existence of the investigation.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s unclear whether the laptop&#x27;s contents are relevant to the ongoing federal probe and whether investigators can even use them, given potential chain of custody requirements for evidence.<p>Pay attention to that last paragraph.')
