I agree that we haven&#x27;t in any way reached peak deployment of productive, intelligent software in the world, but even once we get there the robots still need to actuate in the physical world. Jointly, I think the sheer amount of investment thrown at pure software ventures in the past 20 years has certainly colored our perception of their potential agency, since financial output is only a fuzzy indicator of economic good.<p>If general AI was on the horizon, I might be able to give this attitude the benefit of the doubt, but we cant even rigorously prove that it&#x27;s possible at this juncture. The largest deployments of the latest generation of software acumen are probably social media, and I hope we&#x27;ve learned that that&#x27;s anything but a panacea.')
