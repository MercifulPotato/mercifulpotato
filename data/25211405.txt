It think it&#x27;s typical of cargo-culting: explanations don&#x27;t need to make sense, it&#x27;s all about the breathless enthusiasm.<p>Look, want to know how M1 achieve its result? Easy. Apple is first with a 5nm chips. Look in the past: every CPU maker gains both speed and power efficiency when going down a manufacturing node.<p>Intel CPU were still using a 14nm node (although they called 12+++) while Apple M1 is now at 5nm. According to this [1] chart, that&#x27;s a transistor density at least 4x.<p>Not saying Apple has no CPU design chops, They&#x27;ve been at it for their phones for quite a while. But people are just ignoring the elephant in the room: Apple gives TSMC a pile of cash to be exclusive for mass production on their latest 5nm tech.<p><pre><code>   [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techcenturion.com&#x2F;7nm-10nm-14nm-fabrication#nbspnbspnbspnbsp7nm_vs_10nm_vs_12nm_vs_14nm_Transistor_Densities</code></pre>')
