There are very talented software engineers and very talented non-software engineers. Regardless of the field, I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning how extraordinary it is to take on an engineering feat that comes with so much risk. And while this isn&#x27;t the case with the Curiosity rover, in my head I suppose I was thinking more of missions where human lives are at stake. I&#x27;m just a bit in awe at the courage and confidence someone must have to write code or design something and be comfortable that it will keep another human safe.')
