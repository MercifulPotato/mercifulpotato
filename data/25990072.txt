It nearly never is, and the fact that a dozen devs derived pleasure from creating them doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>I&#x27;ll go even further and claim that &quot;user choice&quot; is code for, &quot;warning: nobody in this space is competent enough in UI&#x2F;UX to derive pleasure from working on it.&quot; In fact in mastodon&#x27;s design, it&#x27;s not even code-- the &quot;choice&quot; of servers by topic is literally a limitation imposed on the user before even signing up. So the very first part of the UX has a circular dependency-- choose a server to try out the service and discover which server most suits your interests. It&#x27;d be like Google redesigning search so that you have to type subreddit-style topic into the URL before searching.<p>Additionally, this &quot;choice&quot; meme seems to conveniently disappear for software that has a thoughtful UI. I don&#x27;t see anyone talking about the downside of Krita <i>not</i> having multiple other half-baked UI&#x27;s than very impressive one it ships with.')
