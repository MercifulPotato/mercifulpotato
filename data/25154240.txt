I&#x27;ve discovered that I am nonplussed by patterns that leave other devs downright emotional and it&#x27;s just not worth the effort to discuss, especially when 99% of readability issues (eg naming) are absolutely undetectable to rubocop. Having a consistent style allows splitting styling and, erm, more fruitful readability discussions.<p>Anyway remember you&#x27;re writing code, not poetry. The inclination to act as if you&#x27;re writing the latter without any kind of cost&#x2F;benefit analysis is a major reason I dislike working with ruby devs. If only I were actually writing for powerpoint slides rather than for concrete business ends!')
