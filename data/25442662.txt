You can easily invoke bspc from any language of your choosing. No need to be limited by an inexpressive configuration file. No need to write the configuration in one specific language that the developer favoured.<p>Another feature I appreciate is that it does not bind any keys. It is left up to the user to implement. I get to choose which keys are used, and what they do. I wish all programs I used allowed me to configure their key bindings like this.<p>bspwm is less of a window manager in the traditional sense, and more of a tool that can be used to build your own window manager.')
