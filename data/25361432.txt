For instance, Detla Airlines was at 60 bucks a share before things tanked. There was talk about airline bailouts etc.<p>I bought it at around 20 dollars a share. This was the riskiest stock I purchased as it was theoretically possible they&#x27;d completely dissolve. But, at 20 dollars a share Delta should eventually go back up to 60. It might take 10 years for Delta to get back to 40 but it&#x27;d still be profit.<p>Anyone trading on a time scale of less than a few years is basically always optimistic. Buy and hold is generally the safest strategy. And the famous quote is timing in market beats timing into the market. In March you were able to effectively get on both trains simultaneously.')
