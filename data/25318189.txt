Because of time sheet. It&#x27;s either not tracked or questioned or sometimes it&#x27;s questioned too much.<p>2. PM is not technical and believes the story being told.<p>3. PM calls for a meeting and asks for status but doesn&#x27;t go to each people to collect information who is delaying or is he waiting for someone else&#x27;s input. Flow is cut somewhere.<p>4. With sprints, too many managers but all sprints are handled by few Dev&#x27;s, DBAs and testers.<p>5. Project changed its course into a discovery journey and everybody is too focused on the side track.<p>All this I have dealt.')
