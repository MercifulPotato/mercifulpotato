Here is what I wrote in response to your other dead comment. Look through the sources, it&#x27;s being thoroughly investigated and getting back negative results, which even if successful, wouldn&#x27;t address the need for immunity:<p>Quickly glossing over that paper, 8,000 participants is not more than 30,000 from AstraZeneca’s recent trial. So right there, your claim about it being a larger study is gone.<p>Then there’s the hazard ratio. There’s a small decrease in mortality but nothing overwhelming. Loads of other studies are out there showing increases in hospitalization time, higher likelihood of requiring intubation, no decrease in viral load and of course, increased mortality. Here is a good summary of those: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov&#x2F;antiviral-therapy&#x2F;chloroquine-or-hydroxychloroquine-with-or-without-azithromycin&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov&#x2F;antiviral-the...</a><p>Now I’m not saying we shouldn’t be trialing hydroxychloroquine…in fact we are! But you seem to be implying that we’re chasing after the wrong thing when in fact, we’re chasing after everything.<p>Long term side effects will be studied and in great detail. Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of time because we’re in the middle of a pandemic. Your solution requires hospitalization, ventilation and for people to continue getting infected, while infecting others because we have no immune defenses against the virus or its variants!<p>I’m not sure what else to say but you’re going to need a lot more than just one study to be retracted before anything you said starts to make sense.')
