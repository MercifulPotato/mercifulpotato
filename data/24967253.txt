My identity is that I want a healthy life. It is something that I will do for the rest of my life, so falling off the wagon every now and then is not much of a problem, it&#x27;s normal, I&#x27;m human!<p>Did I overeat one or two days? No regrets. I don&#x27;t have a goal that now moved further. It is what it is. Today is a new day and I&#x27;ll do what I normally do. Did I hit a plateau? Well, what can I do? My identity still says I should eat sensibly. I stayed off processed foods this week? Check. Did I consume excess sugar or soda? No. Ate my greens? Yip! So, my lifestyle is healthy no matter what the scale says. Did I go out with friends and overindulged? Hey, that&#x27;s a healthy lifestyle too! Just don&#x27;t do it very often.<p>Sure, I can give more practical advice and do think that OP is way too early to announce victory after just one month, but it&#x27;s a journey, you have to experience some things on your own.<p>I&#x27;ll just comment on calorie counting. Once upon a time I used to count calories to single digit accuracy. It&#x27;s not needed. Keep a rough track of your macros as some people say (protein and carbs are aroung 4KCal&#x2F;gram, fat is around 9KCal&#x2F;gram) and you will be fine.')
