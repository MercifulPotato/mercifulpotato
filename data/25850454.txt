We didn&#x27;t need that mechanism because we had another end-run on the principle that the Sovereign cannot withhold consent against the advise of the Cabinet an d no sovereign ever did so since 1708.<p>As I said there are differences but the overall system is basically the same shape. Specifically the Presidential Veto wasn&#x27;t conjured up out of thin air as a cunning plan to implement a system of checks and balances, it was just carried along with the general cut-and-paste.<p>The details do differ and have diverged over the centuries, for sure, but the basic executive role of the President in the US system today is that of George III in the 1770s. I also think there&#x27;s a case to be made that the political relationships between your branches of government would be much more familiar to a 18th Century British politician than their contemporary counterparts.')
