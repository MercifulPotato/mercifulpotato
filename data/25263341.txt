Never expected to see a danluu and Overwatch crossover. I am an ex-top 500 player in Overwatch. When I think back on it to become really really good (top 500 good) you need to just grind it out and win more than 50% of your games. Then, in the long run (I played thousands of games) you will become the best. You just have to improve and keep grinding. Every game should learn you a new lesson which you should apply to your next one. That&#x27;s how I became top 500 :)')
