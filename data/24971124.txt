Materialize lets you ask questions about your data, and then get low-latency, correct answers, which are kept incrementally updated as the underlying data changes.<p>Materialize is built on Timely Dataflow, a low-latency cyclic dataflow computational model, first introduced in the paper &quot;Naiad: a timely dataflow system&quot;. Materialize is co-founded by Frank McSherry, the primary author of Timely Dataflow (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;timelydataflow.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;timelydataflow.com</a>) and Differential Dataflow (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;differentialdataflow.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;differentialdataflow.com</a>), the two open source projects that power Materialize.
