This was in daylight, in San Diego-warm water, in maybe 8 or 9-foot waves, within sight of the shore, and seeing the waves about to break on my head still scared the living shit out of me. I can’t imagine going out in conditions like the ones in the article. I have lots of respect for the Coast Guard folks who go out into that stuff to help others.')
