It is run fast and loose by its managers.<p>I am glad the SEC came down on it. This is actually a very minor penalty and more like a slap on the wrist than anything else.

I encourage anyone else to do the same when they see something wrong with RH or any other trading platform.<p>RH needs to massively increase its controls as well as investor education.<p>I think this penalty is also a massive day of reconing for their business model. They need to move to more of a full service broker - like all the other old-school firms. There&#x27;s no money in order routing such as this. They need to boost their account size and attract higher quality users focused on investing - not gambling.')
