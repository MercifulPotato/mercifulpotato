Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609155431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25558248, text='&gt; “Terroir” is just marketing gobbledygook<p>A lot of it is definitely blatant Marketing, but having been in the culinary Industry and tasted countless wines from various regions their is definitely a reason why that phrase to describe a certain experience has persisted. Certain Pinot Noirs from various regions taste, smell and feel unique in your mouth and accentuate a dish differently than others.<p>And I&#x27;m not a wine snob by any means; I usually just drink whatever is Organic or preferably Biodynamic or leave it the the sommelier if I know them and is really just matching the right amount of tannins (or lack thereof) that matches the dish I&#x27;m eating or making, and I saw the leap that you&#x27;re describing in California happen in my lifetime.<p>Back then as a kid I saw wine as that horrible tasting stuff from a box we were forced to drink at church&#x2F;school in the US, in direct contrast with my Summers in Southern Europe where I had small glass at dinner which was remarkably smoother but something I personally didn&#x27;t enjoy at all and told it was because American&#x2F;Californian junk was inherently inferior. Only to turn the tables around in about a decade or so and created World class products from Sonoma and Napa that commanded a premium in Europe.<p>Which was also a phenomenon with olive oil by the way.<p>Personal anecdote: I can enjoy a $35 bottle of wine from Rioja just as much as a $200 bottle from Bordeaux depending on what I&#x27;m eating and I think food plays the bigger role in if I enjoy a wine or not than the wine itself. Also my Ag focuses just as much of not more on soil microbiology than the type of cultivar that is grown with remarkably different results, so the same should apply to grapes.')
