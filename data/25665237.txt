The question is, do you want a private corporation to dictate whether or not the government of the United States is able to communicate to the citizens? If you do, you are <i>effectively</i> placing the leadership of the country at Twitter&#x27;s discretion. Do you want to have a democracy where all voices can be heard, or do you want a small cadre of unelected corporate bureaucrats to decide what is allowed and not allowed?<p>We have an established democratic process to censure (not censor) and if necessary, remove from office elected officials. That is the appropriate venue and the appropriate authority to deal with this, not Twitter.')
