But for now I haven&#x27;t used anything better than audible.<p>1. Syncing audio between devices. (i.e. switch from listening on my phone to computer, etc)<p>2. Automatically back up the files, so when I switch devices the books are still there<p>3. A good app that that at \nminimum has the ability to listen to the audiobooks at double speed, but it would be nice if it could load the album art for free, and book description.<p>4. Also, it&#x27;s really nice to say &quot;Alexa, ready my audiobook&quot;, and it continues from where it left off.')
