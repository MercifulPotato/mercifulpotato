Apple is a trillion dollar company. These hackers saved them easily millions of dollars in expenses.<p>China or North Korea could easily allocate a much larger team to something like this and disrupt Apple (not for bug bounties). Although, China and North Korea dedicate their resources to financial fraud where there is real money to be had.<p>Apple is a tightwad joke. If they laid out a scope of work for a professional pen testing company that included pen testing their 17.0.0.0&#x2F;8 range then that contract would easily have been in the hundreds of thousands.<p>I’m sure foreign adversaries will take notice now. Apple’s cybersecurity posture has always been very weak. It’s known they don’t dedicated any resources to it.')
