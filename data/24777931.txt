You&#x27;re just making an argument for an inner platform, but without any factual justification.  Is sandboxing truly critical? (millions of graphical artists using Blender, Maya, etc don&#x27;t care)  Abstraction?  Why is that important, the amount of work to get a 3D app to do something interesting in the browser is about 10X that of writing a qtpy app, and I don&#x27;t see the value in any &quot;abstraction&quot;.<p>webgl was a good idea and I dedicated years to trying to make interactive browser applications, and now I&#x27;ve concluded that if I want to make product in time, that works for decades, on all platforms, at speed, I will use systems like Qt for desktop apps, not browsers.')
