I am happy that Android exists as a choice for users but let us not pretend there are no trade offs.<p>Android is not a choice for iOS users, it&#x27;s not a seamless switch. The solution as I see it is that apple could still very well protect users from &quot;trojans&quot; but have an opt-in for 3p app installation. A button that says &quot;I want to install apps from anywhere, I know the risks&quot;.<p>If I pay for the hardware, as a customer, I should be able to do whatever I want with it. With the iPhone, it feels like I&#x27;m renting rather than owning. I worry that&#x27;s the direction apple is taking Macs in with the M1.')
