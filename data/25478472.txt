That&#x27;s quite a stretch. I don&#x27;t think they hacked SolarWinds to &quot;prove how insecure closed source, proprietary software is&quot;. Why don&#x27;t they prove how &quot;insecure&quot; Kaspersky AV is, in that case? Seems strange to pick a software package that nobody&#x27;s heard of, but happens to be used by thousands of juicy industrial espionage targets of their primary political enemy.')
