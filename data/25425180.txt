MOS Technology got sued by Motorola for making the 6501&#x2F;6502 because they violated Motorola&#x27;s patents on the 6800 and took trade secret documents.<p>IC masks are protected as of 1984 (mask work is essentially copyright for the die), but the 6502 predates that.<p>Some companies (such as Intel) copyright the assembly-language mnemonics, but that wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.<p>I can&#x27;t think of other issues with the 6502 but I&#x27;m not a lawyer. Note the MOnSter 6502, a copy of the 6502 built from discrete transistors. I should also point out Ben Eater&#x27;s 8-bit CPU is a simple design, not a 6502.')
