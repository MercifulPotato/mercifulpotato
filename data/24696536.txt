We know, VPNs and other stuff in between are not so secure and not private. Stop saying it, don&#x27;t you have some other piece of knowledge to be proud of? for god&#x27;s sake. Tor and Signal are better than Public Cloud, Chrome &amp; SMS if you&#x27;re looking for privacy. Don&#x27;t you have common sense?<p>- HTTPS is more secure and private than HTTP<p>- Signal is more secure and private than SMS&#x2F;Skype&#x2F;Messenger<p>- Tor&#x2F;Browser is more secure and private than Cloud&#x2F;Chrome<p>- FileVault, BitLocker and LUKS are more secure and private than RAW unencrypted disk data<p>- 2FA and Hashing is better than raw Passwords<p>- List goes on and on.<p>All you have to do is: get out of your desperate situation where &quot;everything&#x27;s controlled&quot;, because it&#x27;s not true, at least not everything. We don&#x27;t have the best security and privacy but we have some of it AND we need to fight to keep and expand it.<p>Now go on and tell me how smart you are and how you see things different and generalize stuff again in replies. Or you can just shut up and stand up to contribute and improve it.')
