If so, do you have any tips?<p>I just dropped the link in the title into all the group chats I&#x27;m in, said I&#x27;m headed to signal and removed myself from the groups.<p>I was not the first person to do that in these groups. Will it cause a critical mass exodus? Idk. I won&#x27;t know, I won&#x27;t be back.')
