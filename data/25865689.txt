But its not Amazon’s fault.<p>Exactly this.<p>Or more accurately, Elastic is pretending it doesn&#x27;t have an open-source compatible business model.<p>The actual truth is, they&#x27;ve built a great business. $500MM in yearly revenue, with 40+% y&#x2F;y growth, for a valuation of like $15B last time I checked. And yet they&#x27;re trying to pretend this is a David vs Goliath story and that they&#x27;re literally going to go out of business because of Amazon. Nope, it&#x27;s all gaslighting. <i>They don&#x27;t need to make this license change</i>, without it they&#x27;ll still be a $50B business in a decade or less.<p>They&#x27;re just having an immature childish response because, while they&#x27;re making boatloads of money, Amazon is <i>also</i> making boatloads of money, and that&#x27;s not fair in their eyes because Amazon didn&#x27;t invent Elasticsearch. It&#x27;s all so childish (and ignores the tremendous value AWS as a whole is, but that&#x27;s another rant)')
