Society went through a period of disruption and experimentation and came out on the other side with new institutions and cultural norms.<p>The same is happening here. That suggests what&#x27;s considered acceptable for pamphleteers and public speakers may not be acceptable on an auto-curating micro-targeting real-time nonlocal platform like Facebook.<p>There was a balance between free speech and the common interest and it&#x27;s been disrupted.
