The redundancy isn&#x27;t an issue with nuclear, it&#x27;s an issue of the notion that we need nuclear and renewables. Just cut out the renewables, and only use nuclear. Using nuclear to fill in the duck curve makes renewables redundant, thus the aversion to nuclear of many proponents of renewables.<p>If storage does become cheap and available, then renewables could be cheaper depending on the price of land and capacity factor of the energy sources. But that&#x27;s a question of if. We have nowhere near the amount of storage required and no solid plan for reaching the required scale. So it&#x27;s a matter of burning fossil fuels until we&#x27;re able to build out orders of magnitude more energy storage.')
