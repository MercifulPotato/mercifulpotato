I have a 3TB pro account which I have setup on my studio computer with full sync to an external drive. I record&#x2F;work on sessions with sync continually active. Both of those things should be &quot;no no&quot;&#x27;s, but it works fine.<p>I go home and my laptop is smart syncing the recently active sessions only which conserves space on the laptop drive but lets me do some small work on recently active sessions.<p>It&#x27;s totally seamless and I cannot recall the last time I was even alerted by Dropbox about anything except that I was hitting my 3TB cap soon.<p>The only issue I ever had was using it on Windows where it would occasionally create conflicted file copies, which was annoying, but moving to OSX resolved that.')
