You could use it to pay for pizzas, there were online casinos, even some businesses selling actual hosting accepted it as a matter of course. Right now, it&#x27;s this weird speculative asset that lots of people are interested in trading on, because it&#x27;s a well-traded asset, but there seems to be zero interest in any of the fundamental principles of decentralization or divergence from fiat. Even longstanding businesses accepting it as a currency have stopped. It&#x27;s closer to digital beanie babies than any sort of serious currency.')
