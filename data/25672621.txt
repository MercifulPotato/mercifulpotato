That is the job of law enforcement. Look up the Posse Comitatus Act.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to be said about the evils of the military industrial complex, but you&#x27;re making that point in the worst possible way. Complaining that your tax dollars are being wasted because the military is too lazy to perform duties that they are <i>explicitly not allowed to perform for very good reasons</i> does not bring anything to light.<p>&gt; An actual alternative narrative is that the executive branch willfully did not defend the capital.<p>It isn&#x27;t a matter of narrative, it is a simple fact that the executive branch chose not to authorize an exception to Posse Comitatus in this case, which is what the National Guard does and requires specific authorization each and every time. Without that authorization, the military has no more authority in D.C. than the NYPD does. It&#x27;s quite simply outside of their jurisdiction.')
