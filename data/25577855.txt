Each society is somewhere on the spectrum of socialist and capitalist, borrowing different quantities of ideas from both.<p>For instance, America has a socialized postal system, socialized school system, socialized highway network, socialized fire departments, socialized police, and a socialized army.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make it socialism, but it doesn&#x27;t make it 100% capitalist either. The question being asked here is more one of redistricting the divisions between the socialized and the private sectors of America.')
