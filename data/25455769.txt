The opportunity for side channels is profound, the abstraction is leaky, and the amount of engineering effort is non-trivial.<p>About 5 years ago we decided to take a path less-traveled with regard to applications development and deployment. We decided that our application is humble enough to run entirely on 1 powerful server. Sqlite is more than enough for our persistence needs. We don&#x27;t need a huge orchestration of machines to get the job done. Instead, we decided to use self-contained deployments of .NET Core applications with all required dependencies embedded. This means we can email a zip file to a customer, they can extract it to any fresh windows&#x2F;Linux vm, and then our code bootstraps the entire show.<p>All of our dependencies (the ones we are legally accountable for) are easily tracked in this approach. Introspection of msbuild dependencies is far easier than understanding the full extent of a docker image&#x27;s vendor scope.')
