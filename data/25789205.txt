The reason why exchanges like Binance and Bybit have their inflows from Tether... is because (as the author explains) they only take Tether!<p>Why do they only take Tether?

A LOT of people in the crypto community don&#x27;t like to pay taxes, and we&#x27;ve known this from day one.<p>Many crypto enthusiasts also boycott &quot;regulated&quot; exchanges like Coinbase, because they shut down accounts if you use it to gamble on a sportsbook, or whatever their surveillance doesn&#x27;t like.<p>So it should not be a surprise that many people in the crypto community, me being one of them, actually prefer to use Tether and Tether exchanges.')
