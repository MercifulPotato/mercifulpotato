Certainly it&#x27;s not the understanding that I grew up with, but I had the good fortune to have a history teacher who liked JS Mill.<p>I see open debate as part of a healthy society. I value the ability to hear perspectives other than my own. That&#x27;s what &quot;freedom of speech&quot; means to me, not the narrow, American legal definition.<p>&gt; The hypocrisy on this topic by right wingers is pretty crazy when you think about it.<p>I fully agree, and I&#x27;m not interested in emulating their hypocrisy.')
