A nuclear powered ION engine can achieve a much higher exhaust  velocity and replace that giant pusher plate with useful propellant.<p>It’s one of those designs that trades something considered largely meaningless, total engine weight, for something considered far more important exhaust velocity.  This always ends up being a far worse trade off than simple models suggest.<p>PS: It could have very high acceleration before running out of fuel, but if the trip is going to take decades either way that’s not very important.')
