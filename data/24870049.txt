I have far less issues with other forms of inheritance. Sure I&#x27;m occasionally jealous of the opportunities or skills others learnt from a young age but overall I&#x27;m just glad there are more talented, thoughtful, considerate people out there. The only part that ticks me off is arrogant people who claim to have gotten far only on their own backs and who refuse to acknowledge any good fortune (what you could call non-financial inheritance) on their part. Admittedly that pisses me off more because I used to do it a lot myself.')
