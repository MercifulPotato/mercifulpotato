People were so afraid of persecution that they used only eye contact to exchange feelings, or so I read.

Well, it&#x27;s worth remembering that it was ordinary people who voluntarily snitched each other during those horrible times, believing that they were on moral high ground. Or just ask Chinese: who beat professors and school principals to death? Who thought that business owners deserved to starve to death? Who thought eating flesh of person was righteous because that person was born in a middle-class family?<p>It looks many Chinese have learned their lessons from their own painful history, yet Americans didn&#x27;t even care about history at all.')
