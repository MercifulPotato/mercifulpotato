Most books, TV shows, movies, etc that do anything with technology above the most basic level usually get at least one thing incredibly wrong. It&#x27;s not necessarily a deal-breaker though - almost all stories are written to present and advance an interesting plotline, and almost all of them gloss over various inconvenient realities for the sake of a better story. Consumers can usually suspend their disbelief and accept the story for its own sake.<p>Problems only really come in when ignorant people read too many stories and start to think that how they present things is actually real. And some people who know a particular area very well may find whatever the story does too patently absurd to suspend disbelief.')
