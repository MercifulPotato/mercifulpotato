I just tried visiting the local timeline of a different instance, as recommended, and I have to say it was a much more engaging experience than I had had before on my account&#x27;s instance.<p>Is there any chance for a federated interaction to effectively replace the local timeline? It&#x27;d be cool to be able to jump into a &quot;community timeline&quot; without that being tied to your account&#x27;s &quot;instance&quot; (ie. using one account for multiple interests).<p>Thanks for the tip!')
