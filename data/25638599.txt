I don&#x27;t know what economists were smoking when they thought the entire blue collar workforce would be retrained into better jobs, but that&#x27;s the theory they kept forwarding.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard that this has helped America by keeping inflation low.  What they mean when they say &quot;inflation&quot; is almost always &quot;wage inflation&quot;.  You can see the mindset in the Covid relief debates- God Forbid we give people more money than the slave wages they get from corporations- they might not work!  Corporations might have to pay more in wages!')
