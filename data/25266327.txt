It&#x27;s been a while since I studied, but the phrase &quot;deadweight loss&quot; looms large in what I remember of the one economics class I took in college. So I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the program is actually a net negative for job creation.<p>Only that doesn&#x27;t matter, either, because the point is not to create more jobs; the point is to influence job creation in a way that benefits the people who hold the purse strings. If the cost of doing so outweighs the benefits, that&#x27;s inconsequential. Those costs are so widely dispersed as to be invisible, immeasurable, and difficult to discuss except on theoretical grounds. They&#x27;ll never be as compelling as a staged photograph of a senator in a suit and a hard hat, sticking a shovel in the ground.')
