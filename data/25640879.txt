I&#x27;ve had people try and bullshit -- not really on purpose -- but asking specific questions weeds them out easily.  Often times they don&#x27;t even know they&#x27;re failing the questions.<p>I have a less-technical manager come in on my meetings and by the end he could spot those people who failed without any knowledge of programming at all.<p>&gt; Of course there are some edge cases where a great developer would fail a leetcode-style interview, but those exceptions are very rare and only seem to affirm the rule.<p>I did all this binary tree stuff in University decades ago -- I only have so much brain space and studying all this <i>again</i> is going to push out the interesting stuff I&#x27;m working on right now.')
