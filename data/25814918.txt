Where I&#x27;m from, triple glaze windows were made mandatory 30 years ago, every single existing apartment building was forced to retro-fit. Yet when I moved to the US less than ten years ago, apartment ads would regularly highlight &quot;DOUBLE GLAZING&quot; as if that was some incredibly expensive and luxurious feature.<p>Also where I&#x27;m from, I used to own an apartment in a building from the 1940s. But a bit more than ten years ago, new strict energy efficiency requirements went into effect, so my building - and every building like it in the country - had to fix it, often by adding a thick layer of insulation on the outside.<p>I still own an apartment there, it&#x27;s newer, but the outside walls are 30cm thick and made of concrete for insulation purposes. And yet, here in the US, I regularly see new housing construction that&#x27;s essentially just plywood for every single wall, inside and outside.<p>The US is incredibly behind when it comes to insulation and energy efficiency, because the economics of it doesn&#x27;t make sense. If energy were to become much more expensive, this would change pretty damn fast.')
