It&#x27;s weird finally encountering someone who is describing it in the exact same terms.<p>We do experience it in relation to our dishwasher sometimes, but I don&#x27;t think the dishwasher is an essential component: it happens with handwashed dishes too. The essential factor, as far as we&#x27;ve been able to determine, is wet dishes which get in contact with outdoor air. However it only happens on some days and more often in some months&#x2F;seasons!<p>My theory so far has been that it&#x27;s a reaction between some molecule in air (something which varies in concentration over a period of days, perhaps a pollutant) and water. But it may as well be that it is interacting with detergent residue.<p>The interesting thing is that we don&#x27;t actually manually measure detergent for our dishwasher but use detergent tablets, so the quantity never varies.')
