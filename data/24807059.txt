Item(by='matthewdgreen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602902514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24806788, text='&gt; They may do it while being completely ignorant of the movement, but still being a rationalist for all intents and purposes.<p>If you consider “rationalism” (in the sense of the subject of this thread) to be equivalent to “following a scientific or rational thought process”, then the main question asked in the article becomes nonsensical. “Where are all the successful people who followed rational thought processes?” is a genuinely foolish question, because you can find countless notable examples with no effort at all.<p>But of course that’s not what the post was asking, and it’s why the poster has a harder time answering the question. The post refers to the very specific Internet phenomenon of “rationalism” which, while cleverly incorporating the notion of rational thought into its name, actually refers to a specific group of people who follow a specific set of teachings.<p>And those people are massively concentrated in US tech and tech-adjacent areas, largely because that’s where this specific set of beliefs took off first. That’s the causal arrow here.')
