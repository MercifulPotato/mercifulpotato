I mean, I don&#x27;t know what the actual assurances are, but if there is any chance that you may lose access to your domain (for causes other than forgetting to pay to renew, ofc), even temporarily, that would be the same as being banned from Google.\nOr even worse, because having your Google account locked means you can&#x27;t use it but noone can use it either; however, if somebody now has your domain, they could be able to impersonate you.')
