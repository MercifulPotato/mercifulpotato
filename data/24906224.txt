The baby&#x27;s weight is fixed at mass * gravity, it doesn&#x27;t change.  What changes is the force required to accelerate the baby upwards, which is the delta between the force of gravity (the baby&#x27;s weight) and any  upward forces opposing that gravity.  So if the baby pushes upward with it&#x27;s feet to help you, you have to exert less force to lift the baby.<p>Scientifically speaking, the weight of an object cannot change unless gravity changes or it&#x27;s mass changes.  The forces required to accelerate that object in a particular direction vary wildly based on all kinds of things that exert a force on the object.<p>Off topic, but that does make me curious how &quot;weight&quot; works in an environment where you&#x27;re exposed to more than one gravitational field.  Like if you&#x27;re close enough to two black holes to be affected by the gravity from both.')
