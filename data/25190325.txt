The article revolves around testimony from firms that WeWork beat.<p>Also, even if we assume WeWork is an aberration, &quot;beat&quot; here is on a long timescale, after all. There are by now plenty of tech companies that have been around more than a decade having never made a profit. At some point you have to accept that the market dumping these firms are engaging in, does in fact lead to less well capitalised firms being unable to compete.')
