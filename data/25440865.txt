Some people have asked here why people prefer tiling window managers. I don&#x27;t â€” I&#x27;d much rather be able to position windows as I want them on the screen. But for some inexplicable reason the world has decided that computers can&#x27;t be tasked with REMEMBERING where our windows were. This is particularly egregious on Linux, where every time you open an app (or the app opens a window), the first thing you have to do is resize the window.<p>Given this failure (I still have no idea why we think our computers can&#x27;t handle remembering where windows should be), it&#x27;s better to have a tiling window manager, because at least one doesn&#x27;t have to hunt for the window borders (which, in another failure of common sense, are becoming thinner and smaller every year) and resize the windows.')
