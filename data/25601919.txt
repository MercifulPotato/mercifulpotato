The skill most people use formal spaced-repetition methods for is factual recall, to be sure, but the underlying principles can be applied to any human endeavour.  My Anki deck, for example, is designed to exercise reading comprehension.  For cooking, I don&#x27;t try to memorize recipes like the article demonstrates; I do, however, try to revisit and make the dishes in my repertoire semi-regularly to reinforce the operational cues that are impossible to put into words.  It&#x27;s similar for all of my other hobbies: I naturally tend to have a period of intense engagement with them at first that trails off as my confidence builds.  I seem to revisit most of them on the same sort of exponential schedule without really trying, as if my subconscious understands when it&#x27;s time to have a refresher.')
