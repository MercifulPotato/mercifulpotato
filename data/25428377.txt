I use a MacBook for personal use and a Windows laptop for work.<p>For many things, they both work well in general (Windows is better for &quot;document stuff&quot; and file management, Mac a little better in window management etc., but comparable in general).<p>But when it comes to media stuff (think: cropping a lossless audio file and compressing the result into an AAC or MP3, resizing 20 images, transcoding a movie from one format to the other, removing one page from a PDF), on Mac it can usually be done with built in tools. On Windows you often need either a prohibitively expensive software suite or go on an ad infested crapware hunt resulting in a borderline unusable tool.')
