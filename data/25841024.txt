And the Christchurch shootings. And 9&#x2F;11.<p>&gt; The storming of the capitol was not at all similar.<p>Interesting. What makes 9&#x2F;11 a terror attack that doesn&#x27;t similarly make the Capitol Insurrection one? Because they both left a similar imprint on the people, and they were both implemented by groups with extremist ideologies and political objectives in mind.<p>I note that you tossed the reference to the definition of terrorism and focused on grief counseling. Interesting decision.')
