Zig&#x27;s std lib already has io_uring helpers based on liburing&#x27;s design, which we contributed.<p>We would have gone with C for its ABI, OOM-safety and control over memory layout, but considered Zig ready enough given our own medium term timeline, and the developer velocity and safety is already paying off. We also wanted a fantastic compiler, which Zig already provides. I personally wouldn&#x27;t go back to C for a new project like this.')
