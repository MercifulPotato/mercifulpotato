Statically typed programming languages try to implement features of dynamically typed programming languages, whereas dynamically typed programming languages try to implement features of statically typed programming languages. On one side, we have a struggle of languages like C++ attempting to relax their own rigidness to achieve dynamic behavior, and on the other, we have languages like Javascript and Lisp attempting to constraint their own dynamic nature for benefits that come from static typing.')
