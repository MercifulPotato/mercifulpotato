Drugs are simple to pinpoint, because they act fast and big. (Plus it&#x27;s not like alcohol is illegal, yet it kills a lot of people, and the prohibition failed.)<p>Reading books changes people, just look at how many people credit &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; as the book that started their journey to become libertarian.

QAnon changes people. The antivax hysteria changes people.<p>Psychedelic drugs change people, yet the opioid and crack epidemics were not about LSD, they are about an alcohol++.
