Around the time of enterprise, then going on to the reboot and new series i&#x27;d lost interest in star trek.<p>The series changed in ways I didn&#x27;t enjoy. Not to bash on them in any way and getting to my point.<p>I&#x27;ve been recommended The Orville a bunch lately. After hearing what it was, I wasn&#x27;t really interested, but finally i was pushed into watching it and I was immediately hooked and finished the first two seasons in a couple days.<p>This is the reason why:<p>&gt;Lately I played a game, Ex-Zodiac, which is a StarFox clone. Only the demo is available, but the author really captured every single aspect that made StarFox great. That attention to detail is what makes games fun.<p>You can tell the people that made the Orville loved the hell out of the earlier star trek series and put a lot of care into small details that really made it feel like star trek, moreso than most newer actual star treks. Despite being somewhat of a comedic parody, like you say, they &#x27;really captured every single aspect&#x27; that made star trek great.')
