I don&#x27;t have detailed plans describing how to bring about global peace by disrupting multinational corporations. Mostly because I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s actually going to bring about global peace. I just wish people would chill out about McDonald&#x27;s because it is kind of a monster. McDonald&#x27;s specifically. If you want to generalize that to all meat companies, that&#x27;s your choice. What really matters is what you value. What do you care about? What are your goals? How are you gonna do that? Don&#x27;t get distracted trying to build up McDonald&#x27;s because it&#x27;s already &quot;successful&quot;. There&#x27;s really nothing you can do for it.')
