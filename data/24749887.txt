However:<p>&gt; And the performance of your CDN is probably worse than the Google CDN<p>What means probably? Other CDNs (Akamai, CloudFront, Cloudflare, etc) are also fast.<p>And by pushing one piece of your website on a different CDN you force your users browser to create an additional HTTPS connection which takes additional round-trips, instead of being able to leverage one connection for all assets. This alone might as well outweigh the performance differences between CDNs.<p>Also the &quot;shared cache&quot; benefit might go away, if I read the other answers in this topic correctly.')
