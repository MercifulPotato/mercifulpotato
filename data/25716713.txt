Maybe you do.  But the comment I was replying to was quoting a statement made by Trump at his rally, implying that it is evidence that he incited violence.  It simply does not demonstrate that.  It is not evidence of incitement.  It just isn&#x27;t.<p>If you believe X because of evidence Y, it does not follow that Z must also be evidence of X, just because you believe X (even if this belief is correct).<p>Not having the critical self-awareness to recognize this is likely to lead you to believe all sort of things that aren&#x27;t really true, as you start thinking that everything you see confirms your existing beliefs, even when it doesn&#x27;t.')
