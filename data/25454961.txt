In the original movie he sometimes spoke in what has been dubbed &quot;Yoda speak&quot;, e.g. &quot;Speak backwards, I do&quot; but I didn&#x27;t get the sense that it was the form for the majority of his dialogue. Then it felt like it became a meme and, by the time that the prequels came around, this was the main way that he spoke, to the detriment of his overall character.<p>Thanks for the magic of internet some amazing person has done the numbers on this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buydemocracy.wordpress.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;yoda-speak-orig-trig-vs-prequels&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buydemocracy.wordpress.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;yoda-speak-ori...</a><p>TLDR; Empire: 22% Yoda Speak. Jedi: 33% Yoda Speak. Phantom Menace: 74% Yoda Speak. He seems to have become very much a caricature of himself during his pop culture hiatus between the movies.<p>Many thanks for posting this and giving me a name for this phenomenon :).')
