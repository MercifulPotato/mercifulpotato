This isn’t a study of the tolerable upper limit of Vitamin D intake. It’s a case report of a single individual who was taking astronomical doses of Vitamin D with disastrous consequences.<p>It’s certainly possible to take too much vitamin D without coming anywhere near the silly doses this person was consuming.<p>Anyone taking aggressive vitamin D doses should invest in a vitamin D test after 6-12 months. If you find your serum results approaching the upper end of the reference range, reduce intake slightly. There are no known benefits to excessive vitamin D serum levels, but there are documented health downsides.<p>If you find yourself reading pop-science articles with unbridled enthusiasm for megadosing vitamins, you’re probably not reading scientifically accurate health advice. Supplementing with moderate doses is fine, but megadosing anything is almost always flimsy pseudoscience.')
