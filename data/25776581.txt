Soon investors and CEOs will realize that ML is effective in narrow ways and that not everything needs ML.<p>They will also realize that 1 ML team + ML as a service (Azure ML, Sagemaker, Google AI platform) is cheaper and works more reliably. The services will keep improving and an underpaid mediocre ML-Engineering team can work to keep the production system up and running.<p>Basically, ML teams might lose jobs just as DB&#x2F;Cluster admins did with the advent of serverless compute as service.<p>I expect it to (already happening) create a day trading company like hierarchy. The Fair&#x2F;Brain&#x2F;OpenAIs will pay 7 figures to the top grads to be first to market. BigN ML product teams will expand and stay as well paid as they are. Then there will be a huge drop as we move to offshore ML product teams that are viewed as cost centers by the remainder of 99% companies. These will be most of the jobs available.<p>In such a system, a pure ML scientist (usually a PhD) will only exist at the top companies. So if you are not in the top 1-3% percentile, you will not have a pure ML job. However, there will still be hybrid DS-SDE jobs (ML engineering, ML product maintenance, ML-as-a-service user) or hybrid DS-PM jobs (Analysts, Consultants, data driven business decision makers). So, anyone who is not in that top 1-3% will have to pivot to one of these 3 roles.<p>______________<p>I won&#x27;t call this an AI winter. But, it will definitely become boring majority of those employed in the field..')
