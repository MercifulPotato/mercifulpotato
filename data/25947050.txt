People keep saying that all the short positions are held by hedge funds, but in reality there&#x27;s a lot of individual investors that have short positions too.<p>The risk to a company that processes trades is that many of these retail investors accounts would turn negative and the company that processes the trades would take giant losses they did not plan for.
