Item(by='theon144', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606515624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25230512, text='Yes, of course it is a tooling issue.<p>I apologize in advance for my jadedness, but I see this sort of comment every time someone mentions the possibility that information organization tools could be better: &quot;This is all very nice, but this other tool I&#x27;ve tried was kind of bad, and didn&#x27;t really solve the world, so I think that actually everything sucks, and we should just (learn how to) deal with it.&quot;<p>Besides, I really don&#x27;t see how this is relevant here, as it doesn&#x27;t even seem to apply to most of the article&#x27;s content - for instance, how would &quot;organization&quot; help with the fact that e-books&#x2F;PDFs are woefully uninteractive and retain print-based limitations? Sure, I could manually collect all the illustrations, their backreferences, and look up every paragraph&#x27;s mentions online, but isn&#x27;t that kind of what computers are good at? Same with the book recommendation &#x2F; sharing system.<p>And as for the &quot;queue manager&quot; and the &quot;memex&quot;, this was exactly the author&#x27;s point, it is a call for tools for organization! No amount of self-organization will help with the scatteredness of digital information, that&#x27;s just its nature - we communicate in different modes, using different media, on different platforms, for different purposes. Sure, you can and try to limit the amount of services one uses: only use Twitter instead of other social networks, only use e-mail instead of IMs and Slack, only watch videos on YouTube... or file every little bit of potentially interesting info into a unified personal database - but I think it&#x27;s obvious how both approaches are untenable.<p>Regimented approaches only work in their own, specific contexts - for a multi-modal multi-medial landscape, one needs tools that operate with these principles in mind, and so far one can only wish they existed.')
