I am pretty sure someone attempting to log in many times to my account was the reason Twitter switched to phone verification due to &quot;suspicious activity&quot;. It happened after I had a seemingly calm debate over some IT stuff. So now I have to verify via phone to log in to my account, which I will not do. I can, however, create a new account that uses e-mail verification, until it switches to phone-only again. Terrible.<p>Oh, and I just made a new account today. It already started bothering me: &quot;We&#x27;ve temporarily limited some of your account features&quot;. Come on. This time it is about &quot;Pass a Google reCAPTCHA challenge&quot;. Next time it will be phone verification. I will not bother with Twitter if it happens.')
