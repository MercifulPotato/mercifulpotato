I have not looked at youtube ads for a while, but earlier it was definitely advertising &quot;host your videos free, let your friends watch them free from anywhere in the world, yada yada&quot;.<p>If one advertises &quot;absolutely free email hosting&quot; but means &quot;we will read your email, analyze your behavior and sell your information to those who can effectively hound you with ads&quot;, people should push back. And &quot;it isn&#x27;t free to run&quot; is not a valid defense.<p>&gt; They could lock the entire site behind a paywall to paid subscribers only tomorrow<p>Sure they can. But that would likely drive most customers away and be a very bad business decision. My 2c.')
