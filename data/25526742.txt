However, that was in 2016 and - for good reasons - she did not start on it herself until 2018.<p>In that time, maybe the googlers put a lot of effort into it, involved a lot of other people and as OP had not kicked it off sooner, maybe assumed (wrongly) she had no further interest in progressing it.')
