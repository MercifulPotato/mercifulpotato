From history we have a partial map of our ignorance. We know from past experience that there are realms of unknown - ecological effects, decomposition products, birth defects, health impacts - associated with new products. We know there is a very big difference between safe and no known adverse impacts<p>Rather than an alternative to science, we need a more vigorous meta model, better appreciation of where the model ends, and a better model for how we should act given our ignorance. I don&#x27;t think we lack the ability to do this, it&#x27;s a matter of will and power.')
