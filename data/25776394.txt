So by mentioning my own (he&#x2F;him), I&#x27;m enabling a non-cis person to share theirs without them feeling odd about it, which boosts inclusivity.<p>That&#x27;s the intent. I haven&#x27;t done it yet (I probably should), but while I don&#x27;t see <i>neutrality</i> towards stating pronouns in the following manner, I do see <i>resistance</i> from people around stating pronouns as being potentially motivated by bias. Inclusiveness boosts work output from everyone, and assuming peoples&#x27; pronouns is a rapid way to alienate a measurable population of workers to a degree that could impact their success.<p>Of the three east coast firms I&#x27;ve worked in the last six years, I&#x27;ve seen it recommended at two. I&#x27;ve seen it dissuaded at zero.<p>Edit: made the change on HN. I did it on Twitter some time ago apparently. It&#x27;s also interesting watching the points swing on this. I suspect it&#x27;s equivalent to corona masking in a way: common usage of pronouns reduces exposure to hatred by non-cis folk much the way usage of masks reduces exposure to covid-19 and complications by vulnerable folk.')
