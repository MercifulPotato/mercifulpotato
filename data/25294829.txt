Lets be real here, if there is enough reform to put H1-B and American workers on &quot;level playing field&quot; in terms of not being abused, American companies are going to look for American workers first (or people who are already on H1-Bs, and can now switch jobs more easily). This is simply because the American worker has the advantage of not having to go through the application process, and of being able to start working right away; the company won&#x27;t have to wait <i>months</i> to bring the employee on board.')
