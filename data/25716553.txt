Moving everyone to one platform won&#x27;t limit the spread of violent hate speech, or limit organized sub-groups from co-ordinating violent activity.<p>From a platform perspective, there isn&#x27;t much difference between companies curtailing the use of their platforms to carry out violent activity and those platforms curtailing other illegal activities such as spamming or malware distribution.<p>We don&#x27;t consider sending 1 million unsolicited emails free speech, and wouldn&#x27;t consider a gang using reddit to co-ordinate free speech.  Is there any difference for groups coordinating the violent overthrow of an elected democracy?')
