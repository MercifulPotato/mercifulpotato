The concern is it could lead to the belief of static memory.  Memory is impermanent and easy to change; you&#x27;re not suck with it.  So much so, there is a police interrogation technique that does just this to get innocent people thrown in prison.  (I&#x27;m not kidding.)<p>How it works is they show a bunch of faces, one with the person they want to be found guilty to the victim.   The victim says no to all of them or, &quot;I don&#x27;t know..&quot; and then later the police come in with a new lineup of photos.  All of the photos are different expect the person they want to be found guilty.  Usually a second time is enough.  The victim will recognize the person shown twice and announce, &quot;It&#x27;s them.  They did it!&quot; If not, they&#x27;ll keep doing this until that is the eventual consequence.  It usually only takes a few times.<p>One particular interesting study on stripping out memories (or muscle memory if you prefer) is how MDMA therapy works on PTSD.  PTSD is a condition similar to anxiety, but different, in which they may have reoccurring nightmares of a horrific event, or if something reminds them of that event irl they may have a traumatic flashback.  Clearly their old memories are causing them great distress.  So how does this therapy work?  Well, MDMA has a side effect of not being able to feel fight or flight on it, and it turns out our memory is read once, write many.  This means the second we remember something, it gets erased from our long term memory.  Our mind recalls the memory (processes it) and while processing it, it writes a new memory back to long term memory with its contents.  On MDMA the fight or flight in the memories can not be processed, so what gets written back is a memory without the trauma attached to it.<p>Read once, write many has numerous side effects.  For example, the very act of recalling a memory over and over again changes it.  You can do this experiment on yourself by writing down a story, then recalling it in your memory by saying it out loud like you&#x27;re telling someone that story.  Each time you say it the memory will be modified.  Keep going and after around 10 times some details should be obviously wrong.  You can then compare this version to the old one to see yourself.  It&#x27;s a solo version of telephone game.<p>So you can alter your memories, you may be able to even find a way to strip the depression out when being hit over the face (Which you can.), but wait there&#x27;s more.<p>How one responds to the present moment is a habit.  Every response you will ever give is a habit, even to a new and unexpected situation.  It&#x27;s pretty entertaining to observe the variation of habits people have between cultures.  In the US if something unexpected happens like on a hidden game show Americans might be like, &quot;Whaaaaatt??&quot; or might punch someone who startles them, or just in general Americans are very reactive.  In the UK when something unexpected happens on a hidden game show they tend to freeze.  Sometimes they look around, but they usually pause and wait.  It&#x27;s quite a different response.<p>Once we realize our responses to the present moment are habits, it&#x27;s as simple (and as difficult) as changing those habits to new habits that are better suited.  This can be as extreme as teaching someone with borderline personality disorder how to not freak out and start yelling when they fall in love with someone, to something more subtle like in your situation not responding with being depressed when life gives you a shitty day.<p>To change ones habits, they have to be aware of the causality.  That is they have to see the present moment before their response and then have a planned alternative response.  You always have to have an alternative response, as purely cutting out a habit is difficult, but replacing a habit is much easier.  Once the cause (the present moment event) is caught before the response happens, a new habit can be put in.  It is nearly instantaneous and a massive amount of mindfulness is needed.  One way to cultivate this level of mindfulness is by meditating, which has the side effect of increasing mindfulness.  This teaching of how to change ones habits to not have negative responses is a key ingredient to removing dukkah or psychological stress, but it is commonly translated to the word suffering.  This is a Buddhist teaching (not the religion) which modern day psychology has picked up on.  Enlightenment in Buddhism is the end of dukkah, so the end of all negative psychological responses to things.  As you can see I can and am giving you a deep dive into this technique anyone can do with a bit of practice showing it&#x27;s quite real.  Enlightenment does not have to be mysterious.  It can be grounded in science.')
