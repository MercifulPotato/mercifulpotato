They think about their hip pockets, themselves, and raising kids on a budget.<p>Renewables are cheaper!<p>Save money heating and cooling your house with solar energy!<p>Drive an electric car and save money on fuel and services!<p>Those are the messages IPCC should be putting out.  Everybody loves a bargain.  The promise of renewables, once we get over the develop and build cost humps, is infinite bargains.  Sell that vista.  It&#x27;s easier than selling science.')
