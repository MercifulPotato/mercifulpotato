Both released this year, both with much hype. No disappointment on both.<p>But regarding Cyberpunk, we should be fair. Witcher 3 wasn&#x27;t the beloved Wircher 3 from today at release either. It had also problems and took it&#x27;s time to ripe. People forget it.<p>Similar think happend at No Mans Sky. Released to early, and still grew in a fantastic game after all the shitstorms. Some games just need longer to satisfy the hype.')
