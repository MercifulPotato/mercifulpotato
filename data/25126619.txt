In kneejerk response to the invasion of privacy from world governments we&#x27;re handing absolute control of the web back to those very governments.<p>Everyone being forced to get permission from a centralized cert authority that is easily influenced, pressured, etc in order to host a visitable website is the end of the web as we know it. This is a slide into a total loss of autonomy.<p>I give it about 3 years before all commercial browsers stop allowing you to visit HTTP sites at all and Firefox only allows if you use their unstable beta build.<p>At that point you won&#x27;t be able to host a visitable website without getting permission from someone else. And that&#x27;s the end of the personal web.')
