My side project, an inspiration-based film recommendation engine, has a niche audience but is of little interest to the general public (or HN) or those that only watch Netflix+Disney&#x2F;Marvel. My traffic comes from arts magazines, twitter and things like apartmenttherapy.com. So you have to seek out communities that may be particularly interested, then maybe the traffic will follow.<p>Then it&#x27;s also just luck in getting noticed. I got a significant amount of traffic this fall from the Recomendo newsletter which led to someone reposting it on Reddit with a couple of thousand upvotes.')
