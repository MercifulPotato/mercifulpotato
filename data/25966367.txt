So the broker must instead pull from their own cash reserves until the trade settles 2 days later, even if the customer has deposited enough money to cover the trade.<p>I think what Robinhood is trying to avoid saying is that they simply didn&#x27;t have enough money to cover that collateral. Hence why they have tapped into credit lines and have done an emergency funding round. If they had allowed GME to trade the past two days, it seems likely that they would have run out of money and instantly gone out of business.')
