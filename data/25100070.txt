That&#x27;s why you often seen the rule of thumb for home theaters &quot;eye height = middle (or even lower third) of TV&quot;.<p>Incidentally - that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve rearranged my own viewing arrangement recently (raised the TV for ~20cm to make room for a well-positioned center speaker), and while being skeptical myself in the beginning, it has worked out great.<p>But yeah, TV over the fireplace is still terrible. :)')
