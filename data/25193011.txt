It contained a genuine 2623 movement, and as best I could tell the hands were the original. Other parts, such as the glass were cheap fake pieces.\nIt was definitely a very unique piece that people always inquired about. Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t so durable and didn&#x27;t last very long before the glass began falling off, and subsequently other components became damaged and dirty. I intend to get another eventually, if I can find a good place to get a high quality one. I&#x27;m not even too worried about getting a Frankenwatch, my only concern is the durability.')
