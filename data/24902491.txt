If it&#x27;s mild and they&#x27;re otherwise a great employee probably just ignore it.  If it&#x27;s large drop in performance that is having a material impact on the team, document the performance impact, take any steps necessary to mitigate the impact of the drop in performance and ask if there is anything you can do to help them improve their performance.')
