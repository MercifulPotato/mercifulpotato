I homeschooled my two gifted-learning disabled sons for years, which means I effectively ran a two student school under the laws of California for years. I also spent some years homeless in part due to my own disability.<p>Before I was diagnosed with a serious disability in my thirties, I was routinely dismissed by people around me as merely &quot;lazy&quot; (while being sick all the time and one of the top students of my graduating high school class).<p>Lots of people who claim their animal is a &quot;service animal&quot; are people whose lives are in the toilet, the system doesn&#x27;t work for them and they have serious issues. Inability to prove need is not actually evidence of lying.<p>I have a dog phobia and don&#x27;t like being around them. I am all for finding some means to make sure people keep their animals under control in public. I have had lots of negative experiences with assholes who will not control their dog and who feel I am obligated to meet their dog&#x27;s emotional needs and all this kind of crappy thing.<p>Plenty of people being dismissed as &quot;merely abusing the system&quot; have a real need and &quot;abusing the system&quot; is their only means to try to meet it in a world that is routinely hostile to their needs.<p>It&#x27;s really complicated. Trying to sort out a better policy is not simple at all.')
