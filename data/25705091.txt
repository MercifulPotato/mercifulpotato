Those are probably the least interesting parts of any discussion around what a &quot;next gen&quot; blog platform might look like.<p>Where the author is correct about next-gen blogging (in my opinion anyway) is in the attempt to reduce the friction to publishing a new post. What tech stack you use, whether it&#x27;s static, what your HTML looks like, are all entirely secondary to whether or not you actually use your blog to build a corpus of content that shows off your opinions, expertise, and insights over time. That&#x27;s what a blog is. It isn&#x27;t HTML tags and CSS. It&#x27;s the content within the tags. For me any next-gen blog tech has to make 3 things trivially easy -<p>- it needs to be simple to set up and maintain. If my laptop dies and I can&#x27;t just clone my blog&#x27;s repo and run a couple of commands to get back to where I was it won&#x27;t work.<p>- it needs to be <i>really</i> simple to publish a post. Most blogs use Markdown with either front matter or a specific file path. That&#x27;s OK but it puts most of the cognitive load on me. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a better way but I don&#x27;t know what it is. I use 11ty for my blog which is very good, and if I didn&#x27;t worry about URLs as much as I do it would be could actually work. But I do.<p>- there&#x27;s nothing that pushes me to write more. This is the kicker, and no one has ever solved it. I think a blog platform that recommends posts I should write, and that praises me for writing, would drive me to actually write far more than I do. So far the only blog platform I&#x27;ve seen come close is Hashnode, but even that doesn&#x27;t do it very well.')
