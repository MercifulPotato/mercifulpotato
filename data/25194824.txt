Clearly I don&#x27;t advocate high taxes that would leave room for the black market to undercut the price. I&#x27;ve had this exact argument so many times...<p>BTW, I&#x27;m not misleading you in the other thread. I know no one wants to believe that their own government could do that, but unfortunately they did. It&#x27;s an &quot;open secret&quot;, something like NSA spying was circa 2005.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bandar_bin_Sultan_Al_Saud" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bandar_bin_Sultan_Al_Saud</a><p><i>Bandar helped negotiate the 1985 Al Yamamah deal, a series of massive arms sales by the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia worth GB£40 billion, including the sale of more than 100 warplanes. After the deal was signed, British arms manufacturer British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) allegedly funnelled secret payments of at least GB£1 billion into two Saudi embassy accounts in Washington, in yearly instalments of up to GB£120 million over at least 10 years. He allegedly took money for personal use out of the accounts, as the purpose of one of the accounts was to pay the operating expenses of his private Airbus A340. According to investigators, there was &quot;no distinction between the accounts of the embassy, or official government accounts [...], and the accounts of the royal family.&quot; The payments were discovered during a Serious Fraud Office investigation, which was stopped in December 2006 by attorney general Lord Goldsmith.[68][69] In 2009, he hired Louis Freeh as his legal representative for the Al-Yamamah arms scandal.[70]</i><p><i>A court affidavit filed on 3 February 2015 claims that Zacarias Moussaoui was a courier between Osama bin Laden and Turki bin Faisal Al Saud in the late 1990s, and that Turki introduced Moussaoui to Bandar.[72] Zacarias Moussaoui stated on oath and wrote to Judge George B. Daniels that Saudi royal family members, including Prince Bandar, donated to Al-Qaeda and helped finance the 11 September attacks. The Saudi government continues to deny any involvement in the 9&#x2F;11 plot, and claims there is no evidence to support Moussaoui&#x27;s allegations in spite of numerous previous intense investigations, noting that Moussaoui&#x27;s own lawyers presented evidence of his mental incompetence during his trial. Leaked information from the redacted portion of the 9&#x2F;11 Commission Report states that two of the 9&#x2F;11 hijackers received $US130,000 in payment from Bandar&#x27;s bank account.</i>')
