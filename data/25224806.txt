So bar minimum you need to be familiar with these syscalls, which are a little obscures, but luckily only a hand full are necessary.<p>Next, youll need to understand process management in the kernel, standard pipes, and job control.<p>The actual emulator code has to keep a mapping of terminal control characters to terminal features, and keep this working across OS&#x27;s if portability is a goal. Here in lies the devil in the details. This emulation layer is tribal knowledge.<p>Finally you have to also be a good UI dev, who knows how to inter-op ASCII and UTF8 shell escaping.<p>This isnt touching on colors, GPU acceleration, and other pluses.')
