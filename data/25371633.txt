I&#x27;m not the only one - Carmack expressed the same (although, to be fair, I&#x27;ve never read other high-profile devs discussing this idea).<p>This is a real-world Linux game production story: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;bgolus&#x2F;status&#x2F;1080213166116597760" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;bgolus&#x2F;status&#x2F;1080213166116597760</a>. Note that the developers tried hard to release the native Linux port.<p>Crucial excerpt (from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;bgolus&#x2F;status&#x2F;1080214424474906624" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;bgolus&#x2F;status&#x2F;1080214424474906624</a>):<p>&gt; We eventually laid out a guide with known good versions of Linux and graphics drivers, but it didn&#x27;t matter. Part of the allure of Linux is the customizability, so few actually stuck to it, and generally wanted to run the game on older hardware we didn&#x27;t support.<p>In order for Linux games production to be economically viable, there should be a Linux gaming standard, but because of the Linux culture, there will never be (there&#x27;s nothing wrong; it&#x27;s just its nature). Even if somebody came up with a gaming standard... xkcd explains what would happen: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.explainxkcd.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;927:_Standards" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.explainxkcd.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;927:_Standards</a>.<p>I&#x27;m not considering adhoc Linux gaming distributions like SteamOS, as they would have to be treated as an independently installed, separate, operating system.')
