Waste of time. There are so many people on there that just seem to be outright trolling, posting outright non-sense, and doing other stuff that is just an outright nuisance. It significantly reduces the user experience.<p>Since HN mainly has startup-minded people on here, I think this actually opens up opportunities for new startups to enter the social media space. There is definitely a large audience who is looking for a more &quot;professional&quot; version of twitter so to speak. Start by blocking anonymous accounts&#x2F;aliases since this is what every troll hides behind.')
