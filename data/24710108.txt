So he joined after they started reddit, making him not a cofounder, and he abdicated his responsibilities after joining and being told by PG to give him a cofounder title, which they weren’t in a great position to decline. It’s hard to set the record straight here without denigrating someone, so they were always in an awkward position when this came up.<p>I don’t know anyone involved, but that’s the impression I got after seeing this topic beat to death on HN and reddit over the last 10ish years.<p>I doubt they cared at all that he was charged years after he left.')
