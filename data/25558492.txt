Item(by='emteycz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609156095, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25558345, text='&gt; &gt; All the New England colonies required towns to set up schools, and many did so. In 1642 the Massachusetts Bay Colony made &quot;proper&quot; education compulsory<p>That didn&#x27;t mean compulsory daily school attendance. It worked differently at the time - mostly religious figures were teaching children every Saturday. Maria Theresa was the first to set up compulsory daily school attendance.<p>&gt; &gt; In fact, the “Prussian model” superseded an education system that actually did look like a factory. The monitorial system and its variants the Lancaster, the Bell, and the Madras systems, involved schools that were housed in large warehouses – larger often than many of the nascent factories at the time – with hundreds of students in one massive classroom with one teacher. Students were grouped (30 or so together) not by age but by reading proficiency, with more advanced students – “monitors” – assigned to tutor and train the others.<p>Yes, and this Prussian model is exactly what education looks like in Europe today. Might be different in the USA, I am European so I don&#x27;t know. That the previous model was even worse doesn&#x27;t change anything about our today&#x27;s comparison to factories. Factories changed too.<p>&gt; adding also that &quot;the major innovation of the Prussian model was in levying a tax to fund compulsory schooling, not in establishing a method for instruction&quot;.<p>If the schools and literature here in former Austria-Hungary and Prussia are to be trusted, this is wrong. The Prussians did this and a lot more to improve their military, and the Austrian-Hungarians did it for the same reason as the Prussians were beginning to outcompete them.<p>&gt; I also don&#x27;t know what &quot;exactly like they do today&quot;, given that my experience in the US school system during the 1970s and 1980s seems rather different than what I read about during, say, the Depression era or the late 1800s.<p>Lucky you.')
