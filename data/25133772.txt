Item(by='leobakerhytch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605680780, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25133375, text='I realized in the last year or two that I was never really bad with names, I just didn’t give myself the chance to be good with them. For someone I’ve just met, it takes a little effort to use their name at least once or twice <i>soon</i> after I learn it, and it’s much more likely to stick.<p>I’m also much stricter with going through the slight awkwardness if I didn’t catch the name first time (even asking to spell it out to be 100% sure). Then afterwards, I’ll write down the name in Notes  with something memorable about the person, and where I met them. 99% of the time, I never look at this again. Just like that, name remembered.<p>Then, I’ll manage not to use a person’s name next time I see them, even when I know it. Oops.')
