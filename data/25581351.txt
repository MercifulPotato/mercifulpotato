You don&#x27;t even need discipline, what you need is an overall culture that it&#x27;s &quot;good&quot; to be in shape, &quot;bad&quot; to eat crappy food (basically the opposite of the US), and people will naturally and almost unconsciously pay attention to the food they it all their life, starting by taking good habits when they are young.<p>Of course if your first thoughts are to look for &quot;explanations&quot; and &quot;excuses&quot; (which btw are the most bullshit I have ever seen on that subject, you could have at least talked at least about stress as an actual obesity factor in people&#x27;s life) you will never get there..')
