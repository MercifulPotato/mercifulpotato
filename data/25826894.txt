I dislike my PhD more or less since I started. I initially took the position because I thought it would allow me more room to learning and get passionate. Additionally, due to the well-paying fellowship I thought it would be less stressful and with lower risk. Unfortunately, I am 1.5 years into it and I feel totally lost and far from finding meaning in my work which is something I crave since I started working.\nMy current savings would allow me to not have to work for 3-4 years. Do you think that this time is reasonably long enough for finding a more fulfilling work? Essentially I want to invest all my savings in finding a job that I like. How much time do you think you would need to find meaningful work?')
