It&#x27;s a git repo, &quot;who knows what&quot; can be easily checked with a quick git diff ORIG_HEAD after a pull. And you actually see the changes you&#x27;re going to be building, rather than relying on some random untrusted thirdparty repo or AUR package, that can be abandoned at any time, or worse.<p>The update checking workflow can be as simple as putting the repo commit or tag list, or news feed into your RSS reader, and just do a quick check if update is warranted when you get some update in your feed. Many projects have an announce mailing list that you can subscribe to. There are special announce lists for security issues.<p>And in case of cgit, if you&#x27;re running a tagged release, how do you know that git 2.25.1 (some random release from a year ago) doesn&#x27;t have any security vulnerabilities when used with cgit? Building from git and basing cgit on top of 2.30.0 seems a bit more reasonable to me in this case.')
