There&#x27;s a reason why Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM are all lining up to grab a piece of the pie.<p>Yes there are economies of scale which means overall the cost should be lower, but once you factor in profit margins, I&#x27;m not sure.<p>The main benefit is definitely not requiring as much technical acumen or teams to build your infrastructure, but as more skilled workers enter the labour force, I think that too will start to get marginalised to some degree and teams will shift back to having their own IT departments. Just a guess.<p>I personally hate the cloud, way too expensive for me and the design choices they do are geared towards profit maximisation and not building a partnership with customers where both win. E.g. so many different modules, each with limited functionality...when I can just run my own virtual server and do everything myself much better')
