You are choosing to dehumanize those who disagree with you, because that&#x27;s more comfortable than acknowledging that they might have a legitimate grievance somewhere beneath all the ruckus around the election results.<p>What now?  I pretty explicitly humanized them, and even shifted the blame a way from them.  Personally, I think a lot of them are being shamelessly used and exploited.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s logical to conclude that there will be blowback from a coordinated campaign to shut down the largest platform favored by &quot;the other side&quot;.<p>Not really.  The largest platform favored by &quot;the other side&quot; (which I&#x27;m assuming is conservatives&#x2F;Republicans) was and is Facebook.<p>Parler was only favored by a much smaller, radicalized subset of conservatives, mainly those who wanted to spread false claims of election fraud (because, IIRC, it only got popular in response to Twitter putting warning labels on such claims, which offended this radicalize subset).  I&#x27;m totally fine with any blowback from such people, since their cause of championing lies needs to be utterly defeated, for the good of the country.')
