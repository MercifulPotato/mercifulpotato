It&#x27;s an SQL DB with an UI, alright, but the database is (or at least has a reputation of being) kind of flakey, and the UI exposes you to all the complexity and inflexibility of relational databases. This creates two types of hurdle. One is educational - you have to teach people basics of relational data modelling if you want Access to make sense for them. The other is operational - you can&#x27;t shuffle data or table structure around in Access like you could in Excel. You can&#x27;t just copy pieces of table around, you can&#x27;t make rows depend on rows before them, etc.<p>Worth remembering is that Excel is, fundamentally, a 2D functional reactive programming REPL. Most of its users don&#x27;t understand that, but they internalize the behavior. They may not know what a DAG is, but they know that updating cells will recalculate cells that depended on them. So you can&#x27;t replace Excel with <i>just</i> a database - because half of the utility of the program is in formulas.<p>There is a gap - a tool is missing that would offer the flexibility, the ergonomics, and FRP capabilities of Excel, while also providing tools for ensuring data consistency and relational queries, <i>and</i> at the same time also making them easy for users to wield. It&#x27;s a tall order.')
