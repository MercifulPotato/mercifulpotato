My car&#x27;s data should be available to me and me alone, full stop. If I choose to share it with my mechanic or the manufacturer, that&#x27;s my business. The manufacturer shouldn&#x27;t have any access without an explicit opt-in from me, and refusing to opt-in should not affect the sale. I should also be able to control what data they can see if I choose to share it. The manufacturer has a legitimate concern about certain operational parameters if I&#x27;m asking them to perform a repair under warranty (did I redline the engine?), but they have absolutely no legitimate use, ever, for location data.')
