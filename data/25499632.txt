I&#x27;m criticizing your generalization from books that are mainly about one context (the legacy of the enslavement of Black people) to a different context (American skepticism of foreign food). I disagree with your basic premise that the two things arise from the same &quot;phenomenon&quot;--generalized &quot;racism.&quot;')
