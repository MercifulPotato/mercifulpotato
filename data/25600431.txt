In a post-truth world, this results in over-investment in poorly ran companies that have good investor PR, but aren&#x27;t actually solid businesses, compared to their peers.<p>This results in an unoptimal distribution of resources, except for the people who took a long position, and then cashed out at the top.<p>Nothing stops a company from creating value just because people are shorting its stock. Musk&#x27;s complaints about shorters aren&#x27;t because shorters are bad for Tesla- it&#x27;s because they are bad for <i>him</i>, as he dips heavily into debt (backed by the value of TSLA shares), to finance his lifestyle.')
