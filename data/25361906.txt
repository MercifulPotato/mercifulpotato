I&#x27;ve replaced most music listening with audiobook &#x2F; podcast &#x2F; text-to-speech article listening. And I pretty much always have bud-type earphones around my neck so I can plug them in when I go to do some 5 minute chore. I&#x27;m not necessarily getting through 70 books a year, but I suspect I&#x27;m in the top one percent or so for magazine article consumption.<p>This does mean you&#x27;re not, say, having a lot of quiet time for your thoughts. I don&#x27;t necessarily miss this, but I&#x27;m sure others will.')
