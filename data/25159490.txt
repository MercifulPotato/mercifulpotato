Designers have a hand in this too. Example: on many sites (Twitter, Imgur, etc.), it is not possible to simply zoom in an image without jumping to a lot of hoops. You hover the mouse over the image, the pointer becomes a magnifying glass, you click and...<p>The image blows up to fill to the screen until it his a overly large and useless border that some daft designer thought looked cute. There is no way to zoom in any further, that is blocked. So zooming to see a part if the image in full detail is out of the question. What&#x27;s worse, if you have a small screen, likely to be the reason that you wanted to zoom in the first place, the zoomed image is actually smaller than the original. Great!<p>So, I&#x27;ve wasted my data plan to download a large high resolution image and a bunch of javascript libraries that make sure I don&#x27;t get to enjoy that resolution. I can&#x27;t remember for sure, but I bet that his already worked fine in Mosaic in 1994. Not anymore. And why? What benefit does this bring? Other than that it looked nice on the designers computer, I mean.')
