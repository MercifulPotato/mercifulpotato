It&#x27;s not quite as configurable as your version, but if folks are interested they can find out more at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alexellis&#x2F;derek&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;USER_GUIDE.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alexellis&#x2F;derek&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;USER_GUIDE.md</a><p>There are automated actions when people delete the issue&#x2F;PR template, and when they don&#x27;t sign off commits for the DCO. This saves me a lot of time personally having to go and comment and explain every time. I&#x27;m going to take a closer look at your bot going forward. Thanks for sharing it.')
