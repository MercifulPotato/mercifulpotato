I grew up there, and have lived in a couple larger cities throughout the midwest. The weather is absolutely terrible and if I lost my remote tech job I&#x27;d be SOL until I could find another one. It is harder to find other parents&#x2F;families&#x2F;friends with things in common with, as well.<p>Another thing people don&#x27;t talk about is the crime. Here in Seattle we have a lot of crime but not a lot of violence. In larger midwestern cities there are huge poor black neighborhoods, even entire parts of cities encompassing many neighborhoods, where the violence and suffering is incredible. Years ago, I used to live on Troost Ave in Kansas City, for example. Troost itself can be dangerous but is mostly fine- go a half a mile east and drive around and it is almost unrecognizable as America as someone who grew up white and did not have to see it. Bullets <i>literally</i> went through the window of the library my wife worked at.<p>I think either leaving or wanting to leave or big cities or job hubs&#x2F;writing articles about leaving big cities or job hubs is something that is &quot;in vogue&quot; right now.<p>Probably a symptom of expensive housing and a pandemic that forced everyone to go remote. People, for some reason, love to dog on big cities&#x2F;west coast but these coastal cities have undeniable positives to living in them; Weather, nature&#x2F;mountains&#x2F;ocean&#x2F;public lands, interesting work, high pay, cultural stuff, etc- all things I want my child to grow up with even if it is expensive.')
