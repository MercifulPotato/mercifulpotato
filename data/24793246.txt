I pay to not be the product.<p>The reason I do not pay for YouTube is that despite paying, I&#x27;m still the product - Google is still collecting every bit of data about me, to spam me on their other channels. Instead, I use YouTube (and every other Google product) logged-out, deleting cookies often[0]. I can&#x27;t do that if I pay for YouTube.<p>[0] I used to reject cookies, but Google has become unusable that way -- everything goes back to defaults which are exceptionally bad for me.')
