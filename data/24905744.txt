If the proportion infected in the treatment vs control is too high (i.e. lots of vaccinated ppl got sick) they will stop the trial and consider the vaccine a failure. If too few get it, they might stop the trial and immediately move to a Phase III study to confirm their result - that is they accelerate the trial to get the treatment out quicker.<p>I am unsure if they will have some lower bound for acceleration for this vaccine, since the downsides might not be apparent for a long time.')
