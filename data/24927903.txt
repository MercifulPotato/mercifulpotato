Next time you need to buy a can of paint, you&#x27;ll go back to Lowe&#x27;s because you figure there&#x27;s a 99% chance they won&#x27;t mess it up again, and meanwhile the Home Depot is even further away and not really any better.  Meanwhile, companies that provide &quot;good&quot; customer service are continuously preyed upon by customers who waste their time and scam them.  Personally, if I were you, I&#x27;d just take the L on this one.  Someday, someone will solve this problem by opening a business that offers absolutely no returns, no customer services, and charges 10% less.  I will shop there gladly.')
