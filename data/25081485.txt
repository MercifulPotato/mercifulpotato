It gives companies market power because users cannot easily switch to a better alternative without losing their entire digital collection.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.defectivebydesign.org&#x2F;faq#copyright" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.defectivebydesign.org&#x2F;faq#copyright</a><p>&gt; DRM is not about limiting copyright infringement. Such an argument attempts to make DRM appear beneficial to authors and is based entirely on a (very successfully advertised) misrepresentation of DRM&#x27;s purpose. To illustrate the absurdity of the argument, consider the nature of file sharing: to obtain a copy of a file without permission, downloaders go to a friend or a file sharing network, not a DRM-encumbered distribution platform. If DRM existed only to prevent unauthorized sharing, every distribution method for that particular piece of media would have to be distributed by an uncrackable DRM-encumbered distribution platform, which is impossible on its own. So long as one copy becomes available without DRM, countless more are easily produced. Industry proponents of DRM are well aware that DRM is not a copyright enforcement mechanism. DRM is only marketed as a copyright enforcement mechanism to mislead authors into tolerating and even defending it.')
