Item(by='gcblkjaidfj', descendants=None, kids=[25906597, 25906380], score=None, time=1611597065, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25906125, text='The original comment is likely a troll, but the current goverment did place a bunch of amateur hacks on the highest positions of power, which led to things like the minister of culture asserting to the public that woman belongs in the kitchen, or that the minister of education asserting in public that the humanities like sociology and history must disappear from the face of earth, and the ministry of environment saying in a leaked video of a presidential meeting that thanks to covid they now had the distraction they needed to kill indians and give the land to soy farmers.<p>So, even if trollish comment, it is not too removed from truth. I can see how incompetence, cost cuts, corruption and favoritism (he did place all his sons in a trump-like fashion in his cabinet) might have led to this. Not to mention relaxing of oversight and the rule of law which allowed for even more departments (and the private companies working for those) to hold and share this information without concerns.<p>The previous government (removed illegitimacy in a coup) did place emphasis on digital security. Brazil have safe electronic voting for decades and Brazilians receive a java application by the gov to do their taxes since the 90s. The current gov was elected on the basis of &quot;we will undo everything the last &lt;&lt;corrupt&gt;&gt; government did&quot;')
