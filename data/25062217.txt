In particular I would really like to:<p>- Pay for the service (sustainable&#x2F;trustworthy business model)<p>- Be able to very tightly control access to albums as I really don&#x27;t want kid photos ending up on facebook or similar due to crazy aunt kathy (in google photos anyone with access can add anyone else and until recently there was no way to remove people)<p>- Ability to require a full&#x2F;proper login for guests (no hard-to-guess urls as security)<p>- Confirmed and well-tested backup as a feature (sha1 of the backup matches my local, original copy, no stripping of the geo data!)<p>- Decent ios and android clients that can auto backup all photos on the device')
