(I believe) there is no feedback though sensors or cameras or anything.<p>But the new trend is based on feedback, whether traditional control-theory feedback, or neural network based reinforcement-learning feedback, which I guess eases the rigors of pre-program design and makes the system more flexible in new situations. But of course it&#x27;s an open research topic, and involves every-increasing sophistication of sensors, high-def cameras, lidars, and what not.<p>Wondering how the choice of stepper&#x2F;servo, or some other mechanisms like hydraulics&#x2F;pneumatics relates to the above categorization.<p>Thanks in advance.')
