I have keratoconus in both eyes, and had two (donor) corneal transplants in the 1990s, in my teens.  Even with them, my sight is not great, as the distortions from the transplant scarring and residual keratoconus around the edges are only partially correctable with regular glasses lenses (I think these artificial corneas would not be better).  I had bad hayfever as a kid (and still do sometimes now) and rubbed my eyes a lot.  I now think it&#x27;s the most likely cause.<p>Don&#x27;t let your kids rub their eyes!')
