The problem was that the effect of outside (weather) temperature on the efficacy of the rubber seals in the fuel conduits wasn&#x27;t factored into the risk assessments.<p>After-the-fact analysis of the data from previous launches showed a clear relationship between the outside temperature during launch and the amount of fuel (or oxygen, don&#x27;t remember) leaked from the joints. But this relationship wasn&#x27;t known before launch, because (IIRC) nobody had done such a temperature-gradient analysis on the launch data before.')
