Several of them are <i>over four decades old</i> at this point.<p>Use of the prefix &quot;ge-&quot; in the singular (giving &quot;patro&quot; for father, &quot;patrino&quot; for mother, and &quot;gepatro&quot; for parent of unspecified gender) goes back to the 1980s.  This has <i>in the decades since even that</i> become mainstream enough that in the last 10 to 15 years &quot;gepatro&quot; is now in Esperanto dictionaries such as Wells&#x27;s 2010 dictionary.  Indeed, it made it into the <i>Plena Ilustrita Vortaro</i> by 2002.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vortaro.net#gepatro_kd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vortaro.net#gepatro_kd</a><p>The infix &quot;-iĉ-&quot; was another product of the 1970s&#x2F;1980s.  This gives &quot;patro&quot; for parent of unspecified gender, &quot;patriĉo&quot; for father, and &quot;patrino&quot; for mother.  It&#x27;s less mainstream than singular &quot;ge-&quot;, but it was popular enough that Jorge Camacho used it in 1991.  It&#x27;s a more logical and consistent system than singular &quot;ge-&quot;, but I suspect that resistance to it is partly rooted in the fact that the L1 languages of &quot;Esperantistoj&quot; do not in the majority have unmarked gender-neutrals and marked masculines for similar words.  The <i>claim</i> is that it reinterprets a large corpus of existing past Esperanto works, but a counter to that claim is that similar things are currently happening with words like &quot;actor&quot; in English without similar objections.<p>And, finally, Ido reformed this <i>all the way back in 1907</i>.  It went the marked masculine route (of Esperanto&#x27;s &quot;-iĉ-&quot;) with the infix &quot;-ul-&quot;.')
