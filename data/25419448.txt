These are all things that have happened, are happening, and are likely to continue happening.<p>GDP is not the issue, but a political and economic system which increases personal selfishness at the expense of others is. You can argue that collectivist solutions have the same problem, and to an extent you&#x27;ll be right. But it&#x27;s a long way from there to pretending that this is the best of all possible worlds, because there are economies which prove that isn&#x27;t true.')
