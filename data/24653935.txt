I&#x27;d guess for the average skilled person it probably takes a half dozen projects and lots of research before you start making pretty decent furniture, so keep that in mind!<p>On top of that, designing good looking furniture takes much more skill and time. Sometimes ya just don&#x27;t have the knack either.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s still super satisfying to make furniture, even if it gets cracks from expansion, has all kinds of weird defects, or doesn&#x27;t look all that great!')
