A good typist could type at about 60 words per minute. Such typing was always to either to copy a written text or to take dictation. I think it&#x27;s extraordinarily rare to find someone who could write down their thoughts at that rate, even if they&#x27;d thought out a text beforehand.<p>I only learned to type at about 20-30 words per minute, still faster than many now but slow the measure of typists, and that&#x27;s easily fast enough to keep up with my thoughts.')
