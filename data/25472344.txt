One of them post 1.04 patch, all happened while driving around town.<p>Was missing Judy&#x27;s dialog during the ripperdoc mission, other stuff is mostly just graphical glitches, nothing game breaking.<p>But as a fan of the &quot;stealth archer&quot; the stealth system is annoying, silenced weapons aren&#x27;t actually silenced. Any shot will alert EVERYONE and they&#x27;ll never calm down again, they&#x27;ll even mysteriously know the gender of my character even if they never saw a glimpse of me :D<p>This is especially jarring for the few missions which are supposed to be &quot;recon only&quot; or &quot;stealth only&quot;, where clearly getting noticed should be a mission failure. You sneak around for a long time and then you get noticed. No way to go back to stealth, so it&#x27;s just a long sigh and out comes the shotgun ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
