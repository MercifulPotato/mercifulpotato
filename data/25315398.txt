You know what your features represent, and the regression puts a straight-up co-efficient on each of them.<p>You can look at the weights you trained, see how strongly your input features contribute to the output prediction, and say things like &quot;if all else is equal, 25-49 males are 0.08 likely to click on this ad&quot;.<p>Deep nets aren&#x27;t explainable in that way, even if you devoted a lot of effort.  Maybe someone will come up with a novel method for doing it but as far as I know the best we can do is statistics about what the net&#x27;s likely to predict.')
