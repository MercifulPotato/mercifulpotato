Over time Google&#x27;s turned it into some limited bullshit account, and at this point I&#x27;d <i>pay</i> them just to turn all that shit off and turn me into a regular Google account -- or just close the damn thing down if I could transfer all the stuff I&#x27;ve purchased, which Google won&#x27;t allow me to do.<p>My fault for trusting Google, but the landscape was way different in 2006.')
