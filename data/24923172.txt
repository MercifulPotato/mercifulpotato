I may have a blindspot, but the languages that get enough buzz for me to notice are either not competing with Python in important dimensions (e.g. Rust) or have a narrower focus (e.g. Julia). Elixir maybe? JavaScript and its derivatives? But these lack the scientific programming ecosystem that&#x27;s helped drive Python recently.<p>I have no doubt that languages exist that might fit the bill of being both as easy as and more performant than Python -- there are a <i>lot</i> of languages out there. But I&#x27;m unaware of any whose mindshare has been sufficiently growing that it threatens Python in the mid-term.<p>If I&#x27;m off base please let me know. I&#x27;d love to find a viable competitor to Python that&#x27;s strictly better than it.')
