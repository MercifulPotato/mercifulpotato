If you start over and type in the books that it recommends for readers of the books that the dev obviously thinks are &quot;bad&quot;, it still recommends more of the books that the devs think are &quot;good&quot; instead of giving you the &quot;opposite&quot; of those.<p>I think it would be more effective for the devs to manually put together a recommended reading list of progressive literature and explain why they feel each book is worth investing time into. I would find that really helpful because even though I&#x27;m not part of their target demographic of extremely conservative people, I wouldn&#x27;t really know which progressive works of literature are considered essential reading.')
