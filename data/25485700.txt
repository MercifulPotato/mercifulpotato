That&#x27;s why they run that COVID Folding@Home stuff - to assess how well vaccine particles can bind to a virus thru variations - lone &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;non-hit&quot; don&#x27;t matter much.<p>That non-determinism alone is a great source of suffering, even before we get to &quot;embodiment&quot; and &quot;need to feed that embodiment&quot;. ;-)')
