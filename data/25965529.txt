Item(by='scythe', descendants=None, kids=[25965616], score=None, time=1611974989, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25964560, text='&gt;Equally likely in my mind is that Citadel bought Melvin&#x27;s book thinking that it had a better plan than unwinding the short just yet. Instead, &quot;hide&quot; the short someplace that Ortex isn&#x27;t looking and that the exchanges won&#x27;t report on for another 3 weeks. That would be their order flow with a company they are in a unique position with - Robinhood - where lots of the buy orders are coming from. If you were Citadel and a little unscrupulous, you could immediately route every sell order on RH to the market but keep the buy orders for yourself. This positions you as short to Robinhood users, and you get to send those sold shares back to the book you bought from Melvin to unwind that short. So, the short does still exist, but now it&#x27;s not visible to outside brokers. Outside brokers, when Ortex calls them up, will say, no no, Melvin covered a bunch today and short interest actually went down!<p>Is that legal? Manipulating report agencies to manipulate the value of a stock?<p>There are multiple Congressmembers interested in this situation. That could be a very dangerous game.')
