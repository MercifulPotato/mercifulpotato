Item(by='moron4hire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602597297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24765369, text='My senior year of CS classes may not have been applicable to &quot;daily programming&quot;, but are certainly applicable to &quot;monthly programming&quot;.<p>There are just jobs I never would have gotten or kept if I wasn&#x27;t able to solve complex problems, on my own, the few times they come up.<p>This is something that is so hard to get across to boot camp grads. They complain about how hard it is to get a job, how hard it is to progress at the jobs they do get, how hard it is to write  basic programs on their own, how hard it is to even figure out what is important to study. But then, if I suggest that constantly focusing on shallow, broad study of JavaScript-framework-du-jure might not be sustainable and that Computer Science might actually be relevant to software development, suddenly I&#x27;m the asshole for calling into question the teaching methods of the boot camp system.<p>For me, it&#x27;s also a quality of life issue. I just can&#x27;t imagine being satisfied with a career where I&#x27;m just a glue coder. I want to make new things. If I were working in the automotive industry, I wouldn&#x27;t want to be on the assembly line, I&#x27;d want to be in the engineering department. And most of the people I talk to want to make new things, too. They just don&#x27;t seem to want to hear that &quot;building something from the ground up&quot; requires &quot;understanding fundamentals&quot;.')
