It looks clean enough to my un-rusty eye, but it sacrifices functionality in favor of hiding the arithmetic behind a slice.<p>And __s&#x27;s comment does it best: use the standard library.  And that&#x27;s a nice implementation (despite the unsafe stuff), which tracks the basepoint and size to keep the arithmetic clean.')
