Item(by='milesvp', descendants=None, kids=[25238573], score=None, time=1606497829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229473, text='I’ve done a certain amount of research around GI due to my wife twice having gestational diabetes, and it was hard to find good numbers in general, but I couldn’t find any numbers related to artificial sweetners. I did find a lot of people claiming artificial sweetners didn’t cause a rise in glucose, which makes sense because the only way to get glucose would be for the liver to release glucose as a response. What I don’t know definitely is whether or not  artificial sweetners cause an insulin response (though there seems to he a growing body of evidence that some do cause the pancreas to produce insulin). There also seems to be a growing body of evidence that artificial sweeteners cause gut bacterial changes ( which, as I write this, makes me wonder if my current gastro intestinal drama might be related to a recent reintroduction of diet soda in my diet...).<p>I will say as an anecdote, that I find intermittent fasting (skipping breakfast and late lunch) much easier when I have diet soda than when I have tea with sugar in the morning.')
