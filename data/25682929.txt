Before USB 4, USB-C spec itself disallows hubs to passthrough an Alternate Mode and even Thunderbolt daisy chain also have to terminate at any point where USB is plugged in. In this case, I believe you can have Thunderbolt 3 hub that only carries Thunderbolt signal, but it will only work with Thunderbolt devices and not USB-C.')
