If they want some gap years, go for it.<p>I realized it long before graduating (and wanted it), but went to college that fall anyway. I didn&#x27;t like the school, and dropped out after 3 weeks. To say that it somehow condemned me would be enormously incorrect. I went to another college the next summer and graduated faster than I would have at the other place, and launched my career in 2009.')
