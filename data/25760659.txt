Aiming for the mass market rather than the low volume high margin workstation business. The world could have looked very different then, Linux might never have seen the light of day, and maybe even killing off Microsoft&#x27;s ambitions in the OS space beyond DOS and windows 3.x.<p>[1] Just picking on Sun because they had the Sun386I back in 1988 and the 386 port of SunOS to go with it.')
