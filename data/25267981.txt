That&#x27;s for almost 40 years of construction and 20 years of operation. So we&#x27;re talking 60 years of funding. Think about that, this is something that could revolutionize everything! Save the planet too. We&#x27;re spending 360 million per year or so on it. That&#x27;s absurd.<p>There are a few big science projects, and even they get very modest funding.<p>Let us put the F-35 into context. It will cost 1.7 trillion dollars for 55 years. That&#x27;s an insane amount of money, 30 billion per year. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stripes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us&#x2F;pentagon-reportedly-estimates-that-the-f-35-budget-plan-is-running-10-billion-short-through-2025-1.644700" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stripes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us&#x2F;pentagon-reportedly-estimate...</a><p>We fund science, which improves our lives and saves us from pandemics, at a pittance, and fund insane programs to bomb poor people at crazy levels.')
