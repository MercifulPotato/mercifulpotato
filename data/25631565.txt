In Lauri Love&#x27;s case, the magistrates&#x27; court allowed the extradition order but it was overturned on appeal in the High Court on the basis of Love&#x27;s not being able to cope in US custody with Asperger&#x27;s syndrome. In the Assange case, the magistrates&#x27; court followed this established and rather persuasive precedent.')
