Neither of those demographics has considered that their &#x27;you shouldn&#x27;t be driving, period&#x27; policy would cause a lot more damage than it would mitigate, when considered at a societal scale.<p>The fact that this kind of policy would do net negative damage is trivial to arrive at, and is exactly why no country has ever stopped people with this issue from driving even though the issue itself is well known. The &#x27;shouldn&#x27;t be driving&#x27; mindset is tunnel visioning and swatting a fly in your house with a nuclear missile.<p>The fact that anyone going against that viewpoint is getting downvoted makes it pretty clear that HN is trending towards reddit where downvotes have become an &#x27;I disagree&#x27; button. It&#x27;s been pretty sad watching this trend play out over the last couple of years.')
