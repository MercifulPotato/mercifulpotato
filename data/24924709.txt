You have to pay someone to do this, and since it&#x27;s more expensive to capture CO2 than not emitting it in the first place, someone has to pay <i>more money</i> than, say, reducing US fossil fuel usage by 10%, to achieve the same CO2 reduction.<p>We can&#x27;t even muster enough political willpower to shut down coal plants.  Imagine going to these same people and saying &quot;Good news, you can keep your coal plants, we will just tax you more than how much it would cost to shut them down!&quot;')
