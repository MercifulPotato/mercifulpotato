I think they should stick to the computer&#x2F;operating system of a car and either take a large stake in an existing automaker or license the technology to several of them.<p>Actually _making_ cars is doomed to be a failure. You need a massive workforce and very large factories. It is fairly low margin compared to even computer hardware let alone software.  Then they have to support these cars which means you need a massive service network. It really is a bad bad idea.<p>Making a car with the likes of Magna is just plain stupid. You canâ€™t get any sort of volume to make the car cheaper and get the OS into the hands of millions of drivers.<p>Here is what they should focus on:<p>1.) Sensor suite for self driving. \n2.) AI computer for self driving.\n3.) Main computer and screen(s) for navigation, car controls and games&#x2F;audio&#x2F;video apps.\n4.) Autonomous software.<p>Work directly with automakers from the ground up and design the vehicles jointly with them to ensure the systems feel native rather than bolted on.')
