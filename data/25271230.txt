I keep &quot;chasing the dragon&quot; when it comes to note taking apps&#x2F;approaches. I&#x27;ve played with everything from NvAlt+SimpleNote (for iOS), Evernote, Notion, Drafts, Editorial, Obsidian, and more. Most recently when I was experimenting with the Zettelkasten notes system (in Obsidian) I got the idea that I would want to do exactly what you talk about and have a &quot;note&quot; per person where I could store trivia, gift ideas, birthdates, etc.<p>Unfortunately I either don&#x27;t fully understand Zettelkasten or I am paralyzed by indecision on where I split my notes and how I organize them. I guess I&#x27;ll just continue using Drafts as my &quot;brain dump&quot;&#x2F;&quot;all text starts here&quot; until I can find something better that is lightweight and works across iOS&#x2F;macOS.')
