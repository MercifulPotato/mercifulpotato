The <i>gun control</i> measure was not rooted in racism.<p>The second is that the bill as a whole wasn&#x27;t &quot;rooted&quot; in racism. It certainly was a bad bill that had terrible consequences, and we should undue a lot of the damage it did, but the <i>intent</i> of the bill was, in part, to help the black community (and it had support from many people in the black community at the time). Horribly misguided in hindsight though.')
