Just assume a human lived to 500 years on average.<p>They would accumulate a lot of damage over that time (muscle tears, concussions, broken bones that don&#x27;t fuse properly, etc.). This would lead to a lot of people in your tribe needing help doing simple tasks. Which would cost your tribe energy.<p>Instead reproduction takes some more energy in the beginning (feeding and teaching), but there&#x27;s a break-even point where the offspring can provide for the next and previous generation more efficiently.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if people would be less stubborn and more flexible if they died later. Otherwise you&#x27;d have people asking you to get off their lawn for 430 out of their 500 year lifespan.')
