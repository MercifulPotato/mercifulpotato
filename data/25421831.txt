FPS games can teach you about your physical ability, practice and teamwork as much as playing football or playing in a band. The physical skills are different, sure, but the planning, teamwork and execution are all very similar (and similar to developing an app with a team). Any of these things could also, well, <i>not</i> teach you much of anything. But is that a function of the <i>game</i> or the <i>player</i>?<p>The article suggests maybe it&#x27;s a function of <i>genuinely liking what you&#x27;re doing</i> vs simply <i>wanting</i> to do it (maybe because of an addiction).<p><i>I.e. the real problem is the opportunity cost</i><p>The problem with viewing through the lens of the opportunity cost is that it requires some hindsight to be completely evaluated. I played competitive football for 8 years. I wanted to, but I never went pro. You can work hard, put in the effort and still have nothing good to show for it. Today, I feel like I could have better spent that time, because it ate up <i>a lot</i> of it.')
