Where would this military police force take its legitimacy from ? The only legitimacy there is is when people get together and agree to institute a force to police them. That means democracy. Since the UN is currently very far removed from the will of the individual citizen of the World, I think your proposal would require a deep change of governance of the UN to include more democratic processes.<p>2. This proposal assumes that there is a single set of values and rules that can be applied to everyone. I don&#x27;t think this is actually true. The world currently allows several value systems to exist simultaneously, which can all be valid. Your proposal would raise a single value system above all others. How do we chose which one ?<p>3. The further the government is removed from the citizens, the less it cares about their actual needs. Special measures would need to be taken to make sure that police force actually serves the interests of the people. I don&#x27;t think the current forms of democracy actually work in that case, when so many people and cultures are involved, you can&#x27;t be satisfied with a majority rule.')
