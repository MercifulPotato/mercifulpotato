It still makes me sad that it essentially has been abandoned (to the point that it almost certainly won&#x27;t expand beyond the current cities).<p>Eric Schmidt liked to say that more revenue is the solution to all problems at a company (give or take). I think Fiber is proof that that isn&#x27;t strictly true.<p>High capex projects like this demand fiscal discipline. They demand the ability to plan, cost and estimate how long things will take. Fiscal discipline just isn&#x27;t in Google&#x27;s DNA. This is unsurprising given how insanely profitable AdWords is.<p>I also describe something like running an ISP as a hyperlocal national business. Think of these issues:<p>- Can you string up lines on poles?<p>- If so, who owns the poles?<p>- How do you get permissions to string things up?<p>- How can competitors delay and hinder that process (believe me, they do)?<p>- Do you dig trenches?<p>- What&#x27;s the soil composition? I can tell you that digging trenches doesn&#x27;t work well when there&#x27;s a ton of small limestone rocks in the soil.<p>- Do you employ some form of micro&#x2F;nano-trenching?<p>- Etc<p>And all of these issues vary from region to region, city to city and even within a city. The entrenched players have become very good at navigating this process, impeding competitors and capturing regulators and legislators through exclusive agreements, lobbying, protective legislation and so forth.<p>How Congress, the DOJ and the FTC continues to completely ignore what a shit show broadband is in the US is beyond me.')
