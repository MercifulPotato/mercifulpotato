Of course it would be valuable to have them there. Google has lots of systems to keep track of what information you access thought, from when I was there. IE if you say want to look at PII like real user names for some debugging reason, you had to go through a portal that was along the lines of declaring: &quot;I need to access this internal system that has PII, here is my authenticated request with my name on it&quot;. And when I was there, they would follow up and ask me about it. This was on a database product.<p>On the other hand, there were multiple stories about the guy from Saudi Arabia who was at twitter and I think he got away back to S.A.')
