I forgot the season&#x2F;episode, but the basic plot is that a Media man who was urging supporters didn&#x27;t think that these supporters would get armed and confront the police&#x2F;FBI. It ended with one of these supporters killed and the man shocked as he clearly didn&#x27;t think it would go that far.<p>In my opinion, Trump is just doing that. I don&#x27;t think he would have expected armed men to join this. He was probably doing it to save face. It doesn&#x27;t help that democrats are making the situation worse by calling this a coup instead of taking a calmer sentence.<p>Here are the possible resolution scenarios:<p>- The men are disbanded. No one is hurt, maybe some charges against some of these men.<p>- One fatal shot on one side or both sides. Sad event, but then the men are disbanded and harsher charges against some of them.<p>The rest is drama.')
