There are different aspects in everything you can measure yourself by. You can be slightly more stupid than others (e.g. I don&#x27;t think I can score at a whiteboard interview, I never am the first one to solve a puzzle) but the fact you are actively aware of that, accept that (but don&#x27;t give up) and take that in conscious account already makes you superior to others in some very important aspects. Also, being above average doesn&#x27;t mean stopping improving, it means your can improve better and easier so you probably should.')
