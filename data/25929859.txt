I guess it&#x27;s not different to the equator on the surface of a sphere... so yes, a straight line &quot;encloses&quot; half of the plane &quot;inside&quot; it, so it has a hole.<p>Of course, my definition only works for the type of wholes that are cavities.  Defining other types of holes, as discussed in the article, requires more than elementary point-set topology.')
