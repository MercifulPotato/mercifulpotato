If the question is strictly &quot;would you rather do a biopsy on a cow or a consenting human&quot; I&#x27;d choose the human.<p>I&#x27;d think most people would agree on the rule &quot;don&#x27;t hurt a person unless you have a good reason&quot;. Vegans just extend that to &quot;don&#x27;t hurt an animal (the kingdom) unless you have a good reason&quot;. And to me, informed consent free from coercion is a good reason, but taste is not.')
