The first lockdown got cases down to very low levels (10s&#x2F;million&#x2F;day).  It turned around a sky-rocketing increase in cases - it&#x27;s not like the seasons changed between April and May.  The second lockdown in the UK was a tiered approach, and has managed the levels (at least up to 3 weeks ago) better than France, Belgium or Spain.  Not quite as good as Germany or Italy, and nowhere near the Scandinavian countries (excluding Sweden).<p>Are you really trying to tell me that the variation in COVID rates is only down to seasons?')
