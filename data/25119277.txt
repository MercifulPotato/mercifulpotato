Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25119339], score=None, time=1605575935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118865, text='The way I see it is that both theorems are statements about the relationship between a theory and models of that theory.<p>Goedel&#x27;s completeness theorem tells you that for a theory in first-order logic, there&#x27;s a model that corresponds exactly to that theory: anything that&#x27;s true in that model can be proven in the theory, and vice versa.<p>Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem tells you that there&#x27;s no such model for any system that includes the usual &quot;full&quot; version of arithmetic. A model is a very concrete thing, so any question you ask about the model has an answer - but you don&#x27;t necessarily know whether that answer is a fact about the theory (i.e. true in all models of the theory - which any statement that&#x27;s provable would be) or just a fact about that particular model.<p>It&#x27;s like if you write some C code, run it, and it prints 4. Does that mean your program always prints 4 according to the C standard? Or did your program do some undefined behaviour, and it just happened that with your particular compiler it printed 4?')
