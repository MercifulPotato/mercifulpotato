Using the language he started with (variables range over &#x27;numbers&#x27;, and the relations are &lt;, &gt;, +, and *), the reals and the rationals indeed have the same properties (elementary theory as logicians would put it). The reason things like \\sqrt2 present no problems is that it is simply impossible to define such &#x27;sequences of numbers&#x27; in this theory (you are only allowed to &#x27;refer&#x27; to numbers by your variables, not ordinary sets and the usual language for sets is missing).<p>If I remember right, the fact he was referring to was proved by Tarsky.')
