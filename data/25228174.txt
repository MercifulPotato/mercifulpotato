The lowering of working hours to 35h per week in France was also voted by a left-leaning government.<p>Healthcare systems in France and the UK were also setup by left-leaning governments.<p>Collective action may work within a single company but if your after general social measures then the action is to be taken at the polling station.<p>In France unions in private companies are very weak these days, and overall the protections and rights of employees are extensive so people no longer have strong needs for this, anyway.<p>The key point is that in a democratic country things happen if the majority wants it and votes accordingly.')
