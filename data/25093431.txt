The extreme right in my country goes up for the exact same reason and people who think they are so smart by hating trump are arrogant and unable to see it&#x27;s just tribalism from both side.<p>How can twitter think they have the right to hide some claims from one camp and not from the other when at the end of the day no one really has any fact at hand ?<p>I support the left ideas but they have no way to win if they dont have the regular people on their side or worse, despise them.')
