But after using this very expensive MBP, I am not happy at all. Hardware is the best in class while keyboard is the worst in the class. But my biggest complain is keyboard layout. It is not ergonomic at all. In windows&#x2F;linux, WINDOW key manages window manager while CTRL, ALT can be used to manage applications. On internet, many places it is mentinoed that, use apple COMMAND key as control key and OPTION key as alt key. Ok thats fine. But this behaviours is not consistent at all across app. Many apps use CTRL key to control application additional to COMMAND key(e.g. in chrome&#x2F;vscode, toggling tabs can be done using CTRL+TAB, not COMMAND+TAB). And this CTRL key is only one side of spacebar, very very unergonomic. Additionaly if you are a touch typer powered with mechanical keyboard, you can press CTRL key on windows layout using wrist. This is not possible on Mac as its first left key is FN.<p>After using MBP couple of weeks, my hand literally hurted like mentioned in video. I dont think I can operate MBP hours without looking at keyboard. In Windows you can do everything with mouse only. In Linux you can do everything with keyboard only. In mac, you need both and your hand hurts.')
