Amazon can easily fund developers, they just didn&#x27;t because they didn&#x27;t have to. Now that the gorilla has been enraged woe to the thing that pissed it off. We&#x27;ll see if amazon actually contributes to the new fork. The fact that amazon is in a better position to make money off of open source software is part of the calculation that startups should be making if they are writing open source software, especially if their moat is a proprietary shim that any of the big providers could rewrite in a month if they cared. Adding a rider to your open source that says &quot;oh, and only the original authors at this one company are allowed to implement those shims&quot; may play well with the HN crowd, but it isn&#x27;t open source anymore.<p>I will also note that is clearly not enough competition in the cloud provider space, if there were more competition then elastic might be able to make money from the platform providers by implementing ES for each platform as you suggest.')
