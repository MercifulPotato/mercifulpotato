What you&#x27;re seeing is just how unrestrained Capitalism works. Businesses respond to market pressures and implement features&#x2F;constraints based on what their customers want. In this case, Twitch has made a business decision that advertisers&#x2F;users want this stuff off of the platform; and honestly as a user, I do want that stuff off of the platform. I want to be able to read Twitch chat without being subjected to racism.<p>But that&#x27;s always been how Capitalism has worked. That&#x27;s why people get concerned about excessive privatization and mass corporate consolidation. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not a good idea to blindly privatize literally everything. Free speech won&#x27;t save you in an Anachro-Capitalist world, it wasn&#x27;t designed to save you from that world.<p>I know that there&#x27;s sometimes a perception that support for the 1st Amendment is a Conservative&#x2F;Libertarian vs Liberal issue, but the irony here is that it was far-Left candidates like Warren who were pushing hardest for companies like Amazon to be broken up. Those people recognize that Twitch censorship isn&#x27;t the problem, Amazon ownership of the entire streaming market is the problem.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to tell people how to vote or start an argument, but if you&#x27;re <i>actually</i> concerned about private tech dominance over public spaces like communication and social networking, antitrust law should be one of the top solutions that you&#x27;re looking into. A lot of the Republican solutions getting pushed through Congress right now are basically just the Fairness Doctrine v2. I don&#x27;t think those people have thought through the implications and consequences of directly attacking private platforms&#x27; freedom of association.<p>I see a lot of people who get 90% of the way to &quot;it&#x27;s bad for a single company to control the entire market&quot;, but that for some reason haven&#x27;t made the final jump to &quot;the problem is lax laws around monopolies.&quot; If you&#x27;re a Libertarian, donate money to Peertube, they&#x27;re working on adding streaming support right now. If you&#x27;re not a Libertarian, support sensible Democratic market regulations to make the market more competitive. And also consider donating money to Peertube anyway, just because it&#x27;s the most promising federated alternative out there right now.')
