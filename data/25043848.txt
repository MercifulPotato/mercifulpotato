If taste was not subjective there would hardly be the variety in meals we see all over the world.<p>And yes, if you go to extremes like rotten meat, there is of course little dispute. However, many cultures have developed certain dishes that they consider delicacies while outsiders would find them revolting.<p>But even from everyday experience, I&#x27;m sure even you will reassess your position if you think about it a bit more. Have you never had the experience that some food that you absolutely love and need others to try gets you little more than a shoulder shrug from someone else?<p>Taste even changes over time which is another intuitive reason why your claim makes little sense. Do you remember the first time you&#x27;ve tried coffee or beer (if you drink those)? Most people are not too fond of these flavors at first, yet they drinks are among the most consumed beverages, at least in Western societies.')
