Mine got better, but a long time ago a doctor told me to try restricting the outward airflow when you are exhaling. Surprisingly this helped me feel better. You do it by puckering your lips as you exhale instead of just opening your mouth. It&#x27;s unintuitive, but his explanation was that you increase the pressure in your lungs by creating some pressure in your mouth. No idea about any evidence behind it. Also your breathing problem might not be similar to an asthma attack.<p>I hope you get better soon.')
