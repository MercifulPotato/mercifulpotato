Firebugging the site and adding a rule for a:visited { color: purple } helps out when hunting for anything odd.<p>June 26, 1996 just 30 minutes past midnight - Lithuanian police spot a UFO &quot;near the Lithuanian border&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documents2.theblackvault.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;cia&#x2F;ufos&#x2F;C05516234.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documents2.theblackvault.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;cia&#x2F;ufos&#x2F;C055...</a><p>&quot;Patrol officers Jaunius Pozera and Laimis Kraujalis placed the whole Vilnius police on the alert. Vehicle loads of soldiers from the Aras Rapid reaction force, sniffer dogs and police reinforcements immediately arrived on the scene of the emergency.&quot;<p>&quot;At an altitude of 20-30 meters above the ground, they noticed a spherical object hanging and &#x27;Pulsing,&#x27; alternately shrinking and expanding.  At the same time, they heard what they described as &#x27;a strange sound like an electric or electronic crackle,&#x27; wanting to take a closer look at the UFO, the policemen moved toward it.  When they had advanced about 50 meters through the long grass, the police said, the sphere moved away, rose higher and rapidly departed in the direction of Vilnius.&quot;<p>&quot; ... it was noted that the tall grass around the place over which the sphere had &#x27;hung&#x27; was flattened to a radius of 10 meters.&#x27;<p>The geography of this FBI translation&#x2F;writeup from Moscow&#x27;s news agency is a bit bizarrely described, perhaps something definitely lost in translation, but it looks like it happened on the Lithuanian border with Belarus, some 10 miles away from the city.<p>&quot;Police commissioner Valentinas Juchnevicius said in a radio interview today that both officers who watched the shining object &#x27;are psychologically healthy, normal people, not noted for crankiness.&#x27;<p>Edit: this is fascinating. More of these I look at, more they look like a lazy search-and-dump of various US intelligence agencies&#x27; foreign media monitoring translations.  For example, a translated Bosnian op-ed came up mentioning UFOs because the columnist was sarcastically complaining about how Washington normally communicates with extraterrestrials but yet can&#x27;t find Karadzic (who&#x27;d been on the run for a time.)')
