I do like the brevity of it compared to the walls of text in the official rust one. Although this does give an illusion that Rust is very simple&#x2F;easy to learn but any beginner will find that anything more than &quot;Hello World&quot; or &quot;2 + 4&quot; is 10x more difficult than writing in a interpreted language. Not because Rust syntax is difficult but the constraints it introduce require more thought of the design of the program.<p>The article also skims over the single ownership model which is a big difference with Rust. And it does miss about creating macros, cells, threading &amp; mutexes, heap allocated types, unsafe code, Rc, std::mem, and the whole crates and cargo ecosystem. Which is why I think this should have been titled &quot;half-hour introduction to Rust syntax&quot;. Hopefully this does bring more people on the Rust train. I think 2021 will be a good year for Rust :)')
