Death is. Only a sheltered person is emotionally distraught because of this; and in turn, only a person who cannot handle this perspective would deem it logical to permanently damage society in order to reduce this number.<p>I am all for protecting older folks, even at great expense. We should have isolated every old folks&#x27; home and done everything possible to keep them COVID-free and well stocked with everything they need. These folks have served their time in society and deserve to be cared for with a higher standard than others. It&#x27;s highly unfortunate that the exact opposite thing happened; I hope that we learn a lesson from this.<p>However, when we&#x27;re talking about the non-elderly, it seems that the vast majority of people who are dying are simply in bad shape &#x2F; vitamin deficient &#x2F; etc. Sorry, I don&#x27;t see any reason I should care about their death any more than I would care about it if they died from heart disease, which is almost certainly going to get most of the people in that demographic eventually anyway, if they don&#x27;t get hit by a car first. It&#x27;s sad for their families, and for us it&#x27;s just a warning to get some sunshine and exercise ever so often, which is literally all it takes to put yourself in the group of people who have a massively high survival rate. In fact, we&#x27;ve all had a whole year with literally nothing else to do for amusement to have gotten in good shape during. At this point, anyone who is still ignoring that has made their choice.<p>It&#x27;s about putting things in perspective. 50-100k people die from the flu every year in America for the past decade and nobody cared before and nobody will care about that 10 years from now either unless it&#x27;s a really slow news day.<p>&gt; there really is no arguing with you<p>There&#x27;s plenty of arguing with me. Convince me why I should care about people who die of one disease when I already didn&#x27;t care about all the people dying of a different one. That&#x27;s fundamentally what this comes down to: blowing that level of care out of proportion while denying people the right to make their own decisions about what level of personal risk they are comfortable with.')
