Then as I was reading the article I saw the embedded tweet without any context and it was just so bizarre I had to see why on earth it was even featured. A search for “toothpaste” and, sure enough:<p>&gt; Telegram&#x27;s MTProto protocol isn&#x27;t obviously broken in a practical way, concedes Matt Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University who has consulted for Facebook on encrypted messaging systems. But it&#x27;s uniquely &quot;weird,&quot; he says, in a way that suggests its inventors don&#x27;t understand tried-and-true cryptography practices and raises his suspicions that it may yet have undiscovered vulnerabilities. &quot;It&#x27;s like if everyone else in the world has agreed that we&#x27;re going to use drywall to do the walls in a house, and then you&#x27;ve got somebody who&#x27;s using toothpaste,&quot; says Green. &quot;Even if the toothpaste works and makes a nice wall, that&#x27;s weird. How do you know they&#x27;re not doing other weird, nonstandard things when they put the electrical wiring into the house? And that&#x27;s what scares me.&quot;<p>I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt (maybe this guy is just terrible at analogies?) so I’m not sure I’d say facebook definitely seeded the article but this is just such a wacky, nonsensical thing for someone to say I don’t really know what on earth to make of it.')
