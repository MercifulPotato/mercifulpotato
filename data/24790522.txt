I&#x27;m just out of college, and for people my age and younger, there is such a desperate and helpless anger towards the people in power.<p>There is absolutely <i>nothing</i> concrete that I can do on a day-to-day basis to protect my world, my friends, my family from people that I watch lie, cheat, and steal on national television.
