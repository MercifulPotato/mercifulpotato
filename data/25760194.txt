Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=[25760239], score=None, time=1610532601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760156, text='&gt; basically stealing by using the item and then returning it<p>If the item is in a condition where it can be resold at full price (aka you can&#x27;t even tell whether it&#x27;s been used), does it matter? If anything, it reduces waste.<p>If it&#x27;s not in a resellable condition, then the store should discount the refund by a reasonable amount to make up for it. We don&#x27;t need yet more scummy entities like credit bureaus which you can&#x27;t opt out of.<p>I&#x27;m also not confident that improving the retailers&#x27; margins is going to trickle down to lower prices for consumers as opposed to go into some executive&#x27;s pocket or get pissed away in marketing&#x2F;advertising spend.')
