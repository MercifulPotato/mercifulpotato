For example, our business didn&#x27;t buy a printer&#x2F;copier - rather it is pay-per-use and ostensibly under perpetual warranty while we&#x27;re paying. If something breaks, a tech comes in and fixes it or replaces the unit. Coffee machines and commercial dishwashers are another example. All these can be leased and serviced for a monthly cost and typically don&#x27;t require any up-front capital. It&#x27;s very convenient but more expensive than an outright purchase.<p>This model works well for commercial enterprises, but it just isn&#x27;t worth for consumers. It&#x27;s like car leases - bad deal for consumers, but attractive due to flexibility for businesses.')
