Item(by='knolax', descendants=None, kids=[25908497], score=None, time=1611573225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25896643, text='&gt; Translation is not something to be avoided for the adult language learner. We should use every advantage at our disposal.<p>Because you&#x27;re relying on the translator to accurately convey the meaning of words to you, which translators rarely do. Most professional translators and language instructors don&#x27;t exactly have the best grasp of language themselves. They do some 1 to 1 translation of &quot;monkey&quot; and 猿 as if the connotation, denotation, and etymology are all the same when if you look it up, they&#x27;re only kinda similar but not exactly.<p>English Wikipedia:<p>&quot;Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals, in part, the simians of infraorder Simiiformes.&quot;<p>Japanese Wikipedia:<p>&quot;日本語におけるサル（猿）とは、通俗的な意味ではサル目（霊長目）のうち、ヒト（古人類を含む）を除いたもののことである。&quot;<p>Former talks about Simians whereas the latter apparently says (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong I don&#x27;t know much japanese) colloquially all non-human primates. Is the translator going to know whether an orangutan or gorilla qualifies as 猿? Probably not, they&#x27;re not even going to mention it.<p>Personally I believe people should learn a language well enough to read Wikipedia( or equivalent), and then continue only with media in the language in question from that point onwards.')
