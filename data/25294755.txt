Things like the electricity and water system are run federally (by FEWA - the Federal Water &amp; Electricity Authority) in 4 northern-most emirates. Many other benefit systems are also mostly funded by Abu Dhabi, and primarily for the benefit of the citizens of other emirates — one example might being the Sheikh Zayed Housing Programme. Abu Dhabi actually does help the nationals in <i>all</i> the emirates.')
