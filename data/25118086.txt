He said that a large % of his jobs for companies like GM or Ford was to grab a notepad and walk the floor. He would ask line employees why they did things the way they did and what they would change. He got reams of suggestions, typed them up, submitted them and collected a giant paycheck.<p>Sometimes they were blindingly obvious things. One employee would drive two bolts, quickly change heads, then drive a third bolt. While the carcass advanced to the next station, the emloyee would change back to the original head and be ready for the next carcass. That employee&#x27;s suggestion: Make all three bolts the same size so I don&#x27;t have to change heads.<p>Of course, that is just a fun anecdote. All such efficiencies have been implemented long ago... for auto assembly. But the point is still valid. Your employees know a ton about your business. Even the ones who do the most mundane tasks. Listen to them. Or... pay a very expensive consultant to listen to them.')
