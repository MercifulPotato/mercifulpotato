Because remove null from a existing language completely is nearly impossible.<p>And now the compiler is able to know something went wrong in your code instead of happily see you  use `null` as a object and crash the whole program.<p>Besides that, that also benefit the library users that the compiler&#x2F;ide will tell them `you can&#x27;t pass null here`')
