This is particularly sticky when it comes to misinformation.<p>Currently we have systems which make misinformation more dangerous (primarily via amplification) and a bunch of people conflating free speech with the freedom to say whatever you want.  I think what we still need to explore is whether or not there is a responsibility on individuals to be factually accurate when engaged in amplified speech.  What does that even mean?  Do you simply need to believe what you are saying at the time?  Or is the standard higher?  Is this responsibility shifted if you provide a citation (where the responsibility of the cited source shoulders some of the responsibility for your derivative thoughts)?<p>It&#x27;s a particularly thorny issue.  One that isn&#x27;t necessarily new, but is particularly acute in contemporary times.  I am against censorship, but I also recognize certain trends which seem to be deepening divides and strengthening conspiracy theories in our society.')
