Could an &#x27;attacker&#x27; try to insert himself at a specific location to gain more fame? My gut feeling is that any change in the rng would not fix the fundamental problem that a low iteration count biases towards the initial ordering. But does that even matter after hundreds of thousands of iterations? Is any improvement in rng just a performance improvement, in that it might give high quality results after fewer iterations?')
