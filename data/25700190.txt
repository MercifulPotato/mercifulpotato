Most things Twitter would moderate today are arguably threats, incitement to riot, etc., all of which could in principle be prosecuted as crimes. But it&#x27;s at least a difference in principle.<p>ADDED: On the other hand, there&#x27;s all the SPAM, link SPAM, astroturfing etc. which isn&#x27;t actually illegal. Arguably some things could be handled through Terms of Service. But it&#x27;s worth remembering that Section 230 didn&#x27;t come about to address purely theoretical concerns given that Prodigy did lose a legal case after all.')
