It&#x27;s also really beneficial to have some kind of test equipment in house to get a general idea, think of it like having a debugger.<p>The first two options are somewhat expensive, the NRE for the power supply design isn&#x27;t attractive to manager types and conductive coatings for plastic or a metal enclosure are not the cheapest options. But if you&#x27;re dead set on compliance it&#x27;s better to frontload the design costs instead of iterating 3 times before you get to market.')
