How many billions of dollars worth of fire trucks are parked right now doing nothing?<p>Given redundancy and inventory logistics, once your industry gets to some number of billions of dollars of equipment, you&#x27;re goddamn right there&#x27;s going to be a billion dollars worth of equipment lying around. It&#x27;s not the magnitude, it&#x27;s the ratio that you should get upset about, if there&#x27;s even anything to get upset about.<p>There&#x27;s also rates of consumption versus rates of production. If consumption rates are variable (eg, ramp-up to Black Friday), there is only so much variability I can manage in production. I can produce at a mostly-stable rate all year and let inventory accumulate during slow months, or I can improve my variability, but the cost is more complicated management of people, and increased likelihood of late surprises.<p>Also, don&#x27;t data centers collide with public sector timelines? If you have to start building a data center by  November 1 and you try to get your approvals all to happen on October 31, you&#x27;re going to fail, and possibly get fired.<p>You try to line those up ahead of time, maybe break ground before the next election so they can&#x27;t stop it, or someone else sucks up the surplus grid power in that substation. If it&#x27;s built early, it&#x27;s sitting around waiting for demand to use it. But at least you have it.')
