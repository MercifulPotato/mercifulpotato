Over the years, more and more duct tape has been added, and there&#x27;s little to no documentation of how everything is set up. The only remaining staff is me, who simply worked for a few years alongside the people who took over from the people who originally built everything.<p>Nobody wants to pay to have some really dig into the system, documenting everything, and bringing it up to date, because there&#x27;s a replacement system on the way (any year now). Instead, they call me every now and then to get everything rebooted.<p>I don&#x27;t mind the extra business, but if something really bad happens then that client is toast and there&#x27;s not a soul who can fix it.<p>Worst thing is I hear this kind of thing is frighteningly common.')
