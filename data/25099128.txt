And I can mix notes with tasks. This is a feature that makes it exceptional. When I was using Things3 I liked the tiny section beneath the task description where I could type some notes about the task. With orgmode I can write a full outline beneath the task description.<p>Emacs is extremely flexible as it can be extended with packages written in Lisp. There are packages that allow me to navigate to any outline node in my ~ 200 org files within a second (ivy + counsel + ripgrep-integration, also org-ql which allows me to query my org files).<p>Also, I write large amounts of text with org-mode (it’s an excellent outliner too; been previously using OmniOutline) and convert to markdown or any other format via pandoc.<p>Emacs, once mastered is an application framework that allows me automate any workflow for which I previously used AppleScript, DEVONthink, Python, Bash.')
