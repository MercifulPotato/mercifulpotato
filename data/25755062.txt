Search for „Astrix“ or „Ace Ventura“ (artists) + „ozora“ or „boom“ (festivals) on YouTube. I really like the speed of it and if there are lyrics, they are very repetitive &#x2F; meditation like. Also the sets are quite long.<p>If you are in a workplace setting, try to keep the live sets in a background tab, as Goa&#x2F;PsyTrance Festival recordings might have half naked people in them.<p>Edit: Or try to find artists in a genre you like, singing in a foreign language. I really like Korpiklaani, as don’t understand and probably never will understand a word of Finnish.')
