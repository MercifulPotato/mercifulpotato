It&#x27;s like people in abusive relationships; everyone wonders why they don&#x27;t quit but they&#x27;re too deep into it to see what&#x27;s wrong.<p>I have worked 60-80 hour weeks, currently with a newborn baby and dealing with a pandemic. This may seem like a high level of stress but it&#x27;s nowhere near as bad as it would sound. The team is hardworking and understanding. It feels like something you do with comrades rather than just a paycheck.')
