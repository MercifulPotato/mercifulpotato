I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d love to hear your theories about how fridges aren&#x27;t necessities in the winter :) I take it you&#x27;re an expert in living wage calculation?<p>For what it&#x27;s worth when I reviewed their methodology, as I suggest you do, I didn&#x27;t see a line-item for &quot;biannual iPhone upgrade.&quot; [1] And re: medical care, I&#x27;m sure you know someone making $12&#x2F;hr can&#x27;t afford to set foot in a hospital in America. For a single-income household of 2 parents and a child, the threshold for Medicaid eligibility is $15&#x2F;hr.<p>As a taxpayer, I retort, stop saddling me with the bill for the employees time you&#x27;re consuming but refusing to pay for. If their services are that important to you, I&#x27;m sure you can pay what it costs without forcing me to split it with you. As a fine upstanding participant in this nation&#x27;s economy, I&#x27;m confident you&#x27;ll find a way. Maybe forego that biannual iPhone upgrade ;)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingwage.mit.edu&#x2F;resources&#x2F;Living-Wage-Users-Guide-Technical-Documentation-2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingwage.mit.edu&#x2F;resources&#x2F;Living-Wage-Users-Guide...</a>')
