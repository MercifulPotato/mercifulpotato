However I think it&#x27;s better as a component than the whole thing, which is also shown in the Doge election.<p>It&#x27;s worth remembering that voting is already only the last step of a process:<p><pre><code>  1 Candidates self-select\n\n  2 party selection panel (or primary election)\n\n  3 election\n</code></pre>\nIn my opinion a good process would be:<p><pre><code>  1 voters form into groups of 100-200 (the range is so that a group that&#x27;s too large can just split)\n\n  2 each group elects one of their number\n\n  3 sortition among these\n</code></pre>\nThis preserves most of sortitions resistance to cliques and elite capture, but still gives a decent chance of selecting people in the top 5% by whatever metric the voters prefer, and allows them to learn (let&#x27;s not select someone like that next time)')
