Although we can&#x27;t say for sure, had those families chosen not to abort, those additional children may not have been conceived or born.  It seems somewhat contradictory to put a huge value on the potential life of an unborn fetus with Down&#x27;s while not recognizing the second-order effects on those potential lives.')
