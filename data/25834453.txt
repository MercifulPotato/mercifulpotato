Item(by='simondw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611070630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25826806, text='&gt; has someone actually just been tortured to death<p>I can&#x27;t rule out the possibility that there are some qualia associated specifically with the neuronal activity corresponding to your mental simulation, but I can say that the leap to the &quot;someone actually being tortured&quot; interpretation isn&#x27;t warranted. It&#x27;s clearly not a &quot;someone&quot; in the sense of a human person, and so all bets are off when it comes to interpreting what it&#x27;s like to be that thing.<p>&gt; Crazy implications if true!<p>Well, the implications are most likely delayed until someone invents a qualia detector.')
