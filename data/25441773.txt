I have wrote 2 or 3 times a relatively extensive .emacs and sinked several hours each time playing with its configuration, searching for nifty things, reading other people&#x27;s blog posts; played with org mode and used eww to geek out a little bit.<p>This is, in my opinion, the <i>best</i> way to introduce people to light .emacs configuration. To the point that I think there should be 4 or 5 different minimal .emacs such as this one in the main project page.<p>I understand why there is resistance to enhance the default UX and configuration, and I see the allure of spacemacs, doom, prelude, etc. But it is overkill, and pushes you down a configuration slippery slope that some enjoy too much and others dread, but that kills productivity.<p>&gt; you learnt that it recommends Emacs and SLIME for development environment and it seemed like a significant additional learning curve for you?<p>This is the key. This is what pushes <i>a lot</i> of people away from emacs. Just have a &quot;1 click&quot; better default that also serves as a tutorial &#x2F; example of how to cover 1 simple use case: one for common lisp, another one for clojure, a couple of different ones for python, one for writing a book. Just feed the space between no config and 3h of research. Have something to point out to newbies.')
