Item(by='matthiasv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607634234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25377493, text='&gt; Sometimes it&#x27;s better to take a deliberately underexposed photo and tweak regions of it in post to achieve the desired exposure instead of introducing global noise from in-camera amplification.<p>That is definitely not my experience for Canon&#x27;s in low light situations. Here [1] is an example shot at ISO 100 but pushed by 5EV to match the brightness of the same scene shot at ISO 3200. The noise is much more tolerable for the latter.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;Ca9ccbK" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;Ca9ccbK</a><p>P.S.: it&#x27;s raw, no in-camera JPEG denoising in place.')
