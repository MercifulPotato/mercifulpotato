Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[25594515], score=None, time=1609393490, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25589079, text='Thanks for this. I didn&#x27;t see your other comment about the guidelines. If you have a link to it, I&#x27;d be interested to read it.<p>I&#x27;m not asking you to &quot;behave yourself&quot;. I don&#x27;t look at your comments that way at all. I&#x27;m asking you to treat HN as a community that you&#x27;re part of.<p>I think you&#x27;re underestimating the good faith in readers here. It is an unfortunate consequence of HN&#x27;s non-siloed structure (i.e. there&#x27;s no filtering or selection of who one&#x27;s subscribed to—just one big room) that bad actors, even when they are a small minority, create an overwhelming and shocking experience of the community being that way. It is not objectively true. Actually the opposite is true: this community is, for a place that includes millions of people, actually relatively functional. (Note that word &#x27;relatively&#x27;. Obviously it&#x27;s still dysfunctional. The question is how do we nudge it into less dysfunction.) I&#x27;ve written about this here if anyone cares: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23308098" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23308098</a>.<p>Re making things worse: there are, unfortunately, many ways to make HN worse. I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re doing all of them, just one of them. You posted <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25565642" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25565642</a> 5 times—that&#x27;s obviously not cool, regardless of how badly you were provoked. When I say that, it is in no way a defense of bad actors. I&#x27;m just trying to prevent this place from degenerating deeper into hell, or at least to slow hell down a bit.')
