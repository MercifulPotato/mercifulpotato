Consider e.g. just a basic API with Bearer tokens - those tokens are sent once instead of on each request. Cloudflare saw a 53% reduction in ingress volume size (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;hpack-the-silent-killer-feature-of-http-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;hpack-the-silent-killer-feature-...</a>). These changes restore something that had been lost - efficient use of the available bandwidth - GET requests fit in one packet.<p>W.r.t. head of line blocking, all you have to do is find a website that shows a hundred pictures or loads a hundred scripts and you can see the benefit. It&#x27;s true that the benefit is minor if you&#x27;re already webpacking and spriting everything, but restoring performance to naive implementations that just use the img tags is not a minor benefit. See this website for example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imagekit.io&#x2F;demo&#x2F;http2-vs-http1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imagekit.io&#x2F;demo&#x2F;http2-vs-http1</a>.<p>HTTP&#x2F;3 adds a lot more complexity than HTTP&#x2F;2 added, for a smaller benefit, but.. that&#x27;s how these things go. Our processors reorder instructions too. Even if it&#x27;s only single digit percent, optimization are worth it. A few percent in the processor, a few percent in the OS, a few percent from the network, a few percent from the JIT - these things add up.')
