Completely agree about the overkill-ness of ELK.<p>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try Datadog yet but it looks great, the one complaint I&#x27;ve had with Splunk (or at least the way we use it at work) is that it&#x27;s still &quot;Just logs&quot; and sometimes you need more than that to investigate issues while Datadog seems to cover more areas of monitoring in one package.')
