It&#x27;s scarce (there&#x27;s only one A4 sheet with that precise badly-drawn triangle), but since nobody wants it, it&#x27;s worth as much as the paper it was drawn on.<p>The same happens with both Bitcoin and gold. Since they are scarce, as long as there&#x27;s enough demand their price will increase. However, there&#x27;s a difference: gold has industrial uses for which there are no replacements with the same characteristics, and this provides a baseline level of demand. For Bitcoin, that is not the case; for any use case, there is (or can be created) another cryptocurrency which can be used instead of Bitcoin. This means there&#x27;s no floor for the Bitcoin demand; for instance, if everyone decides that Ethereum&#x27;s proof-of-stake is the best thing since sliced bread, the demand for Bitcoin can almost completely evaporate, and its price will go to zero. (There&#x27;s a small intrinsic demand for Bitcoin as a collectible, since it was the first proof-of-work cryptocurrency, but that by itself is not enough to sustain its price.)')
