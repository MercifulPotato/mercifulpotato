And this has bitten me enough times already(ActiveAdmin, Thor,...).<p>The other problem is that if you use this you only learn the specific DSL which isn&#x27;t portable. But if you use and learn the basic technologies under it - HTML, CSS, and pure JS now that is something you can use elsewhere even if you throw Ruby away completely. And the knowledge of the basics is really really important and useful.<p>Anyways, what is a problem with writing good old .html.erb templates? I don&#x27;t think there is any.<p>And for the reactivity thing - the most easiest and fastest(10 minutes at max to install and enable) is to just turn on Turbolinks[1] and include this little plugin[2][3] for persistent scroll position where you want. Now when when you click marked with `data-turbolinks-scroll = &quot;false&quot;` Turbolinks fetches the page, replaces the current page with it, and you are still at the same scroll position. No need for SPA or JS heavy FE or anything.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;turbolinks&#x2F;turbolinks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;turbolinks&#x2F;turbolinks</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@kosovacsedad&#x2F;how-to-turbolinks-5-scroll-position-persistence-6e4435a60b2e" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@kosovacsedad&#x2F;how-to-turbolinks-5-scroll-...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;sedadkosovac&#x2F;661d0fd369069cad010f164b3fcd8c20#file-turbolinks_scroll_persistence-js" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;sedadkosovac&#x2F;661d0fd369069cad010f164...</a>')
