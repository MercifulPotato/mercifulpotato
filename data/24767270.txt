I&#x27;ll give you the benefit out the doubt, I&#x27;m guessing you make some kind of distinction as far as &quot;SaaS&quot; vs &quot;bigCorp&quot; vs &quot;indie&quot; -- but I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right perspective.  I guess at EoD I&#x27;d encourage you&#x2F;everyone to consider the content makers and support the ones that make content you enjoy, big and small alike.')
