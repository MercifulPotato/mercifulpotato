I don&#x27;t know how bad it was. My thesis, though (and I think stratechery&#x2F;Ben Thompson would agree), is that Amazon should require a much higher bar before banning something from ec2 than either Apple or Google do.<p>Fwiw, I don&#x27;t think this is &quot;coordinated&quot; so much as big companies responding simultaneously to potential (or already ignited) PR fires')
