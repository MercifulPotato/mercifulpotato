So much of what people raised didn&#x27;t engage with the material, questions that were straightforward to address, or simple clarifications (that they asked as &#x27;gotchas&#x27; more than out of confusion).<p>I think it&#x27;s unfortunate that so much of the pedagogy is focused on following the history. Of course it&#x27;s useful for people that plan on continuing with it, but it&#x27;s a terrible introduction.')
