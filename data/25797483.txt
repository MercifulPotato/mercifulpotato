Because I don&#x27;t want people like that in the workforce anyway. I believe only people who are actually motivated to work, and enjoy their jobs or duties should be there. I really do not want some sadsack of a person who hates their job serving me at a restaurant, who will mess with my food if he feels slighted by me. He should go rot away in a small apartment and leave that position for someone who actually cares. Society should gladly pay these people to keep them away. It&#x27;s sad that someone who is happy to work, must compete with hundreds of people who dont give a shit, for the same job. I hope that basic income would get rid of much of the competition for jobs like this, which would also mean business owners can no longer take advantage of a big labor pool to pay poor wages.')
