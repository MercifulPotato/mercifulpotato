There is only Brownian motion with a random distribution of impact speeds from surrounding molecules.  At any given time the graphene might be experiencing more or less force over its area than the thermal average.<p>Another way of thinking about it is that random noise although uniform at large scale, is intrinsically noisy when you zoom in.')
