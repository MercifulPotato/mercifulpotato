We get it, you don&#x27;t like Pinterest showing up in search results, nobody does. But this has absolutely nothing to do with the article other than it being pattern matching on the word &quot;Pinterest&quot;, which is about the least informative comment you can make aside from outright trolling or spam. There are threads that come up from time to time where such comments would be appropriate, if not particularly substantive.')
