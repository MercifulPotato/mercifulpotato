Dealers (who are buying cars for resale) do not pay sales tax on cars.  When you sell a used car to a dealer, the dealer doesn&#x27;t pay sales tax on it.  When you sell a used car to an auto recycler &#x2F; scrapyard, they don&#x27;t pay sales tax.  If you know of any states that are exceptions, I&#x27;d love to learn what those are.<p>2. A quick Google search (by no means comprehensive, so I could be wrong) suggests that most countries with VAT also charge a land transfer tax.')
