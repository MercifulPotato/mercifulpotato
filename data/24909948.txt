Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603821050, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24909647, text='<i>&gt; It&#x27;s either resistant or it&#x27;s not.</i><p>Resistance is not a binary thing. Often it simply means that a population of &quot;resistant&quot; bacteria takes longer to be completely eliminated, not that they are completely unaffected.<p>It would be better if a different term were used to describe bacteria that are completely unaffected by a given antibiotic; perhaps &quot;invulnerable&quot; would do. If you are in fact dealing with bacteria that are invulnerable to a particular antibiotic, then you need to switch antibiotics, yes.<p><i>&gt; Bacteria multiply far far too fast for them to notice multi-day courses of treatment</i><p>Bacteria multiply far too fast <i>under ideal conditions</i>. But the whole point of giving an antibiotic is to make the conditions as far as possible from ideal.<p><i>&gt; a bacteria only &quot;notices&quot; the current conditions before it either multiplies or dies</i><p>Bacteria are not mayflies. They don&#x27;t have to either multiply or die within a short period of time.<p><i>&gt; It seems to me that instead we should use just enough antibiotic to keep the patient alive (to turn the corner) and then let the patients immune system do the rest.</i><p>Antibiotics suppress the patient&#x27;s immune system, so once you have started them, you need to finish the job with them.<p>If you are going to try to let the patient&#x27;s immune system fight the infection, then I would think you would not give antibiotics at all; instead you would focus on maximizing supportive care for the patient&#x27;s immune system (for example, they probably need to eat a lot of protein since the immune system needs protein to make antibodies, T-cells, etc.), and for the patient generally (make sure they stay hydrated, etc.).')
