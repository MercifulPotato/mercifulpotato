Tax base shrinks, more tax burden on working class people.<p>Then the other problem is that the global birth sex ratios. The natural sex ratio at birth is 105 men for 100 women. When a population is growing, this isn&#x27;t much of a problem in monogamous societies, and everyone finds a partner (men marry younger women on average).<p>When the population is under decline, there is extreme pressure on men and in a perfectly monogamous society, 10% of men are definitely going to be left behind.<p>If we can some how genetically modify humans so that the sex ratios come near 1&#x2F;1 or 0.95 men to 1 woman, it&#x27;ll be easier to survive a decline in population and men wont be impacted as much. A growing population favors almost no one, not men, not women. A declining population means that men are the unfavored sex.<p>The end result could be large male foeticide instead of female foeticide 50 years down the line. I myself plan to not have sons but daughters because daughters are almost guaranteed to reproduce in future and abortion is a human right.<p>Therefore the right way to sustain a decline in population would be an engineering of birth ratios across the world so that a decline in population isn&#x27;t too harsh on some people.<p>The goal of money is power (supporting causes you favor etc) and access to better mates. When there aren&#x27;t enough mates to go by, people will get exhausted and start giving up. It&#x27;s going to be a permanent burnout as more people become aware of what the future holds.<p>There&#x27;s a way that even during a declining global population to sustainable levels, people remain happy. It might be unpopular, but it needs to be done. A new order.')
