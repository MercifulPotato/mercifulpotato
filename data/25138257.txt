I don&#x27;t really want even a minor case of COVID-19.<p>Yes, the vaccines may be riskier than we&#x27;re accustomed to.  GBS is a 1 per million side effect in most vaccines, with some proportion of these people having permanent side effects.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we find that these vaccines are more like 1 in 25k.  But that&#x27;s better than the odds even young people face from COVID-19.')
