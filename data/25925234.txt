Item(by='nilkn', descendants=None, kids=[25925555], score=None, time=1611731673, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25925197, text='As someone who&#x27;s never been on the DC metro, my first reaction to this story was that it&#x27;s pretty unreasonable to post an employee&#x27;s photo to Twitter just because they ate on the train. While we can&#x27;t say for sure that they wanted to get the employee fired, their intent was clearly for them to be held accountable in some way by their employer for this infraction.<p>That said, if it&#x27;s true that metro passengers have effectively been harassed and abused and arrested for years over this no-eating rule, then I can see how it would be more offensive to see an employee breaking it publicly, and this person&#x27;s reaction makes more sense to me.')
