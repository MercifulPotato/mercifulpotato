The crony beliefs, as described, seem to be only socially based.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about it for a while and I just can&#x27;t crack it. Plenty of non-religious people in my friend and acquaintance circle believe that after they die their souls will leave this world and... well they won&#x27;t actually die, I guess.<p>I just don&#x27;t see the social value in that. The subject comes up so rarely that it doesn&#x27;t really matter. If I had to guess how it works, it looks more like some sort of self-defense mechanism than anything - avoiding thinking about (potentially) depressing things that aren&#x27;t actionable.<p>So I guess my problem is that I can&#x27;t find a way to fit that in the proposed framework, unless I missed something?<p>_edit_<p>If my assumption about how it works is correct (self-defense) than it would have near 0 social value, but a lot of practical value (not worrying about things beyond one&#x27;s control). Yet it still sounds like a crony belief - it&#x27;s most likely not how the universe works imo.')
