Richard Dawkins has written some good popular science books like &#x27;Climbing Mount Improbable&#x27; that talks about evolution in this light. His &#x27;Selfish Gene&#x27; is also an excellent read. It is slightly more technical but definitely understandable without an immense technical background.')
