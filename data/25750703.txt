They just can&#x27;t move as quickly, or deliver good enough products.<p>The best products don&#x27;t win (Windows&#x27;s monopoly is proof of that, Linux not being based on Plan 9 is another), and then you have the game theoretic threat (lock-in, insecurity, existential jeopardy) of proprietary products thrown in to boot. Those are usually more important for fundamental, backbone kind of things though (OSes, browsers, servers, crypto, etc. -- as opposed to your music player or a game).')
