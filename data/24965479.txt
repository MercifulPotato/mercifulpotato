What you wrote about the virtues of newtype was explained quite well in the post itself, but you seem to want to disagree about something. You present another strawman in this reply:<p>&gt; the claim that newtype-based approaches are not type safety<p>To use your phrasing, the claim is that newtypes do not in and of themselves provide type safety, but that &quot;newtype-based approaches&quot; can and do provide a weaker form of safety than constructive modeling. Further, it&#x27;s important to understand what the critical additional steps are in such approaches to achieving that safety and avoid cargo-culting &quot;newtypes make things type-safe&quot;, and to understand the ways this safety can be violated.')
