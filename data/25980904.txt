Since SMS became a thing, I have watched in amazement, how people have been buying cars, houses, other goods, transferring money, with their cell phones. It all happens &#x27;instantly.&#x27;  Meanwhile, when we send money from bank to bank, or to Europe, or UK, it takes 3 days, or more!\nSurely, it is set up by the system to collect interest during that time period? Multiply by thousands, millions transactions, that is a lot of interest collected.')
