This indicates to us that ordering the right test during the initial evaluation may lead to fewer errors and better patient care,” he said.<p>a. Tests are not accurate, a false positive causes alarm and follow-up examination where none was present.<p>b. On the inverse: negative tests provide a false sense of security and good-health. [2] discusses this as the prime motivator for patient blood test requests.<p>c. Economic cost to the insurer or ultimately patient&#x2F;taxpayer, not of the tests themselves but of the downstream examinations.<p>As a general rule in medicine: Don&#x27;t treat a patient without signs or symptoms. When a persons feels healthy, they usually are healthy.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hms.harvard.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;unnecessary-testing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hms.harvard.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;unnecessary-testing</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal.pone.0078962" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal...</a><p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC1769380&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC1769380&#x2F;</a>')
