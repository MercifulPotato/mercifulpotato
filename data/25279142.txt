You can drop the exponents and write x^y = z as y ln x = ln z, and then everything commutes and is solved nicely. Same idea (until you get to complex numbers, maybe).<p>With multiplication, xy = z is solved by y = z&#x2F;x or x = z&#x2F;y, which works becuase of the commutativity. If it wasn&#x27;t commutative, though, you would need to use left- and right- division: x = z&#x2F;y but y = x\\z (I guess), implying y = (x^-1) z.<p>In the same vein, x^y = z has the radical symbol as a specialized notation to invert it on one side: x = âˆš^y z, which we can parse as a non-commutative operator that acts like f(z) = z^(1&#x2F;y). But it helps that the raising to a power has an inverse operation that is _also_ raising to a power (x^y)^(1&#x2F;y) = x. Whereas &#x27;being raised to a power&#x27; doesn&#x27;t have an inverse operation that is also &#x27;being raised to a power&#x27;.<p>The other problem is that when you apply a logarithm operator to a term, powers switch to being multiplied. They &#x27;change domains&#x27; in a sense. So it&#x27;s not possible to do anything to the &#x27;x&#x27; in x^y on its own, because that would result in f(x)^y which is still exponentiating by y. You need the &#x27;y&#x27; to &#x27;move&#x27; into the main line of the equation, out of the exponent.<p>I think a good way to model this would be to imagine allowing x^y = z shifting so that the &#x27;y&#x27; is the main line of the equation, becoming something like 1_x y = 1_z. 1_x and 1_z would ideally have the subscript on the left side, to avoid confusion with other uses of subscripts, and to look like a shifted version of x^1 and z^1. These are literally log x and log z in some base, but they&#x27;re just numbers, so you can solve the equation as y = 1_z&#x2F;1_x. Then you have identities like x^1_x = e, so x^(1_z&#x2F;1_x) = e^(1_z) = z. I think you just do away with the notation log_x z entirely; it&#x27;s too odd compared to everything else.<p>So basically I propose y = 1_z&#x2F;1_x, but I don&#x27;t think you can reconcile this with the square root notation at all, as they&#x27;re too different. But it does, at least, keep things consistent with using a division operation for the inverse, akin to x = z^(1&#x2F;y).')
