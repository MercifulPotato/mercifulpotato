Waaaay back, I preordered a UAV around the same time, the &quot;Sprite&quot; drone [0]. I was still in my mid teens at the time, and very ... well, stupid. I wanted something to help take ortho images to stitch together for maps and use machine learning to identify objects from aerial imagery and other ambitious crap.<p>Of course, it took years and years for the project to deliver. The guys behind it kept laboring though, and sent monthly updates, which I&#x27;d usually glance over at least. Years and years of those (detailed!) monthly updates.<p>I remember they had joked early on they&#x27;d &quot;beat&quot; the Lilly to production. Well, they did ;)<p>Many years later, I&#x27;d all but forgotten about it, and was about to graduate college when it finally arrived.<p>I got it set up, took it out for a test flight. Then a second flight -- and on the second flight, it ignored RC input and flew away, (thankfully!!) crashing into a tree trunk at probably between 30-40 MPH. Despite being &quot;ruggedized&quot;, there was a single large plastic gear somewhere between the main motor and the rotor assembly which would essentially take the blunt of any lateral impact, and shattered to bits. Was a custom part, so no trivial repair job.<p>The cost to ship + repair it would have been significantly more than a brand new DJI something or another. I can&#x27;t remember. Much better quadrocopter, better camera, better control system.<p>I learned then that even if an idea makes it to market, not only will it probably be obsolete, but even if the creators got the idea to market, not all ideas are great ideas in the first place. In this case, despite being &quot;ruggedized&quot;, no amount of polymer shielding will really prevent a high drop or impact from destroying the drive train and sensitive electronics.<p>Most of the public accounts I can find about it mention something breaking on impact or it flying away. There was a google plus group (hah!) of &quot;fans&quot; that withered out a month or two after release. A year or so afterwards, the company silently erased the product from their homepage, and shifted gears to selling to military&#x2F;government contracts.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;ascentaerosystems&#x2F;sprite-the-portable-rugged-totally-different-small" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;ascentaerosystems&#x2F;sprit...</a>')
