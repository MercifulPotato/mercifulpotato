Item(by='jonex', descendants=None, kids=[25480702], score=None, time=1608406276, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25474495, text='I wouldn&#x27;t hold anything against a person wanting to end their own life as I haven&#x27;t been in their shoes. Barring that caveat, coupling your life to a dream does seem pathological - I would worry that someone ending their life for something like that are throwing away a decent chance to still end up with a overall good, fully lived life.\nIt&#x27;s important to consider that you can have rough patches in live but recover well. The largest tragedies are when people react on short term mental pain by giving up, where they would have changed their mind if just holding out for just a bit longer. The person who might feel like there&#x27;s nothing to live for after having to give up their dream might just have their true love around the corner or maybe just a few session with a therapist would have given them a new perspective, finding joy in the moment, etc.<p>While I didn&#x27;t downvote - my guess would be that your message was received as support towards the idea that suicide would be a reasonable and healthy reaction to not reaching your dreams - an idea that in itself could make someone consider the option.')
