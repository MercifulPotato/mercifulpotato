In GitHub&#x27;s case, they only recently screwed it up in a major way, so surely it shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal to add back the functionality?<p>Is it &quot;frontend programmers&quot; feeling hurt?  Or business types who think it hurts their telemetry channels?  Do their salaries depend on it?  Or perhaps it&#x27;s just people who just need to disapprove of someone else&#x27;s preferences?<p>It&#x27;s a simple request.  Yes, more than 99% of your users use JavaScript, are not blind or deaf, have reasonably fast links, powerful machines, large enough screens, don&#x27;t mind updating their browser every week (very important! security matters _so much_ when you regularly run arbitrary code), etc.<p>So I&#x27;m in the 1%... why do so many people feel such a strong need to tell me this issue of mine is a non-issue for everybody else?')
