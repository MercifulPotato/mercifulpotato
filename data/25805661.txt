Thanks!<p>Actually I&#x27;m quite ok paying for this app...I like to support developers, especially if an app is open source.  But, my annoyance is less about paying for an app, and more about google&#x27;s calendar - which is forced upon an android user - not playing nice with caldav...And forces a person to sidestep things.<p>I was a really big fan when android first came out, thinking i would have plenty of freedom (or at least a reasonable amount of freedom) of bending my phone&#x27;s OS - at least when compared to Apple&#x27;s ios very restrictive approach...Wow, how things have changed!  I feel like android is too locked down.  Ok, some might think that ios is still more restrictive...But, to me, both ios and android are tech prisons just different colors of paint on the wall.  I say that last statement with my fingers crossed and praying for pinePhone and other linux-y type phones to really make it mainstream!')
