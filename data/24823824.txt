Only near the very end does the actual thing the article is claiming become clear, and it’s still subtle. Basically it’s a terribly written article about a use case of white noise that I think is not the typical use case. The article appears to be about using white noise to fall asleep due to ones’ mental state, and not about white noise to cover up other disrupting sounds. It makes no sense to me that someone would cover it from that angle.')
