Item(by='louwrentius', descendants=None, kids=[25265497, 25265766, 25268185], score=None, time=1606833012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25265352, text='&gt; Up until the invention of Bitcoin, there was ZERO scalable way for me @joeblau to send you @louwrentius money the way I send an email. By that, I mean the only thing I need to rely on is a protocol (like SMTP) and you&#x27;ll receive it.<p>Maybe because it&#x27;s not a need most people have?<p>&gt; The problem is that money (paper money&#x2F;currency) is not the only thing that has value which human beings transfer among each other. We share music, art, poetry, equity in companies, ideas, code, etc. What Ethereum does is take the idea of &quot;Digital trustless money transfer&quot; and expands it to &quot;Digital trustless value transfer&quot;<p>This still means nothing to me. I can&#x27;t relate to this.<p>&gt; Let&#x27;s say I own TSLA stock and I want to sell it to you. I can&#x27;t, without going through a middle-person. (they take cuts and fees..)<p>So it&#x27;s about not wanting to pay transaction fees for buying stock. Hmm, doesn&#x27;t really sell it to me, quite frankly.')
