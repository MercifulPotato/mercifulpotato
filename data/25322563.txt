Unlike cocaine and weed, you can&#x27;t really test for it. Kind of sad to see something like this published by the Marines though; basically content free &quot;muh microdosing.&quot; I mean, does this even mean anything?<p><i>&quot;Microdoses cause cortical functions\nto be more fluid, leading researchers\nto believe that psychedelics may help\ncertain brain areas work in increas-\ningly flexible and expansive ways.&quot;</i><p>If ever there was a meme elixir designed to punch holes in your pre-frontal cortex, microdosing is it. There&#x27;s basically zero evidence such substances enhance anything. In my experience, and in my observations of others, it makes you <i>feel</i> like you&#x27;re enhancing your noggin, but real world performance definitely, sometimes dramatically suffers.<p>Modafinil and amphetamines probably enhance performance on grinding tasks. Nature, concentration and lack of sleep definitely enhance performance on creative tasks. Caffeine works too, and nicotine and the racetams for keeping the cobwebs out and the acetylcholine high. Microdoses, yeah, nerd &quot;muh microdoses&quot; articles ain&#x27;t gonna cut it for me: I&#x27;ve seen the effects and will stick with coffee and snus. Hell, simply looking at scientific or technological output pre and post civilizational psychedelic use: you can see it hasn&#x27;t had any obvious benefit. People did more amazing things back when day drinking was common.')
