Not that HN is immune from strongly-held polarizing opinions. But, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that for a lot of people, you&#x27;re either in camp &quot;Get it as soon as available, no questions asked&quot; or you&#x27;re an anti-vaxxer. (Personally, I&#x27;ll get it as soon as I can.)<p>But this has all the signs of getting very ugly once a vaccine becomes available. I certainly don&#x27;t expect the military to hold people down and vaccinate them by force. But I do expect a lot of severe restrictions in some places on people who don&#x27;t want to get vaccinated right-off that will put them in a tough position.')
