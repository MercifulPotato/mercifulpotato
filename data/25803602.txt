Just as if I said I graduated from Harvard when I got a degree of some sort from HES, that&#x27;s clearly misleading. If you look through the faculty directory of HES, it doesn&#x27;t look as if HES generally gives titles; most of the titles given are the faculty&#x27;s positions at other institutions where applicable. (There are a few Lecturers in Extension.)')
