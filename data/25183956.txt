Not to be hateful, but if you look how the groups align it makes little sense.  Those who most seek to protect those ignorant people call terrorists, or illegals who need to be sent back, are also those who support gay rights, despite the fact those two groups historically and currently trend strongly against it.  I&#x27;m not trying to ruffle any feathers, I&#x27;m just an observer fascinated with how things are playing out.  But recently it seems these virtues we all must follow or die only apply to Americans, and that doesn&#x27;t sit well with me.')
