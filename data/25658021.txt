Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25658572], score=None, time=1609943345, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25656835, text='Ask yourself just what it is you think &quot;meaning&quot; might mean, and why you&#x27;re so interested in it. What is the actual problem that you&#x27;re hoping &quot;meaning&quot; will solve?<p>The answer is going to be a lengthy dialogue that&#x27;s personal to you, but I&#x27;ll give you a bit of a shortcut pointer: you&#x27;re unhappy, and you want to be told a route that will make you happy in some long term. Acknowledge the unhappiness, and start to work on yourself.<p>Ideally you&#x27;d do that with a professional therapist, if possible, though finding the right therapist is a challenging task in itself. They&#x27;re not there to give you answers, but to help you frame the question and encourage you to think seriously about it. It&#x27;s easy to think you have, but instead just wear ruts in your existing thinking patterns.<p>So I&#x27;ve hopefully given you a new way to think about the question. Start there. Forget about &quot;meaning&quot;; it&#x27;s a red herring. Ask yourself why you think that red herring is important, and maybe by looking sideways at the question you&#x27;ll find some answers that are useful. Good luck.')
