Item(by='JediWing', descendants=None, kids=[25072838, 25074093, 25075599], score=None, time=1605201794, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25066024, text='Google Play Music worked perfectly well for me, and I used it as a Spotify alternative, not even for the music library features.<p>The switch to YouTube Music has been terrible.<p>Dead simple things don&#x27;t work: my son would listen to a specific white noise track at night over his Google Home Mini.<p>Previously, we could tell it to play the song, then say &quot;repeat on&quot; and it would repeat indefinitely until he woke up and turned it off.<p>YouTube Music simply doesn&#x27;t work repeating over a speaker.<p>What&#x27;s even more maddening: I can repeat a song indefinitely on the Android app, but once I cast to the Mini, THE OPTION TO LOOP IS CANCELLED AND DISAPPEARS.<p>The only solution: I had to make a playlist that plays the same song for hours.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read, it seems to me like this shift to YouTube Music is primarily a licensing issue. Rather than pay for streaming rights to music tracks, Google seems to be using the library of music it has on YouTube to retroactively backdoor a streaming service that plays the YouTube videos without the video.<p>I suspect the repeat restrictions are a side-effect of this, somehow.<p>I would switch to Spotify (and may still do so) but I&#x27;d still be held hostage to pay YouTube the same price to run without ads (the primary reason I bought the package in the first place), so my choice is to switch to Spotify and make my kids watch YouTube ads, or pay double.<p>RIP Google Music indeed')
