They started development later and took more time but when all will be said and done, I fully expect them to have shipped more vaccines than Moderna and Pfizer: mRNA-based vaccines have never been produced at scale and the logistic involved seems rather complexe.<p>Merck and Sanofi are developing vaccines based on existing vectors. They can reach true mass production as soon as they get approved. It&#x27;s the same thing for Johnson and Johnson actually. AstraZeneca has what I would call a true headstart however.')
