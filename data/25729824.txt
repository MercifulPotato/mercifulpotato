Decertifying the autonomous-driving feature should probably trigger a manufacturer recall, so the features can be disabled permanently (not just a via software update).<p>Or alternatively, most countries have a periodic vehicle check (like the MOT test in the UK), and having non-certified features enabled could be a reason for failing the test.')
