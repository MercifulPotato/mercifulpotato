Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25783639], score=None, time=1610660768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25782024, text='&quot;I don&#x27;t think the parent meant any disparagement to actual primitive tribes. Why did you assume that?&quot;<p>Because all of these statements of ethnicity have to be contextualized.<p>You can&#x27;t just say &#x27;Well White this, Black that&#x27; - other than in a very American context.<p>I live in Quebec and they are essentially the only classical, coherent &#x27;ethnic group&#x27; (i.e. language, governance) in North America aside from Aboriginals - and due to the fact they are surrounded by the &#x27;Angloshphere&#x27; there is a very legit concern about the erosion of their culture.<p>New migrants basically don&#x27;t want to learn French, and more and more English language &#x27;everything&#x27; encroaches on the culture.<p>Now - some Pro-Quebec sentiment is really ridiculous, racist, over the top and frankly dumb (they want to ban &#x27;Staples&#x27; from being called &#x27;Staples&#x27; because it&#x27;s English) but there is an underlying legitimacy.<p>Unspoken in all of this is that Quebec culture is defacto European and essentially (though not technically) White.<p>Also of interesting note that intellectually it&#x27;s super-secular (they don&#x27;t like their Catholic past) at the same time, culturally, kind of super Catholic.<p>Point being: there are calls for the &#x27;saving of our culture&#x27; basically daily. It&#x27;s part of the program here and it&#x27;s not overtly racist or radical.<p>My MP (like Congressperson) is form &#x27;Quebec Solidaire&#x27; and it&#x27;s the very farthest Left group in North America it actually has roots in a former Communist part. (I didn&#x27;t vote for them!) - but - they are <i>equally Nationalist</i>! They walk a tight intellectual line with justifying their Nationalism on a &#x27;racially inclusive&#x27; basis, even though their ideology is at the same time very exclusive to outsiders, who happen to be Anglophones ... and people of colour.<p>In the face of Globalism &#x27;We Are All Aboriginals&#x27; - which is to say every single culture save maybe Han Chinese is under the threat of being &#x27;globalized&#x27; in a kind of Anglo-American hot-mess of commercialism.<p>So yes, it&#x27;s not the same thing for some French guy to be saying such things as it is for someone from the disappearing Tribes of the Amazon, but this isn&#x27;t the 20th century anymore, the fault lines are changing quickly and context is really important.')
