You could argue that making a call to a db is a distributed system but that is usually not what is meant. FP without side effects is excellent for transforming immutable data. History is by definition immutable so it suits that. It doesn&#x27;t fit quite as well with a distributed system that has changing state, where the current state of the system is the primary concern for users.')
