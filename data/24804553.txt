My comment is with respect to Abrahmic creed offering &quot;bliss in after life&quot;. Indian Dharmic traditions doesn&#x27;t claim to give you &quot;bliss in after life&quot;. They help you lead a blissful life in this world and leave the world fully satisfied.<p>Yoga teaches this blissful existence so some parts of these teaching deal with physical aspects like asanas(exercises) and pranayana(breathing). However, central ideas of Yoga is called निष्काम कर्म or unattached action which simply put means hell or high water, you should stick to your duties and perform them without caring for the results. No wonder many scholars like Beethoven, Eliot, Emerson, Oppenheimer to name a few got inspired by its philosophy.[1][2]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yogajournal.com&#x2F;yoga-101&#x2F;first-book-yoga" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yogajournal.com&#x2F;yoga-101&#x2F;first-book-yoga</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;music&#x2F;2005&#x2F;nov&#x2F;18&#x2F;classicalmusicandopera.thomasstearnseliot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;music&#x2F;2005&#x2F;nov&#x2F;18&#x2F;classicalmusic...</a>')
