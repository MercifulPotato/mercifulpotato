I was on a 2 year working holiday visa for that job, and when the visa ran out I was done.<p>.. eventually though I convinced Bell and the Province I was living in to run me through the &quot;Provincial Nominee&quot; stream, which required TONS of paperwork to prove that no Canadian was willing or able to do the job, and therefore they needed a foreigner like me.\nThat took 2 years of paperwork, interviews, medical tests and background checks and being saddled to that job before I finally got it.')
