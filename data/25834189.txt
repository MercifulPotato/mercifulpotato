Every facebook group could in theory individually decide that Qanon conspiracies are unacceptable and remove them, and indeed most do. The problem is a minority won&#x27;t, and the crazies just aggregate there. And the same principle applies whether the decentralized authorities are subreddit moderators or small site admins or what have you.<p>Moderation is fundamentally forced upon people against their individual will for the sake of the larger community. If the &quot;baddies&quot; self-censored, we wouldn&#x27;t be having this discussion.<p>Decentralized authority can work in situations where people can&#x27;t freely associate, for example if my town forbids me from putting a &quot;Hail Satan&quot; sign on my lawn, it&#x27;s a significant burden to move to a town of satanists, and even if I did, it would no longer be a problem for the town I left. But online it&#x27;s trivial to find some place that will let me post &quot;hail satan&quot; and ignoring its existence will just have to be good enough for those who don&#x27;t like it. There is no &quot;local&quot; on the internet - there is no distance nor natural barriers over which the actions of others lose potency. You are never more than a few keystrokes away from the deepest darkest pits of the internet, and there is no way of ensuring any concept stays in those pits.<p>I am not in favor of global censorship as I feel the harm outweighs the good. Unfortunately, local censorship is not a way to have our cake and eat it too.')
