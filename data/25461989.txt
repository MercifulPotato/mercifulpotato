It doesn&#x27;t make the `null` feature of JavaScript go away, it just makes it more explicit in the type annotation. So `null` isn&#x27;t bad. Languages that don&#x27;t have `null` have something similar like `Option`.<p>To me, that helps make the code more maintainable and that&#x27;s the biggest benefit, even more than catching bugs. The process of maintaining code involves asking questions about the code. &quot;What is this code for?&quot; &quot;Was this code written to handle &lt;edge case&gt;?&quot; &quot;Can this value, sent to me from another part of the system I&#x27;m not familiar with, ever be null?&quot;<p>In a strict null check world, you can answer the last question with confidence just by looking at the type signature. Without strict null check, the types don&#x27;t tell you anything about whether a variable can be null, so figuring that out can be anywhere between a distraction to a huge endeavor.')
