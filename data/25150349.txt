Its 0<p>&gt; For instance, my body is using the whole earth as its reaction mass, and is using zero energy pushing it downwards at zero speed<p>That is not how gravity works. There is nothing happening.<p>&gt; A jet is much more impressive because it gets that high thrust to weight ratio while using a small reaction mass ejected at a high speed. That is what is required to push an aircraft up to supersonic speeds<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a small reaction mass. A shit ton air is needed to feed the compressor. A jet sacrifices efficiency to get as much mass thrown out the back as fast as possible.<p>&gt;  if it might be possible to fly supersonic much higher than jets, because there is no reduction in engine power.<p>Why would there be no loss in engine power. If you are using  standard propellers, you are limited by air density. If you are using some electric engine to turn a turbine, you have the exact same issue. What magical engine is this electricity powering?')
