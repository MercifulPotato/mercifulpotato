I&#x27;ve been in situations (I do a lot of heavy data viz work) where providing alternative content for impaired users as well as graphical content for sighted users is a performance no go. If I could reliably detect which kind of content is preferred, then it would not be a problem. But if &gt;90% of your audience is to suffer choppy frame rates (and 100% of your bosses) just to generate invisible content, the end result is that there is no alternative content (or crappy one: &quot;A chart showing the relationship between instance count and cost&quot; &lt;- this leaves out all the interesting stuff).')
