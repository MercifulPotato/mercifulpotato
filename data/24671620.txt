From the Eternal September onwards we’ve struggled to sustain community quality in the face of infinite connectivity. You start open &amp; welcoming, but eventually you get overwhelmed with new folks and you can’t socialize them fast enough to preserve what was attractive about your community in the first place.<p>This is the work of institution building. It’s not easy. The best examples I’ve seen are HN, Lobste.rs and some focused subreddits. All of these have strong mod teams and spam controls.')
