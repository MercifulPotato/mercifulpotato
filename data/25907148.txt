I know I will forget that over time because I am trained in spaced repetition and I know if I don&#x27;t review something I will loose it forever in the future.<p>If I spend hours reading an important book and don&#x27;t review it, I will forget and waste those hours. Nothing less productive than that.<p>Most people forget most of what they learn and are not conscious about it.<p>&gt;And how do you make sure you aren&#x27;t spending more time on organizing&#x2F;formatting&#x2F;maintaining your notes and making it look nice instead of actually reading doing productive stuff?<p>I have it automated. I am an expert programmer so I spend very little time doing that. It is extremely productive because I know how to do things most people can&#x27;t.<p>&quot;The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources&quot; Albert Einstein<p>I have never cared about making it look nice. I started using paper and an automatic feeder Fujitsu scanner. It was ugly at first but worked.<p>After years of improvement,it looks nice, beautiful if you want, but it was never the goal. The goal was automatic review, and powerful search.')
