So called &quot;Hackers&quot; simply told the generators relay to close out of phase causing the generator and grid currents to violently crash into each other. This means the magnetic fields of the rotor and armature were not aligned. Obviously the grid has much larger generators backing it so the little diesel gen set rotor was no match for the now grid energized armature. The armature field tries to violently pull the rotor into phase resulting in catastrophic physical forces on the generator mechanics. After a few of these devastating blows the diesel engine&#x27;s crank shaft, connecting rod or perhaps the flywheel coupler violently fails.<p>The only code needed would be to completely ignore line and gen set phasing or flip them 180 to really let the bolts fly.<p>Any generator will succumb to this no matter the prime mover. They must be in sync with the grid or other operating generators before connected across the line&#x2F;bus. This is power house practice 101 level stuff.')
