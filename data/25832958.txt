We did get the offer for WILTY tickets, but the logistics were simply intractable (living in London at the time).<p>Most mainstream UK shows are taped within, or nearby, London - and that works reasonably well.  Arguably the hardest show to get into is QI, and we were coaxed into being in audience for Pointless in order to bump up our &#x27;score&#x27; on the QI queue as it were.  It&#x27;s a weird old arrangement over there.')
