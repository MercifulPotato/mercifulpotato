One only has to look at the history of manufacturing, labor unions, and misguided attempts to &#x27;keep jobs on American soil&#x27; to see why the wage fixation approach fails. What does work is defining the trend, then selling the knowledge while we work on the next big thing. That&#x27;s been a money maker for America and has benefited the world too via secondary effects.
