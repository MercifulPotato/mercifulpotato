Their inclusion as top-level items in a Math package is not.<p>One could imagine alternate taxonomies where, e.g., the Math package is divided into Arithmetic, Trig, Comparison, and Advanced sub-packages. Or where they are placed into an Operators package insted of Math.<p>For example, Rust puts the Max function into the cmp (Comparison) crate of std. This associates them with comparison &amp; equality rather than trigonometry and calculus like Java does.<p>This is the type of <i>subjective</i> decision-making that qualifies something as original and non-trivial.')
