As they would be fully vested with offers given before the 700% increases. They probably have base salaries in the 100k range but would have equity in the 10m.   I could foresee some pretty big turnover as those employees practically retire or head into angel investing. I mean it’s not like Tesla’s Hr is going to refresh their equity anywhere near what they already have.')
