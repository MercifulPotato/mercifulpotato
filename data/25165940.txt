The game though, is a big reason for hiring people illegally is to keep costs down. Because illegal workers area afraid to complain and will work for less.<p>Now, when the average moron finds that there are lots of illegals in industry X, or in the country as a whole, they get up in arms about the illegals, support a crackdown but the crackdown doesn&#x27;t remove the illegals but makes them more afraid, reinforcing the whole system. So the typical ideology of this country makes accomplices of people to the racket when sun light is (selectively) shed on the situation.<p>It&#x27;s funny that China runs their on the same legal&#x2F;illegal division of labor but in China the &quot;illegals&quot; are internal to China, people from the countryside who don&#x27;t have official permission to be in the city.')
