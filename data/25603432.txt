Odd as it may seem, a lot more people want to buy Bitcoin at $28,000 than wanted to buy it at $5000.<p>Yes, but: if most of that money comes from the pocket of ordinary people, and a bunch of geeks (or the usual Winklevoss twins, Tim Draper [0], etc) will cash out and drive the cost down again, the ones losing a ton of money will be - as usual - the ordinary people.<p>As much as I like Fred Wilson, sometimes I&#x27;m really surprised by comments like this one. It seems he&#x27;s not realizing the danger of this new crypto &quot;bubble&quot;, and who&#x27;s going to pay for it. But &quot;we all have to eat&quot;.
