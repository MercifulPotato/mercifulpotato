They didn&#x27;t know what they were doing or what rights they actually had.  And certainly they must not have read the ToS where Robinhood is granted various terrible powers over their money and trading access.<p>On the one hand it&#x27;s great that anyone who wants it has access to the financial markets.  But I mean, you should probably know what you&#x27;re doing before you start speculating.  Are people really going to make a moral issue out of not being able to sell their bad bets to a greater fool?<p>It&#x27;s like everyone wants access to swim with a dangerous group of man-eating sharks and then complains when they get bitten.')
