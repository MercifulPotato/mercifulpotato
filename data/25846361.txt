They were really loving each other in the Obama years, remember when social media was hailed in liberal media as a positive force for democracy (alluding to the various Spring revolutions)? I mean, Obama’s campaign used private Facebook data no less than Trump did, and liberal media even spun that as a good thing at that time! The problem is once that  same technology was soon to be used against the neoliberals from both left&#x2F;right wing populism (Occupy Wall Street and Bernie for the left, Trumpism for the right), that’s when their relationship  got shakened quite a bit and now we’re up to the point where the Dems are filing antitrust regulations against Google. The neoliberals got a bit afraid that the new technocrats (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc) would accumulate enough power to do whatever they want (against their interests, although so far big tech&#x27;s interests just seemed to be about making as much money as possible with disregard for anything else), so liberal media began spewing out one of the most blatantly aggressive narratives that social media was the sole fault in the rise of Trumpism (well, only partially so, the more substantial reason has to do with US neoliberal policies leading to deindustrialization, along with the greater urban&#x2F;rural inequality divide). I mean, SV companies have their faults, but it’s not just them responsible for this whole mess. Anyways, the mainstream Dems finally got the big social media companies to censor as they please, but that’s only after the populist left&#x2F;right started to look for decentralized or encrypted alternatives, albeit slowly (Telegram&#x2F;Signal&#x2F;Mastodon&#x2F;Pleroma&#x2F;Lemmy&#x2F;etc).')
