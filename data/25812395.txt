There isn&#x27;t as large of an ecosystem, but Kakoune just feels better integrated with the environment.  Is your hesitancy based on some particular feature, or the ecosystem, or something else?  Or is there some default that you dislike?<p>I feel like it doesn&#x27;t need to have as many maintainers in order to be successful, because its philosophy is much more spartan.  The maintainers pretty aggressively keep the project&#x27;s scope in check.')
