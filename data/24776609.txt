Item(by='scoutt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602684104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24776290, text='Yes, the simulation has to have a limited duration.<p>&gt; Lightspeed gives structure to the computation of the universe but it doesn&#x27;t reduce the load.<p>The load would be saved because you don&#x27;t need to keep computing interactions between object, because we don&#x27;t get to see these object&#x2F;interaction since the simulation has a limited time. You save this pre-render of the universe and you just need to calculate whatever is closer to us (and our simulated world).<p>You don&#x27;t need to calculate all at once and you don&#x27;t need to calculate since the big bang, since we will experience a very short period in the simulation. And I suppose most of it can be just faked.<p>Imagine a spherical universe with the Earth at the center. You can calculate the outer portion of the sphere, then garbage-collect, then the result is added to the calculation for an inner portion, then garbage-collect, an so on until you reach the center of the sphere.<p>Another thing is the time-constant. Why our time has to <i>pass</i> with the same speed as the time outside the simulation^? What we think it takes <i>time</i> to calculate it&#x27;s now completely relative. If time is infinite in the <i>real</i> universe, then <i>they</i> have plenty of time to build our world so effectively that our entire existence is ran in a fraction of a second.<p>Other aspect is why our universe has to be of the same quality of the <i>real</i> universe. Perhaps we have a sloppy version that is easier to calculate (but it&#x27;s still complex for us to understand).<p>Of course, I&#x27;m just drinking my coffee and playing I am a genius this evening. I&#x27;m not going to defend the above as in a real analysis.<p>Edit: ^changed <i>calculation</i> for <i>simulation</i>')
