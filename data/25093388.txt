The very first thing a user sees in the issue template is a shouty headline about being blocked. There are many comments which come across to me as passive-aggressive such as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Homebrew&#x2F;brew&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5675#issuecomment-461439973" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Homebrew&#x2F;brew&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5675#issuecomment-46...</a> or the last para at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Homebrew&#x2F;brew&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5654#issuecomment-461734975" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Homebrew&#x2F;brew&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5654#issuecomment-46...</a> .<p>I appreciate that you have a near-impossible mission in helping diagnose people&#x27;s installation issues. I don&#x27;t envy you, and I appreciate the technical work you do. Few open source projects are immune from the challenges of burnout caused by ingrate users and Homebrew probably gets it worse than most. As a maintainer, I 100% get it. But as a user, it puts me off using the software. I now use Homebrew much less than I used to as a result.')
