Basically, you can run a NAS at the capabilities of the machine with random USB3 JBODs.<p>So a $100 5+ bay USB3 JBOD, RPi4B run over the 1G nic, and a 64-bit arm64 distro (because rasbian will die with modern SATA disks in a larger capacity JBOD) and you have a fairly reasonable low end NAS for basically the price of the disks.<p>(or just plug in 4 of USB3 easystores&#x2F;etc and save on the enclosure).')
