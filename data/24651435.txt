It is unusually thin because it has absolutely no side impact protection; I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone&#x27;s daily driver: It meets the basic regulatory requirements, but absolutely nothing more. If you side by side it with a Graco or similar, there&#x27;s no comparison (the build quality is just outright bad).<p>Using one of the worst (legal) car seats on the market as a justification for why this is mistaken is misleading. If you look at any of the safer car seats they weigh more, are wider, and are wildly more popular. Parents are regularly dealing with this &quot;three across&quot; problem. I can easily imagine it being a consideration when looking at kid three (even with two we make different travel plans as a direct result of car seat issues).<p>The Cosco isn&#x27;t a solution, just goes to show how poorly you can get away with making a car seat.')
