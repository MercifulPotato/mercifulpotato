Item(by='draw_down', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610811834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25801986, text='&gt; Commands are indented (horribly, by tabs, because make was created in the early days of Unix when they were still obsessed with saving bytes)<p>See, to me this is exactly not simple (a reference to make’s “simplicity” appears shortly after this). It’s a form of complexity because every time something is wrong with the build, this is one of the things I will need to check.<p>Moving the complexity elsewhere so that it becomes someone else’s problem just does not work for me as a definition of simplicity. You see this pattern a lot. Golang is pretty much an entire object lesson in this dynamic. Everything is “simple”, aka, “your problem”.')
