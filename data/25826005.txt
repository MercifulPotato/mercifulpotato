You are suggesting that the task of relaying blocks falls solely on non-mining nodes, when this isnt true. Mining nodes carry out the same roles as non mining nodes when it comes to relaying&#x2F;propagation. Every node within the network, whether it be mining or non-mining, pass blocks they receive to their peers.')
