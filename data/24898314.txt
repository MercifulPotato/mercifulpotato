From what I&#x27;ve seen, large technical companies are made up of two sets, the technical set and the manager&#x2F;business set. Unfortunately, it seems that the manager set yields a disproportionate amount of influence and power and therefore is &quot;valued&quot; more. I&#x27;m sure there are smaller companies that could make the folks leaving stick around the industry. But, if they&#x27;ve been successful and are mid career they may have priced themselves out of those opportunities.')
