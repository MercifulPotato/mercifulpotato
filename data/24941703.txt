I tried to get into a side programing project, but couldn&#x27;t really settle into one. That&#x27;s when I saw&#x2F;remembered Factorio and started on it. It scratched that itch and I spent hours playing the game.<p>Once my job got back into more hands-on programming, I quickly lost interest in playing Factorio. I&#x27;ve been reading other programmers having the same feeling. You expend the same type of mental processing with both, so one makes you too tired to do the other.<p>That said, if I have a long weekend or a week off, I might find some time and enjoy playing it, and still feel refreshed when returning to work.')
