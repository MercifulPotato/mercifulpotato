Many would probably prefer someone else.  But very, very few would see the integrity of this election as more than an intern-level joke.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever worked in an environment where money was changing hands (banking, trading, etc) or where security was the real deal (three-letter agencies), or even in the insurance industry, you know that election integrity controls are a half-baked freshman project by comparison.<p>(For myself, I don&#x27;t care who wins.  I don&#x27;t believe it matters.  But don&#x27;t piss on me and tell me it&#x27;s raining.)')
