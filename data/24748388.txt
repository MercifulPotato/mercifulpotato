You&#x27;re moving the goal posts and clearly adding further to very obvious agitprop.<p>But, I&#x27;ll take your bait: Where in the wayback machine for these censored sites does it discuss holocaust denial?<p>So far, upon review, I haven&#x27;t found a single mention of the holocaust in any of the banned sites.<p>Lots of factual details about multiple extraordinarily repugnant crimes against humanity committed in the name of the American people, however.<p>Do you deny those crimes?
