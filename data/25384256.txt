I guess cause I bought it for a friend&#x27;s birthday. She specifically asked for me for that album, so all I did was buying it. But it was weird, especially as I was a young boy back then (IIRC around 11 y.o.). I doubt it&#x27;d be OK to publish an album cover like that nowadays, and frankly, I agree.<p>Bad is subjective though. I mean, look at all the Thunderdome covers. Terribly cheesy if you ask me, but youth found it cool I guess. Then again, some people would say Lords of Acid&#x27;s covers are bad (or &quot;satanistic&quot;) whereas other would say &quot;kinky&quot;. That&#x27;s the problem with the term &#x27;bad&#x27;; its too open for interpretation. Imagine a website with &quot;bad news articles&quot;. Same problem.')
