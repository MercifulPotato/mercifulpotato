How many tech IPOs have there been this year? 20 or 30? Of those 20 or 30 companies, how many of their peers at founding (~2010-2013) have survived?<p>If I take knowledge of 2020, go back in time, and take a job, it seems like a great deal. If I&#x27;m back in 2010 or 2011, and take only knowledge of the world at that time, would I have chosen AirBNB? I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Even if I did, what are the odds I could&#x2F;would stick around long enough to make it to the IPO -- or was willing to exercise illiquid stock at departure with years to go before the stock can be sold?<p>To make it fair, one should of course also consider companies which did not IPO but had good acquisitions. I&#x27;m not sure what that number is, 300? 3000? Still, across a field of 20,000 or more startups it is unclear how I&#x27;d get to this smaller set.<p>I think there are def things that can increase the odds, but I dont think it is fair to look backwards using 2020 knowledge.')
