Sure, it&#x27;s easy to read, but having those braces also makes code easier to read.<p>Maybe not opening braces, they&#x27;re sorta redundant, but closing braces allow me to &quot;pop stack&quot; when I read them.<p>Yaml combines the worst of whitespace with the use of whitespace without keywords, which makes things even harder.<p>JSON is ok, particularly if your editor auto-quotes things, I wish it had comments, but having something that strips comments is a single sed pre-processing line.<p>Neither are great for human generation or consumption, but at least JSON is only trying to be a serialize&#x2F;deserialize syntax and doesn&#x27;t claim to be more.<p>YAML truly lives up to the &quot;YA&quot; part. It&#x27;s trying to be the COBOL of configuration, able to be read and written by anyone. But no one needs that.')
