I mean, what&#x27;s the end goal? If i want success and you give me a choice of &quot;improve what you do&quot; or &quot;improve what you look like&quot; for the same result, I&#x27;ll take the first one every time. If that pushes some people away, that&#x27;s gain x2 - improvement and I know that people around me care on a deeper level than a lie of appearance (it will go away with time anyway).')
