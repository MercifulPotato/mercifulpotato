Your misinterpretation starts at the very first sentence.\nI said &quot;people with guns are less likely to be brutalized by the gov or literally anyone.&quot;<p>&gt;And trying to do self defense with a gun is a terrible idea in most circumstances.<p>statistics say otherwise also statistics cant even capture the self defenses that weren&#x27;t needed because someone had a gun and could have used it if needed.<p>&gt;(Though trying to fight government abuse with a gun is also a terrible idea.)<p>trying to fighting against anyone isn&#x27;t self defense. no where did I say anything the like you just made that up.<p>&gt;Deciding not to carry around a gun is very different from deciding not to defend yourself. It&#x27;s not victim mentality.\nYou are seem unable to completely read and understand my post. You cant just pick one part and ignore the rest. I clear said that if you cant defend yourself its not the same as if you voluntary dont want to. There are many valid reasons why you would not carry a gun and so if you dont have one you obliviously cant us it. Not the same as if you want to have guns removed from anyone so people no longer have a choice.')
