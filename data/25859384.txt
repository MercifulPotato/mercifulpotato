So when I signed up, I got a sense that I was joining a community. I don&#x27;t get that sense when I sign up for an email provider. Mastodon servers have rules and themes and therefore attract certain kinds of people. Protonmail might do this too, but it&#x27;s not a social network, so I never meet those people through the service.<p>Also, ducking into other communities to grab and share content feels a bit weird. I didn&#x27;t join radical.town or whatever, so I don&#x27;t really feel like I&#x27;m a part of that community.<p>Does that make sense? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve fully processed this stuff yet, so it might not be a great answer.')
