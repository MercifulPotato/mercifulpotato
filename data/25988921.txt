The story of its production is interesting but the end result is a very non-Disney film. I was never a big Disney fan due to preferring straight-up comedies as a child vs. drama&#x2F;adventure with some token comedic relief character.<p>It is very self-aware and has humor Disney does not include elsewhere aside from maybe some Pixar films. I really recommend a rewatch as an adult.<p>Also as a Seinfeld fan, Patrick Warburton is always nice to hear.')
