I&#x27;m surprised that you have run this platform for 8 years. That&#x27;s incredible!<p>There&#x27;s one question I want to ask you. Do you have any experience handling millions of traffic? I saw that you are using MYSQL for storage. I assume each pageview is stored in a row. So, from my experience MYSQL is very slow performing aggregated queries on those datasets (We recently moved to Clickhouse due to this). I&#x27;d like to know your experiences on handling millions of rows in MYSQL, if you have any :)')
