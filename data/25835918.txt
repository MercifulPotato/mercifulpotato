That is to say in order for communism to work you must have a classless society. Soon as you have inequality based on anything, 2 classes form. Those with and those without.<p>It comes down to even a surplus of production.<p>We could theoretically have the same job but I work 40 hours&#x2F;week and you work 20 hours&#x2F;week. I will therefore be in a class higher than you. If I am not in a higher class, then I won&#x27;t work those 40 hours and I&#x27;ll go down to those 20 hours. OR I try to force you to work 40 hours.<p>&gt;There is an entire spectrum of organizational bodies and humans need not (and probably cannot) abolish all of them to form some sort of universal civilization. Surely there are ways we can retain regional cultural uniqueness and small group identities while gaining the ability to cooperate and share values?<p>That adds a significant level of complexity.')
