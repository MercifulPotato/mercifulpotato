It&#x27;s much more secure to simply demand it as rent.<p>Oh, I realize why landlords prefer it. I just don&#x27;t think it holds up under scrutiny. If you&#x27;re my tenant and I charge you $100&#x2F;month for dog rent on your new puppy, who causes $0 damage and lives for 14 years, I&#x27;ve extracted $16,800 from you, $0 of which will go toward rehabbing the apartment of dog damages when you leave.')
