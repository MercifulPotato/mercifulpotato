Generally speaking, memory-safe programming languages (Java, Safe Rust, Python...) shouldn&#x27;t have any heap corruption bugs (modulo bugs in their implementation, of course). Memory-safe generally means that memory corruption of all kinds are impossible. But Heap Corruption is a very broad category.')
