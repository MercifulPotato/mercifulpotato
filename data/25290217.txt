Existing mines are enough for ~1 billion cars, however raw lithium is currently well under 1% of the cost of a new Tesla so vastly more expensive mining options don’t really effect the economics much.  The minimal amount of recycling would change dramatically as lithium prices increase.<p>PS: “battery grade” lithium is more expensive, but what changes isn’t the amount of lithium but removal of minor impurities.')
