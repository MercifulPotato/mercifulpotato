I was mostly talking about ppl without pre-conditions&#x2F;risks.\nIn your case I would do it too, And for your parent too (Mine has immunodeficiency so vaccine is out of the question).\nAfter I don&#x27;t have like big red flag and I think, for the majority it will be fine.\nI am just more comfortable to use vaccine from techniques previously used on other public vaccine widely distributed.\nI found the move a bit quick to jump on those new technologies, especially when we still could use the &quot;traditional&quot; way.\nI agree the data look ok, but the data sample are nearly nothing compare to the total population who will get it.\nGood data but not that representative.\nBut I would never say to someone to not take it.')
