With IPs being about $25 each that&#x27;s an acquisition cost of less than a dollar per user.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s 6.5 ports per person, you need one for each connection.<p>That&#x27;s not how connections work.  Each user could make a million connections as long as they&#x27;re spread around different servers.  The 65k limit applies to simultaneous connections to a <i>single</i> webserver.  Only the most-connected server matters, so probably something at google&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;facebook, and even then most of those servers have multiple IPs.')
