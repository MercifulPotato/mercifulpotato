The whole requirement to have a card on you is bogus bullshit, and only serves to make you a criminal if you happen to forget it.<p>If you drive the car of a person who has a suspended license, you will get pulled over. Their ALPR system will automatically flag you, and the officer will tell you that he ran your plates and pulled you over because the owner has a suspended license. That might be a good time to have a physical ID on you to prove you&#x27;re not the owner. BUT at the same time, if you know your DL number, or even your name and address, there&#x27;s no reason the cops can&#x27;t look you up to verify who you are.')
