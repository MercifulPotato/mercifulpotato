So they are cannibalizing their own search queries :) And for some loose interpretation of &quot;on&quot;, the results are indeed correct, those are dog videos &quot;on&quot; the rumble channel. As you mention, I don&#x27;t see why it should be a string site: filter, if they&#x27;re unhappy they can delete their Youtube channel.')
