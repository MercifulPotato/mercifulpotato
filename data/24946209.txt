I still see people doing far more interaction than necessary to accomplish certain tasks that have simple gestures available. And with force touch&#x2F;long press, that got even more complicated, as some gestures can trigger different behavior if you press too hard&#x2F;long (made more likely if your screen is cracked; I often accidentally go into the task switcher when I meant to go back in Safari).<p>All of that being said, while this is even less discoverable by far, it’s good that they’ve made it optional <i>and</i> arbitrarily configurable. Also a fairly unusual thing for Apple, though less so in the Cook era.')
