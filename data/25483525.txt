It seems that this is a skill that can be sharpened with deliberate practice.<p>I went to a 10 day silent meditation retreat (Vipasana) abs felt I got much more comfortable sitting by myself just observing my thoughts. The practice part was difficult, probably one of the hardest things I have ever done. 10 days of no talking&#x2F;reading&#x2F;writing, sitting in a room, observing your sensations, for hours on end, punctuated by 5 minute breaks. I felt the world temporarily go from HD to 4K after a couple of days.<p>Anyways, this really made me reconsider my relationship with thoughts.
