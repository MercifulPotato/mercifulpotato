It&#x27;s our mission to rescue these clothes from being sold to international distributors &#x2F; before they leave our shores, and sell them in thrift&#x2F;vintage bundles.<p>Our model is a bit unique. We purchase the same 100lb and 500lb bales the international distributors do. We have a team that processes the bales, categorizes the clothes, and then merch&#x2F;list them in a marketable and fun way on the site.<p>Textile waste is the 2nd largest polluter behind oil &amp; gas. If we can help create a culture of buying second-hand first, we think there&#x27;s a massive opportunity to put a dent in climate change.<p>We just got some of our first press yesterday. :) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.houstonchronicle.com&#x2F;techburger&#x2F;amp&#x2F;Houston-dressed-for-success-as-used-clothing-15770845.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.houstonchronicle.com&#x2F;techburger&#x2F;amp&#x2F;Houston-dres...</a><p>tl;dr WE WILL TAKE ALL YOUR CLOTHES. :)')
