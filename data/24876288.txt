In other words, build more than you need. The major reason to do this is so that when the wind is barely blowing and&#x2F;or it&#x27;s a cloudy day you still get enough power to supply your needs without peakers.</i><p>When there is zero wind and zero sun then it doesn&#x27;t matter how much over provisioning there is: your output will be zero.<p>I live in Ontario, Canada, where we do have wind and (some) solar in our energy mixture. Wind can go from 100 to 2900 MW, and solar from 0 to 350 MW.<p>Looking at the Supply tab (18-24 Oct), on Tues, Oct 20, at 05:00 we had 173MW of wind and zero solar (sunrise@07:48):<p>* <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ieso.ca&#x2F;power-data" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ieso.ca&#x2F;power-data</a><p>The amount that we would have had to to &quot;overprovision&quot; to get useful renewables would have been ridiculous. Luckily our 9,500MW of nuclear just chugs along filling our base load with &gt;4,000MW total available hydro helping, as well as some gas peakers.<p>If we built another 3000MW of nuclear then we could handle our base load with that, and hydro would be used for the variable portion of demand.<p>As someone who lives &lt;50km from a nuclear power plant [0] bring in more.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pickering_Nuclear_Generating_Station" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pickering_Nuclear_Generating_S...</a>')
