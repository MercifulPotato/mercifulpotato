They will also do this even if it means they will play short handed.<p>For example, if they are playing a series with Argentina, they will have players stay in Argentina through most of the series and not physically play in New Zealand till the end of the series. I always wondered how they quantified the benefit or if it was just a &quot;makes sense to do that&quot; style decision.')
