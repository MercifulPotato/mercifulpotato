When I was in the problem space about 15 years ago doing fleet management for a small private company the best reasonably cheap we could do was to use PCMiler (this was before pgRouting was popular) for the routing. However, managing multiple vehicles with constraints like time and vehicle weight&#x2F;size was a chore we managed using some extremely heuristic approaches with Excel (we ended up using Excel over some well defined software because it was cheap and malleable enough to evolve with our constantly changing requirements).<p>I&#x27;m aware of things like pgRouting but wondering if there is some basic FOSS software that does some rudimentary route assignment with multiple vehicles involved instead of leaving it up to the end user to batch destinations or vehicles before feeding them as batches into the routing engine. You can kind of get there yourself doing some basic clustering stuff, but again pretty manual. If I was doing it today at the same (small) scale my approach would probably be to create some drivetime polygons with my constraints around central areas and use to batch my stops before feeding them into pgRouting, but there&#x27;s probably some way more intelligent way of doing it.')
