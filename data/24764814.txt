You can disable someone with leg shots, it takes time as per your own evidence. Depending on how the armored perp is standing there may not be a gap. Then trying to hit such a small target with any kind of range will be very difficult for most. And you best believe if a SWAT officer had a lethal shot with an AR they wouldâ€™ve taken it. So what makes you think the unarmored opportunity presented itself prior to the it did moment?<p>Also why are you questioning police owning an APC but it civilians owning body armor, which is most definitely legal.')
