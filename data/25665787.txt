Why do we need to be so perfectly specific that the amount of fraud that does happen is less than .0001%?”<p>To be fair to the person your replying to I think that percentage you wrote is the crux of the whole thing. Quite large segments of the american population believe fraud &gt;&gt;0.0001% whereas other quite large segments share your view that it is ~0.0001%. And perhaps there is a segment that truly believes it is &lt;&lt;0.0001%.<p>Though I am unsure what the null hypothesis should be in this case it does seem that the probability of the reality being &gt;&gt;0.0001% is above zero.')
