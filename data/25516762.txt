I never owned Leica, but I love my X-Pro cameras. Rangefinders are so interesting to use and X-Pros give you variability - you can use optical rangefinder, mix of optical&#x2F;digital rangefinder with focus peaking, fully digital view finder or back screen, if desired. This gives you a lot of flexibility as different things works best for different lenses. Physically, camera is very nicely built and joy to handle, because all important settings can be set mechanically.')
