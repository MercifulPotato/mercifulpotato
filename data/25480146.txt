Item(by='tristor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608404722, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475490, text='I recently renovated two rooms in my house and took out the mid-grade carpet that the builders had put in and installed real hard wood flooring.  I wanted proper trim in the room and I hired a trim carpenter.  What I ended up with was pre-made trim from Home Depot and mitered corners.  I hired someone who claimed to be a carpenter, and charged a carpenters rate, expecting, at minimum, that the corners were coped rather than mitered.  I own a VERY nice sliding compound miter saw in my wood shop, and I could have very easily taken pre-made trim from the home store and mitered the corners myself, I hired someone who claimed to be an expert with the expectation of hand-coped corners, because that&#x27;s a skill I don&#x27;t have.<p>Just one of several instances where I found out that local carpenters weren&#x27;t real carpenters.  If you only know how to use power tools and have a pickup truck to get materials at the home store, you&#x27;re not a carpenter, you&#x27;re a handy-man.  A carpenter should be able to work wood by hand.  I aspire to gain those skills myself, and at some point I&#x27;ll probably re-do the sad work that was done previously.  At least they caulked and painted the caulk-line. At some point I plan to install crown moulding, but at this point I&#x27;ve decided I won&#x27;t do it until I can make it myself.')
