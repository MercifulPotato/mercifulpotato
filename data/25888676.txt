Tell them what you&#x27;re doing, and take their advice.<p>I cut the 10&#x27; hose in half, and promptly lost one of the halves. I set up the cut end so it was inches away from fitting into a bottle on the shelf, for dispensing.<p>Here&#x27;s a photo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;komodokamadoforum.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;8968-funky-old-cow&#x2F;?tab=comments#comment-106746" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;komodokamadoforum.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;8968-funky-old-cow&#x2F;?tab=...</a><p>After the obligatory lecture on medical grade argon versus what I was buying (no difference besides a title), the guy tried seven times to talk me up from a 20# tank (which they don&#x27;t always have) to a 40# tank (smallest standard size, same price to refill). I kept telling him I wanted to stay married. Then the tank ended up in the &quot;middle shed&quot; with the chamber vacuum sealer. When I went for a refill I reminded him of this hilarious conversation, and upgraded to a 40# tank that&#x27;s still going strong.')
