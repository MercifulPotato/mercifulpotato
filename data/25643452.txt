I discovered several zero-days, and with the help of a colleague, we have recently audited TinyTinyRSS uncovering multiple critical vulnerabilities.<p>At the moment, I&#x27;m building a new business (draft website: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digeex.de&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digeex.de&#x2F;</a>) and I&#x27;m looking for freelance projects until the company is up and running. I want to focus on web applications security only, for now, to improve this service before offering anything else related to security.<p>Email me at daniel (at) digeex.de to book a free appointment so we can discuss the details, and I&#x27;ll come back with the quotes for your project.')
