By processing a RAW image, you are manipulating the image in post (even if just for developing purposes only. No compositing&#x2F;editing.) If you never have to do any post processing, then there is very little chance of any &quot;shenanigans&quot; of compositing something into or out of the image. The image is exactly the way the camera saw it.')
