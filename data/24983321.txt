Possibilities include:<p><pre><code>   * Stripping out huge sections of the minified javascript code and moving it to be loaded later.\n   * Use emscripten to compile the javascript into webassembly, and publish that instead.\n   * Utilize browser caching APIs to improve repeat load times.\n   * Anything else you can recommend.\n</code></pre>\nWe a remote only team, working in the PST timezone.
