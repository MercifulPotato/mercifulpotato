I looked at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nelsontky&#x2F;gh-pages-url-shortener&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;src&#x2F;redirect.js" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nelsontky&#x2F;gh-pages-url-shortener&#x2F;blob&#x2F;mai...</a> and it is a basic script that does nothing more than redirection. A lot of URL shorteners on the web do a lot more. Premium ones can track users and route links based on client.<p>2. Most of URL shortening audience is non-technical and they usually like to pay and forget about it. Hosting and running your own service is an overhead.<p>3. Handling traffic at scale is challenging. So, if you have a lot of hits, I would not advise spending time maintaining the service.<p>4. Github can kill this anytime.<p>That said, this is neat solution for basic needs.')
