They range from simple, ad-hoc, to quite involved.<p>- A huge part of this work revolves around communication and testing: getting the right feedback and then analyzing it.<p>- In software, they should probably be directly talking to engineers and UI designers, to provide the right set of problems to solve. This is maybe a good way to cut off management hierarchies that understand neither (users and implementation).<p>[0] I&#x27;ve also seen the term &quot;Engineer&quot;, &quot;Architect&quot; and others associated with it, but from talking to a UX &quot;Architect&quot; from a large company, I found that the best description would be &quot;Designer&quot; or &quot;Director&quot;, because even though there are sometimes data-driven inputs their bread and butter seem to be very design, and communication focused. Maybe &quot;Analyst&quot; is a good term too.')
