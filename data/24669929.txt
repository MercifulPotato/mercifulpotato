The only roadblock has just been old energy and commodities decision makers being confused about the word bitcoin until they see revenue and sustainability graphs.<p>Other things just aren&#x27;t profitable and didnt satisfy anything for the energy provider.<p>And again, nobody is looking for other things just for the sake of proving that something else can use less energy <i>because there isn&#x27;t a problem</i>. Computers with no* emissions are reducing emissions and adding a use for energy that was not otherwise going to be used. It is literally the opposite of the story being peddled by pointing at the <i>amount</i> of power being used. This wasn&#x27;t available beforehand, it isn&#x27;t important to anyone if “unique” is too strong of a word or not.<p>*its annoying that I can perceive someone will argue that instead of the rest of the point.')
