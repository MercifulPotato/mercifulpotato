The reason why Pandas is such an ungodly mess is because it must be, in order to be even halfway efficient. When you do try to compose things, or even have the audacity to use a python lambda or an if statement or whatever, you suddenly suffer a 100x slowdown in performance.<p>Julia doesn&#x27;t have these problems, and I&#x27;ve found it <i>so</i> much nicer to use for data analysis.
