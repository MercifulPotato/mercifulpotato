I don&#x27;t live in US and never faced with US healthcare. I live in Montreal, and local healthcare is not impressive compared with the European counties I can compare. Most of my friends-immigrants had medical treatment in their home countries in Europe or India, mostly because of the wait times. Probably one would better compare with UK, FR, ES, not CA.')
