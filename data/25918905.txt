I have a serious dislike for both Trump and the pillow guy, and I have certainly said that Trump was not my president -- I didn&#x27;t vote for him, and I very much disagree with almost everything he and his followers stand for. Although I never posted it on Twitter.\nBut that&#x27;s a long way from advocating sedition, or claiming the election was a fraud. I think that political correctness can go too far, even when it supports my beliefs.')
