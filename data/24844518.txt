They&#x27;re joking but they still feel uncomfortable about a large corporation &quot;knowing&quot; so much about their life.<p>To your point, it&#x27;s probably a minority but I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s more than 10%. There&#x27;s a ton of stuff in the market (identity theft insurance, new VPNs cropping up, Apple&#x27;s privacy-focused <i>branding and marketing</i> efforts (I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re inherently better on privacy, they just are branding themselves as such)) pointing in that direction now.<p>Normals need to hear more stories of seemingly innocuous things like home movies resulting in identity theft. Maybe fear isn&#x27;t the best way to motivate people on principle, but it does work. Imagine how many &quot;security questions&quot; and other PII can be gleaned just by watching some family&#x27;s childhood home movies.')
