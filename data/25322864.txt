Item(by='mtlynch', descendants=None, kids=[25331156], score=None, time=1607254784, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322456, text='Thanks for reading!<p>&gt;<i>I like this post but “unscrupulous merchant” seems harsh for a company that may have changed their policies and didn’t realize they had to inform the referring agent of those changes.</i><p>Even giving them an extremely generous benefit of the doubt, I can&#x27;t think of a way to describe them as anything better than &quot;unscrupulous.&quot;<p>If it truly was an honest mistake that they forgot to tell affiliates they changed policies, their reaction upon finding out should have been, &quot;Oh wow! Thanks for telling us! We owe hundreds of people money, so we&#x27;d better review our transactions and pay everyone what they&#x27;re owed.&quot; But instead, they (as far as I know) only paid me and never informed any of the other affiliates.<p>Also bear in mind, that you can&#x27;t just &quot;forget&quot; to tell people that you changed the terms of your business relationship with them. If I hired hundreds of employees by advertising a $20&#x2F;hr wage, I can&#x27;t just privately decide that their pay is lower and secretly reduce their paychecks until one of them notices.')
