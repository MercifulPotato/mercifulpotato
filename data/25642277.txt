Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25642470], score=None, time=1609822849, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25633665, text='&gt; Sounds like the cart before the horse. Tell me I&#x27;m signing up for something that I have no idea how it will turn out, and then present me with a take it or leave it contract months later. And I&#x27;m stuck.<p>That&#x27;s not a reasonable position, since you&#x27;re basically asking for someone to predict the future for you (accurately, I hope).  Not knowing &quot;how it will turn out&quot; is life, for instance have you ever hired someone new with the <i>knowledge</i> of how they&#x27;ll perform over the next few years?  The answer is no, because it&#x27;s impossible.<p>You <i>never</i> know what a contract will be before you negotiate it, and you can <i>always</i> quit and work someplace else if you don&#x27;t like it.  Which is <i>exactly</i> what you probably have now, except your employer writes your contract unilaterally without your input or that of anyone like you.')
