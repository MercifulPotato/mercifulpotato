Face ID is fine when it works, and sucks when it doesn&#x27;t. And mask wearing has really accelerated it being much worse, and we&#x27;ll be wearing masks as a standard piece of dress for another two years I guess.<p>I do miss Touch ID, but that had its own problems (gloves, wet fingers). So one would hope there is a solution that has both. I&#x27;d personally be just peachy with a fingerprint sensor on the back just like the Pixel line used to have. I mean, how much is a fingerprint sensor manufacturing cost? $5?')
