But I have a bad feeling it will be decided in favor of Oracle, since considering specific APIs part of the &quot;idea&quot; rather than the expression seems to be more of a convention among software engineers rather than actually part of the law. APIs can be &quot;expressions&quot;, after all, it just depends on how literal or pedantic you want to be in your reading of the law. The real solution seems like it would be to update the outdated law.')
