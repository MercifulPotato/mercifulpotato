Item(by='prepend', descendants=None, kids=[25597189], score=None, time=1609447706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594898, text='I once worked with a developer on a relatively small team of 10 people or so (3 other devs) who said it was impossible and pointless to estimate effort for tasks.<p>He said that instead a task should be assigned to him and he will work on it until finished, checking in once a week to see if it’s done.<p>It was the weirdest thing so we explored it a bit in a planning session and followed his logic that if we had four devs does that mean we only assign 4 bugs a week? What do we tell the users who submitted the bugs? Especially the ones who were kind enough to (usually wrong) estimate if the bug was easy or hard.<p>After a few minutes philosophizing he changed his mind to provide rough estimates to help with planning sprints and stuff so we could at least try to complete multiple items even if we were off sometimes.<p>It was funny that he was just oblivious to why he was coding and didn’t care about users, funders, or other teams.<p>This isn’t specific to Jira, but we did use Jira, but it is part of some devs just not caring about anything but what they focus on.<p>This guy was probably 45 and had operated for like 20 years. But I guess never in an environment that had production dependencies.')
