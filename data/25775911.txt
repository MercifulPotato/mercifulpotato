Usually if there is so much disparity in power that the outcome is known beforehand it does not come to war.<p>US had declared Axis powers to be the enemy and then the enemy was defeated. Nobody questions that US was key to winning WWII. It seems impossible that soviets would hold if Nazi Germany was able to send all their resources to eastern front. Even with the help on the western front, soviets held <i>JUST BARELY</i>. And at key moment US troops landed in Italy forcing Hitler to divert his forces that were necessary to win battle of Kursk.<p>I don&#x27;t see how you can question that US won the war, it is a fact documented by representatives of states involved in the war signing their capitulation to US.')
