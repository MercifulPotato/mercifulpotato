The white balance is almost always way off, people have asked me how I got the sepia tone filter! I&#x27;ve also had issues with the microphone drivers distorting the sound (windows and linux). Maybe they&#x27;ve improved the hardware. I really like the narrow 60deg FOV of the unit compared to my higher end C615 (which has much better video quality).')
