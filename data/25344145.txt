Item(by='GordonS', descendants=None, kids=[25344398], score=None, time=1607428726, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25343966, text='&gt; In GraphQL we have one endpoint with two different queries. So the same problem can happen if someone queries naively. But, they can also write one nested query that says &quot;give me user for id X and for each video id, give me the video data&quot;. It will be one request from frontend to backend, but still multiple selects to the database, unless we use some &quot;smart&quot; GraphQL framework that does magic for us.<p>In reality, you&#x27;d more likely have an endpoint like `&#x2F;videos&#x2F;user&#x2F;12` or `&#x2F;users&#x2F;12&#x2F;videos`, which would provide all videos for a user, but we&#x27;ll put that aside for the sake of an example.<p>Hmm, so I think you&#x27;re saying that there would still be separate queries, but you&#x27;re &quot;batching&quot; them, such that client sends multiple queries simultaneously to the backend, and then the backend is responsible for executing them? With HTTP&#x2F;2 (which supports request multiplexing), you get a similar result using REST endpoints.<p>&gt; Yeah, seems you edited your post. When I read it, there was 100% a question-mark in it. ;)<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure if you&#x27;re kidding, but I assure you I didn&#x27;t edit my post.')
