The local guy living in a tin roofed house in a village in Indonesia, or the white guy that lives in Bali and flipped it for 6250% or so? The right thing to do would have maybe been help the guy access the market and take a commission, even a large one at 20-30%. Otherwise it&#x27;s just taking advantage of someone. I&#x27;d prefer to live in a world where &quot;good deals&quot; aren&#x27;t considered screwing over someone else.')
