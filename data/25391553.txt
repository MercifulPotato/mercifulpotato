You can experience it with VR headsets that have no base station, like Playstation VR.  They require re-calibration every 10-30 minutes or so.<p>I assume that the iPhone&#x2F;iPad is constantly re-calibrating user orientation using the camera and depth mapper.<p>I imagine two ways that Apple could make AirPods Max work with Apple TV:<p>1. Add a camera to the Apple TV.  Some people would be uncomfortable with this.<p>2. Add an orientation base station to the Apple TV and add receivers to the headphones.  This will increase weight, cost, and power consumption (battery weight).<p>It&#x27;s possible that Apple already added the sensors.  Has anyone done a teardown to look for orientation signal receiver chips?')
