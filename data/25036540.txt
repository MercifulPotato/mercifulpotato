Anyone that has ever eaten a garden grown anything can tell you that there is a lot missing in store produce.  These secondary metabolites are likely the missing link in my opinion.  We aren&#x27;t malnourished (with respect to most vitamins and minerals) in the western world but we do likely have drastically less of all the terpenoid, phenol, and alkaloid compounds that make vegetables &quot;healthy&quot;, to use a word you hate. To add insult to injury, vegetables and fruits low in secondary metabolites taste worse to us, so we eat even less of them than we should.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Secondary_metabolite#Plant_secondary_metabolites" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Secondary_metabolite#Plant_sec...</a>')
