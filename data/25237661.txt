To consumers, Amazon provides an excellent service.<p>(This is the point where everyone always kramers in with their personal beefs with Amazon)<p>Like many others, I use Amazon because it&#x27;s extremely useful, overall it&#x27;s simply a better experience than shopping at other places. I have nothing against small businesses, but when I shop, I don&#x27;t treat businesses like charities. If small businesses want my money, they have to actually present a better service. If they can&#x27;t do that, it doesn&#x27;t overly bother me that they go away.')
