These are consumer-ish workflows that benefit from linear algebra, but people want to do them on their laptops.<p>Hell, people are doing video editing on their PHONES these days, due to the convenience.<p>----------<p>Workstations and clusters are not affordable for the vast majority of users.<p>GPUs probably are affordable however. But these programs aren&#x27;t really operating on GPUs yet (I mean, Blender and some Video Editing programs are... but LTSpice &#x2F; Matlab are CPU-only still)')
