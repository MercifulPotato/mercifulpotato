I&#x27;m not happy with the apps available today for playing and organizing music&#x2F;audiobooks&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;etc. because they all focus on streaming and not folks like me who prefer to manage their own files. I was inspired to design my dream apps, and that&#x27;s exactly what I did. I call it half-baked because these are little more than screenshots, as I haven&#x27;t learned how to code iOS apps.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dillonbrown.me&#x2F;mobile-audio-ui.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dillonbrown.me&#x2F;mobile-audio-ui.html</a>')
