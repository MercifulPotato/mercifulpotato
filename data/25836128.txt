It&#x27;s often referred to as replacing the last mile to your home (i.e., your home router would talk 4G&#x2F;5G to the operator and create a WiFi in your home). Also, some &quot;small cell&quot; approaches use WiFi and only do the access management using the mobile network.<p>WiFi on the other hand doesn&#x27;t have any approaches for wide coverage, cell handover, or any kind of IoT applications.<p>I&#x27;d expect that smaller manufacturers emerge, especially for niche use cases outside consumer mass-markets.')
