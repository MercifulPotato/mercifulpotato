Technically it works like one: You post messages and they&#x27;re stored on the server and served up to everyone else at any point in the future. It&#x27;s perfect for coordinating big groups of strangers.<p>It has a good reputation for refusing to kick people off when governments demand it. Although accounts are tied to phone numbers it doesn&#x27;t show them by default and users can choose a unique username, so unlike WhatsApp or Signal it&#x27;s easy to recognize the pseudo anonymous identity of people you don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s much easier for many people to use than Twitter.<p>When running an opposition movement it doesn&#x27;t matter if there&#x27;s no encryption. Since you are open to the public your adversaries are going to be in your groups anyway. Another bonus is that most of your followers aren&#x27;t already using it, which makes them more free to act. If a different messenger is popular in your country you might not want to tie the long held account that everyone in real life knows you as to your freedom fighting activity.')
