It took 185 years to eradicate SmallPox (mostly from the WHO push of 20 years in the 60s&#x2F;70s). Vaccine manufactures are claiming 95% efficacy, but that&#x27;s honestly not a comforting number. It leaves lots of room and since Challenge trials are unethical (they shouldn&#x27;t be, but they are) we don&#x27;t know how accurate that number really is.<p>We still haven&#x27;t eradicated Polio. This virus may be with us for another 100 years honestly. The next generation will grow up with it and likely won&#x27;t be affected at all by it. Who knows, maybe the common cold Rhino and Coronaviruses killed millions in human pre-history and now they just give us the sniffles.')
