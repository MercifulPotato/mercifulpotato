Also remember there’s a lot of death not captured in that number of people who died at home &#x2F; were never tested &#x2F; etc that gets captured in the “excess mortality” stat.<p>In NY State and NYC in particular its closer to 30%.\nCounting total “excess mortality” in NYC is closer to 60% on the year.  Note that we’ve annualized here and ~90% of the death in NY took place in about an 8 week period, where the daily death ratepeaked closer to 500-1000% of normal for a week or two.  So yes, there was mass death.<p>There are many similar stories in areas of California, Italy, England, etc.')
