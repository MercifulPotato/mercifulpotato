I live in Georgia, and our winters are fairly mild compared to northern states. Even so, outdoor dining in the wintertime is very uncomfortable.<p>Winter is going to be very difficult for restaurants. If they don&#x27;t adapt to serving meals outdoors, they may not survive.<p>They&#x27;re going to have to change a lot to create a comfortable environment for patrons. Fire pits, heaters, warm dishes: soups, stews, ramen, pho, pastas. Warm drinks and heated cocktails. All of this while maintaining safe social distancing.<p>I&#x27;ve already seen a number of restaurants and bars make the attempt. It&#x27;s pretty ingenuitive.')
