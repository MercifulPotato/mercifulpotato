Central bankers generally refer to consumer inflation as the measure of inflation they target. It&#x27;s based on a basket of consumer goods. According to that definition we don&#x27;t have inflation. I tend to say consumer inflation in my comments to make it less ambiguous.<p>By that logic asset inflation can actually act as a deflationary force because the relative value of consumer goods shrinks compared to the rest of the economy and the surplus can be used to provide an excess of consumer goods which further drives down prices. Of course this assumes that asset holders are not planning on spending their capital gains domestically. Considering current demographics (the retired own houses but don&#x27;t spend as much) and globalization (Chinese workers can do your job) it is pretty much assured though.<p>Anyway. The reason why deflation is bad is highly obvious. Imagine a highly simplified economy consisting of one factory. Some initial event happened that caused demand to go down. The factory has trouble selling its inventory. It lowers its prices over time to attract more customers. People looking to buy the latest gadget just put it off because they can buy it later for even less money. At some point the factory has to close because nobody is buying. Then suddenly everyone wants a gadget but there is no factory.<p>If you want a business to operate in 2025 then it has to also operate in the years before that. Deflation sets up the exact opposite incentive. It makes sure everything you did in the past cannot be topped in the future without extreme effort. It means your best years are already behind you because there is less money to be made in 2021 than in 2020. It tends to reward hoarders, those who don&#x27;t need to be productive.<p>Inflation is the opposite. It makes sure that the future is always brighter than the past. There is more money to be made in 2021 than in 2020. It tends to reward workers, those who do productive work.<p>The answer to deflationary problems? Give people a reason to work.<p>It&#x27;s why we have so many &quot;gig economy&quot; companies. It&#x27;s nothing new. It&#x27;s just day labor with some software lipstick applied to it. There is an overabundance of unskilled workers so there must be some way to economically deploy that workforce even if its not enough for a full time position. \nConverting unskilled workers into skilled workers would be even better but it would mean the government or the employer has to foot the bill. It&#x27;s just not going to happen even though there is plenty of money around to fund education.')
