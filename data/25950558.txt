If it was a first amendment problem, gambling wouldn&#x27;t be illegal in most states.<p>Maybe you need explicit help to understand my position. If hedge funds can short&#x2F;long stocks, there should be nothing preventing a retail investor from doing the same.<p>As for it being speech, well, corporations are people and PAC&#x2F;SuperPAC political donations (read: blackbox donations) are speech. These are current USA facts.<p>From there, I extrapolate that it would be unfair to regulate Main Street instead of Wall Street. This wouldn&#x27;t be such a massive problem if Wall Street wasn&#x27;t allowed so much leverage (and short 140% of the company shares...how is that even legal. That&#x27;s literally fraud). I can&#x27;t sell you 100% of my property and then sell 40% to someone else.<p>It&#x27;s that simple, stop obstructing discourse.')
