Power uses problems for their own gain resulting in command economies and authoritarianism which are miserable compared to self-educated motivated individuals.<p>Because everyone can mess up, laws declaring no mess-ups are impossible. Might as well plan for the western sunrise or uphill running water.<p>What works? Respecting others. Leaving people alone. Problems fix themselves regardless of what powerful people do. Political arguments deserve the most cynicism. Violence with words by men in makeup who do very little and it&#x27;s all only for themselves.<p>If raising taxes hurts growth, lowering taxes helps growth. That&#x27;s a fallacy, but take that thought one step further. Bad people get a tax cut too. They horde or harm. Why does that mean we need more intervention and taxes? Federal governments can be corrupted just the same. Often all the same people just putting a cap on the next horrible war.')
