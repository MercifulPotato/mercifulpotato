We know from years of experience that C has plenty of footguns of it&#x27;s own, and fixing them is not possible without a fundamental redesign of the language. Therefore, the foundation of C++ is already rotten.<p>If that foundation were to be redesigned one&#x27;d have to get rid of the current near-100% compatibility with C, making the interop no longer an argument for using C++. Add the fact that most real-world C++ code will also be incompatible, and the strongest argument for using C++ is gone (namely, the impressive ecosystem size and maturity).<p>At that point there&#x27;d be no more justification for the existence of C++ over Rust (or another language that takes Rust&#x27;s good ideas and supersedes it).')
