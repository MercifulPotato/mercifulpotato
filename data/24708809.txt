Is there a generic vapor server that re-routes http requests to the hosts specified in the op-return? If so, what does that give you? If not, then the caller needs to submit this bitcoin transaction as a ... payload to some app-controled proxy that might inject some associated account information by querying a db then route the call to the right endpoint with that info in trusted headers or something?<p>I think I understand the concept as something like &quot;login with your bitcoin identity&quot; but I&#x27;m struggling to understand practically how what you&#x27;re envisioning is meant to work.<p>I actually think this could be made far more generic as &quot;login with public key identity&quot; for any crypto scheme, Ethereum or just about anything that is not mimblewimble and&#x2F;or hyper privacy focused should work similarly.')
