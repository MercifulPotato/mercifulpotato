Like if I were interviewing someone, and discussing salary was part of my role, and they named an expectation 2x what we were planning to pay, I&#x27;d ask them why.<p>Perhaps that&#x27;s the norm where they come from? Maybe they heard Google paid that much? Maybe they were just throwing out a high number to anchor high?<p>It&#x27;s funny to imagine the interview game being like the dating game teenagers talk about, where one wrong move, facial expression, or word uttered can wreck everything.')
