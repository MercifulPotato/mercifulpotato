Slow rollout.<p>Yeah, this alone is bad news.<p>Last year my parents got a two-dose shingles vaccine. The two doses are supposed to be separated by two to six months. My parents struggled to find their second doses in the window. Apparently there was limited supply and no one had the foresight to reserve second doses when people received their first, or even to prioritize second doses over first.<p>The covid vaccine will have much more demand and apparently a tighter window, and our health system isn&#x27;t exactly well-coordinated right now, so I anticipate a lot of people will be unable to get the second dose with the proper timing.')
