Coming from a photography background, we should distinguish <i>quantity</i> and <i>quality</i>.<p>Quantity of light you can make up with higher gain (ISO) and higher available dynamic range also helps, as you mentioned.<p>Quality of light is determined entirely outside the camera, and better gear does not help much if at all. For photography, the quality matters countless times more than quantity, usually. I would argue the same is true for video&#x2F;webcam.<p>This is what people don&#x27;t get, and so hobbyists end up with $5k in gear, taking terrible photos. It&#x27;s similar to when videographers don&#x27;t put effort into their sound.<p>This makes it a question of <i>how</i> and <i>what</i> to light, not <i>how much</i>. The latter would be a matter of adjusting gain in-camera, in Post-Processing, or simply turning existing lighting up. But the former part is the important, and difficult, one.')
