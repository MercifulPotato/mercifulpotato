Item(by='eternalban', descendants=None, kids=[25505474], score=None, time=1608635318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504276, text='&gt; One hypothetical case is a system that does a lot of complex in-memory reads and a few writes to persistent data structures. That kinda of system could be faster than the Java equivalent, out of the box, in Clojure.<p>Why would Java be slower in a read-mostly regime? Your hypothetical is not convincing. Btw, you mention &quot;real&quot; and then move on to &quot;hypothetical&quot; as an example.<p>Are there actually OSS &quot;production&quot; cases of this subset of systems where Java lags behind Clojure in performance?<p>&gt; When we say &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;slower&quot; it&#x27;s equally important to specify &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;slower&quot; when and where. It&#x27;s a complex question with no easy answer.<p>These sort of subtle distinctions only matter to langauge wars and debates like this. For actuals systems that need to do work and need to be maintained, we can in fact have metrics on efficiency.<p>That said, fundamentally, Java affords much greater facilities to &quot;optimize&quot; and approach white hot performance than Clojure.')
