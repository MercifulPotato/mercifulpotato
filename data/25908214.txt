The engine costs are MASSIVE. For planes like those a rebuild costs $50k, and the time between rebuilds is 1200 hrs.<p>That doesn&#x27;t include the amount of maintenance that goes into it between rebuilds either. I would imagine that $10-$20&#x2F;hr would be a reasonable estimate for those engines')
