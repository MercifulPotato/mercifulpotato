I&#x27;d pay to have those stores stocked. Ideally it would have a 90s-era movie theater in it, too. But otherwise it would be empty.<p>Remember that 90s kid movie &#x27;Blank Check?&#x27; I wrote a short fan art film script as a 13 year old that followed a similar premise, the origin of the funds were that the kid was a &#x27;hacker&#x27; so the kid stole the funds from a crooked stockbroker firm trying to launder their money and ended up taking so much he ended up living in an abandoned mall and &#x27;sold warez&#x27; out of the stores with various business models.. I recently saw the notebook and I had clearly recently just saw that movie with Angelina Jolie and Swordfish when I wrote that as that was around the time I had just discovered Newsgroups.<p>I somehow managed to get to the beginning of the 2nd act and just forgot about it entirely until the day I re-read it, haha. Which for being 13 was more resolve than I thought I had.')
