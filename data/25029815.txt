It&#x27;s so often not the focus of your attention when working as an individual contributor then when you take up a leadership role you have to learn fast before you do any serious damage.<p>My best general advice is honesty with your team, realise when you&#x27;ve screwed up and apologise. Also if you can&#x27;t honestly develop empathy for your team you should probably get out of leadership roles.')
