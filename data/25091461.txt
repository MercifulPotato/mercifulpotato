I was perfectly healthy 5 years ago though.<p>I assure you, it&#x27;s a lot more traumatic to actually experience the effects that I&#x27;ve just described over and over during 5 years than to read a single comment about it on HN. Whatever emotions my comment brings up can only help you. Creating something useful for society is very difficult and almost nobody is doing it these days.<p>Realizing this fact is a healthy, positive step forward even though it&#x27;s going to hurt a lot people&#x27;s feelings.')
