I&#x27;d also like to see studies that include other possible sources of discrimination&quot;<p>I&#x27;d love to see this based on culture and personality too.<p>I&#x27;ve been on teams that seem to look down on you if you live within your means and thus aren&#x27;t able to fully participate in discussing the latest gadgets, like people&#x27;s new Tesla&#x27;s and BMWs when you drive a no-frills work truck that doesn&#x27;t even have blue tooth. I actually had a manager tell me I need to discuss gadgets and sports more with my coworkers.  Even if I like gadgets, I like the lower cost and hands on stuff like setting up a Zoneminder server rather than installing a Ring.<p>I&#x27;m also a quiet person who tries to focus on work when at work. I speak up when I have ideas or can help out. Yet I&#x27;m constantly being told to speak up and form stronger relationships with my team. I feel we have a good working relationship. Why can&#x27;t I value them as a coworker and have them value me based on our work interaction?')
