You then send _the clone particle_ over a mean (like fiber optics, if its a photon). Please note that you send the actual cloned particle, not information about it. Think about a cloned Heisenberg cat. You have to send the actual box with the cat inside.<p>So now you have two copies of the same particle in two different locations.<p>Now the tricky (and useless part): you DESTROY the first box. Was the cat dead or alive before you destroy it?<p>If it was dead, you kill the cloned cat.\nIf it was alive, you let the cloned cat live.<p>So now, congratulations, you have teleported the cat just as it really was when you first cloned it.<p>Obviously this is a gross approximation, but the central idea is that quantum teleportation let you clone and transport a particle, but you have to find a way to capture it&#x27;s state and send it encoded in light or whatever method you prefer (fax?).<p>UPDATE: The cat belonged to Schr√∂dinger, actually.')
