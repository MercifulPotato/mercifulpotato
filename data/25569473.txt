Now, that seems ridiculous, but it’s very close to what’s going on when people try to “adjust” stock market valuations for the level of interest rates and use phrases like “fairly valued” and “attractive.” When both assets are at extreme valuations, this comparison, at best, says only that the dismal expected return on one asset is expected to exceed the really dismal expected return on the other asset.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hussmanfunds.com&#x2F;comment&#x2F;mc201220&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hussmanfunds.com&#x2F;comment&#x2F;mc201220&#x2F;</a>')
