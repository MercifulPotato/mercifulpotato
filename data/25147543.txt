The question is whether your HTML depends on your CSS, or the other way round - and that depends on what you&#x27;re doing.<p>Halfway down, it feels like we&#x27;ve somehow managed to recreate the OOP inheritance vs composition debate in our stylesheets (with @extend as an example of inheritance).<p>To me it depends on what you&#x27;re actually writing - if you&#x27;re making a reusable component for other people, say a custom DateTimePicker, then it&#x27;s much more important to be able to restyle the thing Zen Garden-style, than if you&#x27;re running the front page of your own organisation and want things to look exactly like your house style.')
