Bitcoin cuts out middlemen, like banks. The finance industry and banks are much larger energy consumers than the Bitcoin network. Comparing a world with Bitcoin versus a world without Bitcoin is an invalid comparison. If you&#x27;d like to compare energy consumption, do an analysis of companies that incorporate Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin versus business models that use traditional banks (and look at the energy consumption of those financial transactions).')
