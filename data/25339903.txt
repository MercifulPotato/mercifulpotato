That is not the answer and I don&#x27;t think is one of the &quot;obvious solutions&quot; referenced. Let me put it this way...<p>Should we allow a factory in Indiana to avoid environmental regulation if they just pay a 30% tariff? Is it ok to have a 5% mortality rate at a factory in Alabama if they pay a 60% tariff? Should U.S. companies be allowed to just pay fees to become exempt from FDA&#x2F;EPA&#x2F;OSHA&#x2F;etc. rules?<p>I know some will argue that it is the case in the U.S. A mining company can break the rules, kill a dozen workers, then pay a million dollar fine and go back to business as usual.<p>But we don&#x27;t investigate, we don&#x27;t fine, we don&#x27;t punish in any way foreign companies that don&#x27;t follow U.S. environment&#x2F;labor&#x2F;safety rules. We open the door and put their products on the shelf right next to U.S. products. The answer is not to levy a tariff to make them price-neutral. The answer is to ban them just like we should ban U.S.-made products that don&#x27;t follow the rules.<p>If a company can pass inspection and certify that they meet U.S. rules the same as U.S. manufacturers, and still have a price advantage, I say let them clobber U.S. competition. But the U.S. company gets regulator inspections as part of their taxes. Foreign companies have to pay for U.S.-recognized inspectors on their own dime.<p>Same thing for U.S. soy farmers selling into China or Norway. They should have to meet the standards of those countries and pay for the inspections that prove it.')
