I am a staunch believer in post-viral syndrome as I experienced it first hand following an Epstein-Barr infection (mono) but aside from a handful of researchers nobody cares at all. For most physicians, it isn&#x27;t even within the realm of possibilities when you come to them with random maladies. Boom, now you have anxiety because that&#x27;s what they tell you when they don&#x27;t know shit.<p>There are so many bodily issues that arose after my Epstein-Barr infection, it&#x27;s not funny at all. I can absolutely lead a normal life and am active and athletic.<p>But things like autoimmune issues, persistent 15-year brain fog (I&#x27;d rather call it frosted glass layer) which randomly clears once a month to remind me how nice it is to be able to think straight, or full-body-numbing attacks in the middle of a gas station. The first 5 years after the disease I regularly felt like passing out. Later I just got dizzy and learned to control it using water and temperature changes (cold water in back of your neck!).<p>I still took on the anxiety story and did something against it. It helped me in many ways but not with post-viral syndrome. It&#x27;s real and it sucks but it&#x27;s not being taken seriously at all.<p>I am afraid, some COVID survivors are in for a new life which is different in just the right (but minor) ways to drive you insane. Body just doesn&#x27;t feel the same as before.')
