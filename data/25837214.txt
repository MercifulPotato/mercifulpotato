On one hand, a malevolent political party could wield that power to their own advantage, and on the other hand political gridlock could neuter any real progress being made.<p>To address this, I&#x27;m imagining a new branch of government run via sortition. In this system, qualifying citizens would be selected by lottery, and would serve on a committee to oversee it&#x27;s proper execution.<p>This way, companies would have a vested interest in giving their users access to the truth, and an incentive to puncture the knowledge bubble that fosters extremism.')
