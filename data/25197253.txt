A PHEV would have been an improvement.<p>Its a chicken vs egg situation. If they had given me a PHEV, I would barely have been able to use the battery mode because of the lacking infrastructure and defective Lades√§ulen (charging stations) everywhere. However a few colleagues of mine have houses and garages, and for them it would have made a lot more sense. However all of us needed to cover long distances for client visits and thus, BEVs aside from Tesla LR models were totally out of the picture.')
