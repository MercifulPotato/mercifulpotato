I think that Go invested a tremendous amount of time into making their syntax simple and formattable. I don&#x27;t think that at, say, 10m LoC, a Go project is any more sane or performant than other languages, I just think the syntax and style of every file is probably more consistent.<p>Basically I think that Go makes it easy to open and read almost any file, regardless of what you know about the rest of the project. I think that&#x27;s great, but I also don&#x27;t really think that it prevents you from building bad software.')
