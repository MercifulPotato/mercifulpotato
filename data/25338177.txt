They simply require too many specialized and exotic parts.  VERY high maintenance demands per mile compared to shoes or automobiles, or even old automobiles.<p>A decent carpenter working with a decent blacksmith can produce and maintain a horse cart in a village with minimal external commerce; some iron ore imports would be nice, but can be worked around at great effort.<p>But composition rubber brake pads and steel cables to run the brakes and rubber pneumatic wheels and ball bearings everywhere will require at minimum a nationwide rail network.  Even the very concept of national or world standardized screw sizes is a very modern phenonomena.<p>Also a pretty solid argument for a lack of destinations.  For centuries if something was not sustainable with the population inside a walking radius, it would rapidly disappear.  Today I can ride to a big box store, a shopping mall, a library... there was nowhere to go for the vast majority of the population in, perhaps 1021 AD.  The next village over isn&#x27;t all that more exciting than mine.  Pre-pubescent kids seem to enjoy bicycle riding for no purpose other than the sensation of movement, although in 1021 AD a bicycle would be an unaffordable toy for a child.')
