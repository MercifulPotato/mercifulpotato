In my experience, the majority of places where math notation uses 1-based arrays are in applications where the index doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>I prefer zero based arrays specifically because they <i>are better</i> for doing mathematics.  Yeah, it sucks that a lot of matrix algorithms in text books use one based arrays, but I blame the text book for getting it wrong.')
