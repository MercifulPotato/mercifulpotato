Certainly, there are performance tips one needs to be aware of, but that is the case with python too. I have used python for relatively high-performance numerics for research work for the last decade, and now that I am exploring Julia, it certainly addresses all of the concerns I mentioned above with code which is at least as legible&#x2F;simple and much more introspective. It has its warts, but those warts are on the roadmap and I have seen significant improvement between v1.3 and v1.6 (e.g. compilation latency and debuggability).')
