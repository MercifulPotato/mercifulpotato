Tesla&#x27;s superchargers run at 50-250kW and discharging is going to be above 1MW at times, which is not kind to batteries.<p>I think you can expect quality grid storage setups to last 2000-3000 cycles at this time depending on their environment.<p>Keep in mind that these cycle lifetimes are to 80% life, so if you&#x27;re willing to go down to 50% capacity you can expect longer lifetimes, probably closing in on 15-20 years of use.')
