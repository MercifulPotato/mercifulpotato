When you can&#x27;t fully help, don&#x27;t just say no, give them some starting pointers and offer to review, or assist more if they get stuck, so even then you are still being supportive.<p>Help people to help themselves. Don&#x27;t just do something for them, guide them in how to do it themselves so next time they don&#x27;t even have to disturb you.<p>Listen out for opportunities to use your skills to help people when they don&#x27;t even realise they need help. I&#x27;ve lost count of the number off little scripts, tools or reports that I&#x27;ve knocked out in a couple of hours just because someone absent mindly moaned about something they found annoying. These things build your reputation far more than just plain helping, and if you&#x27;re observant they are often simple and quick to do.<p>But also, make time to progress your big goals too, which does mean you have to say no sometimes.<p>Get help in return from those you have helped to move your goals forward faster than you can on your own.')
