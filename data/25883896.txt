This may be good from a social standpoint as it opens up equality of opportunity but it is bad for science. The movement has silenced people who point out inevitable differences in observation. Women are different then men and giving them equal opportunities will yield unequal outcomes based simply off of actual biological differences in behavior and physical stature. Such censorship is bad for science.<p>I stated an observation between sexes that is completely obvious and avoided even entertaining the reasoning behind why such observations are true because I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re true. Yet it still hit your ideological nerve, no doubt due in big part to the tenets spread by ideological feminists. I support equality but not equality to the point where it denies reality.')
