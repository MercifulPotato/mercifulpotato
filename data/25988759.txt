Item(by='magicalhippo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612188337, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25988387, text='True, though that bottleneck would mostly be with the Pi itself. After all it only has GbE built-in, a single HD will easily saturate that for sequential loads or all loads for a SSD.<p>I have 8 disks hooked up to a Pi4 through USB3-SATA[1] with external 12V, works quite well in terms of reliability (had to turn on quirks mode[2] though). As I mentioned the main limitation is the single 1GbE interface, but this is just for archive data so.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aliexpress.com&#x2F;item&#x2F;4000001204302.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aliexpress.com&#x2F;item&#x2F;4000001204302.html</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;forums&#x2F;viewtopic.php?t=245931" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;forums&#x2F;viewtopic.php?t=245931</a>')
