The challenges are different.<p>Containers are just namespaced processes that share the same kernel as the host. A host has access to all container processes, uids, gids, file systems, and  networks. Cgroups are used to limit resource access.<p>To run containers securely you need to understand how to protect running processes. You need to use unprivileged users where possible, drop all kernel capabilities not required, run Linux Security Modules (AppArmor, SELinux) to prevent processes from doing things they shouldn’t; and, run containers based on the smallest image possible, since a container should only have files that are absolutely required to run a process, and nothing more.<p>Even when you do it all right, in a multi tenant environment, it’s not safe to run all containers on the same hosts.')
