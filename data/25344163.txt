Is there research showing that, when <i>the whole class</i> misses in person school, there&#x27;s appreciable damage done?<p>Allow me a counter example: My significant other was a war refugee and had severely disrupted schooling from the age of seven to about nine years of age.<p>Yet her generation had higher graduation and matriculation rates than their parents. Indeed, their achievement rates were in line with other countries in the region that didn&#x27;t experience war.<p>I&#x27;ll readily concede that, for children in an abusive home, less time at school is dangerous to their wellbeing. But the hand wringing about long term learning damage to all kids seems overwrought and unsupported by any evidence I&#x27;ve seen.<p>But I&#x27;m more interested in being informed than winning arguments on the internet, so if you can point me in the direction of studies, I&#x27;d much appreciate it.')
