You could explore new groups through the client as well.  I never found the web based Usenet mirrors comparable to a dedicated client.<p>Typically you synced the equivalent of headers and bodies separately (for the groups you were interested in).  This way you only grabbed what you wanted.  For binary groups, people settled on patterns in subjects, etc so that clients could automate downloading of files (binaries had to be encoded and split into parts due to post length limits).<p>On regular text type newsgroups you might set your client to download headers+bodies in one shot for offline mode.  With offline mode you would then just download what&#x27;s new vs your cache.  Then work against your local cache for reading&#x2F;replying.  Once online again, your batched replies could be sent.<p>If your ISP didn&#x27;t have the newsgroup you wanted, you would have to point to another NTTP server.  For a while there were public ones that anyone could use.  Over time, those public ones went away or dropped problematic areas like alt.binaries.*.  These days Usenet is available as a for-pay service.')
