Item(by='dwild', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604337261, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946039, text='&gt; counterfeit goods today.<p>counterfeit != stolen<p>At least counterfeited come with some kind of effort to produce the product in some similar manners. That come with it&#x27;s own issues, the quality of the product is a big one.<p>&gt; with BB I can return the item in a week if I don&#x27;t like it, claim warranty, etc.<p>Yeah, never got theses issues over media files luckily. You could argue that a rebate high enough justify not being able to return an item. I&#x27;m sure plenty of van guy could allow you to return it too ;). I bought a 1060 on Kijiji and the guy told me that he would replace the item if it wasn&#x27;t working. He got just as much incentive to do this than the van guy ;) hell maybe he even stole them, who knows.<p>&gt; Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve gotten better service from private tracker staff than any streaming service.<p>Sure, when that&#x27;s all you pay for, it&#x27;s easy to offer great service. Believe me, there&#x27;s a MUCH bigger part from Netflix price that go toward paying for content than from your private tracker. Not by choice... they need to pay for that content, someone has to pay for it.')
