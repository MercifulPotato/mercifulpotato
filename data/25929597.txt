It&#x27;s one thing to say that you don&#x27;t want to shelter your child; totally reasonable, kids <i>should</i> be exposed to a wide variety of experiences. But by definition kids lack experience, and if you expose them to a distorted image of reality, then unless you make an effort to point out that distortion, then they will rightfully conflate the distorted reality with reality.<p>To use your example as an analogy, most porn with any production value at all will show a drastically distorted depiction of what sex is actually like. To be raised on a diet of unrealistic porn will not leave you merely ill-prepared for an actual sexual relationship, but will actively disillusion you when reality fails to match your expectations.<p>If you let your kids use social media, then you need to take steps to emphasize the hyperprocessed fiction that it represents.')
