It seems that the gradual leakage solution <i>was</i> thought to require an additional assumption that violated semiclassical gravity, but this new result is consistent with semiclassical gravity. However, platz&#x27;s reply to my original comment makes a good point about the new work using a gravitational path integral, so I think I&#x27;ll take that as my answer for now.')
