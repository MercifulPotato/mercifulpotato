Best info I could find is that gmail does NOT support exact phrase matching , at all.  (ie in the search “cat dog” , the quotes are ignored , so “my cat my dog is green” is returned as a match , unfortunately)<p>This very much limits ediscovery flexibility and is unbelievable for a company that specializes in search')
