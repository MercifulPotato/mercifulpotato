I&#x27;ve been trying a Noodler&#x27;s Bulletproof Black which is a bit more water-resistant, and so far it&#x27;s okay - and the bottle was about the same price as a similar-sized bottle of Waterman. I want to see, however, whether I have any problems cleaning the pens (piston-fill) with the Noodler&#x27;s.')
