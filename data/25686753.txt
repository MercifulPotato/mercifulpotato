The expectation is to run these on RISC-V hardware (mostly emulators are used now due to limited hardware availability but that is not the end goal).<p>* Technically it may be possible to run RISC-V on Intel&#x2F;AMD CPUs by modifying the microcode but not that much is known about what exactly the microcode does and it will likely not be very performant.')
