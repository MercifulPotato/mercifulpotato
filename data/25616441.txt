It certainly helped that I had an okay Twitter following at the time (I think around 1k), but it doesn&#x27;t need to be huge. You just need the right person to retweet you.<p>That was enough to iterate on until I had an MVP.<p>Then my Show HN [1] sent like 15k visitors in a day and that led to a ton of usage. I think something like 4k projects were created that day. I wasn&#x27;t yet charging at the point, but probably for the best, since high usage meant a lot of feedback.<p>A few months later I launched on Product Hunt and that went well [2]. Beyond that, just improving the product every day, sharing my progress on Twitter, and trying really hard to turn every new feature into an exciting launch event.<p>I also started a React hooks blog [3] that sends me a handful of customers every month. I could probably do a better job of promoting Divjoy on there.<p>Haven&#x27;t delved into SEO (barely rank for anything), content marketing, paid advertising, etc, so it&#x27;s still very much a learning process for me.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gabe_ragland&#x2F;status&#x2F;1108875975494795265" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gabe_ragland&#x2F;status&#x2F;1108875975494795265</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20688044" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20688044</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;divjoy-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;divjoy-4</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usehooks.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usehooks.com</a>')
