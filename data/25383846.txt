Apple will end up earning most of the revenue.<p>The strategic disadvantage is that as windows users move to M1 based macs, sales of PC hardware will drop, since the PC ecosystem is hobbled by a lack of deep integration, lower performance CPU&#x27;s, lower profit margins, less R&amp;D, etc.   If volumes of sales drop too, it could trigger a cascade effect (fewer sales causes less R&amp;D causes less desirable products causes fewer sales).  That could kill consumer PC&#x27;s entirely, which would be very bad for the future of Windows.')
