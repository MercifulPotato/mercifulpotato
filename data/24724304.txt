If I were to take the TOC from another book. Copy only the TOC, write all the chapters and sub-chapters without having even read the other book (only the TOC).<p>Suppose then, than I publish the book explicitly as a replacement for the other book. Not as in &quot;this is the same&quot; but as in &quot;if you find a reference to a chapter in the other book, you can also just look here&quot;. Would that be copyright infringement?<p>What happens if I do this to a technical document (think a 3gppp spec) where the TOC runs for 10 pages for a 300 page document, with headings nested 5 deep?')
