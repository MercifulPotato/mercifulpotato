This would suggest that Maven is pretty close to perfect: the game just isn&#x27;t that deep, and the randomness of the tiles drawn dominates any small performance gain.<p>For human players a large part of the game is in knowing the word list: even world champions spend hours poring over different permutations of that, which a computer can access instantly. The strategic part of the game seems interesting, but can be almost completely accounted for with some simple heuristics and the knowledge of which tiles remain.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0004370201001667" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S000437020...</a>')
