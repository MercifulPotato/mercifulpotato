I do maintain lots of projects with both, and cmake is always the second citizen, for msvc users only.<p>Serious users use autotools (with mingw), but the occasional windows noob cannot be helped. So he gets his limited cmake experience. Cmake usually only does a tenth of the autotools probes, edge cases will never be detected and worked around. Such as broken compiler versions, as with gcc or icc frequently.\nCmake is a visual basic like hack, but Visual Basic at least had a proper design. Just lacked the library infrastructure.<p>Everybody uses autotools, show me a cmake-based distro.<p>All this autotools bashing is hilarious. Probing is costly yes, but you only do it once, and you rarely do it by yourself. Distro packagers do that for you.')
