But I had not seen the Hartman paper[1].<p>What I found most interesting about the Quanta article is the discussion about how to measure time at these scales. And just recently there was this article on zeptoseconds[2].<p>I can&#x27;t help but think something amazing is going to come out of all this work. It may be a parlor trick but it is going to be a really cool parlor trick.<p>[1] <i>Tunneling of a Wave Packet</i> -- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.do&#x2F;10.1063&#x2F;1.1702424" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.do&#x2F;10.1063&#x2F;1.1702424</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scitechdaily.com&#x2F;zeptoseconds-new-world-record-in-short-time-measurement-as-physicists-track-the-propagation-of-light-in-a-molecule&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scitechdaily.com&#x2F;zeptoseconds-new-world-record-in-sh...</a>')
