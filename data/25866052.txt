The Rijksmusem is actually the national museum, Rijk is another word for State or maybe closer to empire. It&#x27;s entire collection is the heritage of the Dutch state. So in this case it&#x27;s not a bad argument to make that it shouldn&#x27;t be hidden in a basement but shared with the public. Although since the nineties the Rijks is officially an independent foundation.')
