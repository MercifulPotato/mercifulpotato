To say charge a powerbank&#x2F;phone? I have a crappy bike (no gears, tons of rust) and I have a bad habit of going as fast as it lets me good. However I honestly don&#x27;t really want to go faster than 15mph or so b&#x2F;c it&#x27;s generally unsafe. The problem is I have some mental block of making myself go slower. I guess I enjoy the workout. So I want to put in a resistance in somehow that I can crank up to make myself go slower. Does anyone have an ideas?<p>The generators I&#x27;ve found online seem kinda whimpy and just slide on the exterior of the tire&#x2F;rim. Is there is something more hardcore I can put on the chain or something?')
