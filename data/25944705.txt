That&#x27;s like subscribing to the Washington Post because you like the navel oranges that Amazon Fresh delivers.<p>You&#x27;re not getting it. Musk is running Tesla as a tech company, NOT a &quot;car&quot; company. That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s been able to build the company through years and years of unprofitability, as Bezos did with Amazon.<p>You&#x27;re also not understanding the stock market (which is timely). Once that stock is sold to the market, the stock price only affects people&#x27;s bonuses. It doesn&#x27;t have any impact on the company&#x27;s production or revenue.<p>People buy (or sell) stock based on whether they think the price is going to go up or down. It&#x27;s that simple. Tesla doesn&#x27;t pay a dividend, and doesn&#x27;t confer any meaningful voting rights (as Musk has secured a supermajority). There is LITERALLY no other reason to hold Tesla stock than to think it will go up. There&#x27;s no other value to it.<p>Why would it go up? Because of good press. Good press comes from a lot of events. The company doing well, financially, is great news! But rockets and satellites are just as good, if not better, than reports of high-quality automobiles.<p>There&#x27;s a very, very thin relationship between non-voting, non-dividend-paying stock, and a company&#x27;s fundamentals. It&#x27;s mostly a shared illusion that it&#x27;s based on financials which makes the stock market work at all.')
