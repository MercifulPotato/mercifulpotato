Item(by='ornornor', descendants=None, kids=[25323073, 25322733], score=None, time=1607250015, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322493, text='I live in Switzerland. A lot of stuff is paid cash at the store, with a debit card, or as a bill that you receive at home later. There is no credit card involved in the transaction.<p>I&#x27;ve also tried charging back on my Swiss card once... What a mission. I was treated the same way any other store treats me: download this PDF, print it out, fill it in (5 pages), send it in the <i>mail</i>, wait 3 weeks, never hear back.<p>Compared to my North American cards: one phone call and the dispute is open. Wait a month and get the credit. End of story.<p>Or for cell phone issues in NA: try calling once, get nowhere, tell the regulator with time of call and name of the person, a week later get a call from the &quot;VIP&quot; service at the telco who will basically give me whatever I want to make the complaint go away.<p>There are no regulators with that kind of power that I know of here. All of the &quot;regulators&quot; have no teeth, and so the businesses don&#x27;t fear them.')
