Isn&#x27;t that going to be counterproductive in the long run?<p>Actually, consensus is forming around the opposite, here!  Small children are almost never strong enough to shoot with proper form on a 10&#x27; hoop.  If you give them an 8&#x27; hoop, they can begin practicing with proper form earlier, which is a more important factor in consistent shooting than having to adjust to a higher hoop later.<p>e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ak-static.cms.nba.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;79&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;7-8_Rules_and_Standards.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ak-static.cms.nba.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;79&#x2F;20...</a>')
