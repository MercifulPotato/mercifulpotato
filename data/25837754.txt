Item(by='chme', descendants=None, kids=[25837806], score=None, time=1611084863, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837276, text='&gt; Yep: the community is built around the upstream project, and has a lot invested in their continued existence as an open source entity.<p>Ok, that was what I meant with &#x27;upstream can reuse use the project name, infrastructure, etc.&#x27;. Probably a very big &#x27;etc.&#x27; here.<p>So your point is more about that the contributors and the community helped build the brand and recognition of ElasticSearch, which is now, taken away from them.<p>That is a fair critique, IMO.<p>However, that Elastic as upstream of the project suddenly disappears for the community, I find is something, that unfortunately, many open source projects have to go through sooner or later.')
