I think &quot;killed&quot; is often a fair description, especially when the &quot;replacement&quot; is an altogether different program (such as in the case of Google Cloud Connect, which Google Drive didn&#x27;t suitably replace.)<p>Yes, Google is not a public utility... but users&#x27; willingness to adopt new services is not a free, renewable resource, either.  Some of us get tired of embracing new tools only for them to be ripped out of our hands by their maker, after we&#x27;ve made them an integral part of our workflow.  I&#x27;ve become more of a laggard due to Google&#x27;s and other companies&#x27; actions in this area.')
