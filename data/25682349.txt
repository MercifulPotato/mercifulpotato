Who also gets respect from people way smarter than myself. That’s always a signal I look for when I’m in out of my scope.<p>I hope this project works out for you. Always so much BS on the people side in OSS, something I learned the hard-way long ago. But talent is talent, work speaks for itself, etc.<p>You’ve certainly chosen a general enough topic&#x2F;niche to draw lots of generic opinions and the whole peanut gallery stuff. So I predict this road will require quite of bit of blinders to operate without the constant distractions from the non contributing opinionated mediocrity. The only way to stay productive in such an environment IMO.')
