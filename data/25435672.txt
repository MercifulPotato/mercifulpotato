That leaves two hardware configurations, each available with Manjaro or KDE pre-loaded.<p>It looks like the Manjaro version may only be available in the EU, so that might simplify your decision.<p>The PinePhone is awesome--I love my Braveheart edition--but you should probably have a decent understanding of Linux and&#x2F;or embedded systems (at least replacing an Android bootloader) in order to appreciate it at this point. If your goal is to learn then it certainly could be fun, although you might want to supplement with something a little more beginner friendly like a Raspberry Pi or a laptop&#x2F;desktop you can boot from USB. Personally I would only advise someone to purchase a PinePhone now if they&#x27;re totally comfortable replacing the OS, in which case the edition it ships with doesn&#x27;t really matter (other than the branding).')
