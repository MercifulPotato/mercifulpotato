They have some advantages (mostly convenience of bundling) and some disadvantages (reliability&#x2F;compatibility, and functionality). One of the disadvantages is that they’re much more likely to simply not load—fonts are supposed to be optional, and most browsers have a “don’t use the fonts the web page specifies, use my own set of fonts” setting. And the other <i>huge</i> disadvantage is that you’re mostly limited to monochrome icons (styleable multi-coloured text support in the one file is somewhere between non-existent and patchy, can’t remember exactly where). Overall, I’d consider one of the inline SVG variants to be the gold standard in terms of <i>functionality</i> and <i>compatibility</i>, though optimal developer ergonomics require some sort of build tool.')
