I’ve never found one single project that fulfils everything I’m looking for, so am currently dividing what time I have between two:<p>- A website about video games that I love to work on - but which has a niche audience and is ultimately quite frivolous.<p>- A programming language implementation which could provide significant value to its future users - but building it is frustrating and not always interesting.<p>There is some crossover of skills and knowledge between the two projects, but at the moment they’re both progressing very slowly.<p>I’m also losing time to analysis paralysis - should I stop working on one of them? Which one? (Might I find a purpose in games, or a passion for languages?) Or should I carry on trying to progress both?')
