Can it be cheaper?<p>We shipped an application recently where groups of users use hardware keys to unlock sensitive information.<p>We were able to use FortifyApp  (from PeculiarVentures) in conjunction with &quot;regular&quot; Yubikeys acting in PIV (smart card) mode. We seriously considered the YubiHSM instead with different shim software but it was really quite expensive when you need 1 per operator.<p>The other thing which would be a &quot;must&quot; for commercial uses (I think, anyway) would be supporting standard PKCS11 APIs. The API is... not that great, but it&#x27;s the only thing that saves you from rewrites every hardware generation.<p>Would that be on the roadmap?  If not, what&#x27;s the interface between host(s) &amp; hsm?')
