Ultimately, the only way we can judge our actions is by their consequences. If I&#x27;m a middle-class person, giving another middle-class person extra cash won&#x27;t benefit them much more than it hurts me. If I&#x27;m wealthy, the situation changes; I need each dollar substantially less than other people do.<p>But frankly, I&#x27;m not interested in moralizing individual&#x27;s actions at all. I&#x27;m not interested in going &quot;oh Jeff Bezos is a BAD PERSON for X Y and Z.&quot; I think that&#x27;s silly. I want to use the legislative system to raise is taxes and put his money to better ends whether he likes it or not. Whether Jeff Bezos is &quot;good&quot; is entirely irrelevant.')
