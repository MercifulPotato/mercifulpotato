For composing I would suggest people also look into cropping the photos before sharing them to get to the golden ratio or rule of thirds.   It&#x27;s usually a really quick and simple edit to make and it makes a huge difference.\nI would also add a third useful concept: find ways to hold the camera still when taking the photo.  This can be by using a delay timer, or use the volume button instead of the on screen button, or just holding the phone differently.')
