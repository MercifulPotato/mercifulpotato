For me it was always pretty snappy, including refactoring actions.<p>OTOH I&#x27;ve hardly ever used or installed Resharper (or Rider).  When I did try Resharper, I found Visual Studio was dog slow, very much like what you described, and it provided me with very little benefit compared to what I already had in VS.')
