Kind of sauna effect limited to the upper torso and the insides of the throat&#x2F;lungs (potatoes also contain some natural biologically active substances, antibiotics, etc., including even ethanol and some toxins, so may be that had some effect too). Of course starting upper teenager years it became just sauna with hot tea (on couple occasions 2-3 hours in hot sauna (&quot;banya&quot;) got me back from flu like condition of around 39 C degree body temp back to normal by the end of the day) and in the latter years  some ethanol (drinking, not inhaling :) was added into the mix too.<p>Note: IANAD, all of the above is just anecdotes from personal experience, don&#x27;t try at home, etc. Even Russian Internet is  full of recommendations where hot boiled water isn&#x27;t removed from the pot before the inhalation - that is a different approach and carries major risks of getting burned and whatever else. Sauna (especially with alcohol) carries its own bunch of risks too.')
