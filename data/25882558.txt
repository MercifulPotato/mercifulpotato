It&#x27;s a clipboard history &#x2F; snippet &#x2F; text expander tool which runs both on Mac and Windows. I&#x27;m quite aware that there are a lot of similar tools available but none of them suited for my purpose so I decided to create one for myself. Hopefully it will be useful for others too.<p>Any kind of feedback is welcome. Thanks.')
