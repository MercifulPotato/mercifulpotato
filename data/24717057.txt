Some people were definitely bad at academics (by choice sometimes), but good at various extracurriculars. There were definitely &quot;jocks&quot; who excelled at sports or music or debates, and were in danger of being kicked out because of grades. Some of the &quot;jocks&quot; had bad social skills, a lot of the &quot;nerds&quot; had excellent social skills.<p>But people were absolutely not excluded from friendships because of what activities they participated in. I saw all sorts of friendships, because people just liked people. There was bullying, but it happened for other reasons.')
