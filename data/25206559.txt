Why spend 1000s on a small apartment in the city all alone when you could ride out the pandemic at your parents&#x27; in a large suburban home?<p>Maybe some people with families already may choose to stay in their new suburb. But young people will come back. Why? Because a large city is one of the best places to look for a partner. Or put more succinctly, people want to fuck. It might take a while for more young people to flood in, and in the meantime rent prices might dip, but I&#x27;m confident people will want to keep fucking in the future. So as long as that&#x27;s there, I think cities will recover :)')
