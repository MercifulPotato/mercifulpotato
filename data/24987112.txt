I have a Versalink with huge useless OS that takes forever to boot and errors that require multiple reboot to &#x27;fix&#x27;. Guy on the phone said it was because of drivers on client machines (what sort of crap printer crashes when there is a wrong driver installed?) but evrn with his updated version it hasn&#x27;t fully gone away.
