Despite, this his <i>&quot;Parerga and Paralipomena&quot;</i>[0] provides a very accessible glimpse into his ideas and the person (it has been translated into other languages too).<p>Reading him (oddly) has also made Kant more accessible to me (something I thought I had given up trying to understand). While I don&#x27;t agree with every single thing Schopenhauer said (he is a raging critic of Hegel &amp; Fichte - probably anyone that he didn&#x27;t agree with lol) his ideas remain worth looking at. A shame he doesn&#x27;t get more recognition in the non German speaking world. (maybe some people here into philosophy know why he hasn&#x27;t gained more traction (especially for Parerga and Paralipomena)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parerga_and_Paralipomena" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parerga_and_Paralipomena</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;search.php?query=Parerga%20und%20Paralipomena" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;search.php?query=Parerga%20und%20Paralip...</a>')
