It demonstrate that performant Swift code is possible, but with a lot of profiling. I initially choose to use Swift in hope of better performance characteristics than Python (for some pretty heavy data preprocessing prior feeding to neural nets), but at the end, writing some simple code still 2~3x slower than in C &#x2F; C++ if not more.<p>Hopefully at some point when Swift matures, people can start to optimize the generated code more.')
