Something most other countries in Europe didn&#x27;t get the option to do.<p>It also has some negative sides as well.<p>In general I would say having more parties, would help a lot. If your social circle is full of people who have slightly different parties switching party is a lot easier.<p>In the US the most important system is the get away from First Past the Post single election for congress and presidency. Remove primaries, use either larger districts with representative representation of some kind, or smaller districts with ranged&#x2F;score&#x2F;star voting. Ban the president primary and have people use range&#x2F;score&#x2F;star voting to select an actually popular president. This I think would eventually destroy the two party system in the US.')
