In some places if your permit expires you are now a criminal and breaking the law, which may put your ability to own any firerms at risk, so staying in compliance is a huge deal.  Also, lapses in permits may submit you to a whole new round of scrutiny when you reapply.  Often, the fees we pay for these permits are meant to fund the work to issue them.  It isn&#x27;t uncommon for those fees to get diverted elsewhere, so now we paid for services we aren&#x27;t receiving.  These things have happened to firearms owners so we are hypersensitized to these issues.')
