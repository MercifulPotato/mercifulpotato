There’s no “catastophizing” here.  These are all, well-documented, uncontested facts.  Most are documented by multiple videos of him, and members of his administration speaking about them.  There are dozens of other examples of this behavior, also all well-documented.<p>Fortunately, it looks like he failed, and will soon be a former president.')
