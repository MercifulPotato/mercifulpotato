There&#x27;s the Dell that sells the cheapest equipment you can buy. This Dell sucks as much as anyone else. Don&#x27;t expect miracles. Then there&#x27;s the Dell that sells upscale gear. This is usually pretty good, or at least has the ability to be pretty good. I have appreciated the ready access to service manuals and such, too.<p>I say this because it&#x27;s unwise to hear that Dell has pretty good gear, then go to their site and buy the cheap stuff. It isn&#x27;t necessarily any worse cheap stuff than anybody else, but it&#x27;s not what people mean when they say Dell can have pretty good gear.')
