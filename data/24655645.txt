The mirror pair of pins in the connector are not connected to anything.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:USB_Type-C_plug_pinout.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:USB_Type-C_plug_pino...</a> (Note the empty pair of pins on the bottom-center, right below &quot;D-&quot; and &quot;D+&quot;.)<p>USB-C receptacles have the two locations this pair could end up in cross-wired, so that an electrical connection is made whether the cable is plugged in with the data pair on the top side or on the bottom.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:USB_Type-C_Receptacle_Pinout.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:USB_Type-C_Receptacl...</a> (Note how &quot;D-&quot; and &quot;D+&quot; are mirrored top-center and bottom-center.)<p>This is more complicated than previous versions of USB, where there was exactly one pin that could be connected to D+ and one that could be connected to D-. If a manufacturer designed a USB-C device like this, with only one of two possible data pairs connected, then the cable will only work when plugged in &quot;data-conductor side up&quot;. When plugged in &quot;data-conductor side down&quot;, the D+ and D- conductors will be in unconnected pins in the receptable, and the unconnected pins in the cable will be in the receptacle&#x27;s connected pins.<p>If this is actually what happened in your car, and you&#x27;re the adventurous sort, you could possibly fix this by soldering two &quot;bodge wires&quot; to your minivan&#x27;s USB port, one shorting the two D+ pins together, and the other shorting the two D- pins together.')
