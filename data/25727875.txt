(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curry-lang.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curry-lang.org&#x2F;</a>)<p>Sounds a lot like Haskell with Prolog...<p>“ Curry is a declarative multi-paradigm programming language which combines in a seamless way features from functional programming (nested expressions, higher-order functions, strong typing, lazy evaluation) and logic programming (non-determinism, built-in search, free variables, partial data structures). Compared to the single programming paradigms, Curry provides additional features, like optimal evaluation for logic-oriented computations and flexible, non-deterministic pattern matching with user-defined functions.”')
