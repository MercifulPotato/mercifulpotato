You might be right about Calendar, because there is nothing in the world that a Googler or anyone else hates more than Oracle Calendar.<p>My overarching view on Google&#x27;s evolution is that their real product is dirt-cheap computing facilities, and their products are often just a way to exploit that capacity. Part of Gmail&#x27;s genesis was an abundance of underutilized hard drives. YouTube was acquired because they already had the networking in place to operate it. Inbox Smart Reply was a way to use a novel and cheap ML inference device to launch a feature that nobody else could afford. In all these cases the infrastructure existed first and the products emerged to fill them.')
