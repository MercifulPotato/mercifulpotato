An engineering interview has a non-neglible amount of randomness. Maybe you get a grumpy interviewer or a noob interview, or your brain freezes over.<p>When you are considering hiring a nobody, this is acceptable. You will interview multiple people, and they will interview at multiple places, so the randomness isn&#x27;t that important.<p>But if you want to hire one specific guy as a strategic hire, suddenly the randomness may no longer be acceptable.')
