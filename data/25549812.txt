UV&#x2F;Vis spectroscopy is a rather unspecific method, many things can absorb the same wavelengths. You need to have a very good idea of what is in your sample to be sure that you&#x27;re measuring the right thing.<p>In this case there are two things that absorb at the same wavelength, the vaccine and the polysorbate. The proper reference measurement would be all components except the vaccine, which you then compare to the full vaccine. It reads a bit like the used water or another buffer as blank here, which is really inexcusable.')
