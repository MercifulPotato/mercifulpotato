P5.<p>&quot;My original reflex hammer from medical school was simply a round rubber ball about the diameter of a nickel, mounted on a handle. This illustrates the point that any hammer is satisfactory if the examiner knows where to strike the tendon. I have even used the diaphragm of a Sprague stethoscope, and a former resident, a Vanderbuilt graduate, used her knuckle. Some physicians use the tips of their fingers, a tool that is always available.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think a citation is really necessary in this case. You&#x27;re tapping a tendon. That&#x27;s all. You don&#x27;t need special equipment. I wouldn&#x27;t make the same argument for a stethoscope.<p>But if you want, Sapira is a really fun textbook. It&#x27;s even a fun read for a layperson.')
