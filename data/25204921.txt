At the moment I have a few other things open, PDF viewer, Word, iTerms, Emacs etc, but nothing huge.<p>Most of the time this level of usage is ok, but I&#x27;ve had times where I&#x27;ve had to wait 30+ seconds for the UI to respond at all (even the Dock or switching workspaces) and wondered if the system had crashed.<p>For that reason I&#x27;m generally waiting for the next 32GB model before committing, that&#x27;s assuming I stick with Apple instead of switching back to Linux (which I used for ~20 years before trying the MBP).')
