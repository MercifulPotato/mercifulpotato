I&quot;m quite passionate about any job so it hurts my mental state to having to fight BS while spending the day busy doing unchallenging work. I&#x27;m looking for advise on how you came across dealing with being in bad jobs especially with covid. Also interested to know if you are currently facing the same issue and how you are tackling it.<p>I do recognize there are obviously some underlying issues at play here, I do feel like I&#x27;m unable to make a change in life in general sometimes.<p>Here are some thoughts I have,<p>1. Keep going at the current job and keep looking on the side.<p>Problem I have here is I don&#x27;t want to place too much mental pressure on doing well at the job and committing to interviews and job searching. So this mean I likely continue to show a lack of commitment regarding to studying interviews&#x2F;applying, making finding a good job a very long process<p>2. Leave the job, take time off to focus on new opportunities&#x2F;learning&#x2F;covid break.<p>I don&#x27;t have an issue with supporting myself for many years. I took a lot of risks when i was younger however now I&#x27;m now in my 30s, more cautious, and do fear unstability and judgement. So I do not know if I have a good enough reason to do this. Specifically I haven&#x27;t been showing consistency in focusing on studying&#x2F;job. Also I&#x27;m concerned if i can use all my free time effectively, If covid didn&#x27;t exists, it would be easier to find more purposeful things to do part time while job searching (volunteering, working on friendships&#x2F;relationships)<p>3. Do nothing, practice Stoicism<p>I think this is what I&#x27;m doing most of the weeks, trying ignoring the BS issues&#x2F;people, focus on day to day tasks, staying focused on getting through isolation and letting time pass. However I know the job situation  won&#x27;t get better on its own for the next year at least.<p>Thanks,')
