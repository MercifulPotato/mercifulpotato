Basically, we were doing a lot of &quot;spurious&quot; re-builds of crates, because we were changing flags between compilations, and with some creativity, we didn&#x27;t actually need to do that. If you&#x27;re not building a bunch of things multiple different times in slightly different ways, it&#x27;s not relevant.<p>I will say that I recently discovered that putting a bunch of crates into a workspace is inherently slower than compiling them all separately, which is pretty surprising. I haven&#x27;t dug into the <i>exact</i> reason yet, but it makes 4x the syscalls, so I&#x27;m assuming that it&#x27;s checking every single dep of every single member and that has significant overlap.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;complex-build-advice&#x2F;48779?u=steveklabnik" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;complex-build-advice&#x2F;48779?u=s...</a> is probably closest to what I can currently say :)')
