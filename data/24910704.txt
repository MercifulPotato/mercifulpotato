I&#x27;ve looked at Meson&#x2F;Ninja&#x2F;Make and it works but it&#x27;s truely very complicated and very difficult to get hermetic &amp; reproducible builds from these systems. In my opinion, Bazel will be the future once the currently ongoing external dependency management design doc is implemented. I&#x27;ve migrated quite a few builds to bazel at work and I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic reduction in compile times - not even from compiling source code! Doing things like packaging zips, generating code, generating docs (swagger), etc all adds up in CI time and automating, and caching, absolutely all of it is astonishingly useful.')
