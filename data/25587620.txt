Started thinking that we’re talking about different aspect. I’ve been thinking about models as they’re used in end-user systems. Particularly how it’d fit in with Ruby and Rails, or similar. Actors without a good framework like OTP are indeed a pain. The fork-join model is great for parallelism and computation. Problem is that it’s harder to use for general purpose concurrency where your inputs aren’t immutable or fit into the model. Not that I’ve seen fork-join model really used other than map reduce or some MPI constructs.')
