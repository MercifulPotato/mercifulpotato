We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result. We&#x27;re a startup â€” we&#x27;re 900+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We&#x27;ve built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.<p>We&#x27;re focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 30+ states and have successfully launched both a renters and home owners product.<p>We raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company ($523 million in funding to date.) We&#x27;re planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry. To do that, we&#x27;re looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you&#x27;re just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.<p>Our tech stack involves Ruby &#x2F; Rails and Javascript &#x2F; React Native. However, we&#x27;re not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we&#x27;re looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.<p>We&#x27;re actively hiring in Columbus, OH and we&#x27;ve built an engineering team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we&#x27;re headed, and we&#x27;re searching for both experienced Engineers and Engineering Leaders who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in both locations.<p>Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.')
