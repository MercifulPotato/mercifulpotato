Here, we as honest citizens are building fences, walls, gated-communities, electric fencing, metal bars around our doors and windows, hiring private security, etc to combat the crime that the wider society is tacitly tolerating. People <i>want</i> security, and we&#x27;re willing to forego things such as &quot;privacy&quot; in return for that. Not all of us put &quot;privacy&quot; on a gigantic pedestal as some others do.')
