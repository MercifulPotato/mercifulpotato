I currently spend 2 hours a day training for boxing, spend time on weekends mountain biking and wish there was more time! At some point I&#x27;ll be financial independent where I will be able to devote even more time.<p>With that being said, would it help people to view exercise as play time? If you go play basketball with a group of guys, are you exercising or playing? For me it doesn&#x27;t matter, I&#x27;m going to be out there either way but for others would the mental shift make a difference?')
