Cryptographic and real-world plausibility are two entirely different things.<p>People get blackmailed, shamed, hurt and even killed over mere rumors, speculations and suspicions. As long as people believe in something (because something merely <i>look</i> plausible), there&#x27;s no need for a fancy crypto to prove some machine sent some email. I&#x27;d dare to say most people don&#x27;t even understand what cryptography is and what digital signatures really are (who signs what and what exactly this means).<p>I&#x27;m yet to hear a story of, let&#x27;s say, a brave dissident who got out of jail because of cryptographic plausible deniability property making their oppressors unable to prove authenticity of some leaked or intercepted correspondence.')
