SF to LA, unless you&#x27;re traveling on local roads, is essentially all freeway. And pretty much one long road at that. Hop on I-5 or 101 or even the 1 and, in the words of The Simpsons, &quot;sit back and feel your ass grow&quot; for five hours. Self driving folks have been saying that highways driving has always been pretty straightforward for essentially a decade now.
