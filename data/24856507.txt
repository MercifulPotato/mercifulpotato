That heat, unlike on Earth, <i>really</i> stands out against the cold of space. You can hide the emissions of many vehicles on Earth, because Earth and its atmosphere is pretty warm compared to space in the first place. But in space all you need to do is look for heat signatures(infrared and others) and you will spot any vessel immediately.<p>Some Sci-Fi has tried addressing it with plausible ideas - like for instance dumping all heat into shielded internal tanks, which have to eventually be vented(so that stealth cannot be infinite because you run out of heat storage capacity on board).')
