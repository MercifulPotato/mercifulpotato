Despite all of that, despite rarely if ever spending any money on &quot;fun&quot; things, I&#x27;m $30,000 in debt. Tuition and rent are just <i>that expensive</i> now. It&#x27;s almost impossible to save up when you&#x27;re throwing just about every dollar you&#x27;re making just to keep yourself afloat.')
