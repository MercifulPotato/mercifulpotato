I am not sure the secret.</i><p>A lot of it is luck. I posted a Show HN years ago, on a whim, and it became one of the top-10 Show HNs ever. It led to coverage in Fast Company and dozens of other outlets. In subsequent months, I posted about significant updates (bookmarklet -&gt; Chrome extension, new PDF tool), and those posts went nowhere. It is hard to know why things catch on sometimes.<p>I&#x27;m still working on the same project, and I have HN (and the luck of that first post) to thank for it!')
