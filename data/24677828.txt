I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s plenty on the left that would like more open borders, plenty on the right that want them closed, and plenty in the middle that are fine with them as they are - I guess those would be the happy ones, so &quot;no one in Europe being happy&quot; isn&#x27;t strictly true.<p>But supposing it were, then the &quot;nonsense&quot; claim makes sense. The argument is logical, even if the facts may be disputed. I just couldn&#x27;t figure out the train of logic for the &quot;white supremacist neo-colonial&quot; claim, no matter which facts were believed.')
