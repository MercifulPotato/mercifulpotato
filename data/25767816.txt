Item(by='ingvul', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610571173, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25767739, text='&gt; In 3 years in the US you earn significantly more than in 5 years in France, so the vacation and health coverage arguments do not hold, unless you have an expensive illness (&gt;30k$ per year).<p>Care to elaborate? Especially the part about vacation. Do you mean that US developers will retire early than their European counterparts because they are earning more in average and by doing so will enjoy more free time? I&#x27;d rather prefer to enjoy my free time when I&#x27;m in my 20s and 30s than when I&#x27;m in my 40s, 50s, etc.<p>The part about the health coverage: well, that&#x27;s the thing, you never know if you&#x27;ll deal with expensive or rare illness... so the European way of health coverage is worth it.')
