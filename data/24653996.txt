I have a new macbook pro with USB(C&#x2F;thunderf*ck?) adapter that lets me use this headset on my mac. No biggy.<p>Anyway one day I was like, huh, I bet this won&#x27;t work, but I plugged my Mac adapter into my Oneplus phone, with the USB A headset attached. The phone actually detected the headset, including the volume up&#x2F;down button built in.<p>So yes, USB-C simplified my life.')
