They will continue to try to do it again and again, because they&#x27;ve done it thousands of times in the past and only been caught out significantly once before (VW in 2008). They definitely haven&#x27;t lost - the money they use isn&#x27;t theirs to lose (they just take a percentage of the profit they make, they&#x27;re not losing their own money) and, more importantly, traders are up <i>hundreds of billions</i> in the past decade or two, so a few tens of billions lost now isn&#x27;t going to put them off trying again.')
