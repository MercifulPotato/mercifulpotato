It does only voice and SMS&#x2F;MMS.  It only works over Ethernet or Wi-Fi.It uses mains electricity.  I wrote the software -it&#x27;s Python3 and C.<p>I&#x27;ve been using this phone as my daily driver for the last year.  It is <i>very</i> reliable.<p>I plan to start making it available in Jan 2021.  Look for more posts here.')
