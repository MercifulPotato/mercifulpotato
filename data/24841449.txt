I am also aware that Federal employment laws are unlikely to support firing them on account of recusing themselves from a case.<p>However, that does not mean the ABA&#x27;s Rules of Professional Conduct do not apply to them, nor does it mean they should not be fired for choosing to terminate representation of their client.<p>It sets a terrible precedent in a system that is designed to have someone willing to fight on each side for their client. If the government wants to bring about a weak case, let them. The opposing party has their own representation point out those weaknesses, if that is truly the case.<p>So whether they can be fired or not, doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they should be, or that they should resign from the Department.')
