I dont disagree with the sentiment but I think its misplaced.<p>People are well and truly capable of living with nature without killing whole forests. Its a matter of putting our interests above those of others that is the issue.<p>Eg. The government permits loggers to cut down 1000 year old trees in a forest, permits mutlinational Ag companies to cut down and burn much of the forest to plant some inane plant species that has marginal benefit to squeeze out an extra 10 cents on a human consumed product because ultimately the quarterly results have to improve. All these abstractions have seemingly nothing to do with a dead forest.<p>We should have instead, enforcable policy that puts a high price on environmental projects of any scope larger than..say an acre. It would force companies to innovate and invest in R&amp;D. Use those big brains.')
