Remember that &quot;some democrats&quot; feeling this way is actually not very useful. Instead, various and multiple people with different levels of the election oversight process would need to 1) feel this way, and 2) be willing to risk a federal crime despite all other incentives, and 3) have the actual capability of carrying this out. Each step in the process here carries further inter-dependencies.<p>For example, the people who really feel this way must be multiple election officials in multiple locations. Recall that there are no &quot;state&quot; elections, but rather multiple districts, which are then collected for the state elections. And so there has to be fraud in multiple locations, and it must be coordinated. Before we go any further, it&#x27;s important to understand that when we&#x27;re supposing that we know &quot;how people would feel,&quot; we suddenly mean &quot;I know the motivations and incentives of multiple strangers, whose jobs and lives I know nothing about.&quot; This is where our ability to judge a person&#x27;s incentives really falls apart. If we&#x27;re considering scenario #1, where an imagined other might feel some way, that&#x27;s probably fine. By the time we&#x27;re in scenario #2, we already do not know enough information to determine all the incentives involved. One pole worker may be a republican, another a democrat. One pole worker may have a strict credo they live by (in other words, they wouldn&#x27;t break the law no matter what) while others may be much more open to malicious actions. Some might be risk averse, so might be risk addicted. The point is we don&#x27;t have factual information about all these different competing incentives.<p>Even if we could establish the various incentives, there&#x27;s further information we don&#x27;t have: What is the structure of the various election boards? Which individuals would be required to coordinate malicious to reach the desired outcome? And, which of those individuals do we think have the &quot;wrong&quot; incentives? In other words, were enough bad actors in the right place?<p>Lastly, (and shortly since I&#x27;m getting too wordy) supposing we could work out the first two problems, do we think such a group could escape the nigh-historical oversight which has been playing out after this election?')
