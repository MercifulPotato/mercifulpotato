Started on 6-7th November.<p>My ISP Tele2, Croatia. But, I am on a 4G LTE router.<p>Haven&#x27;t had it for 2 years since I&#x27;ve been with that ISP nothing the same as described.<p>Or at least we had some strange stuff for a few days, I thought it was my dedicated server SSH and MTU, bu not.\nWhen connected through the VPN, the speed is normal, fine.\nAlso, FTP was working fine.<p>But, without a VPN, the network seems to be &quot;throttled&quot; somehow, do not know why.<p>Persists today. I have to use VPN for SSH connection to my server and to download on my &quot;full speed&quot; over FTP.<p>And my router is D-LINK, since firmware upgrade cannot access HTTPS configuration.
