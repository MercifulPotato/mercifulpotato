I hadn&#x27;t heard of it but it appears to be an Instagram alike for 3D models and VR.  If Google was trying to establish themselves as a first mover platform in the VR space, it&#x27;s odd that they would can such a product before VR itself has finished taking off.  It signals that they actually have no interests in VR going forward but it&#x27;s Google so you never know, they will probably have 4 of these services at some point in the future and you&#x27;ll never know when or where one starts and stops.  For an advertising company, Google is remarkably bad at advertising their own products.')
