However, I would disagree with one thing. I know in the article I didn&#x27;t really go in-depth into knowing your target audience but I think that&#x27;s how you clearly set expectations. For example, in this thread a lot of people are saying the mobile chip wont ever be as powerful as the top of the line players in the market (which is true).<p>However, Apple copywriting isn&#x27;t meant for those people. Rather, they niched down to people who use their mac for browsing or video editing (which can be pretty resource intensive). Since they niched down to focus on only those kinds of customer archetypes, they knew what to build and made sure they were able to deliver. I know that&#x27;s tangential to copywriting but for a solid product launch you need a bunch of different parts to go right.')
