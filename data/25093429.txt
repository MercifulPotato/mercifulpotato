Even your local news web sites, which ten years after YouTube still couldn&#x27;t manage to consistently get a video to play in the browser, have figured it out by now. But Reddit? Nope. Requires me to hit the play button 3-4 times in order to start the video, stops randomly in the middle of the video, and &quot;re-play&quot; never works. I mean, we&#x27;re almost in 2021! Developers, if you can&#x27;t figure it out, just give up and embed YouTube.')
