My basis for this was from several friends who have been financial planners for 10+ years and two have lived off day trading for more than 15 years.<p>Then I had a few people tell me, &quot;Nope, its called a &quot;short squeeze&quot; and totally legal. Then I had to go back and do some research on how short squeezes work. Then I found several instances where this had happened, just not nearly as public because of social media.<p>The small amount of research opened my eyes to the fact even though something may seem illegal, in the finance world, there&#x27;s a lot of gray areas and details most people will never know about until something like this happens.')
