Like you point out that the classes you took are 101 courses. These are really just &quot;tasting&quot; courses. I&#x27;m sure if you decided to take more advanced&#x2F;grad numbered courses, or unnumbered &quot;topics&quot; courses, you would have a better idea of what&#x27;s going on.<p>In general, &quot;having a deep understanding of models &amp; techniques in full detail&quot; is not well-defined. For example, analysis of linear regression is often offered as a full year-long sequence for graduate students in math&#x2F;stats depts. Is this necessary for doing linear regression in practice? Not really, but who cares - it&#x27;s interesting stuff in its own right. Most people just need just enough understanding to finish a job.<p>In general, the precise medium that you use to study something isn&#x27;t that important as long as it works for you, but there is a good reason that there are longstanding classic textbooks that people swear by in most fields of mathematics. I do strongly feel that in the context of any mathematical subject, that there are few substitutes to the grind - doing proofs and solving problems on your own.<p>Okay, but just to have at least one link in my post, I want to share this guy MathematicalMonk who used to make really great videos on ml-related stuff:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCcAtD_VYwcYwVbTdvArsm7w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCcAtD_VYwcYwVbTdvArsm7w</a>')
