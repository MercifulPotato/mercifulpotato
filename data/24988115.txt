Low taxation for example is great, but not if it means slashing your education budget or having the streets full of homeless people.<p>Every time people try to start a new country from scratch - whether by colonizing some land or a revolution - the results end up completely different to what they hoped or expected, often for the worse. Real lasting change is effected by the long, hard, often unhappy slog. Ask the people who fought for civil rights, or gay rights, or environmentalists - or for that matter, the various conservative groups.<p>Honestly if you want a new country, start with the one where you live, become an active citizen and do the hard work of showing up and participating. If that&#x27;s not possible then move to a country where you can make a difference, but still you have to put in the work.')
