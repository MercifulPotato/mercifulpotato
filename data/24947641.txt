Not because most people are stupid, or they don&#x27;t know the concept of opportunity costs, as popular explanations go. It&#x27;s because for most individuals, time is illiquid. You can&#x27;t just turn every 10 minutes you save on some chore into 1&#x2F;6 of your hourly rate. So, for most people, that $2&#x2F;month is a pure loss, even if it saves more than 10 minutes a month, so it needs to be (or at least feel) truly worth it.')
