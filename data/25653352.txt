In your words, &quot;<i>something that happened 60 years ago when both countries had very different governments</i>&quot; But, perhaps after watching the US performance in Iraq, maybe Iran wanted a credible deterrent to prevent the same thing from happening to them.<p>If the issue with the nuclear program was really about proliferation, the US would have active sanctions against Pakistan. AQ Khan wasn&#x27;t an Iranian!<p>&gt; &quot;<i>How many of those are the result of Iranian involvement?</i>&quot;<p>They didn&#x27;t invade the country, overthrow the government, and disband the army. If Iran invaded Mexico, overthrew the government, and disbanded the army plunging the country into chaos, do you think the US would stand by and do nothing? No way!<p>Do you feel that the ISI is any more odious of an institution that Iranian military intelligence in that respect? Why does the US treat them so differently?<p>&gt; &quot;<i>agreement and compensation</i>&quot;<p>That&#x27;s blood money, not an apology. The US screwed up big time in shooting down that plane, and the best they could muster was that it was a &quot;...proper defensive action by the U.S.S. Vincennes.&quot; (<i>rolls eyes</i>) When Iran shot down the Ukrainian airliner, at least they had the decency to label it a &quot;disastrous mistake.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;<i>Who had been involved in attacking American soldiers.</i>&quot;<p>Why were the American soldiers there halfway across the planet in a country where they aren&#x27;t welcome and don&#x27;t speak the language? Maybe they wanted the Americans out so that the region could achieve some stability?<p>My point with the Saudi-Yemen thing is that KSA doesn&#x27;t need nukes as an insurance policy because the US has their back. No nuclear-armed superpower has Iran&#x27;s back, so they&#x27;re probably looking for the security of a nuclear deterrent.<p>The US-Irainian conflict, like the US conflict with Cuba, is something that should have ended decades ago. It&#x27;s a legacy of old political hostilities that happened when my parents were teenagers. It&#x27;s 2021, we have better things to worry about. It&#x27;s all so petty.')
