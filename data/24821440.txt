Why should a public school provide &quot;prayer rooms&quot; which is basically a euphemism for Islam rooms. Today it will be prayer rooms tomorrow it will be halal only meat in cafes. This is a tyranny of minority. I am sorry, I do not see any difference.<p>&gt; Not, like, actually teaching kids to be Muslims.<p>That would be the logical next step after the prayer rooms.')
