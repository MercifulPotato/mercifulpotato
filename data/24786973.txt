Hiding the benefits of programming from the &quot;unwashed masses&quot; because they are not going to understand it anyways is gatekeeping.<p>The aim should be to make programming&#x2F;scripting&#x2F;automation easier and more accessible, not to hide it away to prevent people from ever using it.<p>&gt; Why shouldn&#x27;t everyone churn their own butter? Why shouldn&#x27;t everyone sew their own clothes?<p>Why learn history in school? Why learn math? Why learn about philosophy? Should we stop teaching that in school because the &lt;stereotype&gt; will never use it anyways? Or is the opposite true and not teaching that would be the actual gatekeeping?<p>TLDR: You suggest that this would hide &lt;useful stuff&gt; behind programming and thus be gatekeeping. I think you are hiding useful stuff==programming and are thus the gatekeeper.')
