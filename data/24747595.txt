Typically it is not literally the state of being propaganda that makes propaganda concerning, but instead, it’s the the agenda that the propaganda is espousing that is of concern.<p>For example, some propaganda is good and had an agenda that is widely agreeable — e.g. many things produced by the Ad Council.<p>Few would think it is reasonable for the US to prohibit its government from doing things that it believes is in its own interest.<p>Tl;dr: it’s because countries don’t prohibit themselves from doing things they think is a good idea.')
