People generally don&#x27;t admit to being wrong. And backing his supporters into a corner, by projection will not go well.<p>So... we should be careful not to call the Trump movement terrorists or what they did insurrection, otherwise... what? What does &quot;backing his supporters into a corner, by projection will not go well&quot; mean? Violence? Sorry, <i>more</i> violence?<p>Sounds an awful lot like a threat of terrorist intimidation to me. But I don&#x27;t know. I mean, I don&#x27;t want the Proud Boys to slip an IED under my car so I guess I should go along with it? For the good of the country?<p>In fact we probably shouldn&#x27;t arrest any of them. What insurrection? What pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails? Let&#x27;s just make it so nothing they do is illegal - we don&#x27;t dare threaten them or their self image, after all. Who knows what they might do? They can storm the Capitol as many times as they want. Hell, the next time they run a car into some protestors, we&#x27;ll even cut their auto insurance premiums!')
