In WebAuthn every single time you enroll on some web site with this system, a completely random new private key will be generated and the site will be given the corresponding public key and a fresh magic &quot;cookie&quot; identifier that serves no other purpose.<p>Your Apple device remembers the association between this particular web site, any user ID the site said is relevant (e.g. maybe the username mrwnmonm and friendly name &quot;Shiny Steve&quot;) the cookie, and the private key.<p>On subsequent visits either of two things can happen:<p>1. You tap some sort of easy-one-touch login button. The Apple device says &quot;Hey, sign in here as mrwnmonm &#x2F; Shiny Steve?&quot; and you use your touch ID to prove you are still you, this unlocks the private key, Safari uses the private key to create a proof that you still know that key, attaches the proof, and the cookie. The site recognises you must be Shiny Steve and you&#x27;re in.<p>2. You sign in &quot;normally&quot; (e.g. with a username and password) but then as a Second Factor the site shows the Apple Device the cookie it remembers, your device recognises this cookie and prompts you for a touch to prove you are still Shiny Steve, whereupon it uses the private key to sign a proof and send it back to the site.<p>Because the keys are different on every site even if two web sites deliberately work together to try to figure out if a user on one site is the same person as a user on another site, WebAuthn doesn&#x27;t help them do that at all.<p>Also unlike passwords or most other schemes, there&#x27;s no risk from mass data loss because the web site is storing <i>public</i> information. If a &quot;dump&quot; of every Facebook WebAuthn public key was made, that&#x27;s essentially useless to everybody except Facebook anyway, whereas obviously a password dump or a dump of all the TOTP secrets would be a huge security problem.')
