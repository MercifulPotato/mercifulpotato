The point I am making is that the power usage is not directly tied to transactions. Not making a transaction on the blockchain will not save X watts because that power is burned regardless of what transactions are going through.<p>An example would be that me not driving to the beach saves some fuel but bitcoin is just a train constantly driving to the beach and back regardless of how much I use it. You could grab the number of trips and the power usage and calculate a power usage per trip but its not an entirely useful metric since the power usage does not scale up as more people use the service.')
