I just bring two lighters<p>&gt; Selfie stick ... hiking poles<p>I find the more stuff I bring, the more frustrated I get unpacking and packing each night and day. Of course there’s the weight thing, too, but anyway try to pack your things in cloth or plastic baggies for separation. I use the zippered pouches that are sold for this purpose in luggage when traveling.<p>Also don’t forget a trash bag!<p>&gt; bells<p>This is great if you are hiking where bears are active.
