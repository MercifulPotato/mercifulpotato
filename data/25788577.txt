They just released a new ARM Macbook Pro with a touch bar at the bottom end of the Pro lineup, which didn&#x27;t used to come with a touch bar (I have ~2017 pro without). If they wanted to drop the touch bar they could have done it without much fanfare on that model and I&#x27;m not sure why they wouldn&#x27;t do so.')
