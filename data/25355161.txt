It doesn&#x27;t have to mean the absolute version where no alternatives exist at all. It can (and legally does) mean that a business is so dominant that it can effectively dictate the terms of the market.<p>Google has a search monopoly effective enough that they can solely make or break anyone who relies on search. They have enough dominance in the market that if they were to choose to delete something from search results, it could utterly devastate all sorts of players in the market who cannot at all get by on the tiny fraction of traffic they get from other sources.<p>This is not the case for all areas of search, but it&#x27;s the case for enough of them that the concerns about Google&#x27;s monopoly are valid.')
