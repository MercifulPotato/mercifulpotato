PayPal locks your account. YouTube decides to kill your channel for copyright strikes <i>to content you created.</i> Amazon does - all the shady things Amazon is famous for. Apple kills your app because reasons.<p>And so on.<p>This is not about disappearing people. Or businesses. This is about disappearing <i>politicians.</i><p>The real game here is that the mainstream media - especially on the far right - have suddenly discovered they&#x27;re no longer owners of the narrative space, and their game tokens can be removed without notice.<p>Of course they&#x27;re unhappy about this.<p>So if we&#x27;re going to talk about concentrated media influence, we should be questioning the international reach and centralised narrative control of the Fox network (and others) at least as much Twitter or Amazon&#x27;s ability to ban someone who was literally planning an insurrection in the US.<p>There is no free speech issue here, because the kind of &quot;free&quot; political speech we&#x27;re talking about is very, very expensive, and only available to a tiny selection of headline operators.<p>Everything else in the social media space is noise farmed for engagement, and is unlikely to unduly trouble anyone who matters.')
