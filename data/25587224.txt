I thought it would be a good device to let one of the kids use for school-in-quarantine. That isn&#x27;t going to happen. I bought the 8G mini, and I&#x27;ve yet to feel anything remotely like memory pressure even running Windows 10 in parallels and having 5+ sessions of VS Code open. I do web, Rust, Go and similar type programming. Just this last week homebrew reached critical mass and nearly everything one would need is available for the arm builds. I love this thing, quite unexpectedly. I&#x27;ll buy a 16&quot; arm mac when they come out for a portable version because I need a bigger screen than the 13&quot;s have. Zero regrets and 100% surprise from me. I&#x27;ve been a pretty die-hard Linux on the desktop person.')
