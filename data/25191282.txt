Item(by='throwawaygh', descendants=None, kids=[25191452], score=None, time=1606162976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25190916, text='<i>&gt; For example, in Philadelphia they have closed the permitting office repeatedly for COVID, bystepping the law which requires them to issue a permit in 45 days, by simply not accepting applications.</i><p>This was a HUGE deal in the PA gun community, and I simply cannot understand why.<p>1. PA extended the expiration date on existing permits that expired after February until Dec 31. It was only new permits requests where the delay actually effected anyone.<p>2. The delays weren&#x27;t specific to guns. Government offices closed and then opened at reduced capacity. This also happened for DLs.<p>3. The remedy provided by the state was also not specific to guns. Again, e.g., expiring driver&#x27;s licenses were extended.<p>4. The state&#x27;s choice not to prioritize streamlining this paperwork was reasonable. It had huge budget shortfalls and more important things to worry about (acquiring&#x2F;distributing PPE, acquiring&#x2F;distributing respirators, high unemployment, evictions, running elections, finding overflow space for hospitals, moving schools to remote, figuring out how to safely open up service businesses&#x2F;schools, and the list goes on...)<p>5. To the extent that streamlining paper work should have been a larger priority, given the severe stress on logistics networks, I&#x27;d imagine CDLs would be the place to spend those limited resources rather than CCW applications.<p>So, an unavoidable delay happened in LOTS of government processes -- only one of which was CCW issuance -- and the government provided uniform remediation to help partially mitigate the impact of delays in all of those processes.<p>No one was coming for anyone&#x27;s guns.<p>TBH the foaming-at-the-mouth response to unavoidable reasonable delays in processing concealed carry permits during a public health emergency is the sort of thing that makes me (a gun owner) feel completely antagonistic toward the PA 2A advocacy community.')
