I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that you didn&#x27;t see the problem of hypergrowth and I apologize if it came across this way. However, in the sequence of tweets it does sound like the conclusion &#x2F; lesson is to throw ever more heroic engineering at the problem or to get better at eng. planning, as opposed to solving the organizational issues and messed up incentive structures at the root of it all.<p>I realize this isn&#x27;t a small ask. I&#x27;ve worked in BigTech myself where the reward &#x2F; risk ratio of trying to actually solve problems at the root is basically 0 if you&#x27;re not SVP or higher. Anyway, I enjoyed the tweets nevertheless. Good luck.')
