It was a side scrolling (left to right I think) shooter (like Raptor, but left&#x2F;right) and the graphics felt very anime. I think it was VGA&#x2F;DOS. There&#x27;s no way I can possibly look it up because it was entirely in Japanese. I have no idea what it could have been called. I don&#x27;t remember the name of the ZIP file either.')
