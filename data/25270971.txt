But when you have bad experiences, they can be really bad. I ordered a TV on Amazon (Prime) and it was scheduled for delivery in 3 days. Because it&#x27;s a large shipment truck delivery, they give you a window. Like Spectrum&#x2F;Comcast. So I sat home all day and... nothing. I checked my messages and almost the exact time the delivery window was closing they left a message saying &quot;could not deliver will try some other time&quot; basically.<p>It took a month and about 15 customer service reps before a single person could tell me where my TV was. I&#x27;m not exaggerating. They had no clue what happened to a $1,000 purchase. It fell into their bureaucratic black hole like some scene from a Monty Python skit.')
