My office is two miles from home so I could easily manage a week on one charge so a slight inconvenience measured against the &#x27;convenience&#x27; of a petrol station would be no big deal for me.<p>I already despise having to fill up with petrol and always delay it until the last minute so that would be an added incentive for me.<p>Also, could not public car parks, workplaces, supermarkets, etc be used as public charging points?<p>In reality, we&#x27;re talking about no new petrol&#x2F;diesel cars in 9 years which means second-hand cars will be available for at least 10 years after that. It isn&#x27;t as if you&#x27;re being asked to make changes overnight?')
