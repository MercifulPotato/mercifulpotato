I do like it, but I think the biggest opportunity for solutions in space is to reduce &#x27;jank&#x27;, and make the recording process as transparent as possible.<p>We once recorded an interview in Riverside and had mistakenly added the guest as a &#x27;Producer&#x27;, and not as a &#x27;guest&#x27;, meaning it did not record one stream of the audio. Anything the UI can do to essentially scream in my face &#x27;this is recording, and everything is ok&#x27; is what will build trust in products like these.')
