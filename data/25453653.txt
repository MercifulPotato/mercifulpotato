My impression is that this is meant more as a transition than a preferred option.<p>The SSR features are also optimised to the point that the data fetching and rendering is decoupled. So a client side (JS) navigation only needs to fetch the new page&#x27;s data. The DX around this is super smooth (just expose an async function...)')
