I have the Argon 40 case for an RPi4. I&#x27;ve overclocked the core to 2.0GHz, and with 100% passive cooling, no fan, it does not thermal throttle at all. I&#x27;ve pegged it at 100% CPU use for an hour with no throttling. The chip runs hot, but it&#x27;s not a top of the line CPU that needs active cooling. A good sized chunk of metal will cool it just fine.')
