We had the Beatles, they had Elvis. We had Jaguars, they had Mustangs. (this is deliberately simplified example)<p>However the internet has made everything smaller and the dominant force in tech is in the USA. Sure there are spikes in influence of Asian and other cultures (Gangam K-pop etc.) but most of it gets churned out from celebs, artists, influencers, bloggers, writers and thinkers in the liberal east and west coasts.<p>Do we all want to hear what these people have to say, no, but when everyone else is wanting to follow them then it becomes easier to be influenced directly or indirectly.<p>The last cultural influence that stood in opposition to &quot;Western culture&quot;, was communism, but that died on 1990 with the first McDonald&#x27;s in Moscow. \nSure the idea of communism isn&#x27;t dead; you might see a few random people still promote it online or outside a shopping centre with a shabby looking stall, but these people are seen as weird or uncool (communism isn&#x27;t cool btw).<p>So back to the topic, do we just want to be cool, is BLM cool, will it be forgotten, after the main proponents find another flag to wave?<p>Are we all just inadvertently programmed to consume and conform due to our DNA and society by those at the top, or do we risk being an outcast by going against them?<p>What happens when China takes the reigns as a new culture to oppose and compete with this idea of &quot;Americanized Western Culture&quot;?<p>Will we eventually have a Blade Runner like culture with a Chinese European blend in the future?<p>Will we all homogenise in the end? Will I see someone in the Amazonas eating KFC and wearing Adidas just like the person in the township in Johannesburg?<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer.')
