Apparently one was stolen and they wanted to know how difficult it would be for an attacker to... well... &quot;you know the name of the attack where they steal credit card info and such ?&quot;. So I replied &quot;skimming&quot;.\nThe attack actually did happen where they reversed the terminal to find vulnerabilities and used that to steal a database with payment information. No physical device was used for the attack, but the name &quot;skimming&quot; seemed relevant.<p>Bottom line is, you use the word you and involved people know to describe the threat we face.')
