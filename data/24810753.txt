If you&#x27;re looking to build out a business with employees it will be much more challenging as you will need to be a full time sales person, always making sure you have enough work in the pipeline to make sure they get paid, rule 1 is that staff always get paid before you.<p>I would suggest you find like minded individuals and partner up with them, that way when one of you has a bad week or you need a holiday the other&#x2F;others can pick up the slack.<p>Seeing as you have so much experience you should be able to lean on previous employers &#x2F; colleagues to get contracts, this is how we started out. Once you have a few projects under your belt and a decent website you will need to see if you&#x27;re getting enough work by word of mouth from previous projects or if you need to invest in marketing. If you stay as a small team it will be much easier to do well via word of mouth if your quality of work is good. At the end of the day it&#x27;s all about your network and driving quality projects into your business.<p>I would strongly discourage you from only bringing projects to the POC&#x2F;MVP state. This is what we did initially but you need a far higher throughput of projects and you&#x27;re in danger of leaving clients high and dry if they want the idea built out further.<p>That&#x27;s how we got started anyway, best of luck with your venture!')
