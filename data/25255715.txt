When you are trying to learn a new mathematical concept and are manipulating matrices and vectors, Octave&#x2F; Matlab is a breeze. Compared to other languages that require you to call the `dot()` function.<p>Additionally compared to python&#x27;s matplotlib, Octave &#x2F; Matlab&#x27;s plotting syntax is much simpler. Not faster but its functional.<p>In short, its a great educational tool, prototyping mathematical &#x2F; engineering models. Bad for production use where you are using the code base to actually solve an engineering &#x2F; science problem.')
