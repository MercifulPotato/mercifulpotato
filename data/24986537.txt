However that&#x27;s HomeKit-only. The key option we&#x27;re looking for is RGBWW (with 2 different &quot;temperature&quot; whites) for a wider range and more natural lighting. We&#x27;ve been considering various more flexible light strip arrangements, but as GP noted, the market is flooded with low-reliability options.<p>Luckily, we&#x27;ve stumbled upon Sowilo [2], which advertises powerful RGBWW LED strips with appropriate specs (with per-meter max brightness and power consumption listed), provide all the components you need for powering and driving the strips you need, and best of all provide a Hue-integrated controller! (likely from scavenging an actual Hue LED strip controller!). We&#x27;ve ordered a kit last week, and are eagerly anticipating testing out the ~13000lm of purported light.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.evehome.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;eve-light-strip" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.evehome.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;eve-light-strip</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sowilodesign.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;led-strips" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sowilodesign.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;led-strips</a><p>Tangentially, we&#x27;ve picked up 4x GE Ultra Bright [3] at Lowes for $10 each to test out the brightness, and those have been great too.<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lowes.com&#x2F;pd&#x2F;GE-Ultra-Bright-150-Watt-EQ-A23-Soft-White-Dimmable-LED-Light-Bulb&#x2F;1002643700" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lowes.com&#x2F;pd&#x2F;GE-Ultra-Bright-150-Watt-EQ-A23-Sof...</a>')
