I.e. all the internal tooling to deploy and manage applications.  If YouTube gets split off from Cloud, YouTube obviously can&#x27;t sell cloud hosting, but can it run the Cloud software on their own hardware so they don&#x27;t have to pay Cloud prices?  Or will they be forced to reinvent those systems, and how different from the old ones do they have to be?<p>It&#x27;s also going to be weird because the newly created companies are now potential customers of each other, and yet they also have far more detailed information on each other than is normal.  I.e. Cloud probably has a pretty good idea of how much they charge to get maximum profits from YouTube without it being unprofitable for YouTube.  And vice versa, YouTube probably has a pretty good idea exactly what it costs Cloud to provide certain services.  Makes for an interesting negotiating table.')
