Which is way more complex and requires way more people than it is frequently given credit for. (Uber isn&#x27;t just an app; it&#x27;s a bunch of apps, supporting a 2-way marketplace with complex dynamics and many millions of participants.)<p>But the vast majority of Uber&#x27;s employees are not software engineers. Running a physical service in ~70 countries is &#x2F;hard&#x2F; and requires a lot of people. Support and operations eat up a lot of the headcount, and can&#x27;t be scaled like software. Similarly you need a lot of accountants and lawyers to operate globally, along with all of the infrastructure to support a global workforce.<p>[Disclaimer: I work for Lyft]')
