Item(by='labawi', descendants=None, kids=[24902750], score=None, time=1603745208, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899901, text='I&#x27;ll quote from the first paragraph of court&#x27;s opinion:<p><i>We hold that the statute requires copyright holders to consider fair use before sending a takedown notification, and that failure to do so raises a triable issue as to whether the copyright holder formed a subjective good faith belief that the use was not authorized by law.</i> [2]<p>Note that the case was about abuse of DMCA takedowns by copyright holders if not considering fair use. Judge considers fair use as <i>authorized by law</i>, which I would interpret as right, not defense.<p>Another quote:\n<i>We agree with the district court and hold that the statute unambiguously contemplates fair use as a use authorized by the law.</i> [2]<p><i>Fair use is not just excused by the law, it is wholly authorized by the law</i> [2]<p>From previously quoted wikipedia article, the paragraph continues:<p>&quot;Fair use is therefore distinct from affirmative defenses where a use infringes a copyright, but there is no liability due to a valid excuse, e.g., misuse of a copyright.&quot; [1]<p>As for plaintiff considerations, IMO, of course plaintiff is required to argue it&#x27;s standing, otherwise the case is thrown out, or in this case DMCA is abused. Normally the first bar is to make a coherent argument, then the court gets to decide whether your opinion is right, but that does not lower the defendant&#x27;s rights to a &quot;defense&quot;, even if they are a defense.<p>[2] Court&#x27;s decision, hopefully: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar_case?case=12567649168680108221" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar_case?case=125676491686801...</a>')
