Having POTUS45 removed from twitter was basically the chance in a lifetime for Parler, and in that critical 48 hours their hosting provider pulled the rug out from them and their app was removed from BOTH app stores (I have a hard time believing there wasn&#x27;t some form of coordination here). It seems especially sinister to me, but maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m viewing it outside of a political lens.')
