Your deduction based on the dictionary definition of &quot;criminal&quot; is valid (I say dictionary definition and not legal definition because, afaik, &quot;criminal&quot; is not a legal term).<p>But I don&#x27;t accept dictionaries as the ultimate authority of the meaning of words, just a handy guide. The meaning of a word is whatever people tend to understand that word as. I cannot prove this on the spot, since I&#x27;d have to invest time into organizing a survey, but I&#x27;m fairly confident that, if you ask a thousand people whether someone who drives over the speed limit is a criminal, a majority of them would say &quot;no&quot; (phrasing of the question will matter probably though).<p>You can insist on the dictionary being the ultimate source of truth, that is fine. But all that achieves is setting yourself up for gratuitous, avoidable miscommunications. If your theory of language makes communication harder, it seems to undermine the point of language.')
