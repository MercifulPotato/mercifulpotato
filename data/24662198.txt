Ubuntu, RHEL, Suse etc are operating systems, but more importantly they are separate independent operating systems. Their interoperability pretty much starts and ends with POSIX, everything else being more of a happy coincidence. And many of those major Linux-based OSs have strong vendor behind them.<p>Same way you don&#x27;t expect cohesiveness between macOS and Windows, I think it is bit unreasonable to expect cohesiveness between RHEL and Ubuntu or whatever.')
