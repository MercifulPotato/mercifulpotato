HN is but a shell of what it used to be, infested by pretentious mediocrity. Read carefully and you will see how language, topics and “well informed” explanations are following a set of pattern. Basically most people here imitate each other and rarely provide meaningful insights while down voters often downvote meaningful replies. Links are great tho.<p>Just have a read and see how many replies on most topics rarely dive into specifics and often barely scratch the surface of topics. Humous takes a deep understanding of a topic for one to see why it is hilariously amusing to some. Not something you can achieve with shallowness.')
