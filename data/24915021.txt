Facebook did not make socializing better. It made it worse. Was it at one point a new web site? Yes. Does it make money? Yes. But it is not innovative.</i><p>This is surprisingly hollow. Facebook took Instagram and WhatsApp and basically put it on steroids. Those apps couldn&#x27;t have possibly been the behemoths they are now without Facebook&#x27;s ample innovative, world-class sales, marketing, engineering weight behind it [0][1].<p>&gt; <i>Next consider Amazon. Yes Amazon (which is not based in Silicon Valley) made online shopping better. However, it is fundamentally just another middleman, and will not stand the test of time. True innovation, like the silicon chip itself, stands the test of time.</i><p>No no no. Amazon is probably one of the most innovative companies right now. You don&#x27;t go from selling books to building a wildly profitable IT Enterprise business to winning the Emmys by resting on your laurels or being complacent.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qJl27KvUDn0&amp;t=34m47s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qJl27KvUDn0&amp;t=34m47s</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18065897" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18065897</a>')
