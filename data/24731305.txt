Then you feel responsible, like you’re paying attention to risk, but in a way that lets you remain 100% confident and optimistic. The problem with low-probability tail risks is that they’re so rare you can get away with ignoring them 99% of the time. The other 1% of the time they change your life.<p>The other side of the coin for his implicit argument that you should think about these tail end risks is that they&#x27;re everywhere and in everything we all do commonly, even in fundamentally non-irresponsible activities. Ie: driving your car daily for errands around town will 99.9% of the time result in errands completed more quickly. 1 out of 1000 times, it could result in you killing yourself or someone else, even if you&#x27;re always perfectly sober when you drive. Thus, while long tails risks shouldn&#x27;t be forgotten, giving them too much weight as a basis for decision making could easily paralyze one into forfeiting all kinds of activity or choices. It would become a very constricting way to live a life, very quickly. Magnify this possibility accordingly for people who naturally suffer anxiety issues about life.')
