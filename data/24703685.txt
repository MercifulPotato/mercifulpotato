Item(by='antoncohen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602027063, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24698334, text='&gt; The App Platform is one of the few PaaS products built on a shared Kubernetes platform.<p>I wonder how they are doing this from a security standpoint. For customer workload isolation is every container actually a VM? The pricing&#x2F;sizing kind of makes it look like that.<p>&gt; App Platform provides predictable, easy-to-understand pricing<p>How? Outbound network is charged per-GB. I know autoscaling isn&#x27;t supported yet, but hopefully they support setting a max number of instances. One of the things people like about DigitalOcean over other cloud services is that you can sign up to pay $X per month and know that is what exactly what you will pay, no surprises.<p>&gt; Upcoming features<p>The list of things not supported yet includes <i>auto-scaling</i> and <i>VPC</i>. It is hard to imagine using a PaaS without autoscaling. And I wouldn&#x27;t want to build out a microservices-like architecture without VPC.<p>Overall I really like the concept of the offering. Simple PaaS, with custom container support, Kubernetes (for what it is worth in a PaaS, I don&#x27;t know), and predictable pricing. That all sounds really good.')
