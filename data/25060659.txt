If you go up to something that&#x27;s existed for thousands of years, and find it tempting to declare it pointless cruft that should be swept away in the march of progress, maybe there&#x27;s something you&#x27;re missing. I don&#x27;t have time to make an extended argument but one idea is that the most important part of marriage isn&#x27;t for the happiness&#x2F;benefit&#x2F;pleasure&#x2F;romance of the couples, but for the benefit of children. Studies demonstrate that children of single-mothers have worse outcomes, such as worse mental health outcomes. A marriage is supposed to be difficult to get out of, to disincentivize broken families. Not that this is anywhere close to a full answer; cultural evolution [2] means we may never get to a full understanding of whether&#x2F;why the customs we have are beneficial, simply because societal dynamics are extremely complicated and still beyond our understanding.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fs.blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;chestertons-fence&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fs.blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;chestertons-fence&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;04&#x2F;book-review-the-secret-of-our-success&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;04&#x2F;book-review-the-secret...</a>')
