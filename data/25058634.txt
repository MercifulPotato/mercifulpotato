Everything I see has suggested that our emotional intelligence is actually falling if anything. We&#x27;re inundated with self-help material that is just the same garbage spewn over again. Everything of value has been drowned out by the noise. People are struggling more than ever with their emotional state. Social media was supposed to be this great connector yet its practically crippling our ability to form connections. The cynic in me says it&#x27;s deliberate; to subdue the masses, but I know that the reality is that there&#x27;s just no money to be gained after you fix someone, and no one&#x27;s going to pay to be fixed unless it&#x27;s a guarantee. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re stuck with individual therapy for even the most trivial things. Such a massive inefficient system we live in, and it&#x27;s only made worse since there is money to be made by making someone less emotionally stable; by making them vulnerable you make them easier to manipulate and more succeptable to advertising. It&#x27;s a cycle where the incentives are all misaligned.')
