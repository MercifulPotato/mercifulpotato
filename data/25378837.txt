My parents, children, and friends who have iPhones have the same benefits. When my mom calls me for help, I know for sure where all her apps came from.  I know that they&#x27;ve been at least somewhat vetted and come from a singular trusted source.  I know that &quot;some kid from school&quot; didn&#x27;t show my kid how to use this &quot;cool other app store&quot; where you can download &quot;all kinds of free stuff&quot;.  I have not yet had to help one of them get malware off of their iOS devices.<p>My point here is that this has been the deal for over a decade.  If you bought an iOS device, you knew the deal. This isn&#x27;t new.  Many of us bought it BECAUSE of these.  And you may think that having access to other app stores doesn&#x27;t affect me, but it does.   At this point, I don&#x27;t understand why people who don&#x27;t like it are buying iOS devices.  There are options out there that do exactly what you want.  Why did you buy an option that doesn&#x27;t have the features you want, and now you want to take away a feature many of us like?')
