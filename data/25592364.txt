Item(by='unishark', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609420733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581727, text='&gt; Amazon could easily require sellers to provide some basic transparency about these listingsâ€”disclosing where these manufacturers are located, how long they&#x27;ve been in business, and which other brands they own. This might make it easier for Amazon to punish companies that try to mislead customers with fake reviews.<p>In my experience they go out of their way to hide info on who the company really is and especially where it is located. Including deleting reviews that point this out. I suspect they make the most money selling in a position of maximum information asymmetry. If you built up any loyalty to the brand they could sell to you outside amazon.')
