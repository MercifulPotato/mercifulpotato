When I was &quot;young&quot; I operated an email server for 6000 users. Keeping that server and our domain away from blacklisting was a full-time job.<p>It wasn&#x27;t enough to secure your server: Any spam or virus coming from the internal network through that email server could potentially blacklist us. Basically, you had to treat your users as untrusted, and run anti-spam and anti-virus filtering that was as good as whatever the rest of the Internet was running.<p>IIRC, although blacklisting was done by non-profits, it was still rather opaque: Blacklisting <i>should</i> be traumatizing, so that you (and your higher ups) are forced to do a proper risk assessment and actually implement it. It was also opaque to make it harder for the bad guys to move quickly.<p>I hate the increasing influence that big tech has on small tech. But keeping web and email safe and clean is a cat-and-mouse game, which, unfortunately, also adds burden to the good folks.')
