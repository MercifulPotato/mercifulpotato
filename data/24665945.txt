Web browser for YouTube, Netflix,, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, bbc iplayer (I use FoxyProxy UK proxy since I’m not in the UK), ITV.<p>I also have an HDTV antenna and use the Samsung remote to switch inputs for it, but it is rarely used (broadcast TV content just sucks where I am), although there is also locast.org if you like that.<p>That’s a lot of content for me, but I still sometimes use Stream.io (also with FoxyProxy VPN) to stream films from Pirate Bay instead of downloading.<p>And if I want to watch download&#x2F;save something or watch content I already stored, I have a synology NAS that’s mounted over SMB ( or NFS?) for that. There’s also a DVD player in the ancient PC but we don’t use it (however VLC plays dvds just fine).<p>Honestly this is much more quality content than me or my family could ever consume.<p>The family does not mind the keyboards&#x2F;touchpad interface for the TV even though they don’t know Linux... UI is so simple it does not matter.<p>I did increase font size even though it’s a 65-inch screen.')
