There is no rote checklist process that will reliably pick the right tool.<p>You do need to learn about tools at least superficially, but when you learn how to build the right mental models for your problems, that&#x27;s when the whole picture starts to become clear and you will just &quot;see&quot; how the right tools will slot into your problem.  Then you can deep dive into those tools.<p>I&#x27;d highly recommend starting with Bret Victor&#x27;s demo, Up And Down The Ladder Of Abstraction: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;worrydream.com&#x2F;LadderOfAbstraction&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;worrydream.com&#x2F;LadderOfAbstraction&#x2F;</a> (view on desktop) to start building the &quot;abstraction muscle&quot;.<p>Then it will become more apparent what constraints might lead you to choose a message bus with a RabbitMQ broker instead of making internal HTTPS calls, for example.<p>[But really, as to your final paragraph, just use Postgres until you can&#x27;t anymore]')
