These are errors in the basic craft of journalism.<p>I see the same problems in other articles in areas I have worked in which leads me to doubt the whole enterprise.  It also likes &quot;profile of a researcher&quot; articles, which are typical talismanic pieces for the popular press void of any actual science.<p>It&#x27;s probably fine to surface interesting topics, though there are other sources appear to use writers who are actual scientists, or who at least have scientific training.')
