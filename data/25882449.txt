When that does happen, the smart devs will write tools that search for common issues in open source repositories, that also have bounties.  You apply 1 code fix to 100 repositories, and that $80 bounty (x100) becomes an $8000 bounty.<p>The result of that is that the easy stuff with a known fix will always be prioritized, and the hard stuff that require real engineering time will never be fixed.')
