Item(by='bigthymer', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1610656294, title='Ask HN: Best marketplace payment processor that minimizes inter-user xaction fee', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I want to build a marketplace where most users are both buyers and sellers for different transactions. For example, assume we have 3 users, Alice, Bob, and Casey. Alice buys a hammer from Bob in one transaction but later sells the hammer to Casey in a different future transaction.<p>Since users are frequently both buyers and sellers, I foresee withdrawals from the marketplace being infrequent with a single user not making any over long periods of time. During sign up, I would like each user to make a deposit (let&#x27;s assume for $10 each, so in the above example, total of $30 deposited). This deposit would sit in the user&#x27;s connected account at the payment processor.  When Alice buys the hammer, Alice&#x27;s connected acct goes to $0 and Bob&#x27;s goes to $20 for Bob (let&#x27;s ignore taxes for now, I know I will have to account for them). When Casey buys, now Alice has $10 and Casey $0.<p>Which payment processor is the best for this type of structure? Can I do something like this with Stripe Connect?  Any idea what the fee breakdown is for deposits, withdrawals, and inter-user transactions?<p>Dwolla supports &quot;Balance-to-Balance&quot; transactions which seems to fit.  I&#x27;m wondering how other payment processors compare.<p>I did some searching for other related Ask HN posts and I came across this earlier post (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1493421) from ~10 years ago.  I wanted to ask again since a lot could have changed since then.<p>TY')
