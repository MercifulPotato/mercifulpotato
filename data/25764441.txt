Let me spell out why they come across as completely insincere:<p>Couldn&#x27;t you just as easily argue that NOT doing anything about a losing president trying to overturn democracy is a much more slippery slope to something far worse? If you simply acknowledge this in your comments, trust me, your points will be taken more seriously.<p>Don&#x27;t worry, many of us who consider the far-right actions insane insurrection and conspiracy theory still do believe in free-speech, and will speak up for it if it goes too far (e.g. your third example). It&#x27;s kinda insincere to jump to these slippery-slope conclusions though, and I think you know that in your heart of hearts. It&#x27;s pretty trivial to take any real-world phenomenon and contrive how it could be exaggerated to the point it&#x27;s bad (&quot;Police shooting an armed criminal? What&#x27;s next police shooting babies?!?&quot; &quot;President bragging how he could shoot a person in the street? What&#x27;s next, president shooting people in the street?!?&quot;).')
