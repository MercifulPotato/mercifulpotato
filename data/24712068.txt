And as far as I&#x27;m concerned, Firefox isn&#x27;t dead as long as there isn&#x27;t a viable replacement that:<p>- doesn&#x27;t update via a sketchy background process (Google Updater, or whatever they&#x27;ve renamed it to this month to avoid scrutiny)<p>- allows me to customize the UI to fit my needs (tree style tabs are an absolute must for me)<p>- allows me to <i>use a full ad blocker like uBlock Origin</i> instead of arbitrarily limiting the ad blocker API to advance the interests of advertisers<p>Of course, Firefox&#x27;s management is an enormous problem, from the way they&#x27;ve prioritized features to the recent layoffs to the enormously stupid decisions (letting a certificate expire that disabled almost all add-ons, the Mr. Robot tie-in &quot;experiment&quot;, pushing pocket, default disabling userChrome.css, forcing auto-updates) they&#x27;ve made in the past 5 years. But the core of Firefox is good.<p>I would love a startup that builds an entire business off of a fork of Firefox that&#x27;s completely based on privacy, perhaps with some non-invasive monetization like:<p>- a $5-20 one-time fee to use (with weak enforcement, a la Sublime Text&#x27;s &quot;annoy you every 5 saves&quot; model)<p>- a paid vs. free split where the free version of the browser adblocks ads but replaces them with in-network, verified safe ads<p>- Linux kernel donation-style only model, with no parent corporation<p>Because of all of the Firefox devs floating around who just got laid off, you could even snatch up some guaranteed capable talent already familiar with the code base. And the best part? They&#x27;re already vetted to not be part of the management-industrial complex that&#x27;s taken over Firefox these days.')
