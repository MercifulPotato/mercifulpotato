Taiwan banned flights from China early on, and now only allows entry to residents and those on business. The UK has still not stopped international travel. Quarantine on arrival in the UK is weak and unenforced, compared to Taiwan where the only way out of the airport is in a quarantine taxi to an approved place and you get tracked by your phone for 2 weeks. By consistently refusing to take timely action, and refusing to take things seriously, the UK forefeited its island advantage.')
