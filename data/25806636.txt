He timed the release of Hillary’s emails so they could be harnessed as part of a disinformation smear campaign right before the election but not long enough before to allow a response. This campaign was also the genesis of the mythos of the Q movement.<p>As for Greenwald there seems to be a clear spin to just about all his work for the past few years.<p>In both their cases I find it impossible to believe that there are no leaks or whistleblowers for them to report upon that concern the Trump orbit. Trump’s entire career is a history of shady deals, con artistry, and exaggeration, and are there still people who argue that he is not a fascist after the events of January 6th? He re-enacted Mussolini’s march on Rome almost exactly, but thankfully with far less competence. We are lucky he and most of his followers are bumbling fools.')
