And those alternatives offer much higher productivity and a much larger talent pool.<p>Rust is not even the fastest web framework (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techempower.com&#x2F;benchmarks&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techempower.com&#x2F;benchmarks&#x2F;</a>) . And the benefit over Java, C# or Go is really negligible. Who needs more than 300000 req&#x2F;s and can&#x27;t afford servers to scale?<p>So, another nice try from the Rust evangelists, but no thanks.')
