We decided to create a Veg&#x2F;Vegetarian platform to help make the process of finding the available food options easier.<p>Two core features: (1) Search for any dish of your choice and see all the options, which you can filter by price, delivery, nutritional info etc. (2) Create your OWN MEAL and see which local restaurants could cook it for you.<p>The site provides you with personalised feed, allows to have a prompt ‘chat’ with any restaurant, and sugests healthier options. It is designed for people with allergies, food intolerance and other diets just as much, due to the detailed meal info.<p>Hope to hear your thoughts We’d really appreciate it.<p>Thanks!\nMadina<p>(In the video, only the ‘Create’ feature is shown)')
