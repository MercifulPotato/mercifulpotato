Like a lot of people were confused by Robin Williams and Chris Farley, but I don&#x27;t think anyone that&#x27;s ever suffered from depression was surprised at all. We think of depression as sadness instead of the existential emptiness or mundane that many experience. Autism is represented by geniuses like House or Sheldon Copper and no one understands the sensory overload aspect that is so common. It&#x27;s also trendy in some circles to have illnesses because it represents struggle and overcoming obstacles. But the challenge is that many mental illnesses are extreme versions of the human condition and if you dilute it enough everyone has an anxiety disorder and depression and multiple personalities. I don&#x27;t blame people for not knowing but maybe we should cool the jets on how woke we are because it seems like we&#x27;re perpetuating misnomers more than recognizing nuances.')
