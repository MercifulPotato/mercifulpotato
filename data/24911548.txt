If you have versions in the filename of the object that helps but isn&#x27;t great from an auditing perspective. People change filenames, and if someone alters or tampers with the file it&#x27;s hard to tell. You might argue that this is also possible if you fetch the file somewhere or install a package and link against it, but you have a better audit trail, packages can (should) also be signed.')
