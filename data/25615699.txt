Like for example.<p>Totally different program (medicaid nursing home care) and not relevant because (1) it isn&#x27;t medical care and (2) someone who has assets to draw down from is, by definition, not poor.<p>&gt; If after 4 years they want to gift their children with a few thousand euros to pay, for example, for their marriage, they don&#x27;t have to worry about it.<p>This isn&#x27;t a realistic scenario (at least in theory).  Medicaid nursing home eligibility is evaluated on a case by case basis and penalties are only incurred if the Medicaid applicant&#x27;s intent is to defraud the government (i.e. you can&#x27;t give away your money for the sole purpose of acquiring government benefits).')
