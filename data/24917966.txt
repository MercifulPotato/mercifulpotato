I managed to select a game and get to the title screen, but then the controller stopped working? Well, it looks like the app was able to receive my button press to start the game, but no button presses on the gamepad did anything in the actual emulated state. Chrome on MacOS. None of the buttons work at all in Safari, of course.')
