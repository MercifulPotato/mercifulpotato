For the most simple use case you have maps, which in Go are already generic. Of course, anything more advanced would be greatly helped with generics, since at the moment they (I presume) store `interface{}` types and the consumer has to cast them back to the real types. Or they use code generators, which is also pointed out in the article.<p>To add some potential goodness coming from generics: Option types to avoid nil, Either types to replace the value&#x2F;error tuples (which the article points out is a weird outlier, because you don&#x27;t have tuples elsewhere in the language).<p>Those make me wonder if parts of the language and codebases written therein would actually improve compared to the weirdness of multiple return values and the like.')
