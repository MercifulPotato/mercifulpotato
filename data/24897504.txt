GP makes no claim of a series of events at all.<p>GP is merely pointing out that often, societal norms have been immoral, despite the &quot;wisdom of the time&quot; saying that challenging the norm is immoral. And society doesn&#x27;t realize they were wrong until the normal has been challenged.  By not allowing a society to challenge the norms, the norms may never change.<p>It is your example that is fallacious. You bring up Canada and Germany, even though we have no idea how good or bad of an impact those laws will have. And more importantly, how dangerous it is to even give a government power to restrict this sort of speech. We don&#x27;t know the conclusion.')
