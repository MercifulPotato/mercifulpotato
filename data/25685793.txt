In all their keynotes, maybe excluding the first iPhone, they don&#x27;t even acknowledge other phones. You should buy the next iPhone because its better than the previous, not because its better than an android. And because of that stance, they spend zero effort in supporting other platforms. And apparently... That works just fine!')
