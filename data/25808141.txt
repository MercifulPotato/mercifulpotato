Just trying to point out the negative association is unfortunate.<p>Everyone works from whatever information they have, past experience, natural tendencies, etc. And people _can_ break out of an poorly-informed viewpoint. (I grew up in one for many years.) But the process must be cooperative or internally motivated.<p>BTW, it&#x27;s interesting how misinformation can overwhelm proven information. Much like spam and bot activity accounts for email and Internet traffic it&#x27;s easy to lose the signal among the noise. We&#x27;re all trying to adapt to find the signal. (At least those of us who aren&#x27;t intentionally producing noise.)')
