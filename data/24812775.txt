Any other articles that happen to have a person&#x27;s personal info are blocked?  Do they block tabloids as well?  Was it cool how they unilaterally blocked people from mentioning that said article exists... sans URL and without PII?<p>There&#x27;s a lot of mental gymnastics and cognitive dissonance required to believe this was &quot;just policy&quot;.<p>Likewise, why is it such a burden for Twitter to monitor illegal content but not legal content?  Is there just so very much illegal content on Twitter relative to legal that they can&#x27;t manage?  But, yeah, they&#x27;re all over this legal content like a hawk, just coincidentally.  (Despite them talking about them implementing restrictions like this for years).  It&#x27;s politically targeted.  You know it.  I know it.  Everybody knows it.')
