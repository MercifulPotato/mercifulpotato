I happen to have seen like 8 trillion pod manifests so I know what I&#x27;m looking for, but if you don&#x27;t, you have to figure out the schema in some other way.  To reverse engineer something, I usually pipe into keys (jq keys, jq &#x27;.spec | keys&#x27;, jq &#x27;.spec.containers[] | keys&#x27;, etc.)<p>For Kubernetes specifically, &quot;kubectl explain pod&quot;, &quot;kubectl explain pod.spec&quot;, etc. will help you find what you&#x27;re looking for.')
