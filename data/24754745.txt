Item(by='AnonC', descendants=None, kids=[24755617, 24756476], score=None, time=1602513452, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24753940, text='When I saw the title, I thought maybe this could be a cheaper bundled offering for individuals (and <i>cheap</i> users like me). Then I read the description and see it’s a corporate solution. The recent announcement about analytics and about speeding up WordPress sites seemed interesting, but they’re out of my budget (yes, indeed). If there were some sort of bundle at a lower price for individuals running a handful of personal sites, that’d be quite interesting to me.<p>Off topic: I posted an off topic comment on one such announcement a few months ago asking why new domain registrations were still not open (only transfers are allowed), and got a reply about squatters being a problem, which I didn’t really understand because that could be the case even with domain transfers (in my understanding). I posted a follow up [1], but apparently that wasn’t seen. So I’m linking it here again for visibility if @eastdakota or @jgrahamc or someone else at Cloudflare can respond.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23976304" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23976304</a>')
