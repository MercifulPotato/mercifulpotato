Maybe it isn&#x27;t to you. So be it.<p>Computing has been a major part of my life for 35 years. I wish that I didn&#x27;t have dependence in proprietary software but I do. Within that context this matters a lot to me.<p>Normalizing the idea that the developers of proprietary software are acting ethically (if within their legal rights, which I would dispute) when they remove functionality is very troubling to me.<p>I would rather that this kind of behavior, on the part of developers, be both socially taboo and illegal. Failing illegal I&#x27;ll settle for socially taboo.')
