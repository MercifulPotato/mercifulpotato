The article just says:<p>&gt; Google violated US labor laws by spying on workers who were organizing employee protests, then firing two of them, according to a complaint to be filed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) today.<p>And then talks about the circumstances around the firing of those employees.<p>&gt; “This week the NLRB issued a complaint on my behalf. They found that I was illegally terminated for trying to help my colleagues,” Spiers said.<p>This also doesn&#x27;t refer to spying.<p>Is this title&#x2F;article just clickbait or is there any substantiation or further information around the &quot;spied on workers&quot; claim? I&#x27;ve done a quick bit of reading on other news sites and can&#x27;t find any mention of spying elsewhere.')
