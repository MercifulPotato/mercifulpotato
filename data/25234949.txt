And that&#x27;s not even getting into clauses baked into employment termination contracts. \nSo you have a scenario where you can&#x27;t actually &quot;prove&quot; race was a primary motivator for quitting because:\na) if it were a &quot;subtle racist&quot; co-worker, they&#x27;re probably using euphemism \na2) if they&#x27;re a &quot;not subtle racist&quot; co-worker, it would embarrass the employer for keeping that person on the book swhen the reputational cost exceeds the cost of sourcing and hiring someone who&#x27;s not a not subtle racist&quot;\nb) If the person wants to work in tech again, relationships will likely be burned as a direct or indirect result of airing out a company&#x27;s dirty laundry\nc) Could be sued for violating non-disparagement clauses (prices out anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the security to burn the bridge between them and a growth industry)<p>If the point of your comment was to use a number of premises that aren&#x27;t empirical, and border on dogmatic, then I misunderstood, and apologize for trying to search for rhetoric where it was not intended to be found.<p>If the purpose of the statements above where to be rhetorical or logical, then we&#x27;re getting into a place where we&#x27;re asking for evidence that would be difficult for someone with said evidence to do without them, say, being financially and occupationally secure enough to burn the bridges between them and:\n- Coinbase\n- Coinbase&#x27;s Investors\n- Coinbase&#x27;s Investors&#x27; LPs\n- Coinbase&#x27;s Investors&#x27; companies\n- Every other company that either doesn&#x27;t question whether they are less meritocratic than they believe, or doesn&#x27;t question whether or not they can replace the problematic superstar employees')
