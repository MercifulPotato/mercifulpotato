And even if it doesn&#x27;t end up as fully open sourced project, Google still releases white-papers on the subject that allows startups to create something similar (Cockroach-DB for instance).<p>However, while I admit that some decisions might be made to avoid benefitting competition (I think, that kind of stuff is way above my pay-grade), some things cannot be open-sourced for purely technical reasons (without a complete rewrite, that is). For instance, within Google everything is a protobuffer, and tools rely on that assumption heavily to work. Outside Google people don&#x27;t use protobuffers nearly as much and the usage of those tools would be very low.<p>Other tools are tied to Google having many datacenters and multiple fibers between each of them for redundancy. Like Spanner, which also requires atomic clocks to work properly.')
