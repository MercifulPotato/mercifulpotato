However, I can think of at least one possible disadvantage --<p>If these &quot;enhanced&quot; videos proliferate, then as a side effect there will be less desire for the original &quot;source of truth&quot; videos in grainy B&amp;W and low framerates.  I.e., this scenario: the original, primary-source video, based 100% on reality, gets 100 views on Youtube while the same video artificially manipulated to look better gets 100k.<p>Eventually the enhanced one has replaced the original, and possibly even the original gets lost, and in the future historians will only have our grossly-artificial reinterpretations of the video instead of the source of truth.<p>(but then again, YT is not exactly a historical archive, I&#x27;d imagine the originals should be archived properly to prevent this)')
