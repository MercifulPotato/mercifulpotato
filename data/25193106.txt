On demand power is what drives the modern world. It enables such luxuries and tools like computers, phones, power tools, the internet, etc. The grid responding no sounds like something that would be out of a 1980&#x27;s anti-USSR propaganda, and I can&#x27;t help but feel like such a world would be considered dystopian by most. And we currently don&#x27;t have the capacity or technology to store electricity for long periods (i.e. by renewables) without another support structure like nuclear or biomass.<p>Additionally, we don&#x27;t have electric vehicles&#x2F;machinery that can adequately replace many of the essential tools that we have today. Try mining on a fully electric system. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to get very far right now. Maybe some of these processing systems could be electrified but not the whole thing (hey, maybe we&#x27;d go small modular reactors and that&#x27;d power these machines? But I doubt it).<p>The reason I bring up such things like concrete and steel, besides the logistics of constructing them (again, getting heat is a problem), is because when we talk about fossil fuels it is really a proxy conversation for climate and emissions. It is a danger that we are only focusing on this and not other things.<p>&gt;&gt; One of the biggest challenges in climate is that the population has been so hyper focused with energy and transportation<p>I do think Gates[0] wrote a decent article on the subject matter and how we need to start widening our net if we&#x27;re really going to solve the problem.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gatesnotes.com&#x2F;Energy&#x2F;My-plan-for-fighting-climate-change" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gatesnotes.com&#x2F;Energy&#x2F;My-plan-for-fighting-clima...</a>')
