But instead of improving on particles or waves, he eliminated them as he proposed the warping of space and time.<p>&gt; Using newer mathematical tools, my colleague and I have demonstrated a new theory that may accurately describe the universe. Instead of basing the theory on the warping of space and time, we considered that there could be a building block that is more fundamental than the particle and the wave. Scientists understand that particles and waves are existential opposites: A particle is a source of matter that exists at a single point, and waves exist everywhere except at the points that create them. My colleague and I thought it made logical sense for there to be an underlying connection between them.<p>Link to the study (paywall) and abstract: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physicsessays.org&#x2F;browse-journal-2&#x2F;product&#x2F;1829-14-larry-m-silverberg-and-jeffrey-w-eischen-on-a-new-field-theory-formulation-and-a-space-time-adjustment-that-predict-the-same-precession-of-mercury-and-the-same-bending-of-light-as-general-relativity.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physicsessays.org&#x2F;browse-journal-2&#x2F;product&#x2F;1829-14-l...</a>')
