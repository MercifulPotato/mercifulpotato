From what I see, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justinguitar.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justinguitar.com&#x2F;</a> is a great resource if you got the self discipline.<p>I believe guitar is a very accessible instrument and an electric guitar is easy to practice silently late at night, relatively cheap (Squier Stratocaster Pack etc.) and easy on the fingers compared to, for example, an acoustic guitar.<p>With learning 4-5 chords, you can perfectly cover lots of great songs. Learning pentatonic scale is not that hard for improvising soloing over those chords with a cheap loop pedal. All under 200-250$ and half an hour a day for, let&#x27;s say, a year.')
