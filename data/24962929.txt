In the coming decade, getting a custom chip built will be on the same level as getting a PCB done 20 years ago.  That brings many other concerns, such as slipping some snooping logic onto a corner of a chip, which is activated only when some 2048-bit string is sent to wake it up.  Therefore, even when we have a Chip House build our chip, we&#x27;re still going to have to knock the tops off and do something similar to what Ken Shirriff does <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.righto.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.righto.com&#x2F;</a> to make sure there are no &#x27;extra&#x27; circuits.
