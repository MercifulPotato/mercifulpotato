We started by building software to map all outdoor ads and make them easy to buy and measure using data.<p>In doing so, we acquired customers like Squarespace, Shopify, GoodRx, KrispyKreme, and many others, and raised our Series A last year.<p>Now, the industry is undergoing a transition to programmatic buying (meaning auction-based buying, just like how you bid for ads on Google and FB.) We&#x27;re building the best platform to buy outdoor ads in real-time. We just launched this new product in June 2020 and we&#x27;re seeing significant growth.<p>For engineers, we&#x27;re looking for:<p>- Experience with Ruby, Rails, &amp; Postgres, or similar technologies. Our traditional-buying product is in React, our programmatic product is built with Stimulus Reflex. The back-end bidding system is in Kotlin &amp; Quarkus (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quarkus.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quarkus.io&#x2F;</a>)<p>- 3+ years experience working on production systems<p>- People who actively want the startup experience: taking a lot of ownership, having a big impact, and building amazing products that customers love.<p>Fill out our Google Form here if this sounds interesting to you!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;dCVT5tUgfpE87JcP8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;dCVT5tUgfpE87JcP8</a><p>For Product Managers &amp; Project Managers, we&#x27;re looking for:<p>- 2+ years experience in the role, preferably at a high-growth startup<p>- Beyond that, impress us :).
