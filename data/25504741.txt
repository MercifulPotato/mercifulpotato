Maybe it&#x27;s taking into account people who won&#x27;t accept it right away?<p>The vaccine is being rationed because of high demand. The moment demand drops, it no longer makes sense to ration it the same way.<p>Also keep in mind that distribution speed will increase over time as procedures and protocols are put in place and learned by everyone.<p>I suspect the majority of people who want to be vaccinated in europe will have their shot by september 2021.
