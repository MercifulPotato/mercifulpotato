If anything, it hinges on hubris: the censor assumes to know which content deserves to exist at all.<p>The need for censoring content still exists because certain kinds of content are deemed illegal, and failure to remove that may end up in serving  jail time.<p>On the other hand, <i>moderation</i> is named very aptly.<p>That said, I fully support the right of private companies to censor content on their premises as they see fit. If they do a poor job, I can just avoid using their services.')
