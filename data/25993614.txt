With no first party support, Stadia is just going to be a way to stream ports of games designed for consoles and PCs. Imagine if Valve released the Index, then announced that they aren&#x27;t making VR games any more. That&#x27;s basically what Google is doing by saying it isn&#x27;t worth it to develop games specifically for Stadia.')
