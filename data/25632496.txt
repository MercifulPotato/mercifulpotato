It&#x27;s inherently political, that&#x27;s the whole point of it. And the values from the mission statement does sound like something every company should aim for, but sometimes they forget we&#x27;re all humans here, so we need something to keep companies in check.<p>I&#x27;m not sure comparing unions to code of conducts are suitable. Unions are a historically old and proven way for workers to enact change in workplaces, industries and even entire countries. Code of conducts in open source is a fairly new invention (officially, written down ones at least) with no such track record.')
