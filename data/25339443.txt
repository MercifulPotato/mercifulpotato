Hence enabling SpaceX to fail-fast with confidence that they will be able to find the problem from the data and fix it.<p>Plus apparently they&#x27;re relatively cheap to build, that just makes the test even cheaper.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;spacex-with-a-manifest-of-70-missions-vows-to-safely-return-to-flight&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;spacex-with-a-manife...</a>')
