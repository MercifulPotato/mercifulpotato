Now they can do that, but it&#x27;ll take some effort.<p>On KYC I&#x27;d agree they&#x27;re in a better position, but it seems like they&#x27;ll still need to beef up their processes, as regulators are quite interested in proving where cryptocurrencies came from. They&#x27;ll not want to be caught with a load of coins that came from the latest ransomware incident.')
