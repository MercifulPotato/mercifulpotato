Which might explain why he gets so much coverage on HN and why his open source projects have such high degree of adoption from corporations... And receives such big contracts.<p>He writes a lot of nice uplifting pro-social articles, but keeps dancing around the real issues and doesn&#x27;t do enough to really help open source. From first-hand experience, he doesn&#x27;t even bother to answer emails or messages from community members or from authors of other popular open source projects.')
