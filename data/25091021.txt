It knows each types, it knows function to convert to each type, but... it doesn&#x27;t do the conversions! So frustrating! Why do I have to care about types in these dynamically typed languages??<p>Also, is sprintf-style string formatting the best example here? I think that feature is type strict in a lot of languages, after all you are declaring the types you want in the formatting string. I imagine most implementations of % in dynamic languages pass to sprintf internally?')
