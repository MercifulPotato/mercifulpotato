I&#x27;ve never purchased &quot;more than I need&quot; from Amazon. But probably about 10% of items purchased for the first time simply aren&#x27;t as advertised -- not Amazon&#x27;s fault, but the manufacturer&#x27;s. They don&#x27;t meet the needs you bought them for, so you have no choice but to return them. And of course clothing is notorious, because manufacturers still insist on making up their own idiosyncratic definitions of S&#x2F;M&#x2F;L, when simply providing measurements in inches or centimeters would fix most problems. (Also color-accurate photography, for when the item listed and photographed as red turns out to be orange-pink.)<p>&gt; <i>&quot;You&#x27;re lucky if half of all returns can still be sold as new, so a huge amount of merchandise has to be dispositioned via some other means â€” liquidation, refurbishment, recycling, or landfill.&quot;</i><p>Yup, that&#x27;s just how it works. That&#x27;s why I buy a lot of stuff &quot;open box&quot; off eBay -- especially things like dongles, adapters, cheap peripherals. They all come from returns from places like Amazon and Best Buy, but are half the price. It&#x27;s great.<p>This article isn&#x27;t surprising, except for one data point about a single bag that wasn&#x27;t resold. But they&#x27;re probably hiring minimum-wage workers to categorize returns, who make errors.<p>There isn&#x27;t really anything new in this article.')
