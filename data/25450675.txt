The approach you’re showing makes sense and it’s not unlike how I’d approach a one off&#x2F;internal project where I know the routes are all defined in a predictable structure. The benefit of the pseudo types I shared is that the only predetermined structure is the route factory call. It only needs to know input output and serialization types. It can be extended to use TS 4.1 template literal types to validate path parameters. But it’s application agnostic.')
