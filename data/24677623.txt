The other manufacturers do the same.<p>I have no real problems with my Windows and Linux setups though. I had a loaner MBP and Mac Mini for about a year for testing purposes and frankly I did not see a single thing (OS&#x2F;hardware) that would cause me to switch. So your statement about &quot;the least amount of problems&quot; is likely what you feel personally and does not really translate to what somebody else would fine.')
