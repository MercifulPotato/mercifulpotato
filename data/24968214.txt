Solutions could be resisting urges or open relationships (although I have doubts).<p>Anyway, my wife has contributed or provoked ideas, editing, and real life implementation of the ideas. She didn&#x27;t get interviewed.<p>I&#x27;m not famous (yet), I was a B+ student, I feel normal. But over the years strangers greeting me. IRL, or strangers being dissapointed in a personal political opinion, or the interviews make me realize it might happen.<p>I don&#x27;t want to destroy the family I love.')
