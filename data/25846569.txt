It feels pretty outdated at times. It feels almost unprofessional at times coming from a unix-like OS user space and has since the 90s. But then unix-like OSes have been a thing this whole time.<p>Yeah, I think Intel is our latest, greatest example of the follies of not regulating markets properly. Properly regulated, Intel would have been smacked around or incentivized against dominating the chip market &#x27;back when&#x27;. Given the factors required, this may have had to require state-led&#x2F;funded chip research and fab production. i.e. Effectively making a government do what TSMC did years ago - and privatize the actual results of the efforts at key points&#x2F;areas. Just enough public investment to push the market toward efficiency then back out. Proper regulation would have kept pressures in place to keep key technologies and manufacturing processes&#x2F;abilities from entirely leaving the local market, too.')
