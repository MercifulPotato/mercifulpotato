Ah, the good ol&#x27; person familiar with the matter. They should have also gotten a second opinion from someone &quot;familiar with Trump&#x27;s thinking&quot; while they&#x27;re at it.<p>Oh, and the headline for the article is written as if it factually happened, whereas in the article itself the FDA Chief himself denied that it happened. They didn&#x27;t even bother to add an &quot;allegedly&quot;, &quot;reportedly&quot;, etc. to the headline, they just wrote it as &quot;X happened&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s some serious journalism right there, nothing but the best from CNN. I&#x27;ll be waiting with bated breath for them to ever write a similar story about Biden &#x2F; his administration over the next four years, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll give him the same treatment; CNN being the strong bastion of impartial journalism we all know it to be.')
