I.e., are the incidences of disease less after removing the people who got measles who didn&#x27;t receive the MMR vaccine? Measles is known to strip the immune system of much of its memory, rendering people who have had it susceptible to all sorts of diseases they used to have protection against. I would not be surprised at all if this led to a large outcome differential for the vaccinated and unvaccinated, even if only a few of the unvaccinated caught measles.')
