So that is, in an efficient Tesla about 2 miles of range for every hour of peak sun.  Depending on your location, orientation and time of year you might expect peak sun hours of 3-6 hours&#x2F;day.  So grand total 6-18mi&#x2F;day of range added making a lot of happy assumptions and not moving your car during lunch.  This amount of charge per day could be acquired in 1-2 minutes at a supercharger and worth about 30-75cents.  Or charge at a L2 charger in your own garage in 12-36 minutes.')
