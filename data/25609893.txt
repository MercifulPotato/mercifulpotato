It&#x27;s had a dramatic improvement on every aspect of my life: health, weight loss, stress relief, mental fortitude, friendships, breathing, everything.<p>And in starting BJJ, you&#x27;re going to be _awful_ at it. No matter how athletic you are, you&#x27;re going to get destroyed (choked or joint locked) many, many, many times by people younger, older, weaker, stronger than you simply because they know more and have better technique. You really truly do start at the bottom.<p>It&#x27;s exhilarating. Every day after work (or before), you and a bunch of friends go into a padded room, put on pajamas with a thick belt, and attempt to strangle and&#x2F;or joint lock one another. You learn new techniques, body mechanics, and actual fighting techniques. When you&#x27;re rolling with someone else, literally every other stress in the world melts away as you&#x27;re trying to stop your opponent from submitting you while you&#x27;re trying to submit them. It truly is physical chess, and there&#x27;s nothing better than switching from the drudgery of a job to a night of martial arts.')
