You can pay a little more for a printer that is rated for more prints before needing a new drum. At work we were chewing through 2 brothers per year of the cheaper consumer grade type. Paid just a little more for an office version and it lasted until we stopped with faxes a few years ago. Now they bought an HP without asking me and it just sits in a corner because no-one can get it to work for very long. On the other hand paper usage is way down now so eco friendlier :)')
