No, it&#x27;s not universal or common that people feel more empathy for murderers or criminals. People might feel empathy with more context, when remorse is expressed and time has passed, this applies to both murderers and racists.<p>The examples in the TED talk are poor. If you&#x27;re in public relations, don&#x27;t make an offensive joke about not being able to get get AIDS in Africa because you&#x27;re white. If you&#x27;re in journalism, don&#x27;t plagiarize and make shit up. These people failed at the fundamentals of their job description.<p>Should the world just ignore racist tweets and the damage that racists&#x2F;racism causes? Should racists get the same cushy &quot;rehab&quot; murderers do, by putting them in prison?')
