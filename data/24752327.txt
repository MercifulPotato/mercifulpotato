Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=[24753888], score=None, time=1602489403, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745570, text='I might not like to see my inconsistencies, but I&#x27;d probably be fascinated by them.<p>For some, the natural drive towards reconciling inconsistencies would be helped by them being exposed that way.<p>For others, I might accept the inconsistency, and it would be fascinating to see which ones I made a choice to accept that way.  I don&#x27;t regard that as fundamental inconsistency anyway, because all statements are approximations, and apparent inconsistency can be a valid (and healthy) holding state while figuring out nuances, which can take a long time.<p>For yet others, I suspect I would conclude they aren&#x27;t inconsistencies in my own thinking, they are inconsistencies in how others &#x2F; the system interprets my thinking, and then I&#x27;d have to refine how I describe them.<p>If the system didn&#x27;t allow me to express the necessary nuances so it always regarded my thinking as inconsistent despite not really being so, that would be frustrating.  After all, that&#x27;s how it is with other people already: Invariably they believe I believe something that I don&#x27;t, and no amount of explanation sorts that out because, by and large, they aren&#x27;t interested in the necessary nuance.<p>The one key feature that would make a system pointing out my inconsistencies pleasant to use is:  If it were private advice, between me and the system.<p>The moment it becomes social pressure, public knowledge, pronouncements about me, that&#x27;s when it would stop being something I&#x27;d want to engage with.')
