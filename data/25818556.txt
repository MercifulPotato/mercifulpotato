They&#x27;re cold. In Japan salads are rare and usually nothing but iceberg lettuce and cherry tomatoes.<p>&gt;  who thinks that anything pickled is gross,<p>The pickled isle of a western super market has more pickled things than the corresponding Japanese super market. They&#x27;re just different kinds of pickled things.<p>&gt; normal Japanese meal generally has a pretty good mix of stuff<p>And similar in the west isn&#x27;t it? The normal family dinner is 1 meat dish (beef&#x2F;chicken&#x2F;pork&#x2F;fish), 1 starch dish (bread&#x2F;potatoes&#x2F;rice), 1-2 veggie dishes (salad, green beens, peas, carrots, etc...)<p>Japanese &quot;in general&quot; find many western things disgusting. Most Japanese find savory beans gross. As popular as cheese as become in Japan there&#x27;s still a large percentage of Japanese that have never eaten any or eat it rarely. This is especially true outside big cities where the culture is less influenced by the west.<p>Japanese often can&#x27;t eat anything other than Japanese food. There are plenty of tours of other countries where you can sign up to have all your meals prepared for you while abroad and all of it will be Japanese food.<p>Many Asian cultures (including Japan), for many people if you haven&#x27;t eating a bowl of rice you haven&#x27;t eaten.')
