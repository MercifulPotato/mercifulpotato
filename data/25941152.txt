It does <i>everything</i> which might be appealing to some, but for me it just meant everything was confusing, inconsistently labeled and documented, and&#x2F;or buried under 5 levels of menus or under buttons that made no sense.<p>The way I explain it is you know how when your computer illiterate parents ask you to do some simple task that you have literally no idea how to do, but you look at some menus  that have vaguely similar sounding titles based on your years of building up intuitions about how computer UIs work, click those menus, find what you need and do the task? GitLab breaks all those intuitions so easy tasks become hard.<p>YMMV, of course.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Sourceforge recently and am pretty happy with it overall, though it&#x27;s still <i>very</i> alpha quality.')
