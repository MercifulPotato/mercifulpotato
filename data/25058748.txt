They had a very interesting episode a while back about the economics of local news as well as how critical it is to the health of our society[1].<p>Once you stop paying people to sit in board meetings and town council sessions and listen for interesting stories you suddenly see a lot more corruption. It would be great if people could focus less on national&#x2F;international news and more on what&#x27;s going on locally. Local news helps tremendously by reporting on, contextualizing, and digging into all the local government&#x2F;business&#x2F;other activities that most people don&#x27;t have time to focus on.<p>For my part I&#x27;ve found a few (verified) local outlets run by local citizen that I subscribe to and I think it would be good if more people did the same.<p>I would not deal with the organizations in the article though as by admitting they are &quot;for profit&quot; they have already made their values and incentives clear. If they are siphoning off a large portion of their proceeds to go into the owners&#x27; pockets there is no way they can produce a quality product. This is not unique to the news industry.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wnycstudios.org&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;otm&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;local-news-on-the-media" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wnycstudios.org&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;otm&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;local-news...</a>')
