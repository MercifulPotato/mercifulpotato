A single naive one for py2 and two separate ones for py3 bytes and unicode. All casting between the two would have to be made explicit.<p>&gt; How would this all work with C modules?\nIn non-strict mode, you&#x27;d be able to use either py2 strings or py3 bytes with these, and gradually move all modules to strict mode which requires bytes.<p>And then, gradually after a decade or so attempt to get rid of all py2 types.')
