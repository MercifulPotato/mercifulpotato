Did I misread it?<p>My comment wasn&#x27;t very clear. Sorry about that. Usually we think of a judgment &quot;on the merits&quot; as one that occurs after considering both the law and facts of a case.<p>&gt; Do you mind elaborating on the difference?<p>In the case of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the judge in theory assumes that the facts alleged in the complaint are all true. If he dismisses the case, it is because <i>as a matter of law</i> the plaintiff cannot win. In such a case it is incorrect to say that the evidence was found to be lacking because the evidence was never considered.')
