I cleared all the rounds and impressed everyone, and the manager asked me to state what salary I&#x27;d like. It was a remote role, and I&#x27;m based in India.<p>The manager called me and he said everyone was super impressed with my performance in the interviews and wanted to know what Salary I was expecting.<p>My first question to him was do you have regional salaries. He said no. Canonical pays global salaries.<p>I&#x27;m a fairly good SDE2 who&#x27;s almost at an SDE3 level. I&#x27;ve given talks at PyCon India and the local Python Meetup group, where I also conduct workshops and seminars on topics ranging from security to web application design and python internals.<p>So I told him that a salary between 100 and 125K USD would be good.<p>He said 110 would be doable. He said any higher and the management would have issues. I was prepared to hear him negotiate till 75K mind you. I was super elated.<p>Two days later I get a form rejection letter saying I was passed on. I reached out to the manager and he said I asked for too much for my experience.<p>I specifically had asked him for his budget and what the role could pay, but he pretended that he could afford whatever I asked for. This leaves me with two thoughts.<p>1. The manager was unaware of his own budget and didn&#x27;t know if his company even had regional salaries or not.\n2. The company is looking to low ball people from cheaper countries even if they&#x27;re a great developers.<p>Tell me again why people should apply to Canonical?')
