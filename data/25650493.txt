I&#x27;ve worked on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kontxt.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kontxt.io</a> for a few years. Kontxt&#x27;s a multi-purpose online communication and engagement tool for 1.) ENTERPRISE productivity, 2.) interactive and remote EDUCATION, 3.) expandable native AD platform for digital publishers, and 4.) a SOCIAL network to share the best parts of the web. There&#x27;s a different business model for each solution.<p>I&#x27;ve built out the product. I&#x27;m looking for a partner with notable business and sales experience in at least one of these categories: enterprise, education, digital publishing and advertising, or social. I know HN is a tech community, but if you know anyone who&#x27;d be interested, I&#x27;d love to chat and see where the future takes us. Feel free to contact me at dbodin@kontxt.io.<p>Hope the new year is off to a positive start for everyone! :)')
