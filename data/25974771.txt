We need both.<p>Responsive package maintainers do not help in any way with Firefox zero days, vulnerable codec parsers in MPV, a weird LibreOffice extensions scanning all my files and sending it to a server, or a VS code extension downloading and running random binaries.<p>I want to get my packages from a trusted central repository. AND I want most of applications to be sandboxed and have restricted access permissions to the filesystem and network.<p>There is no reason why repos can&#x27;t package desktop applications in a way that runs them inside a sandbox by default, whatever the concrete implementation is, with me also having the ability to run randomly downloaded binaries with the same security guarantees.')
