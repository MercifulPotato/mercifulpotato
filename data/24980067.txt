The code compiles!&quot;<p>&quot;But where is this symbol defined?  How can it be in scope here?&quot;<p>&quot;The code compiles, but it doesn&#x27;t work, right?  It must be a compiler bug!&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the risk of learning a language &quot;on the job&quot; or from piecemeal tutorials, instead of reading a book or similar resource from start to end. Sometimes there&#x27;s a corner of the language that by chance you just haven&#x27;t seen yet, even after years.')
