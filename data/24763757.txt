Item(by='rzwitserloot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602581032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24763098, text='&gt; Is there anything stopping an organisation from defining some standard types of serverless environments?<p>Yes. Basic economics. There is nothing _technical_ stopping &#x27;an organisation&#x27; from making a federated twitter or facebook. But there are (evidently) insurmountable non-technical reasons: It hasn&#x27;t happened &#x2F; there have been attempts which have all effectively failed (in the sense that they have made no significant dent in these services&#x27; user numbers).<p>Why would e.g. Amazon (AWS) attempt to form a consortium or otherwise work together or follow a standard, relegating their offerings to the ultimate in elasticity? Economically speaking, selling grain is a bad business: If someone else sells it for 1ct less per kilo then the vast majority of your customers will go buy from someone else, there&#x27;s no product differentiation.<p>Serverless lockin (such as GAE or AWS Lambda) is the opposite. No matter how expensive you make the service, your users will stay for quite a while. But make a universal standard and you fly in one fell swoop to the other end of the spectrum. If I have a serverless deployment and the warts of serverless are fixed (which would, presumably, involve the ability to go to my source repo, run a single command, give it some credentials, and my service is now live after some compilation and uploading occurs) - then if someone else offers it 1ct cheaper tomorrow I&#x27;ll probably just switch for the month. Why not?<p>This cycle can be broken; but you&#x27;re going to have to paint me a picture on how this happens. Government intervention? A social movement amongst CEOs (After the war, there was a lot of this going around)? A social movement amongst users so aggressive they demand it? Possible, but that would require that we all NOT go to serverless until the services offering it come up with a workable standard and make commitments to it.')
