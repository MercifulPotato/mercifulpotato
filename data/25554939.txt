Then the hydrogen is piped to where it&#x27;s need, or stored in underground caverns for later use.<p>Power generation becomes entirely local via fuel cells. Since hydrogen can be stored for long periods of time, the intermittency problem goes away.<p>Although there would be a near-term loss of efficiency, the sheer simplicity of the solution is remarkable. It even eliminates the issue of down power lines cause fires, which is a major issue in California today.')
