Item(by='minimuffins', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609805647, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25639907, text='Guild has a connotation of workmanship and craft expertise, industriousness, etc. I do like that.<p>But there is also an existing phenomenon of various things calling themselves guilds (there are various &quot;freelancers&#x27;&quot; guilds, e.g.), but they do not function as an economic bargaining institution at all. They&#x27;re just professional organizations where people exchange contact info for networking purposes.<p>I think there&#x27;s no getting around the task at hand: rehabilitating the concept of a union of workers with shared interests and goals (even shared fraternity, if I&#x27;m gonna be super sentimental). It&#x27;s capital, it&#x27;s labor, it&#x27;s unions. New century, same basic stuff.')
