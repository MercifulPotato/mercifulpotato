A good coat, scarf, gloves, hat, and long-johns will keep you comfortable outside down to single digits (f).<p>Plus, when you&#x27;re outside doing stuff, it can feel pretty warm, even in 20 degree (f) temperatures.  One of the best feelings in the world is unzipping my coat on a brisk day while working outside and feeling that cold air hit my hot, sweaty torso.<p>Also, people adapt to cold pretty quickly.  Never-pants people are a thing, even in Russia.<p>People do complain about the cold though.
