Napster was shut down for copyright infringement. Bittorrent is blocked in some places on similar grounds (although, notably, BitTorrent itself is still alive and well - the law enforcement action has been against distributors of copyrighted materials and sites like TPB).<p>But even if someone really wanted to get Mastodon banned and created a server full of illegal material to give politicians the fuel they&#x27;d need, the law enforcement answer there would be to go after that host. The overall network would not be liable because it wouldn&#x27;t be hosting&#x2F;distributing the material.')
