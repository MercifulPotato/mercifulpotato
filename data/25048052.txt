If they indicate a 9 before intervention, they did so by comparing the feeling of this this trauma to the fuzzy memory of breaking a bone as a child and the more recent but less painful memory of burning their finger in the kitchen a couple weeks ago. Then they sit and suffer from this trauma at approximately that same level of pain for the next 2 weeks, they&#x27;ll have a new baseline to compare against.<p>It really sucks that we have no objective measure of pain; a tricorder that you could aim at someone and get a number back would be infinitely better than what we have now.')
