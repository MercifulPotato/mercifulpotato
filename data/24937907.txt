Anonymous functions weren&#x27;t as common in other languages when Ruby first got popular, so the older Ruby devs had to learn about blocks without talking about anonymous functions, and I think they mostly haven&#x27;t realized that the world has changed and there&#x27;s a common terminology that people coming in from other languages will know.<p>The one big quirk is that Ruby syntax doesn&#x27;t let you assign a block to a variable like you can assign a function to a variable in javascript. But you can work around that by using the lambda keyword or Proc.new with a block, which will wrap it into an object. Then you can use the &amp; sigil to pass that object into a method that&#x27;s expecting a block')
