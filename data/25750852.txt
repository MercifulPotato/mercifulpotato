Have a good sized, trusted, reachable community&#x2F;social group. Regardless of whether it&#x27;s a short term or long term disaster, this is always useful and would become essential in the long term case.<p>1. Be prepared to leave if it&#x27;s a <i>true</i> collapse.<p>2. Otherwise, prepare like you would for any other short-term disaster.<p>a. Water purification&#x2F;filtration system<p>b. Some water to last a few weeks, beyond that use (a)<p>c. 3-6 months of food stuffs (canned and dried goods)<p>d. Some method of cooking said food stuffs for up to a month (beyond that you&#x27;re dealing with a more complete collapse and there&#x27;s little to do short of having your own small scale farm)<p>e. Some method of charging&#x2F;running electronics without a grid (gas generator, solar panels, large batteries)<p>f. Some method of temporary heating (cooling is irrelevant, open the windows, but in the winter further north you <i>need</i> heat)<p>g. Stay healthy and fit, not crazy gym rat fit, but if you can&#x27;t walk 5 miles at a leisurely pace in 2 hours, you&#x27;re not close to healthy or fit.<p>h. Keep vehicles fueled (no less than half a tank) and a gas can topped off (use this periodically, fuel spoils)<p>i. Alternate mode of transportation (bicycle)<p>j. Basic tools for maintaining all or most of the equipment needed above<p>k. Have medications stored and ready to last at least a few weeks, longer for more critical conditions (my high cholesterol can be left untreated for extended periods, someone&#x27;s thyroid or heart condition cannot)<p>3. If you want to prepare for a total collapse and don&#x27;t want to leave the country acquire several acres of wooded land with a good sized garden plot and plant stuff. Have a fireplace&#x2F;wood burning stove for winter heating, possibly for cooking. Look into other techniques of sustainable living. Probably also weapons. Know your neighbors and develop associations that can help post-collapse, because going solo is not going to be much fun.')
