To be fair the ballpoint I use took me a while to find - Parker Jotter case with refills they now call &quot;QuinkFlow.&quot;  They write smoothly without requiring much pressure, with quite a thin line.  The only pen I found that can produce a thinner line is a Pentel Needle Tip with a 0.3mm ball.<p>The thing I love about any ballpoints though is that they are pressure-sensitive - they produce a lighter line with less pressure, which is great for sketches and shading.  I find that rollers are either on or off.<p>I never experienced the ballpoint ink not drying, in fact the opposite - ballpoint is usually dry instantly, while with rollers I have to be mindful and wait a few seconds or more with pooled ink.<p>The only issue I found ballpoint has that roller doesn&#x27;t is the &quot;ink turds&quot; you mention.  These happen especially when I try to draw long straight lines (maybe even with a ruler).  At the end of the line if I&#x27;m not careful I can end up with a giant drop of ink that can turn into an unsightly smudge.  But, I found a way around it - I need to keep rotating the pen so that different sides of the ball enclosure collect the ink, letting the collected ink get pulled into the paper.')
