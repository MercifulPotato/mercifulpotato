And if it could also throttle CPU performance, painting performance, and available cache memory to a &quot;typical user&quot; profile that would be ideal.<p>It would be best of all if that typical profile varied from day to day to cover a range of experiences of typical users, but the distribution was updated periodically from the lower quartile of the general web user population as measured by surveys.<p>In general: Fast developer machine for builds, slow <i>runtime</i> machine for using the application.<p>(In embedded and console games this has always been automatic :-)<p>If you don&#x27;t run the application on a separate machine, then simulate one instead.<p>But there&#x27;s no advantage in making IDEs, compiles and testsuites run slowly.  Just the target application.')
