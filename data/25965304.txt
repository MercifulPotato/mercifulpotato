From what I&#x27;ve learned from Europeans, there&#x27;s only one vaccine candidate of that nature the EU considered, a Sanofi Pasteur&#x2F;GlaxoSmithKline combo, the former providing the infamous spike protein, the latter an adjuvant.  <i>Everyone</i> expected this to work like the Novavax version of roughly the same thing that&#x27;s just reported good U.K. trial results, but Sanofi&#x2F;GSK&#x27;s didn&#x27;t provide a good enough response in the elderly.  They were expected to fulfill up to half of the EU&#x27;s requirements, but they&#x27;re restarting with a new Phase I trial next month or so, and they <i>might</i> have something ready by the end of 2021.<p>So if all that is correct, the EU ended up with a very big hole in their plans and not enough redundancy.  By comparison only because I&#x27;m in the USA and familiar with our efforts, 5 big bets were made with more than a billion dollars each in up front R&amp;D money.  Moderna and now Novavax are looking very good, AZ&#x2F;Oxford and one dose of Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s is looking OK, with a two dose study in progress for the latter that might show increased efficacy, and only Sanofi&#x2F;GSK failed in a really major way.')
