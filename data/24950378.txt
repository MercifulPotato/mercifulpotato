Across Europe and Asia, bears and people \n  probably competed for the same real estate for around \n  300,000 years; it probably wasn’t much of a contest, though. \n  These lumbering Ice Age giants stood 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) \n  high when they reared up on their hind legs, and the largest \n  males weighed up to 600 kilograms (1,320 pounds). That’s \n  about the size of a large polar bear or Kodiak bear today. \n  You wouldn’t want to meet one in a dark cave.</code></pre>')
