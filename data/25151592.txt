I&#x27;ve bought a bunch of music off there. It may not be as convenient, but I really like the idea of being able to pay artists directly and have them get most of it minus a small cut for Bandcamp.<p>I also tend to find music I like better on there, though that comes down to personal taste I suppose.')
