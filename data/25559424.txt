And yet I&#x27;m only half-way done. But not to worry, the final pieces are easy: (1) implement a semantic language model, (2) implement sharding to enable you to distribute your data across many machines and (3) implement voice-to-text. That would put us pretty darn close to us having a out-of-the-box turn-key Google-killer FOSS solution for anyone to deploy to the internets and make billion dollars on.<p>Which brings us to my proposal, which is, don&#x27;t pick Lucene or Elasticsearch when choosing your Google-slaying tech. Instead, pick a piece of tech that is specialized on solving the problems you&#x27;ll face in a web search engine context, that is maintained by someone who tirelessly try to outdo all of the state-of-the-art FOSS search tech out there, even though he is a single-member team.<p>Also, feel free to help out.')
