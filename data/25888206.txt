Wordpress has the &#x27;loop&#x27; you hook into and everything happens in it. Drupal has more of a pub&#x2F;sub model with hooks which seemed much easier to build standalone plugins. At the end of the day I&#x27;d say the most important part is understanding how they are built and where you are supposed to spend your time as a dev to make your users happy.')
