One plus is that I don&#x27;t need to install anything on my phone since it just uses WebRTC in the browser to send the cam&#x2F;mic feeds to OBS.<p>Of course, even once you get it set up on a tripod and pointed at your face, you will want to turn down screen brightness and keep it plugged in.  It works and it works well, but your phone may get warm and drain some battery if you are using it for hours at a time.  In the end I consider it a good backup option (used it when I forgot my webcam at another location) but I prefer the ease of a dedicated camera if I have the option.')
