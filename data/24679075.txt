I&#x27;ve gone from running Linux servers to describing them in Cloudformation definitions! Still using Linux on my desktop.<p>Made a good circle of friends from the local LUG and associated IRC channel. I met my now wife whilst she was over from abroad studying, and the channel welcomed her joining the chat when she went home for her final year. We&#x27;ve all known each other for 20+ years now.')
