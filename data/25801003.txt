You basically work the evening shift 6pm - midnight, 6pm - 2am, etc. You can get jobs where you basically look at a monitor with camera displays and walk around once per hour or so.<p>The benefit is you can write, code, etc on your personal computer during that shift if nothing is going on.<p>Not all security jobs are like it.
