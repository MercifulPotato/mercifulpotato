Here in France, if you have teeth problems, need glasses or eye surgery in order to not go blind or need to stay in the hospital, you better have good insurance (mutuelle). The state social security &#x2F;does&#x2F; pay for this, but the amounts are ridiculously low. I&#x27;m not sure what the prices are in the US, but healthcare over here is <i>not</i> free. Source: my mom had to undergo eye surgery (the mutuelle had to cover a fair chunk of the cost) and my father had to spend some time in the hospital for surgery; both where in &quot;state-approved&quot; clinics.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with how the US system works, but from what I understand this &quot;mutuelle&quot; thing looks like the employer health plans in the US. It&#x27;s also paid for by the employer over here, but you have to pay income tax on it.<p>I think that many people, at least when they compare the US to France, consider that the insurance paid-for by the employer is somehow &quot;free&quot;, or don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s there.')
