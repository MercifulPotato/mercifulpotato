The places with the strictest lockdowns are doing better than the places with fewer restrictions. However, the numbers aren&#x27;t so night and day different as to suggest that those additional lockdowns have been worth the price.<p>This is complicated by the fact that the places who were willing to be the most strict would have enacted policies much earlier, and thus didn&#x27;t actually need to be very strict.<p>I live in South Australia, where we&#x27;ve been extremely proactive in quarantining new arrivals since the start of the pandemic. We&#x27;ve only had two outbreaks (&quot;outbreak&quot; here meaning literally any locally-acquired cases) since March - the first one was ten cases over the course of about three weeks, during which we shut down almost every non-essential business and imposed very harsh maximum occupancy limits on essential ones. The second outbreak was ~30 cases, and we entered an immediate 6 day &quot;stage 4&quot; lockdown (that ended up only being 3 days) almost immediately after we found the first bulk of those cases.<p>Those measures are far more stringent than almost anywhere else in the world - the lockdown implemented at 18 local cases in November didn&#x27;t even allow going outside to exercise, something places with thousands or even hundreds of thousands of cases allowed - but it means that we only had to lock down for 3 days in the entirety of 2021, and it means that for the majority of the last year our lives have been completely normal.<p>My experience has been that the speed at which you react to an outbreak is far more important than how strict you are in reacting to it, as long as you meet some minimum threshold of responsibility. Our initial outbreak in March was completely eradicated just by social distancing, enforcing maximum occupancy requirements, and working from home where possible. It&#x27;s fine to have relatively loose restrictions as long as you&#x27;re willing to ramp them up drastically the same day you find more cases than you expected.')
