He has connections all over the NYC investment bank and hedge fund IT department world, and can literally call a few people up and get &quot;a&quot; well paying job at a hedge fund in a matter of hours. Some of these connections are billionaire CEOs&#x2F;fund managers.<p>The caveat to this is that he has to be extremely unpicky. Said job can be very undesirable other than the compensation - stuff like feeding XML feed files or working with VB, etc. But because they are at hedge funds, they all still pay well.')
