I think maybe I just misundertstood. The way everything i&#x27;ve read about this stuff says all of these platforms and instances should be able easily communication with other instances and platforms. So an account on a mastodon or funkwhale instance should be able to find and communicate with people on other mastodon instances or even other platforms using the fediverse&#x27;s open communication standards.<p>But, from your second link, people are saying to just make multiple accounts across instances and platforms.<p>I guess i&#x27;m not understanding the &#x27;open communication porotocols&#x27; part.<p>A bunch of them are listed as using ActivityPub. So does this not mean that having an account on an instance of a platform using ActivityPub should allow you to communicate with other platforms using ActivityPub?')
