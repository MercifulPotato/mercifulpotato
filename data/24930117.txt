I fail to understand who forces you.<p>You answered your own question.  It starts with distros defaulting to Wayland, despite it completely missing features I currently rely on in X11.  No big deal, I can always manually switch to X.  It&#x27;s only a small pain!  Then more and more software starts being Wayland-only, because most people are using it by default.  Not a huge deal, I can stick to older versions of software.  Then drivers are only released for Wayland, because at this point the only people left running X are me and a few other folks like me.  Meanwhile, the features I consider absolutely necessary are still missing, because the primary source of funding is no longer hobbyists but corporate vendors.<p>I have seen it happen before, with GNOME.  A decade or more after the cascade of attention-deficit teenagers started stripping out features it is still missing plenty.<p>&gt; People created Duvian. If systemd is such an awful choice it should be amazingly popular.<p>You miss the corrupting influence of money.  Money means resources, and resources mean being able to extend tentacles into every project.  Resources mean being able to present an offer to other projects that they can&#x27;t refuse: patches that implement needed functionality and, oh yeah, also mandate systemWaylanD.')
