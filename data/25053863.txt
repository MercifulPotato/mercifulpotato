It makes a lot of sense to simply ship a pre-configured OS when pushing HTPCs.<p>You could say that making it Linux-based shows that SteamOS is all about Windows, but if anything that logic suggests it&#x27;s all about <i>the Xbox</i>. If it were competing with Windows it&#x27;d be a KB+M-based distro.<p>If you say &quot;but they didn&#x27;t need a separate Linux distro, they were already focusing on Ubuntu&quot;, that just proves that SteamOS wasn&#x27;t about Windows.')
