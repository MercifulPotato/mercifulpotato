Understanding that it&#x27;s ok to contact strangers &#x2F; organisations outside of professional interaction, to ask them a few questions. Doing things for fun and involving others.<p>- If he is good with instructions, maybe it&#x27;s an idea to have small flow charts in a small notebook to help with things like communicating or decision making? The flowchart could direct him to a templates asking for help, signaling discomfort etc.  (just like so many people could use some help in writing effective emails).<p>- maybe he can keep an online notebook, to journal his activities &#x2F; learnings, projects. to practice his communication, sort his thoughts. As a reference for communicating with others.<p>- Kinda meta, but perhaps there is value in involving or stimulating him to have informal (slow and spaced) interactions with people around the topic of your post. Just talking to people in the professional (or hobby) field. You can set up questions or talking points together, or even a plan, get some insights, meet people, practice interaction .. no pressure, no strings attached. Just make sure the other person understands the goal and keeps it positive &#x2F; light. I&#x27;m sure there are people open for this and they will have more to offer than me haha.<p>- ... and then of course you can wrap all this up in a project supporting people with autism in computerworld.\n(I don&#x27;t mean this condescending! I&#x27;m just reasoning that your family is the most suited to address this topic, and it&#x27;s a worthy thing to work on. Granted it might be draining  to work on.)')
