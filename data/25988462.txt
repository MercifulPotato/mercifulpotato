The motive was to be free of the unfair influence of any one state.  Brasilia copied that idea (it&#x27;s amazing how visually similar it is in many ways to DC).  ...and you might say Constantinople was the original.  Similarly, most US state capitols are intentionally NOT their largest city (ie NYC is not the capital of New York State).   ...even Vermont chose Montpelier instead of Burlington.')
