Money&#x27;s a bit tight, but they can pay you with food and a couch to sleep on. You&#x27;ll have to share the room with ~15-30 baby chicks, though. You&#x27;ll quickly get used to the smell.<p>I understand that this won&#x27;t give you a vertical garden, but unlike a vertical garden, it <i>will</i> go most of the way to meeting your daily caloric and nutritional needs.')
