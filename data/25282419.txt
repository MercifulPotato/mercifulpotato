I&#x27;m saying you can add those in to your diet, not meat. I&#x27;m not claiming we need to inject these missing nutrients into the meat, and I&#x27;m not claiming that our body manufactures them from sources where they are absent. But your implication here is that humans eat only one type of meat from an animal that provides all nutrients we need. That&#x27;s not true, and it&#x27;s stupid to think that. You really need to try to understand the science of this topic because you&#x27;re out of your depth, clearly. Stop putting words in peoples&#x27; mouths.')
