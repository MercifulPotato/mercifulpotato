If you have a low self-esteem, you could develop this peronality where you are constantly judging others, and trying to control and make them perfect, because they are part of <i>your</i> life.<p>This could have been caused by constant criticism received during childhood, or abusive parents who were themselves perfectionist in treating you, and didn&#x27;t show enough acceptance, pride and love.')
