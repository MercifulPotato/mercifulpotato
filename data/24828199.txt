This includes content (will they understand this acronym?), but also includes how they are likely to interpret the tone of your message. Punctuation, grammar, emojis, etc. help to communicate tone -- but that doesn&#x27;t lend itself to a blanket &quot;always use punctuation&quot; statement. Being too formal can appear cold and aloof; being too informal can appear apathetic or unkind.<p>It&#x27;s also important to consider the range of reactions. For those who understand an acronym, they likely won&#x27;t even notice; for those who don&#x27;t understand it, they risk losing face and potentially looking like an idiot when they have to ask what the acronym means. The &quot;time saved&quot; is helpful, sure, but considering how people will respond goes beyond &quot;how much time will they spend asking a follow-up question?&quot; and also includes &quot;how will they feel if they don&#x27;t understand this?&quot;')
