Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607341748, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25330458, text='&gt; What&#x27;s your take on how everything works these days?<p>Mostly, I wish technologies to make unreliable P2P transfers more robust had been widely applied to point-to-point transfers.  I wish my phone, for instance, used low-data-rate UDP (with TCP-friendly flow control and a low priority IPv6 QoS) with a rateless forward error code (such as Network Codes) to download updates.  There&#x27;s no reason an update download should just fail and start over if WiFi is spotty or you move between WiFi networks.<p>Power, CO2, and cost efficiencies of scale due to centralization are nice.  The shift to mobile makes P2P more challenging, see Skype switching to a more centralized architecture to make mobile conversations more stable.<p>I wish we had somehow come to a point where users were incentivized to use P2P programs that marked P2P traffic using the IPv6 QoS field to flag P2P traffic, rather than relying on heuristics to try and shape traffic.  Using heuristics to shape traffic incentivizes P2P traffic to use stenography and mimic VoIP or video chat, making everything less efficient.  Monthly data quotas at different QoSes, after which all the traffic gets a low priority, would incentivize users to use programs that explicitly directly signal traffic prioritization to the routers.<p>Comcast&#x27;s traffic shaping attempts using heuristics seem to have caused it to forge RST packets when Lotus Notes (mostly used by enterprises) downloaded large attachments, breaking attachment downloads.[0]<p>&gt; Do you miss p2p?<p>Sometimes.<p>&gt; Do you think we could ever get back to it?<p>I think that really depends on corporate censorship (with and without government pressure) trends in the near future, and how hard the average person wants to push back.  I think P2P is unlikely to see a major resurgence any time soon.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20071114&#x2F;175325.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20071114&#x2F;175325.shtml</a>')
