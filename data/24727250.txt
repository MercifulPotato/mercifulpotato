A hardware design, like a battery, is not copyrightable in general. The technical drawings or a written description can be copyrighted, but the abstract technology and process cannot. Under copyright laws, it&#x27;s illegal for me to duplicate your documents, but there is nothing to stop me from reverse-engineering or duplicating the same process or hardware [0], and I&#x27;m also allowed to write about this technology in my own words. Only patent laws can grant a period of exclusive control of an abstract technology to its inventors.<p>[0] If I obtained your documents illegally, it would be trade secret infringement, which is an independent issue from copyright nor patent.')
