Gnome&#x27;s HIG is only followed by the 5 or 6 core apps that ship with it. The rest of my apps do their own thing (yes, even gtk-based ones).<p>From my personal perspective as someone who uses both KDE and Gnome daily, both are just windows and a bunch of panels. What gives KDE an edge for me is that it doesn&#x27;t try to force its weird conventions on me.')
