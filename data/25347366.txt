Symptoms started to mimic others with an MTHFR mutation.  That mutation results in less production of some enzyme that metabolizes folate into another form (eventually leading to the form I posted 5-something-or-other).  Taking that supplement allows you to bypass the folate conversion metabolic pathway.<p>How does this all fit together?  I&#x27;m not entirely sure, this is an emerging area of research, I can only share what worked for the person I know.  This MTHFR business seems to be related to histamine levels as well, that methlylated folate seems to be used by the liver to metabolize histamine.  This seems to be directly related to allergic immune responses.<p>Hypothesis:  Most people can tolerate the small amount of immune response triggered by the a-gal protein.  People with MTHFR mutations cannot.  The exact causative pathway, TBD.')
