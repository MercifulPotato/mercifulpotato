It’s almost like an acceptable form of doodling. But I rarely ever go back to my notes. I think everything in my notebook can fit in one page in terms of useful information. I hated when my managers would tell me writing things down is important. If it’s important, I’ll document it correctly, not scribble it in a book.')
