Add to that minimum contract terms and difficulty cleaning machines, and it was a pain to manage.<p>That&#x27;ll do it. I&#x27;m using the Buildkite elastic stack, which took me about 20 minutes to start using and 4-5 hours to dial in to ideal settings (eg adding IAM to allow deploys from agents, getting the right size spot instances etc).')
