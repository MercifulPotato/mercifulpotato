The fact that there&#x27;s zero reason to go outside aside from groceries makes life really boring. I feel like I&#x27;m once again stuck in my small hometown where there was nothing to do. Every day feels the same. \nThis started to negatively impact my work - I feel like I&#x27;m back to being a junior developer except without the drive and passion I had back then. I just feel apathetic about working in general and I do the bare minimum because there&#x27;s nothing to look forward to after work.')
