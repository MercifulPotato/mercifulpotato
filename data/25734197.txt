He&#x27;s a co-founder and partner at YC. Both defendants were the children of parents who were involved with early UNIX, one at Bell Labs and NSA, and the other as founder of the Mark Williams Company.  One kid got probation, community service and a fine.  The other was not so fortunate.  If we compare the actual damages caused by each, the result seems to violate any notion of proportionality.')
