Many &quot;scratch an itch&quot; tools such as Google bus schedule lookup, employee tenure lookup, or massage-room booking originated in 20% projects.  The &quot;internal social media&quot; of Google such as &quot;moma badges&quot; (&quot;achievements&quot; for e.g. writing 100 CLs or contributing to a particular fixit -- anyone could add new ones) and the internal joke image board &quot;memegen&quot; also originated as 20% projects.<p>This kind of modest, privste service was much lower-commitment than trying to single-handedly kick off a new external-facing service.  Having all these volunteer-built projects around created a good vibe of being part of a community of engineers, each building whatever we needed to make our days better and sharing it with our coworkers.')
