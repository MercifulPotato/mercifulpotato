I agree with Heinlein that &quot;a good idea is worth one bottle of scotch&quot;; that the execution is where the vast majority of the work is and where the vast majority of praise should lie.<p>And that&#x27;s coming from someone who&#x27;s not as bullish as some on Apple&#x27;s execution.  I think AMD&#x27;s cores are better and compared 1&#x2F;1 on the same process node Apple would look a little behind overall.  But Apple for sure gets praise for their execution here (optionality in store order), which is remarkably good.')
