All banner notifications are turned off (this might change if you can swipe up to temporarily hide them like on Android).<p>1. Only a couple of important messaging apps (SMS, Signal) give me real notifications: the phone vibrates and they appear (hidden) on the lock screen.<p>2. Other messages like Slack and get delivered to the notification center, but can&#x27;t appear on the lock screen.<p>3. Notifications that I need to eventually respond to are set to badge only. The badge count annoys me so I eventually look at it, but notifications that I&#x27;m intentionally delaying don&#x27;t busy up the notification center.<p>I&#x27;ve found that this only somewhat works and also drives a new behavior. Previously I wouldn&#x27;t check my phone unless I was bored and wanted to read something like Twitter or Hacker News. Now, however, I&#x27;m grabbing my phone often to see if I had quiet notifications delivered.<p>In some ways this is worse than just letting the phone buzz. The mental distraction from thinking &quot;I have have a Slack message&quot; seems to loom more than the knowledge that something came in that I&#x27;m ignoring in order to focus.')
