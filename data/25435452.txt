Anything marginally complex and you have to stop what you’re working on and really read the regex to try to understand what it’s doing.<p>SQL isn’t hard, but trying to remember all the use cases for the various ways to query something always trips me up. “Wait, do I do a LEFT JOIN here? Ok, now I gotta to look up the different kinds of joins so I can be sure I’m writing the most efficient query.”<p>Again, it’s just a matter of practice. I’d take SQL over a regex any day.')
