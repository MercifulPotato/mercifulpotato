Linux is also based on unix. As are Android and ios.<p>The more we add to these operating systems, the harder it becomes to walk away from them because we have so much invested in them.<p>Does this mean that in 200 years we&#x27;ll still be using the descendants of these early operating systems? Under what circumstances would someone decide to start something truly new? And what would it take to ever reach a feature parity with the existing options?<p>And to be clear, I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s a reason to walk away from these. I&#x27;m not an operating system programmer, I don&#x27;t even really know that much about it. I&#x27;m just wondering if it will always make sense to just keep adding to what we already have.')
