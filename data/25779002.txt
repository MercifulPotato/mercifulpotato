This is actually why there&#x27;s a song titled &quot;kill the president&quot; on the first offspring album.<p>I wonder, regardless of what Twitter will do, what the law is in the case of this tweet? In any case, saying you want to kill anybody is a bad idea. We should place a greater expectation for good behavior on the president of the united states as compared to any random moron on Twitter.<p>I&#x27;m not really talking about what Twitter should do here, though. Rather, as a general matter, the president of the united states should be held to a higher standard than most of us.')
