XP needs Pentium instructions, though, I believe.<p>All the versions of Windows I&#x27;ve seen will run in lower than the stated minimum amount of RAM. Windows 3.0 needed 2MB for Standard Mode and 4MB for 386 Enhanced Mode, but you could force it to start in either in 1MB.<p>Often, they will not _install_ in less than the minimum, but once installed with more, you can reduce the amount, and they will boot and run.<p>My home fileserver in the mid-1990s was an IBM PS&#x2F;2 with 12MB, running NT Server 3.51.<p>When XP was new, I think the recommendation was 128MB, in which it ran poorly. 256MB was OK, 384 usable for light use, 512MB good. My laptop maxed out at 192MB. :-(')
