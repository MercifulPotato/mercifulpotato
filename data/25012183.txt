In fact, I&#x27;m delighted! I think the &quot;run-based&quot; machinery that can be traced back to Rogue (with all the trappings that tends to imply: tangible loss upon death, random layouts, etc.) have been one of the best trends in gaming of the past decade.<p>It&#x27;s similar to what happened to RPGs. Remember what &quot;RPG&quot; used to mean in the 90s? Then remember when games starting incorporating &quot;RPG elements&quot; (e.g. character progression through leveling and experience points) into other genres? Turns out there were some widely-applicable, generally good ideas that had mostly only surfaced themselves in classic RPGs that took years to gradually diffuse into the medium at large. So goes the roguelike.')
