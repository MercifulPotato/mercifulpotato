Still, are there many public clouds built of these Ampere Altra-s? Maybe we gonna have them widespread soon, but until then I wouldn’t want to build stuff that only runs on Amazon or my own servers with only a few on the market and not yet globally available on retail.<p>Also, AFAIK on ARM the parts where CPUs integrate with the rest of the hardware are custom. The important thing for servers, disk and network I&#x2F;O differs across ARM chips of the same ISA. Linux kernel abstracts it away i.e. stuff is likely to work, but I’m not so sure about performance portability.')
