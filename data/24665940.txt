If I&#x27;m in a one on one chat &#x2F; conversation with someone I like to ask them how they&#x27;ve been &amp; what&#x27;s going on. An extension&#x2F;plugin for an existing tool might be interesting e.g. teams, slack etc. I tend to agree with other comments about an app not being able to replace the spontaneous in-person conversation we&#x27;re talking about though.')
