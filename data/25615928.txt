I work from home, so even if I moved to Miami for a year and didn&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s not like a huge setback, I can move somewhere else next year.<p>I think it&#x27;s more about finding the right people to network and be friends with (people with similar interests, other angel investors, etc.), regardless of city, and I think that&#x27;s easier in larger cities. For example, I&#x27;m hesitant about Denver or Austin because of all the Leftists politics, which is why Houston&#x2F;Miami is more appealing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inc.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;201908&#x2F;hannah-wallace&#x2F;miami-florida-entrepreneurship-scene-startup-neighborhoods-business-city.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inc.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;201908&#x2F;hannah-wallace&#x2F;miami-flo...</a><p>Maybe Houston will have a better year after a bad 2020? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.houstonchronicle.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;article&#x2F;Houston-s-nascent-startup-scene-struggles-as-15206406.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.houstonchronicle.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;article&#x2F;Houston-s-...</a><p>I&#x27;m still considering lots of options, my lease is up in about a month.<p>Thank you for both of your comments! :)')
