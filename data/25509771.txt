Thinking of it this way allows one to see the system more clearly, <i>and in turn manipulate it to one&#x27;s own ends</i> (and very easily, provided those embedded within it are unaware of the situation, which is very much the case).<p>If (even for the sake of discussion) one assumes this to be the case, then availing oneself of this very same technique (and do it better, leveraging superior thinking &amp; magnitude of compute (via crowd-sourcing), lower requirements for stealth, etc) to fight back seems like a no-brainer to me.<p>Getting those who live within such a system <i>to even consider</i> this possibility on the other hand, this is not an easy task.  I see no no-brainer way to go about this, other than just talking about it explicitly.  I&#x27;m essentially proposing that we apply the very same systems analysis techniques that we would use at work to the very system we live within, but it seems this is a very non-intuitive idea.')
