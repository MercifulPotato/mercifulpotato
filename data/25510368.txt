Although, I should say it&#x27;s crazy how good the best readers from Zebra are <i>and</i> especially crazy how good vision api&#x27;s from Dynamsoft are!  They can read up to eight PDF417 codes simultaneously!!<p>Tbh, barcode thermal printers need an open source print driver other than Cups.  I&#x27;ve been working on a project that both involves printing custom labels with Data-matrix qr codes and scanning them.  Unless you pony up $400+ for a Zebra printer that has a &quot;direct print&quot; api that allows you to bypass common print drivers - using Cups is a huge pain.  In many cases (at least on macs) it&#x27;s nearly impossible to use a web passthrough to your local cups driver and commonly submitting a sequence of jobs incurs a 3-5 second delay between jobs.  I now realize why there are entire companies built on top of proprietary print drivers and RPC channels to talk to printers.  It&#x27;s not that surprising though, since most of this problem space has been dominated and solved by Point of Sale companies.  I&#x27;d definitely be open to any suggestions as to how I could better integrate printing to a rollo and scanning from a scanner or mobile device in a react app!')
