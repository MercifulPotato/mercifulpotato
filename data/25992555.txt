And real progress (i.e. getting a fully working distro for our intents at the time) was only seen after money were thrown and a contract was signed.<p>The bottleneck however paid off imo - Red Hat insisted on doing things slow and steady, so once things started landing in the distro, they just worked. Unlike other distros which touted aarch64 support early, but struggled to fix issues along the way.<p>I remember working with OpenJDK and Opendaylight on aarch64. The crashes I&#x27;ve seen were terrifying. The JVM crashed so hard, our expert Java developer laughed 30 minutes straight looking at one trace. To this day I have no idea what was so funny, as he couldn&#x27;t explain it in a simple manner and I lost interest.<p>Anyway, thank you Red Hat developers for all the work (minus the systemd &quot;architects&quot;, but that&#x27;s a different story).')
