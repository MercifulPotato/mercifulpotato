It wasn&#x27;t just a series of bad choices by the startups that got them here, it was concentration of an emerging market over 10-15 years.<p>Amazon dominates conversations because they extract the most value from open source projects. They make more money selling PostgreSQL, MySQL, Elasticsearch, _Docker_, Linux, etc than the creators of those projects. It&#x27;s not the only perspective, but it dominates for a reason.<p>Startups OSS their work because it helps them get users and figure out what to build. Amazon has the benefit of watching which projects become most viable (frequently because the startup threatens their revenue somehow) and packaging them up as their own services.<p>I want to live in a world where smaller startups _can_ OSS their work and also monetize it. And I&#x27;d like them to be able to do it without raising $100mm in VC.')
