Item(by='013a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609780085, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25634132, text='Discord is definitely in the same realm of scale as Slack, and probably bigger (they publish different metrics, so its hard to say for sure).<p>The really impressive thing about Discord&#x27;s scale is the size of their subscriber pools in the pub-sub model. Discord is slightly different than Slack in the sense that every User on a Server receives every message from every Channel; you don&#x27;t opt-in to Channels as in Slack, and you can&#x27;t opt-out (though some channels can be restricted to only certain roles within the Server, this is the minority of Channels).<p>Some of the largest Discord servers have over 1 million ONLINE users actively receiving messages; this is mostly the official servers for major games, like Fortnite, Minecraft, and League of Legends.<p>In other words, while the MAU&#x2F;DAU counts may be within the same order of magnitude, Discord&#x27;s DAUs are more centralized into larger servers, and also tend to be members of more servers than an average Slack DAU. Its a <i>far</i> harder problem.<p>The chat rooms are oftentimes unusable, but most of these users only lurk. Nonetheless, think about that scale for a second; when a user sends a message, it is delivered (very quickly!) to a million people. That&#x27;s insane. Then combine that with insanely good, low latency audio, and best-in-class stability; Discord is a very impressive product, possibly one of the most impressive, and does not get nearly enough credit for what they&#x27;ve accomplished.<p>For comparison; a &quot;Team&quot; in Microsoft Teams (roughly equivalent to a Discord Server or Slack Workspace) is still limited to 5,000 people.')
