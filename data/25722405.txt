More op amps?<p>FPGA&#x27;s can&#x27;t do that (or at least one&#x27;s mere mortals can buy), but Cypress have a line of parts called PSoC (programmable system on chip) which can effectively synthesize analogue cells like op-amps in an analogous way to an FPGA. They also have a cut-down (surprised?) version of verilog, so you can write a few CPLD-y verilog modules to go on it as well.<p>The dev boards are very reasonably priced, well worth having one around to play with - can&#x27;t comment on using them at scale. Cypress have some pretty good video lecture&#x2F;tutorials on using them by Alan Hawse (Who is very stereotype-engineer <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0IKuUgEWAqg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0IKuUgEWAqg</a>)')
