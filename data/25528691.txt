To me, BotW feels more like a game engine and less like a game.  My biggest issues:<p>&gt; Content sparsity.  Like many open world games, most of Hyrule just feels dead to me.  Towns aren&#x27;t as populated and lively as OoT &#x2F; WW &#x2F; MM, the main reason being that there aren&#x27;t as many overlapping storylines that have you return to the same location as you progress through the game.  The game basically encourages you to clear a region and never return.  The random encounters are repetitive.<p>&gt; The shrines, what the heck were they thinking?!  It feels like Nintendo hired a bunch of interns that year and needed to give them something to do.  All the shrines were clearly made in a generic level editor.  Felt really out of place to me.<p>&gt; Most of the music in BoTW is quiet and subdued, unlike previous entries in the series.  This is good for setting a certain tone, but it&#x27;s less effective unless there&#x27;s some flashier music to contrast with.  To me, the lack of music made the game feel even emptier.<p>&gt; Shallow combat mechanics, even compared to other entries in the series like OoT.  Just mash buttons until enemy dead.  Armor &#x2F; weapons don&#x27;t really matter beyond the stat boosts and occasionally some elemental matching.  Guardians &#x2F; Lynels require some strategy, but once you figure out the tricks it&#x27;s not hard to brute force those too.<p>I had fun playing, for sure.  It just doesn&#x27;t rank very highly on my list. \n I&#x27;m looking forward to BotW 2, where hopefully they&#x27;ll use their game engine to make a great game!')
