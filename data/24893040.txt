If you&#x27;re going 1,000,000MPH and fire propellant at 500MPH in your direction of travel, it would travel at approximately 1,000,500MPH and you would decelerate below 1,000,000MPH, so you actually wouldn&#x27;t run into it. There&#x27;s no drag on your exhaust in space like there is in an atmosphere...')
