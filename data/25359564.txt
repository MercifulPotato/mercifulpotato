I think a lot of people would understand this better if they experienced burn out.<p>I used to spend a lot of time working. Then over time that just started destroying me. I got let go from my job and while I had noticed this a bit, particularly on vacations, I had no idea how to &quot;not work.&quot;<p>My stress level was through the roof and I had no outlets for anything.<p>2020 has been the year of me trying to create a life outside of work. Kind of a weird ass year to try it but despite 2020 being 2020, I&#x27;ve rediscovered my love of reading, really started learning music theory, and a bunch of smaller things.<p>I should be able to go into 2021 a lot better as a person and feel my life is &quot;better&quot; in a lot of ways that it was previously pretty poor. I still don&#x27;t think my life is amazing or great or anything, but baby steps.<p>A big change in mindset to accomplish a lot of this is that my job exists to plan for the future (planning for retirement has been a big deal this year), it pays for me to have fun (enjoy the now), and it pays for me to pay my bills to live. My job is not my life, it&#x27;s a means to an end. I show up, I do my job, and I leave at the end of the day and I don&#x27;t think about work until I come back in the next morning.')
