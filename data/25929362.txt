E.g if you make 1,000,000 of $1 bets on slots in registered and regulated online casino then you&#x27;ll actually retain 95-98% of the money. People who are addicted to gambling and risk aren&#x27;t there to bet $1 so they lose everything much faster.<p>It&#x27;s can be different for offline gambling where people go to play once in a month, but online companies related to gambling work hard to avoid burning people out too fast. After all they want sustainable income which come from audience that trust them.<p>Stock market on ther side doesn&#x27;t have anything like this and it&#x27;s can make people go broke much faster than casinos do.')
