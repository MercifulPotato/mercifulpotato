The response to &quot;my legitimate tool was attacked because people thought it was for X&quot; should not be to talk about the problem of X and why it&#x27;s important. It should be to figure out how we prevent useful tools from being taken down. Amplifying a different problem, the fear of which led to breaking a useful tool, does not help.<p>Also, if you don&#x27;t want something downloaded, don&#x27;t post it on the Internet in the first place. The problem you&#x27;re talking about isn&#x27;t that photos get downloaded, it&#x27;s how those photos are subsequently used.')
