For an established PDU session the IP address is fixed, and does not change during a handover.<p>For information MIP is used between S-GW and P-GW (PMIP IIRC), so there can be IP addresses changes when the HO is such that the S-GW changes. Still, this is transparent to the UE: it&#x27;s a change at the tunnel level, and the UE traffic flowing inside this tunnel is not affected.<p>BTW what &quot;anchor&quot; means here is that the IP address the UE gets is routed to the P-GW. From then on the traffic is tunneled to the UE across the cellular network core and radio access networks, but all this is transparent for the end device. There&#x27;s a first leg from P-GW to S-GW, then from S-GW to the eNB (the base station), then the over-the-air and last leg to the mobile device. That&#x27;s 3 tunnels joined together to transport data seamlessly from P-GW to UE. During a HO the radio one always changes, the S-GW to P-GW rarely changes. And the P-GW is fixed to provide IP session continuity.')
