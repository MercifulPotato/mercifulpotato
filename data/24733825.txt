Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602273759, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24732676, text='&gt; I find it interesting that the story of &quot;Genesis&quot; in the Bible basically goes through the order of operations for how the universe formed (aside from a couple of the days out of order...but it is very close).<p>As a Christian but decidedly not a biblical literalist, that&#x27;s...just not true, without a whole lot of strained appeal to metaphor informed by knowing the answer you want it to get to.<p>Genesis has two mutually incompatible creation stories, and while the reference to &quot;days&quot; means this has to refer to the first one, its not really true of either of them.<p>I mean the first one has creation in this order of days:<p>(1) Light, day vs. night<p>(2) separation of the waters (which, incidentally, appear to preexist creation, as they don&#x27;t get created anywhere) into waters above and waters below, divided by a &quot;firmament&quot; which is named Heaven.<p>(3) Gathering of the waters below the firmament into one place (the Seas), producing dry land as side effect. And the creation of grass, herb-yielding seed, and fruit trees on the land.<p>(4) Creation of the Sun, Moon, and stars.<p>(5) Creation of sea and avian animals.<p>(6) Creation of (non-avian) land animals, including man.<p>That&#x27;s more than a couple days out of order.')
