A $50 set of Anker Soundcore&#x27;s will remove engine noise but not a noisy neighbor - I like them for travel because the battery is solid and I won&#x27;t cry if I lose them.<p>On the other hand, a $400 set of Sony&#x27;s will basically put you in audio isolation - to the point that some people genuinely don&#x27;t like them. A friend had me put his pair on in the middle of a busy restaurant at lunch time and I&#x27;m not kidding when I say it felt pin drop quiet.')
