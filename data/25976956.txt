If the algorithm behind your platform maximizes time on site, it will maximize anger, outrage, and quick dopamine hits.<p>If the algorithm (or moderation process) functions differently, that&#x27;s not the case, and I think we see this to some extent in HackerNews (not saying it could scale to Facebook level though). I hope other &quot;ethical social media&quot; platforms like Okuna (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.okuna.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.okuna.io&#x2F;</a>) will follow.')
