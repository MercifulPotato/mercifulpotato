Well of course Fedora being what it is, they had Gnome 3 and I used it as a daily driver on my Thinkpad X220 doing web dev&#x2F;devops (we called it &quot;sysadmin&quot; back then) for an indie marketing firm.<p>Well, Gnome 3 was neat at first, but they made what I felt were several boneheaded decisons such as removing options from menus, removing menus entirely in some cases, gconf, and of course the early 2010s were peak &quot;copy whatever the fuck the Freedesktop people are doing without critical thinking&quot; so of course systemd featured prominently.<p>Those couple of years of tweaking and fixing systemd problems and finding menu options being removed seemingly every fucking week really killed any enjoyment I had and it&#x27;s part of the reason I own a mac today.  I have better things to do with my time than find workarounds for whatever way Poettering&#x27;s latest fetish is broken.  I&#x27;m sick of awful battery life, awful track pads, awful suspend-resume, awful external display support, and awful wifi.<p>I&#x27;m convinced the only people who have good things to say about using linux (or BSD for that matter, been there done that, no thanks) on a laptop are the kind of people who keep their &quot;laptops&quot; on the same desk, plugged in to ethernet, and are effectively using a desktop with poor thermals, and I think a large part of the reason why the desktop linux ecosystem is in such a poor state today is because of the choices made by some Freedesktop.org people and aped by the rest of the community back in the late 2000&#x27;s and early 2010s.')
