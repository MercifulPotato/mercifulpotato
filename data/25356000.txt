Item(by='comex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607496358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25353452, text='&gt; Phones are not designed for reading, so dynamic layout or not, it will still be inferior to finely typeset document<p>Personally, I find my phone to be my favorite medium to read prose on, not inferior to anything – including printed paper, which I never use if I can help it.  It works for books and most webpages, but PDFs are a disaster.<p>My second preference is my laptop.  Its screen is big enough to make reading PDFs an acceptable experience, but not a great one.  When viewing at an optimal zoom level for me, there&#x27;s almost enough vertical space to fit an entire normally-sized page… but not quite.  Which means I have to scroll.  In the common case that the paper has two columns, I have to scroll down to read the bottom left of the page, then back up to read the top right, then back down to read the bottom right.<p>Oh, and it&#x27;s always great hunting for the figures in a paper, because of course they have to be nicely lined up in a corner of a page, even if that leaves them far from the text that references them.  It&#x27;s a compromise that makes total sense in print, but feels silly on a screen.<p>So TeX&#x27;s output is good in print but awkward on a screen.  (It may not be limited to PDF, but I&#x27;m pretty sure all its output formats assume a fixed page size.)  Meanwhile, HTML is good on a screen, but I agree that it&#x27;s awkward in print.<p>What we need is a format that&#x27;s good at both, and that doesn&#x27;t currently exist.')
