Nothing would change significantly for rich people as they would continue to put most of their money in the same investments they do today which generally have higher risk adjusted returns than gold and would continue to have higher risk adjusted returns than a gold backed currency.<p>The difference would be in the liquid portion of a person&#x27;s assets and poor people need to hold a much larger part of their assets as cash and are therefore much more affected by inflation.<p>It should also be noted that neither fiat currencies nor currencies backed by precious metals are guaranteed to maintain their value and are usually not the most secure means of long term wealth storage.')
