To get donations? That&#x27;s not what open source was invented for.<p>I don&#x27;t know about everyone else, but if I publish something as open-source it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s something I made and needed in the first place.<p>Open-sourcing it is just a way to enable other people who have an itch to scratch to be able to do so. More often than not, such scratches comes back benefiting me as the original author.<p>I don&#x27;t get this fixation on everything having to be profitable, but then again I don&#x27;t work on any FOSS projects full time. I only do it to scratch an itch, to make the software work for me.<p>And when it works... I go do the actual work I&#x27;m paid to work on, using the software I&#x27;ve helped make better.')
