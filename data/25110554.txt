People use Windows because it&#x27;s what came installed in the computer and it runs the software they think they need. In their point of view it&#x27;s not broken (because either they never experience the brokenness, or because they don&#x27;t know what not broken looks like).<p>From my point of view, Linux is not broken at all. It runs the software I need (I&#x27;m comfortable with Gimp, I don&#x27;t have spreadsheets that pass the limits of LibreOffice and I don&#x27;t use EA). Lately, the move from X to Wayland has been introducing some brokenness - it&#x27;s not as easy as it used to be to run X apps across the network - but I imagine all these will be eventually fixed.<p>Like you said, most users don&#x27;t worry EA is Windows-only because most users don&#x27;t worry about things like OS.')
