There are constant, intense calls for violence (in Minecraft), photoshopped porn of Hunter Biden and just a regular stream of dog whistles and keywords that cannot be interpreted any other way.<p>There is no loss here. The right has collectively lost its mind and these sites are pure sewer.<p>On top of this, the sites are ironically so anti-left that you are banned instantly if you even tried to discuss something in good faith. It&#x27;d be hilarious if it wasn&#x27;t so terrible.')
