If a developer releases a game for a console, it should run well on that console. If the game is too fancy for the console then it shouldn’t be released. And if the developer insists that the game runs well on a given console, but they never release screenshots and it turns out they were lying, then their behavior is truly deceptive and inexcusable.<p>This Barnum-esque idea that it’s PS4 owners’ fault for letting CD Projekt Red rip them off is gross. Although it’s pretty funny that the suggestion always comes from people who think they’re <i>defending</i> CD Projekt Red.')
