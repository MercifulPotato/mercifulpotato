MS ranks #1 and I actually know someone who works at a large customer and their surface devices last 12-18 months. They had over 500 of them. They don’t send them for repair because the warranty is a year so they are scrap then. No statistical contribution to that study. They are replacing them with Lenovo units with 3y NBD repair and support and they are cheaper.<p>As for Apple, you buy a 3 year warranty with AppleCare for less than the surface costs and that includes accidental damage for a small excess fee per event.')
