Personally, I don&#x27;t know how to reconcile being told that voter fraud is exceedingly rare when I see articles like this where individuals and teams of people are caught falsifying information on this scale. What if these people only falsified 20 identities instead of 8000? Would they have been caught?<p>If the process for identifying fraud isn&#x27;t particularly robust or thorough, how can you legitimately say fraud is extremely rare?')
