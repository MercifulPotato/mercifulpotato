Looks like the comment section gets into this.<p>- I think it&#x27;s mistake to not insulate the floor. Rule of thumb is soil underneath building is 2C less then average indoor space temperature[1] - for commercial buildings, probably more residential since there&#x27;s less equipment. So there will be heat loss. More importantly, the ground consists of wet soil with moisture that wants to evaporate up into the structure. Insulation is one of the crucial components of preventing this (in addition to proper site drainage, and air&#x2F;vapor barriers).<p>- I think this kind of steady-state calculation is great for a quick back-of-envelope calculation like this. But, for the sake of completeness, I want to mention that heating is a dynamic process with multiple modes of transfer, and not modeling it that way means we&#x27;re neglecting the following impacts: air infiltration&#x2F;ventilation that changes with pressure differences, solar radiation, heat generated from people and office equipment, latent energy impact of humid air, and the changing resistance associated with air films on surfaces. Thermal mass is also one, but is already mentioned in the original post.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bigladdersoftware.com&#x2F;epx&#x2F;docs&#x2F;8-3&#x2F;auxiliary-programs&#x2F;energyplus-weather-file-epw-data-dictionary.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bigladdersoftware.com&#x2F;epx&#x2F;docs&#x2F;8-3&#x2F;auxiliary-program...</a>')
