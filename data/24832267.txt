The short version was that the drivers available at that time couldn&#x27;t translate from the AirPrint-wrapped format to the one that the HP expected, on a Raspberry Pi, in realtime. It was worth it to me to replace the printer so that I didn&#x27;t have to listen to my wife hate on the poor HP every time she tried to print and had to wait a minute or two for it to start.')
