Item(by='amscanne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611475412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25887027, text='&gt; One is depth-from-defocus combined with &quot;overlap&quot; hierarchy information that can be used to build a depth-map. This is the technique Tesla talked about. Interestingly, instead of manually coding up this algorithm, they simply trained a neural net to do it! The trick was to use the radar data as the &quot;ground truth&quot;, and train the NN to predict it based on the optical input. It works quite well, and there are videos floating about showing how a Tesla can build up an accurate 3D model of the world around it as it drives along.<p>Wow, that scares the shit out of me. I hope this is not serious. How could they possibly understand the neural net and how it will behave under novel scenarios? This is the opposite of what you want in a safety critical system.')
