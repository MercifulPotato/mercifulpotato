If I buy 1000 upvotes for mycompetitor.com, will you boot them?<p>Attribution is a terribly hard problem, Google has the same issue with paid links, and handles with the Disavow Links tool, but that&#x27;s a hack, not a solution, as it essentially means you have to buy services that get you and up to date list of links to your page so you can disavow them before Google hands out penalties.')
