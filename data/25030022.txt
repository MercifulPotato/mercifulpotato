There are really only 2 approaches that seem to make any sense whatsoever: staggered lockdowns; or one, big, mother of all lockdowns that eliminates the virus entirely, followed by strict border controls.  We&#x27;ve seen already that the latter strategy is not practical in the US, if only because people simply won&#x27;t adhere to lockdown restrictions.  Staggered lockdowns allow us to keep something of the economy going, while still not overwhelming the healthcare system, and this probably represents the best outcome we can hope for now.')
