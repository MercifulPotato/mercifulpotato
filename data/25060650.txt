Item(by='dredmorbius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605116680, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25059366, text='I strongly recommend Vaclav Smil, <i>Energy in World History</i> and <i>Energy and Civilization</i> (along with many other books on resources).  The &quot;Burning Buried Sunshine&quot; paper (Springer link above)describes human energy use relative to net primary production. As of the late 1990s humans wwere accounting for (using directly or indirectly) 20% of all net primary production, with other energy use roughly doubling that.<p>Whether or not remaining biological systems could survive on just 60% of plant life is a possibility, though the impacts would likely be large.  Further growth in human energy consumption would obviously be limited.<p>I&#x27;d come across that independently, Smil also cites it.')
