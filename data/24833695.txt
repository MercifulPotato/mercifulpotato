I also play Cogmind and it&#x27;s been a timesink too. With each major update, he also introduces a &quot;mod&quot; option that lets you play the game in different ways and that refreshes the game so well.<p>For example, Cogmind is a game in which you blow up other robots and take their parts in as yours. Each time you would go up a level, you would be able to put points into different categories that let you accomodate more parts, etc. One time however, the game added a different way of playing that lets you &quot;buy&quot; upgrades as you level up (level up as in going up a level). That made the game quite different and I had fun playing it all over again.')
