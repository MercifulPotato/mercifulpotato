Perhaps one thing to add is that the underlying problem is always a mistaken belief that you can draw a <i>general</i> conclusion from a <i>limited</i> data set.<p>The data may be flawed in many ways, so there is no automatic assumption that any conclusion is correct.<p>And - as this answer says - this is a completely different process to discovering a robust causal mechanism that can reliably explain a correlation and predict its persistence into the future.')
