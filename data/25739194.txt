Now where I could see it getting interesting is if consumers in the area don&#x27;t have an alternative way to access content. I&#x27;d say if that is the case then this ISP here just opened up a door to a potential case to regulate them as utilities which means they wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this. If the users do have a choice in the area then moot point.')
