Instead of trying to convince equally powerless people to see reality in some manner which doesn&#x27;t matter, the logical thing to do is work to increase your locus of control over your surroundings.<p>Politics don&#x27;t matter, they are downstream from structures and incentives. Whether you like the police, lgbtq+ rights, abortion, equality, etc is completely irrelevant, how those things make you feel is irrelevant, stop wasting time on them and let other people waste their time on trying to validate themselves and their feelings with political games. Do real activities and increase your influence and control over your surroundings, then exert your values over that sphere. Caring about people agreeing with you is the position of the victim and slave.')
