All through the 80s and 90s they had the best digital camera sensors on the market and where first to release a commercially available DSLR. In the mid 90s they owned the pro DSLR space.<p>But they didn&#x27;t want to cannibalize their film market, and after much infighting between senior managers they ended up not investing in the digital lead they had.
