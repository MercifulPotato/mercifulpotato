Some people&#x27;s feelings and sense of superiority are truly hurt by this I expect and the SEC are probably hard at work trying to figure something out and to the extent that they&#x27;re failing to do so, salivating at thought of new powers. All in the name of saving the undeserving from themselves of course.')
