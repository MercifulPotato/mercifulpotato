I.e. if I delay a task for 111 seconds, I can publish it to RabbitMQ with a queue with a per-queue TTL of 100 seconds, after which it&#x27;ll fall out to a DLX. What happens with the remaining 11 seconds? Does the DLX deliver (somehow) to a series of increasingly shorter per-queue TTL queues?<p>I, too, would love an implementation of arbitrary-granularity delays without buffering (potentially huge, mem-wise) tasks in &quot;unacknowledged&quot; in a giant binary heap: that&#x27;s expensive for consumers and terrifying for RabbitMQ stability when a broker has to e.g. re-&quot;ready&quot; millions of messages because a delay-buffer OOMed.')
