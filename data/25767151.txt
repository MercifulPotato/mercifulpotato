Helium has been about 10x that the past half decade. I used to pay about $3,000 per 100L dewar a few years ago. Sounds like that price was still common in 2020: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physicstoday.scitation.org&#x2F;do&#x2F;10.1063&#x2F;PT.6.2.20200605a&#x2F;full&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physicstoday.scitation.org&#x2F;do&#x2F;10.1063&#x2F;PT.6.2.2020060...</a><p>Plus, liquid helium is produced as a byproduct of some natural gas extraction. If you needed volumes beyond that production, which seems likely if you wanted to switch the world&#x27;s data centers to it, you&#x27;d be stuck condensing it from the atmosphere, which is far more expensive than collecting it from natural gas.
