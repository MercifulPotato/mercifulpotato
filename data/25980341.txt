When you get it home, you realize there&#x27;s a big hole in it, and it can&#x27;t be used to replace the one currently on your car.<p>You call me up and I say &quot;I never said it would work in a car, I just said it was an oil filter (true) which would fit into a 2019 Mazda (true).&quot;<p>The law says &quot;nice try, you can&#x27;t be that pedantic.
