So if you&#x27;re plugged in for 12 hours overnight, that&#x27;s 40-ish miles, which is more than most people drive in a day. Or 8 hours at work, you get 30-ish miles, still significant.<p>If the parking lot at work has solar-shaded carparks that feed the chargers, the building might not even need a service upgrade. I don&#x27;t know why this isn&#x27;t more common.')
