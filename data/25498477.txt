I have never used anything more stable. Database upgrades are always seamless (I&#x27;ve never had to even touch the db since install) and all I have to do is occasionally add some indices through the CLI when it asks me to. The automatic updater seems to also make some sort of backups and even if it doesn&#x27;t, a standard mysqldump backup should be enough to restore pretty much everything. It even survived two migrations to new servers.')
