Item(by='bartread', descendants=None, kids=[25198563], score=None, time=1606223269, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25197654, text='&gt; I think the premise is that you can look up a item on Amazon, ebay, and walmart and between the three you&#x27;re very unlikely to get ripped off if you buy the cheapest one available.<p>I doubt it&#x27;s an issue with Walmart but you have completely ignored the problem of counterfeit&#x2F;knock-off goods on Amazon and eBay. From painful experience, although fortunately not with anything too expensive, I can tell you that it&#x27;s absolutely possible - likely, even, if you buy enough stuff - to get ripped off on Amazon in this way and that your strategy is not a reliable way to avoid being ripped off.')
