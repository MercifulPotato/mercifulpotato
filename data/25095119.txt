Without leverage, you can usually only take the most risky of strategies in order to get a return. If you&#x27;re willing to take on leverage, you are much more likely to find a good strategy.<p>Source: work at a small prop firm that takes on around 10x leverage. Even at this leverage ratio, we are considerably less risky than the S&amp;P 500. Even at 10x, our volatility is somewhere between 1&#x2F;2 to 1&#x2F;3 of the S&amp;P.<p>If you take on very little directional risk and are doing stat arb like us, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with taking on a lot of leverage. Even at 10x, we are safer than the vast majority of retail portfolios in existence.<p>Leverage (through futures, options, shorts, or borrowing) is the cornerstone of almost all active outperformance in the industry. Without leverage, you will be forced into high beta names that trade at a premium compared to their risk adjusted return. See the &quot;low beta anomaly&quot; for more information.')
