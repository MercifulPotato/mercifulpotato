Is there meaningful interrelatedness between the Undertale fandom and the Call of Duty fandom, for example? ARMA 3 and Candy Crush? Fortnite and FF7? If we&#x27;re talking about &quot;gamer culture&quot;, we have to be talking about the cultural tropes shared among people who <i>identify as</i> gamers, and for whom that identification constitutes a meaningful part of how they conceive of themselves.<p>From what I concede is an outside perspective, I&#x27;ve never been able to understand what benefit or value there is in that identification for the people who hold to it; all it seems to do is establish them as members of a specific market segment with the aesthetic taste of an insufficiently socialized eleven-year-old boy. That, and its interaction with the industry that exists to exploit it, is something I would expect to see explored in an article purporting to discuss &quot;gamer culture&quot; in the context of its specifically sedentary aspects, but Gordon appears content merely to brush against the opportunity of such incisive analysis on his way to invoke Cronenberg and <i>Hemipepsis</i> - which leads me to wonder if Lewis Gordon wouldn&#x27;t really rather have been J. G. Ballard. No shame in that, but if so, he&#x27;s got a lot of work to do.<p>It&#x27;s also worth considering that &quot;gamer chairs&quot; aren&#x27;t just bought and owned by gamers. A lot of folks I work with have used them to furnish the home offices they&#x27;ve had to set up this year thanks to COVID, because they&#x27;re marketed as being designed for long periods of sitting, and because Herman Miller and Steelcase and so on typically price in the next higher order of magnitude - a significant point for folks with larger families and less disposable income than, I think, a lot of HN participants, myself included. Such a blurring of categories might likewise be part of an analysis produced by someone willing to invest effort in developing a broader view than Gordon seems to have bothered with.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, really. There are hints here at a much better article than the one we&#x27;ve actually gotten to read.')
