Note that where I grew up &quot;conservative&quot; is more in line with the policies of a centrist US-democrat. What the republicans campaigned for this election would be more in line with right wing fascist parties like NPD (basically a party for neo nazis in Germany, AFD, Marie Le Pen&#x27;s right wing party in France etc).<p>I think actual US conservatives should draw a border at some point. Because there is nothing conservative about dreaming of returning to a past that never existed (it is usually a ethnic clean past, where everybody was happy and agreed what the good values were, nobody had to pay taxes, etc)')
