So that includes losses in the power supply and ssd and everything else outside the chip that uses a bit of juice whereas the AMD tdp is just the chip. I thought Anandtech said there was currently no reliable way to do an ‘apples to apples’ tdp comparison?<p>Edit: quote from anandtech:<p>“As we had access to the Mac mini rather than a Macbook, it meant that power measurement was rather simple on the device as we can just hook up a meter to the AC input of the device. It’s to be noted with a huge disclaimer that because we are measuring AC wall power here, the power figures aren’t directly comparable to that of battery-powered devices, as the Mac mini’s power supply will incur a efficiency loss greater than that of other mobile SoCs, as well as TDP figures contemporary vendors such as Intel or AMD publish.”')
