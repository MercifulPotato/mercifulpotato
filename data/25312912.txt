Given that, the choosing option 2 will clearly leave this children and their families worse off. I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s a controversial statement, it&#x27;s simply describing the situation as it is. Denying harsh realities doesn&#x27;t make things better for those children.<p>Now, the ideal situation is just a direct wealth transfer from rich countries to poor countries, and I would be in favor of that. But people in rich countries value the lives of people in their countries many times more than those in poor countries, so I doubt this will happen anytime soon.')
