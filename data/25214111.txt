They are extremely hostile to the repair industry.<p>Its one thing to demand Apple change their design (as if anyone can do that), its quite another to politely request that maybe perhaps Apple shouldn&#x27;t focus their energy on crushing the repair industry. Its laughable that Apple happily certifies their own products as &quot;green&quot; when they are so hell bent against repair. Apple&#x27;s (and others&#x27;) anti-repair policies generate a ton of e-waste.')
