After all, USB-A plug has a prominent logo (distinguishable both on sight and by touch) that identifies up-side. It should be dead-simple to do, no? What went wrong?<p>- Did some laptop manufacturer mount USB-A receptacle upside-down?<p>- Or was that micro-B that trigger this? (for example Samsung&#x2F;Nexus S and LG&#x2F;Nexus 4&#x2F;5 have micro-B receptacle upside-down relative to one another)<p>- General feeling of inferiority from Apple&#x27;s Lightning plug?<p>- Something else altogether?')
