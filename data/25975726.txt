Let me search for &quot;foo.bar&quot; and only find that exact sequence rather than tokenising it and finding all files with &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;. This issue alone has led me to never use it in favour of clone + ripgrep<p>2. Inline expand in search results. Let me click a button to see all matches in a file when there&#x27;s more than fits into your result preview, rather than having to click into the search result then repeat the same search with my browser search to find where in the file it is')
