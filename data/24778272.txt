This completely defeats the purpose of a firewall.<p>If it is happening, then it&#x27;s Docker doing this - not the linux firewall that comes stock with most distribution (iptables and the like). They would never simply add rules to the chains just because something was listening on that port.<p>Really, the best security advice for using Docker is to not use Docker. Unfortunately, there aren&#x27;t very many &quot;hold your hand&quot; alternatives available. Aside from LXD and that family of technologies, which are criminally underused.')
