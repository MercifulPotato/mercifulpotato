Based on a couple thousand <i>healthy</i> patients of the general population.  (BTW, I think it&#x27;s really important that everyone learn to see through the math&#x2F;symbols&#x2F;technical jargon when reading such research papers to understand the populations really being studied.  All those <i>r</i> and <i>p</i> numbers are meaningless if the underlying patient data are flawed.)<p>That is really rough.  I could not imagine this would be credible if you substituted for example (just to think about it locally with a population you might know), &quot;New York&quot; for &quot;Maharastra&quot; state in the plot and asked if you believed the strength of finding that average Vitamin D level in New York state correlates with Covid death rate.  How about for Florida -- would that be believable too? And also, the noticeable points making up the perceived trend are so few, and the points are not even weighted for population size (?)!<p>Much more work in detail -- at the <i>patient level</i> with Vitamin D measurement -- would have to be done to be credible.   I would not act on this information in the present form.')
