Say 40% of total shares are floating. You the hedge fund owe 60% of the shares because you shorted them. Even if your position is closed immediately (hint, it won&#x27;t), you would still need to find the remaining 20% of the shares that you owe. Who will give you that 20%? Well I of course, but the difference is, I get to dictate what the market price is.<p>We saw this happen in 2008 with Volkswagen. 1% of the total shares were floating because Porch√© had purchased the remaining, the rest of the shares were owned by institutions and they were not selling them.')
