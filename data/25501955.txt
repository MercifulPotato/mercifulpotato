After they have gather all the insights they can from Clojure and its ecosystem (which is a worthy endeavor IMO), they go back to their big ecosystem mainstream programming language because of all the benefits you get from it even if that programming language is worse. It also doesn&#x27;t help Clojure the fact that JS 2020 is way better than JS in 2010 and that you can easily bring all your Clojure insights&#x2F;concepts to JS.')
