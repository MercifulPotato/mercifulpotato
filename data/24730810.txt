Used to do the code&#x2F;eat&#x2F;sleep&#x2F;code&#x2F;eat&#x2F;sleep lifestyle but realized I liked to refactor, polish and perfect too much and that was incompatible with the industry&#x27;s demand to &quot;ship barely working garbage on time&quot;.

It&#x27;s great because it lets me stay in software, but in a supporting role and I don&#x27;t feel the pressure to get on the code&#x2F;eat&#x2F;sleep treadmill.
