Item(by='IkmoIkmo', descendants=None, kids=[25496762], score=None, time=1608562876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493947, text='&gt; when a TRILLION dollar private company screws people over<p>It&#x27;s an Apple supplier, not Apple. Besides, what does it matter that it&#x27;s a trillion dollar company? It implies that if say 1 million small companies worth 1 million, would fare better in forcing a large supplier like Windsor or a large number of smaller suppliers, to respect India&#x27;s local labour laws vis-a-vis their employees. That&#x27;s a ridiculous assumption I think. If anything I trust that Apple&#x27;s market power will force Wistron to pay out its workers according to the terms they agreed, much quicker than if Apple was, say, a small-time no-name company.<p>It&#x27;s entirely right to be outraged about this, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But I don&#x27;t see the cause being related to Apple being a trillion dollar company. Nor do I see Apple screwing people over.<p>Tons of small and large companies in India screw with local labour laws all the time. If anything I&#x27;d expect that Apple suppliers would do so less on a per-worker basis. That&#x27;s an assumption I&#x27;d like to see tested. The current system (courts or trial-by-media) will likely work for Apple holding its suppliers accountable. For a small company? Not so much.')
