If the overwhelming majority of the people I&#x27;m interviewing, hiring, and working with look like me, then I have to ask, are these really the most qualified people? I mean, there&#x27;s one of two possibilities -- either in fact there&#x27;s something about people who are very similar to me that makes them the most qualified OR there&#x27;s a lot of talent being overlooked and missed and my company is missing out here. Which one is more likely?<p>That re-framing is the easy part, of course. Actually making changes is hard. On one side we all know that if you make something a metric you run the danger of making it a goal, but on the other side the biases that lead to a lack of diversity are so deep and ingrained they can be very difficult to counter.<p>But hopefully this re-framing is at least helpful in explaining why a lack of diversity is an issue that matters.')
