It was annoying, and frustrating compared to the rest of the experience. For instance, I was shocked (and delighted) that I didnâ€™t need to move my SIM card over.<p>But the sign in just failed, silently. It was especially annoying because my password is long and complex, and until I got my password manager installed I had to type it by hand. I eventually gave up and went about my day. It worked later in the afternoon for me.')
