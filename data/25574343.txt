I&#x27;m eager to know more about this case, because on the one hand there&#x27;s this report and on the other hand Apple strongly denies it to be the case. Clearly both can&#x27;t be right.<p>Apple&#x27;s Supplier Responsibility department has to have the strongest incentives to avoid this sort of situation. Were they simply fooled by this company? I would assume they have some sort of continuous verification process and don&#x27;t just take suppliers at their word.<p>On a separate note, it is a bit disappointing to see more insinuations from the Washington Post about the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. I would encourage people who care about this subject to read the act — it&#x27;s pretty short — and why companies are against some parts of it despite being against forced labor.<p>There&#x27;s a section in particular (#4) that bans all imports of products made entirely or partly in Xinjiang province unless the &quot;Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection&quot; declares them to not have been linked to forced labor. This kind of wide-ranging and completely vague ban feels more like the U.S. administration using this topic to further restrict Chinese imports. Doing this correctly takes more than a 2-paragraph ban on literally all exports of a whole entire region, and I wish this paper actually explored the issue in depth.')
