Heck, for a class I reverse engineered a robot&#x27;s bluetooth control api because coding up computer vision was easier in python than in matlab (which had a provided &quot;SDK&quot; that some TA had written in years prior).<p>I spent less time doing that issue than it took to debug a missing comma on the end of a line in some matlab code (for a different assignment in a later class) that led to some incorrect matrix operation and completely failing code. I do not like matlab.')
