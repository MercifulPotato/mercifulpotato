Item(by='jka', descendants=None, kids=[25168948], score=None, time=1605954580, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25167491, text='Build a transparent, open and collaborative system that we can all inspect and trust, that has the following goal:<p>Determine and sort the most significant causes of harm to life on earth, including citations and with ranking corrections possible as further evidence becomes known.<p>Where possible, provide the ability to perform regional geographic analysis, and associate man-made causes with their financial supporters and benefactors.<p>Publish and disseminate this information with high integrity and authenticity assurance and without any editorial comment, ideological leaning, advertising or emotional appeals.<p>Tediously and meticulously continue to accept corrections and updates, and publish them in an append-only format.<p>(this would be something like a funnel to combine conent from academia, the press, financial transparency initiatives, and fact-checkers - distilled, open, and with community curation)<p>People aren&#x27;t all rational, and some people (sociopaths for example, or people with vested interests who are genuinely unaware of the harm their financial investments cause) don&#x27;t really care for the outcomes of those they affect.<p>So this platform would not immediately result in utopia - those people would be the most likely to attack it, deride it, claim that it is flawed, discredit or downplay it, etc.<p>Over time however it would continue its&#x27; seemingly boring, methodical analysis and attribution of problems, with gradually improving quality, verification and trust thanks to open publication.<p>At a certain point in time it would gain enough traction, credibility and community resilience to shift opinions at large.  Attacks on the platform would intensify as it became a more existential threat to harmers.<p>The goal would be to reach a point at which significant threats to life are being removed as a result, and life could move on to solving gradually more minor and local issues.')
