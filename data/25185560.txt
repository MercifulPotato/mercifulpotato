Is it following the breaking news? Probably not. The real problems don&#x27;t change hourly or daily, and information doesn&#x27;t go stale. So instead of today&#x27;s news, it may be better to find <i>books</i> on these topics, as well as recent but not <i>that</i> recent reports, investigative journalism, etc. - things that are not meant to be a part of a daily news cycle.<p>Solid information from sources like that, and refined beliefs formed thanks to it, will make you a better voter too.')
