It doesn&#x27;t solve the impossible problem of somehow deciding the true information content of any piece of data, it only locks it away in a slightly neater box of impossible.<p>How much some data means depends completely on everything else you know about the world. You could imagine under different priors of knowledge, different strings would have differing kolmogorov complexity. not technically true, because kolmogorov complexity Is fixed, but that assumes you have the absolutely omniscient model for everything.')
