I moved my tutoring business to Stripe as the sales team ensured me it would be the perfect invoicing solution.  On our first round of invoicing they put an arbitrary tiny limit on how much we can invoice customers per week.  As a result we missed payroll and are basically out of business as our entire cashflow has been hijacked by stripe.  Customer support is useless.  How could they have not mentioned limits when signing up?  No way on Earth I would have used Stripe if I had known about invoicing limits.  And they last for 4 MONTHS!')
