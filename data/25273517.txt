I also have a boss above me who needs information from me. E-mail was getting incredibly inefficient for me when everyone starting working from home earlier this year. I lost oversight and missed tasks. I was getting 25-50 emails a day that required some type of response or action from me.<p>I switched my team over Teams and asked them to create a card in the planner tasks if they needed something from me - instead of emailing me. That was much easier for me to keep track of everything. E-mail is good for communicating a thought, I don&#x27;t find it good for tracking tasks - particularly tasks that have a deadline.')
