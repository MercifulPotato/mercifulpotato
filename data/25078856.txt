Many registered Democrats (usually the wife) denied being Democrats when their partners were around. I thought this was an error in our data until I revisited the neighbourhood. Husband wasn’t home. Wife scolded us. He is an ardent Republican and wouldn’t appreciate how she votes.<p>Mail-in ballots let voters verify their vote to third parties. That opens them up to external influence, positive (pay for votes) or negative (fired for voting wrong).<p>We had no choice this year. But there is a real tradeoff in privacy for vulnerable people. We shouldn&#x27;t lose sight of that trade-off while pushing for turnout.')
