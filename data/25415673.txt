Code signing keys get abused all the time. It&#x27;s why Microsoft now insist they&#x27;re held in hardware devices whereas they used to allow them to be free-standing files, but it hardly helps.<p>If you think about it for even a moment you&#x27;ll see that for code signing to be meaningful requires a completely locked down software supply chain, including controls that trace through developer laptops and third party open source code that&#x27;s pulled in to your application. The typical app developer combines components from a huge number of sources of unknown reputability and security strength, which are then all executed on laptops that have permission to push arbitrary jobs to CI clusters.')
