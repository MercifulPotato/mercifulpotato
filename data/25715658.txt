The only thing that is harder than making a bunch of technology choices one time is making them constantly.<p>Pick technologies that are stable over time frames measured in years, not months. You will never be able to construct any great works on top of fields of quicksand.<p>For example - Instead of using a fun &amp; shiny new language you read about on HN to construct your company&#x27;s new loan processing backend, perhaps consider technologies such as Java or .NET. Instead of using a database engine that was developed this decade, look at something that has already stood the test of 1-2 prior decades.<p>Now, 100% of everything I have just said is totally irrelevant if we are talking about software engineering just for the sake of it (fun, hobby, exploration, etc). This is the important distinction. If the livelihoods of your coworkers depend on you not making a bad technology choice, try to go with the safe bet. Separation of hobby &amp; work mindset can solve a lot of this mess.')
