All those sequences were already present in databases and therefore within the known protein universe.<p>&gt; Based on that, I would wager that what DeepFold learned is an evolutionary &quot;language&quot; that maps out a large useful subset of the entire possibility space.<p>This might be true, depending on how “foldable” the unexplored space is. A reverse DeepFold would give some clues on that.<p>&gt; Natural evolution tends build upon previous successes so it seems probable evolution has mapped out a fairly useful &quot;language&quot; of patterns for useful protein shapes<p>This is already known. The structural and functional diversity we see in existing proteins originated from a relatively limited repertoire of conserved protein domain folds, or even subdomain-sized fragments in some cases.<p>&gt; Either way, I&#x27;m excited to see who comes up with the first custom protein(s) to catalyze industrial processes!<p>Same here! Especially since the <i>de novo</i> design of enzymes has been progressing slowly but steadily.')
