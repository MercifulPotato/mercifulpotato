Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=[25311652], score=None, time=1607138958, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306343, text='&gt; I hear that in the US people will lose their healthcare when they lose a job and it could cost $1000 a month (which is more than my monthly rent)! Here it&#x27;s simply free. That brings a lot of peace of mind.<p>That&#x27;s not true in most of the states where people actually live. For example where I live in Maryland: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marylandhealthconnection.gov&#x2F;lost-your-job-you-can-get-health-coverage&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marylandhealthconnection.gov&#x2F;lost-your-job-you-c...</a><p>&gt; Yes, you have 60 days from the date of losing your job to enroll in health coverage through Maryland Health Connection. You do not have to wait for open enrollment. A special enrollment period allows you to enroll in a health plan<p>Eligibility for free or subsidized healthcare depends on income. Here are the income limits in Maryland: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marylandhealthconnection.gov&#x2F;how-to-enroll&#x2F;medicaid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marylandhealthconnection.gov&#x2F;how-to-enroll&#x2F;medic...</a>. For a family of 4, if you earn less than about $36,000 a year you qualify for Medicaid, which provides free healthcare, including prescription drugs. For a family of four, you can enroll your kids in Medicaid if your family makes under $55,000 per year.<p>Above that it&#x27;s a sliding scale based on household income.')
