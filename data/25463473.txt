As the other poster wrote, it is a criticism towards the decisions of the GTK <i>developers</i>. That someone else could take the code and change it, is completely, absolutely, 100% <i>irrelevant</i>. It has nothing to do with the comments here, they aren&#x27;t about if it is technically possible to add a compatibility layer on GTK3 or GTK4 or whatever nor who will make it.<p>It is ALL about the GTK development team&#x27;s decisions, <i>including</i> the decisions that make a backwards compatibility harder.<p>Also caring about backwards compatibility isn&#x27;t something that can be bolted on top by a 3rd party, it is something the library has to keep in mind in the <i>design</i> phase. And it isn&#x27;t something that can be thought as a separate component, it is something that has to be at the same level as everything else. Expecting that it is something that &quot;shouldn&#x27;t hold up a GTK release&quot; is a completely wrong way of thinking about backwards compatibility - a project that cares about being backwards compatible considers it as important as any other change (new features, bug fixes, etc) and not something to be an afterthought.<p>&gt; The GTK developers are just ordinary people like you or I who volunteered to work on it, if you want to change this situation then you or someone else can step up and become a GTK developer and work on this. Then you can say they care about it :)<p>Sure, they may be (i do not know) and they have all the rights to ignore backwards compatibility - it isn&#x27;t like i&#x27;m paying them to work on their library or be in a position to make any demands out of them. But that doesn&#x27;t mean i wont say they do not care about backwards compatibility.<p>&gt; I think it is incorrect to say they don&#x27;t care about backwards compatibility anyway,<p>It is absolutely correct because this is what they have repeatedly shown.<p>&gt; you seem to agree that they would meet that minimum required to claim backwards compatibility.<p>No, i do agree with that, what i agreed with is the definition that keeping code running is the absolute minimum one would do to provide backwards compatibility, but i never claimed that the GTK developers care about it. These are two different things: one can not care about backwards compatibility, yet still provide that minimum amount for it for practical and strategic reasons to entice people move to the next version.')
