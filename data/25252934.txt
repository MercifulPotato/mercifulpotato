We can then say that, as far as getting work done, a meeting in Zoom is just like a meeting in real life, and as with meetings face to face there are times when things are said which will be ignored.  (Ideally we would want our business to work where all information is being assessed logically, but in reality, people are not that logical!).<p>Video conferencing makes picking up on who is ignoring what harder, it doesn&#x27;t make the what less easy to ignore. People will still be able to say things, it&#x27;s just harder for others to notice the reaction of other people are to each other. People are free to react to other people and information, it&#x27;s just harder to work out <i>how others</i> are reacting to that.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the worse thing about Zoom at all and there are many positives but I can understand that there are some negatives to video conferencing. Humans often communicate many things non verbally. One obvious example would be seeing who is looking at who in real life, where all we now is everyone looking at each other equally.<p>edits:\nIt&#x27;s worth pointing out that the article is about accents being subtle status signals but the anecdote is about social&#x2F;power status in meetings where accents would be a bad signal.')
