Two things are particularly cried about across most of the ecosystem: the 30% cut they take off pretty much everything and the vague terms that you have to comply with, and that they enforce in a mostly random way (app gets pulled out of the app store, won&#x27;t tell you why, won&#x27;t tell you what you did wrong).<p>Now add the exhorbitant prices for their low-specced, low-quality hardware.<p>Now add the continual rip-off of their users.<p>Now add the subject of the original linked page.<p>At this point I think that yes, defending Apple is extremism.<p>It&#x27;s fine to accept the tradeoffs, it&#x27;s not fine to pretend they do not exists:<p>- &quot;Yeah this stuff is unreasonably expensive but we have to use it&quot;<p>that is honest<p>- &quot;the apple ecosystem is the best for creative and developers and what apple does across all the spectrum is fine&quot;<p>that is dishonest.')
