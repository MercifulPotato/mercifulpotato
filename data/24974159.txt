Not due to privacy concerns but simply due to them cancelling products or making existing products worse (gTalk&#x2F;Hangouts closure as well as Google Photos&#x2F;Drive decoupling were the two big ones).<p>I now use Fastmail with my own domain and I love it.<p>I also use Firefox which is pretty much back to being the best browser after around a decade of falling behind Chrome.<p>For search I use DDG but I often find myself doing a &#x27;!g&#x27; search for local information such as restaurants&#x2F;maps.<p>Chat I use a combination of Telegram and Whatsapp (but this is dependent on what other people use).<p>I use OneDrive instead of Drive (I get 1TB thanks to the Office family plan), which is ok.<p>I still use an Android phone as I find iphones to be very frustrating to use , especially if you do not use a Mac.<p>I think the two big unbeatable ones are Search and Maps. No one is able to even remotely compete on those two but I think that&#x27;s ok. We have to go back to a world of diversifying the software we use and stop companies from forcing us into a single ecosystem.')
