We have multiple fiber links due to the railroad and university, yet our ISPs are beyond shit. Unless you live in the &quot;new&quot; neighborhoods it&#x27;s all old copper coax or old phone line DSL. No company is going to pay to put in the last mile of pipe for a town of this size. Anyway, it&#x27;s about $40 &#x2F; month with tax for 30 MB down and 5 up. Abysmal.')
