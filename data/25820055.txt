Considering that annual global emissions measure in the <i>billions</i>, even if a significant number of other rocket companies pop up, as the article predicts, that&#x27;s still an honestly negligible amount. Pointing the finger at Bitcoin is significantly less ridiculous, considering the paper estimates its footprint at over 30 <i>million</i> tons of CO2.<p>That article is honestly embarrassingly bad, it links to data that was 4 years old at the time of publication, making it apparent they just took the first google result and stuck it in. I&#x27;m all for bashing Musk, but this isn&#x27;t a good reason.<p>edit: quick back of the napkin math says convincing a single medium-large company of 1000 employees to go all-WFH, eliminating commutes, would have an equal or greater impact than this hypothetical rocket-a-week. There&#x27;s a lot of lower-hanging fruit to go after before we worry about rockets, and Bitcoin is increasingly one of those')
