While there might be commits in the Wayland repos, featurewise progress has ceased. Waylands broken architecture has made progress hard to impossible. Porting of popular window managers is extremely slow since there is just no thought given to X compatibility. Input handling by each application on its own is insane and broken. Feature-consistency across compositors on things like screenshots is a pipe-dream. A promised easy ssh -X replacement doesn&#x27;t work right after a decade.<p>Waylands broken architecture makes progress slow through unnecessary duplication, incompatibility and the lack of a smooth migration for many software packages (usually it&#x27;s rewrite-time). Wayland should be abandoned and the design redone.')
