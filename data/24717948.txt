Part of that leverage comes from having lots of options. And why is there lots of options? Because &quot;anyone&quot; can start a tech company. The main mean of production of a tech outfit is the tech workers themselves.<p>Companies don&#x27;t own the workers.<p>A steelworker can only do what they are skillfully specialized to do by using capital goods own by the company. Hence they can&#x27;t negotiate with their feet (leaving) while a tech worker can.<p>Tech workers can work (remotely) for virtually any company in the world.<p>A farm worker can&#x27;t.<p>All this may change in the future, but with some privileged tech workers (I&#x27;m not one of them) being able to retire in their 30s and 40s now I don&#x27;t see why as a whole the industry is incentivized to unionize.')
