Trust me that using a color palette generator is not the One True Way! Also there&#x27;s no advice on how to pick a base color, just &quot;pick one&quot;.<p>Second this author is basing the advice on this app:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=net.amortizedcost.batchimageshrinker" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=net.amortizedc...</a><p>Again I am not an expert and I don&#x27;t mean to be rude, but that&#x27;s not a very nice looking app in my opinion. The colors, fonts, alignment, spacing, etc all seem just a bit &quot;off&quot;.')
