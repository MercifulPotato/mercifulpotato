On the flipside, here in Montreal I&#x27;ve been very impressed with my local pharmacists at the nearby chain drugstore. They pay attention to drug interactions to the extent of flagging a risk the doctor missed but in retrospect admitted is valid, give me a consult every time I get a new medicine, remember things well enough that I was once asked how my wife was doing with her own recovery from something, and so on.<p>I used to live in the US and I&#x27;m certainly not used to that either. I wish that kind of great pharmacist care were more widespread as a norm.')
