The main codification seems to be that you <i>are</i> allowed to infringe on others&#x27; exclusive rights to their property (outside their yard and plantations) as long as the harm is minor: wearing down surfaces by walking and cycling on them, flattening grass and meadows by (briefly) camping on them, picking berries etc.<p>Here&#x27;s a good treatment of the relevant laws, published by the ministry of environment (in Finnish): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helda.helsinki.fi&#x2F;bitstream&#x2F;handle&#x2F;10138&#x2F;38797&#x2F;SY30_2012_Jokamiehenoikeudet.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helda.helsinki.fi&#x2F;bitstream&#x2F;handle&#x2F;10138&#x2F;38797&#x2F;SY30_...</a>')
