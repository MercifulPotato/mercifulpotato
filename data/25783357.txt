That submission totally tanked, though.<p>I felt it was interesting enough to post then not only because it&#x27;s rather unexpected, and useful if you want to avoid eggs in your food, but also because it&#x27;s <i>new</i>.<p>I had just realized that day that the entire concept of using aquafaba as egg white replacement has not been around for very long. I mean the Wiki page says that the first recipe for meringues using aquafaba was published in 2015.<p>I think it&#x27;s really cool that such things are being discovered still. I mean the recipe for egg-based meringues is probably a few hundred years old [2] although sources are obscure. To have a vegan replacement using basically two ingredients appear six years ago is just cool! :)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24210986" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24210986</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Meringue" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Meringue</a>')
