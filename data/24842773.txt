They are always out of almost everything. I asked a cashier why they hadn&#x27;t restocked and they told me that they are restocking normally but people are stealing all the stuff immediately. I have seen several thefts while shopping there; the shoplifters are  brazen and unhurried and take armfuls of merchandise. Walgreens seems particularly hard-hit and I don&#x27;t understand why they aren&#x27;t investing in security.')
