And no system claims to be perfect- you need good reference images of everyone with multiple angles and a good view of their face at the crime scene.  Driver’s license photos just aren’t good enough and the culprit may not have allowed themself to be in other images. Out of all the people that were at the Capitol that day, there are bound to be a few people that don’t have many pictures associated with their true identity.  It’s maybe even more likely that a person who would bring pipe bombs to a mass gathering would be one of those people cautious&#x2F;paranoid enough to stay out of the system.')
