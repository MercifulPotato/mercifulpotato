Sad that the mounting (plastic is not long-term, the SO-DIMM was better in that regard) and form-factor of these are a bit odd, we&#x27;ll have to wait and see if someone makes boards&#x2F;heat-sinks for it!<p>They need to be compact even when stacked like these: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;move.rupy.se&#x2F;file&#x2F;pi_4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;move.rupy.se&#x2F;file&#x2F;pi_4.jpg</a><p>The home computer revolution started with the C64 and peaked with the raspberry pi 4, everything in-between has just been revenue garbage.')
