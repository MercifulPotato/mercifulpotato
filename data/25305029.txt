It&#x27;s unique that you interact through stored procedures that are shared by the data so each node processes completely in parallel without any side-effects. It&#x27;s more akin to other streaming&#x2F;SQL processing engines like Spark rather than a fully functional SQL database.<p>I highly recommend MemSQL (now called Singlestore) for a really polished distributed relational database that combines OLTP with OLAP columnstores.')
