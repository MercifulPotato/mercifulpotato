Einstein A. later [2] (1924) published a paper in favour of an opposing theory, but there was apparently an error in this work, and Einstein E.&#x27;s was correct, but of negligible significance to the effect (Crooke&#x27;s radiometer turned in the opposite direction Crooke predicted, due to an error; decades of determining how it worked ensued) they were theorising over.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24131958" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24131958</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crookes_radiometer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crookes_radiometer</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;schierenberg.nl&#x2F;product&#x2F;72535" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;schierenberg.nl&#x2F;product&#x2F;72535</a>')
