I never will: too many Californians have ruined the place; now they&#x27;ve got skyrocketing housing prices, traffic, homeless tent cities with rivers of human feces and the general high quality of life one can find in other paradisical California shit holes. No doubt they&#x27;ll find a way to jack the taxes up if enough move to Texas.<p>Very <i>typical</i> of a Palo Alto resident to think the only problem with California is prop-13 or some obscure housing policy or whatever. You can&#x27;t even breathe the goddamned air in your utopia, the tax rate makes France look reasonable, the highways are designed for 1&#x2F;4 the population density, the power outages are Zimbabwe tier, riots over ... people saying things, and you think a housing policy adjustment is gonna make it all better? Maybe you should try leaving your $4m bungalo bubble once in a while? Actually, no, stay right there. Enjoy it; you earned it.')
