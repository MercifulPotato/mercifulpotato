(Visual Studio, MS office, Skype!! <i>grumble</i>).<p>Eventually I got tired of doing all of my infrastructure development in a VM, so I wiped out my desktop OS and stuck FreeBSD on it (I was also on a tirade against systemd at the time). -- I was given a crappy PC to run windows&#x2F;skype&#x2F;office on.<p>Overall, aside from how absolutely horrendously slow the browser was (and, it&#x27;s even slower on OpenBSD which is what I stuck on my laptop)- it was significantly less &#x27;breaky&#x27; than my windows machine was.<p>Windows had crapped out a whole bunch of times; randomly stopping devices from working and needing a reboot to fix, the VM software(s) had completely wrecked the networking stack in the OS- it was really painful.<p>But FreeBSD (once set up) made that desktop the most solid it  had ever been.')
