It merely gives your body antibodies to deal with it when you get it. Sometimes those antibodies work, sometimes they do not. The initial estimates for C19 vaccines seem to put it at 50% effectiveness. People seem to be expecting a silver bullet. It&#x27;s not going to happen, especially not this quickly. But irrespective of whether we have a vaccine, yes, everyone will get it eventually.<p>&gt; For one, it is too early to declare a winner. We have to wait.<p>My point exactly. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not declaring them the winner. They are experiencing an uptick in cases, too, though nowhere near as dramatic as e.g. France, Spain, Italy or the UK.')
