If you never have to wait for a lock then you know exactly how long your process will take (as long as it isn&#x27;t CPU starved). As soon as there&#x27;s a lock its going to become unpredictable, because when there&#x27;s a lot of contention you&#x27;ll wait a long time, when there isn&#x27;t you won&#x27;t have to wait. And best of all, with lock free you shouldn&#x27;t be getting deadlocks ever.<p>This property in turn could get you better performance in the end because you may not have to size everything for such a big range of contention, so you can optimize utilization of the hardware more without risking things hitting a peak and experiencing severe degradation.')
