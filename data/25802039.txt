The crucial difference is that women message first but from what I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;ll just say &quot;hi&quot; or some other low-effort message in most of the cases.<p>Why? The answer is simple: women have plenty of options and also absolute power over those choices so no need to do much - it&#x27;s a natural, rational and logical choice. Hence the dynamics aren&#x27;t going to change no matter what tech you apply to the &quot;problem&quot;. If you forced somehow to write a more thoughtful initial message, they&#x27;d just go to some other app (or the majority anyway).<p>How I see it is if Bumble grows as much as Tinder, it&#x27;d suffer from the same problems. Except that women will receive less initial gross messages (if that&#x27;s an actual wide issue, I have no idea). Men are left in the same situation, which is how it should be I guess.')
