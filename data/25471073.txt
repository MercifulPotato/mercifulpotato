Like if you do math on Khan Academy, and then you have the animations of &quot;you have completed the challenge&quot; and &quot;you have gained another level&quot;, and if you are intrinsically motivated and you came there to do the math, this is actually distracting. External motivation helps those who have none, but hinders those who already have internal motivation.<p>In some sense, dividing the university into grades, and organizing lessons in schedule is... a very primitive form of gamification. If you have a motivated person, you don&#x27;t need to do this; just give them the books, and they will read. You don&#x27;t need to set up a schedule for them, because the motivated person&#x27;s natural schedule is &quot;as soon as possible&quot;. The schedule is just slowing them down. (But it works the opposite for an unmotivated person, who without schedule would never get anything done.)<p>The deal is: pass these X exams, and you will receive a diploma, which is a certificate that you passed the exams. When you remove the distractions, it can be done pretty fast.<p>Gamification could be great for students with low motivation. But it would take a lot of time, because it means doing things that are not essential.')
