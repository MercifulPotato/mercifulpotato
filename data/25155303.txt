I looked up the Wiki page <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parry_Moon#Holors" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parry_Moon#Holors</a> and found:<p>&gt; But this is incorrect, in general, for the definition of a tensor includes a specific dependence on coordinate transformation.<p>This is very much a physicist&#x27;s definition of a tensor; a mathematician&#x27;s definition includes no such thing (although one may prove results about co-ordinate transformations as a theorem).  For example, there is no such thing, mathematically, as an intrinsically covariant or contravariant tensor, although, having chosen a fixed vector space $V$, one may certainly put a bi-grading on $T(V \\otimes V^*)$ that makes that sort of distinction.')
