I did the van thing for a year while working in Australia on the NBN (big fibre optic project). \n Drove around and spliced and oversaw fibre projects.<p>It gets old pretty fast, has tons of hidden costs, and looks quaint and romantic to people who&#x27;ve never had to do it.  Fun for a year, but I probably would have paid almost as much just booking into hostels or AirBnB&#x27;s and renting a car on occasion.<p>I was able to go and see some cool places -- but breaking down in remote South Australia was scary and frustrating.  And you get really, really tired of the lack of space.<p>What made it tolerable was being able to get out of the van and chill in places like the library or a coffee shop-- likely all no-gos in the COVID era')
