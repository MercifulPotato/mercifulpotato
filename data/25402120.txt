I&#x27;ve heard all the self-serving arguments they make about how turning things off surprisingly might be unwanted behaviour and so on. If that&#x27;s the case, the admin won&#x27;t set a cap. But there are exactly zero circumstances under which someone who intended to cap their usage at a level that would cost single digits of dollars or remain within a free plan intends or wants to run something that costs four orders of magnitude more than that, and IMNSHO such predatory pricing models should be illegal (assuming that the charges aren&#x27;t already considered unenforceable by courts under such circumstances; I haven&#x27;t checked).')
