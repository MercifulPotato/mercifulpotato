If you&#x27;d used Parler before it went down (I poked it months ago, before all this madness, and found it to be sorely lacking), you&#x27;d notice that it&#x27;s a shoutcasting platform like Twitter, and is wholly unsuitable for any kind of event planning. At most, you could give messages saying to prepare for X at event Y, which is &#x27;planning&#x27; of a sort, I suppose.')
