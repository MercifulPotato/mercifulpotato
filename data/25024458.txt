Item(by='educated_idiot', descendants=None, kids=[25025291], score=None, time=1604828665, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25024389, text='Yep, IIUC what you are talking about is similar to the question others have raised about an &quot;Effort&quot; dimension. \nTo keep the daily or slightly more long term planning simple, I opted to not consider those dimensions. You raise a good point and I need to give it some thought. It has to be &quot;complete&quot; enough that you can prioritize properly, but easy enough that you can use it all the time. \nThe finance example is a good one, but I think you could boil all the costs down to a single term for that case. (essentially it&#x27;s just money lost). Just like the user makes a choice there, the expectation here is that the user will formulate an impact-effort code in their mind and add a task.')
