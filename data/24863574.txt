If your personal opinions are that others don&#x27;t deserve the same basic rights that you have you should face the consequences of holding those beliefs. Gay marriage is no different than any other civil rights issue and we wouldn&#x27;t excuse someone who was against equal rights for women or people of another race because it&#x27;s their &quot;personal politics&quot; and they&#x27;re entitled to their view.')
