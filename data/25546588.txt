In memory-heavy workloads where the CPU utilisation isn’t as high, we’re seeing 18W active power, going up to around 22W in average workloads, and peaking around 27W in compute heavy workloads. These figures are generally what you’d like to compare to “TDPs” of other platforms, although again to get an apples-to-apples comparison you’d need to further subtract some of the overhead as measured on the Mac mini here – my best guess would be a 20 to 24W range.<p>Lakefield is a 1+4 hybrid architecture with one big Intel Core (the laptop CPU brand name) core and four little Intel Atom cores. I&#x27;m not sure what the ideal x+Y combination is for big.LITTLE hybrid silicon for the laptop-class nor the ideal TDP target. From what I&#x27;ve seen, the M1 seems to be the processor to beat along price-per-peformance, performance-per-watt, and all-day-battery dimensions. Independently, the SoC GPU and Universal Memory seem to be in a class of their own.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a>')
