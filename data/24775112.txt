I haven&#x27;t seen this argument so maybe its flawed.<p>If we have non-zero chance to live in simulation, then running our own simulation will eventually have a chance for cascading simulation effect (each simulation runs one or more subsimulations). This puts ever growing strain on amount of power needed to run the whole system at the top level.<p>At the top layer it might mean that simulation might be slowed down - time resolution slow downed (un-perceivable to us in simulation) to level where simulation becomes unusable&#x2F;no value running it.<p>At this point the simulation might be killed&#x2F;rebooted.<p>So if we have non-zero chance to live in simulation, creating our simulation might mean we are dooming ourselves.')
