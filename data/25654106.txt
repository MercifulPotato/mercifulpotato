For tools I use and places I want to work:<p>* Programming languages should be general.<p>* Programmers should be competent and disciplined enough not to misuse that generality.<p>I absolutely hate programming in languages like Java, designed for idiot programmers. I understand their place -- there are a lot of incompetent programmers, and we need to constrain them, and a lot of places with boring IT problems who won&#x27;t be able to hire competent people -- but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d ever want to touch. That sort of workplace and that sort of language would make me miserable.')
