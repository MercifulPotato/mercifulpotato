Ghost (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;driveghost.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;driveghost.com&#x2F;</a>) is funded by top VCs (incubated at sutter hill ventures, same firm that incubated Snowflake) with a highly technical second time founder in John Hayes (first company is the public company Pure Storage).<p>They&#x27;re taking the same bet (i.e. CV + ML advances on a large and high quality enough data set are enough).
