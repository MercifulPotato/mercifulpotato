Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610063096, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25679023, text='&gt; It is clear to me that Trump and his surroundings have no qualms about fabricating &quot;truths&quot; in whatever quantity fitting whatever narrative to match their aims.<p>This is how politics has been for a while. Trump just adopting the winning strategy employed by Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc.<p>&gt; I fully admit that I am not privy to the perspective of and influences on Trump supporters at large and capitol stormers in particular. However, the idea that there is a meaningful bar of evidence to clear before his supporters buy into his statements appears largely unfounded to me.<p>Yeah, people usually presume things they like to be valid, the same way they accept news media and blog posts uncritically when they agree with them. Its definitely part of the human condition and not anything significantly different among the different partisans these days.<p>&gt; And let me be perfectly clear that virtually every human will believe a convenient &quot;truth&quot; at some point or another. But given the degree to which Trump&#x27;s entire sphere of influence has supported any outlandish, nonsensical or downright contradictory thought he expresses, I do not see how election integrity measures would have moved the needle in this regard. (Which is not to dismiss the need for them, just their influence on this attack).<p>I&#x27;ll just point out that there&#x27;s a lot more diversity of opinion about trump on the right than you&#x27;re aware of, which is normal. I hear the same shit from people on the right about people on the left.<p>&gt; [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-claim" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-claim</a>...<p>Yeah, he&#x27;s a politician. This is no different than Pres. Obama &quot;you can keep your insurance if you like it&quot;, &quot;You didn&#x27;t build that&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m going to close Guantanamo Bay&quot;, etc. You can say that t told more whoppers, I&#x27;m not interested in disputing that. Politicians lie, if you&#x27;re going to hold one accountable then you need to be consistent. But holding politicians to their word doesn&#x27;t really get much traction, its always seen as partisan.')
