They are Starbucks. They are not the cheapest. They aren&#x27;t even the best. But they are everything you want.<p>If your company gets Starbucks-huge, you don&#x27;t need to buy your coffee from Starbucks. You have your own deals with roasters and your own supply chains and baristas and coffee logistics experts.<p>That&#x27;s why some companies build their own. Not because it&#x27;s a better idea (it&#x27;s not), or because Starbucks costs too much (compared to the investment in re-creating Starbucks?). It&#x27;s because they are a business that effectively makes their own coffee already, so it makes no sense to pay Starbucks for it. Of course, they won&#x27;t have <i>a Starbucks</i> once they make their own coffee, but they will have served their needs well enough.')
