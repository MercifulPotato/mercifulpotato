You can&#x27;t just force companies to compensate what they view as an unprofitable position.</i><p>That is absolutely not how demonetization works.  Google doesn&#x27;t take a poll of advertisers and ask if they think they should demonetize them.  YouTube reviewers unevenly apply intentionally vague policies to demonetize videos, seemingly at random.<p><i>We&#x27;ve currently had well over a century of the far left, socialism, receiving almost no corporate or government financial support. Both groups have been openly hostile towards the position, yet it has somehow managed.</i><p>I&#x27;d argue that the current incarnation of the Democratic Party is incredibly far left, and it has plenty of financial support.  By today&#x27;s standards, Bill Clinton during his Presidential years would be considered a conservative.  Even Barack Obama has been criticized by the woke left for saying that cancel culture is toxic [1].  You have to be pretty far left for Obama to say you&#x27;re too far left.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;voices&#x2F;obama-woke-meaning-michelle-cancel-culture-foundation-chicago-a9178436.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;voices&#x2F;obama-woke-meaning-mich...</a>')
