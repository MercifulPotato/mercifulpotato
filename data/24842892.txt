The US still dominates in logic and analog sub-product categories by a wide margin.<p>&gt; Back in the day as much as about 40%...<p>40% sounds too high -- I think 18% at max is more realistic.   Apple&#x27;s A chip cost was estimated between $12-$20 or about 7%-8% of total BOM.  Aside from Apple&#x27;s A chips fabbed by Samsung and baseband&#x2F;RF&#x2F;sensors by Qualcomm&#x2F;Skyworks, I can&#x27;t think of any other significant US components in Apple&#x27;s mobile product.  The most valuable components in the iPhones in those days were DRAM&#x2F;NAND flash storage (about 30% of BOM) and displays and they came from either Japan or South Korea.  Micron wasn&#x27;t an significant supplier until Apple&#x27;s relationship with Samsung soured.<p>Sure, who can forget Tim Apple&#x27;s rare CBS interview where he proudly declared the engines of their portable devices were made in the US, after which Apple promptly outsourced it to TSMC in Taiwan.  I suspect that that was a calculated move to make the final defense of their outsourcing practices before moving that out of the US as well.')
