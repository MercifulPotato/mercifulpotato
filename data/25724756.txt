Arrived and set it up. A week later the picture goes out. I register the TV with manufacturer and open a ticket for repair. Meanwhile since it’s the holidays I see what Amazon offers for support.<p>I chat with someone who helps me out. They are arranging a freight pickup courier to return the TV. I tell the agent I threw the box out to the TV. They said well without the box to ship it back I’d have to get one and it’s costly. So the agent refunded me the OLED TV with my word I’d e-waste the TV. Not even a week old. So I’m still waiting to see if the manufacturer will warranty repair the TV.<p>I’m wondering if I got lucky because of Covid or the holidays?')
