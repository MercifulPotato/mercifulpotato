Item(by='joshspankit', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610828852, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25803674, text='A) There are a lot of potential hiccups with trying to get a new IP:<p>- Some ISPs assign statically (odd, but true) meaning you will always get the same public IP<p>- The DHCP lease time is different for many ISPs: 5min to weeks, meaning you’d have to be offline for at least that long in order to be assigned a new IP when connecting<p>- Some ISPs lease it to the modem and not the router or anything internal (does not apply to what you said, but another tactic: changing the MAC address)<p>B) OP asked how to investigate. <i>If</i> getting a new IP dodges the issue and it doesn’t happen again, then there’s basically zero chance that the actual cause will be known')
