I’ve first heard it in a podcast with the monk Anselm Grün, who counsels burned out managers in Germany:<p>Think about what you could do for hours as a child. What kept you so interested that time just passed by?<p>Then examine what wish, image or interest underlies these activities. You will often find clear links to your current occupation.<p>The assumption underlying this is that our interests are unique and not random, and that we have to find or rediscover them as they tend to get overshadowed over time, which removes us from feelings of flow and focus.')
