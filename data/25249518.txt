What a waste!  Go hire someone who&#x27;s proven themselves instead.  Maybe a champion from your competitor, a hero from the open source community, a promising young startup who&#x27;s running circles around you.<p>Some quotes from the article:<p>- <i>Despite its lack of corrections experience, McKinsey won the contract.</i><p>- <i>As they formulated a reform plan, the consultants did not solicit the views of inmates, clinic staff or others with direct insights into drivers of violence.</i><p>- <i>The cityâ€™s bill from McKinsey would include $5.5 million for data analytics... These tools, however, proved I&#x27;ll-suited </i><p>- <i>Officials discovered coding errors in spreadsheets used to collect violence data from Restart units. The flaws were significant.</i><p>If you&#x27;re going to hire a big firm like this because you think they bring reputation and prestige, at least tie a portion of their remuneration to performance outcomes.')
