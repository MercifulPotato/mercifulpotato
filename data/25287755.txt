In countries with developed services and healthcare like Germany of Finland, the language barrier will heavily handicap one&#x27;s ability to even benefit from them.<p>One simply sees their paycheck cut by ~40% monthly and in case of crisis situation is always put at the end of the queue as a low priority applicant. That&#x27;s ranging from irritating to infurating depending on the urgency of one&#x27;s problems.')
