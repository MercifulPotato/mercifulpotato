However I am not sure how to handle the remaining difficult 20%. Particulary where to put the business logic.<p>I don&#x27;t want to have all my business logic in database. I don&#x27;t want to write all business logic in SQL. SQL is not good language for this and the tooling is suboptimal: editors, version control, libraries, testing.<p>Is there a way to define stored procedures and triggers in some host languge (as with SQLite)? Or is the recommended way to add extra API handled by language of choice? But I don&#x27;t want to do the same things in two different ways (i.e. querying by PostgREST and querying the DB directly)')
