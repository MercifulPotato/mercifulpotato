Item(by='milesvp', descendants=None, kids=[25554507], score=None, time=1609102918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551397, text='&gt; operator overloading for non-arithmetic purposes<p>I’m not sure it makes it a ‘good’ idea, but I recently needed to overload [] on an embedded system. The chip we used in a design didn’t have enough pins for both SPI and external memory. One of the memory address pins was used for both. So we wired up the memory skipping over the pin. This led to odd behavior that didn’t make sense until the original hardware engineer remembered he’d had to build it this way as a price compromise (the chip with enough pins would have probably been double the price). So I had to make sure that an adress translation happens on every access to DRAM, and overloading array access was a very obvious clean way to do this for any code that already did array access.')
