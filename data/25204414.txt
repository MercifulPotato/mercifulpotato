That the last common ancestor of octopus and human was a little wriggly thing, leads me to believe that forming a boundary between self and non self is hard (the bilayer), that forming a system of heredity is hard (first rna then dna). That the accumulation of processes that use energy, resources and information from the environment in new ways is a long relentless grind. The basic body form, multicellularity and a gut were, big difficult changes, but maybe intelligence is just paint on a hard won foundation.')
