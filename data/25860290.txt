Your company work, or individual projects?<p>If you&#x27;re an individual, then it would benefit someone who has multiple devices and&#x2F;or multiple operating systems and doesn&#x27;t want to manage their environment across all those devices and operating systems. For example, I personally have OSX, Windows, and several different Linux distributions on my laptop itself. My desktop also runs several operating systems.<p>Managing software across all of those is a pain. With Docker, I only have to manage the containers, and just have Docker installed on all the operating systems. Instead of managing like 50 different dependencies across 7 systems (think 7x50), I only have to manage Docker inside each system.<p>If you&#x27;re working for a company, they will have their own dev environment. Instead of setting up and troubleshooting all their dependencies on your computer, you can just use their containers.')
