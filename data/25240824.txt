I&#x27;d like to point out that the Kolmogorov complexity approach can make sense of subjective probability too. Since you lack precise enough information to predict the dice roll, the most compressed way to write down your observations will involve a Shannon-style code with your subjective probabilities. If you have enough information but not enough computational power, the resource-bounded variants of Kolmogorov complexity may be more applicable.')
