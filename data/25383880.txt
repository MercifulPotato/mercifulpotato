This will align the release cycle of NixOS after that of Ubuntu and Fedora. Hopefully, this will lessen the load on testing&#x2F;fixing high-profile package sets (systemd, GNOME, KDE) and as a consequence leave more time&#x2F;manpower fixing the longer tail.<p><i>even if it means cutting 80% of the packages out of the official repo</i><p>There are different opinions on that. Some contributors believe in a large, single monorepo, while others think nixpkgs is too large.<p>Personally, I have moved from the first group to the second. There are <i>many</i> packages with probably only a handful of users, but they clog up the PR stream. Even worse, many of those packages do not have active maintainers, so they end up being maintained by people who are long-term nixpkgs maintainers&#x2F;committers (and typically have a high maintenance load anyway).<p>It&#x27;s kind of interesting that nixpkgs grew so large, because it&#x27;s one of the distributions that makes it the easiest to add third-party package sets. I guess it&#x27;s because the bar for contributing a derivation is low (you basically open a PR and wait until somebody merges it) and because committers rarely reject packages for being to much of a fringe package.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NixOS&#x2F;rfcs&#x2F;pull&#x2F;80" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NixOS&#x2F;rfcs&#x2F;pull&#x2F;80</a>')
