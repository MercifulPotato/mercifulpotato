It&#x27;s also virtually risk-free should I fail. So long as I have enough money for a plane ticket home, I can just leave and there&#x27;s zero long term consequence. This is <i>incredibly</i> common for westerners in Asia to do. It&#x27;s also not uncommon for non-Americans to move to the US to instantly get a leg up in work with some companies really giving preferential treatment to things like H1Bs, then going back home with a larger savings and better opportunities to actually get started as an entrepreneur.<p>Americans who only have America don&#x27;t have those massive privileges.')
