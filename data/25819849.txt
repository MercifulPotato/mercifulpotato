If you use AR&#x2F;bands to cause or what could be deemed to be insurrection&#x2F;rebellion&#x2F;riot then that activity would be unlawful (whether AR was involved or not).<p>As AR is a communications medium, and given its intrinsic nature in that it can bypass the normal&#x2F;usual means that the State has to shut communications down - at least in the short term - the State has concerns (even if unwarranted - as it&#x27;s still a potential threat).<p>From the very outset in the early days of radio, there were two reasons for licencing radio transmitters&#x2F;operators, one was to control interference and the other was fear by governments that information could leave a country&#x27;s borders without the government&#x27;s knowledge or its ability to stop it, hence strict licensing.<p>In the early 1900s governments were truly paranoid that foreign agents etc. could use radio for war  or insurrection etc. It was a very big deal. (Note the shutdown of AR during WWII for similar reasons.)<p>Governments everywhere still worry about this. Note the rules around mobile phones which have similar issues.  The international mobile standards make it compulsory that phones send IMEI and serial numbers to cells for ID etc. to ensure that the communications can be tracked&#x2F;IDed.<p>Thus I&#x27;m not a bit surprised that the FCC issued this warning given the current political unrest.')
