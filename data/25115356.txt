Encrypted queries can still leak information to observers, and we apparently still have to trust Apple to &quot;remove&quot; information from their logs (rather than simply not logging to begin with.)<p>Dev certificate revocations are rare enough that they can be handled by periodic updates to an on-device revocation list. This is similar to what Chrome does with its CRLSet.')
