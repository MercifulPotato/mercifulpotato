They may not be as good, but they might be much cheaper. I can also see Microsoft pushing Windows on ARM harder, and rolling out their own chips at some point.<p>Also once the market gets &quot;used to&quot; multi-architecture software (again), I think we&#x27;ll see a renaissance of chip design as many more players crop up, because of the lower barrier to entry.')
