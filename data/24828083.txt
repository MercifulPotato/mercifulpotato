The difference in meaning for different punctuation for these crowds is SO evident, I feel like I&#x27;m always playing translator for even the language I grew up speaking and writing.<p>The biggest example of this is the ellipsis among the older crowd. In informal messaging that I grew accustomed to it went from being overused, to nowadays seeming like you are being sarcastic or angry about something. So among the younger crowd I see it almost never used anymore. On the other hand the older generations picked it up from how we used to use it, as a sort of pause. But they co-opted it as probably the most common punctuation used in their messaging. I&#x27;m not joking when I will sometimes receive a message from an older coworker that will contain an ellipsis every 5 words or so.<p>It&#x27;s always been interesting deciphering the actual meaning of some messages based on solely age of the sender.<p>This all to say, deciphering punctuation at all in informal writing is an interesting game.')
