Otherwise the companies wouldn&#x27;t bother with it, right?<p>Personally I don&#x27;t like it, although I&#x27;ve never seen asking for your name lumped in with the false politeness. It is pretty widespread over here. People are more likely to pick up on hearing their name, rather than a number, right? Nobody can spell my weird name, but they just put a phonetically similar more common one on the cup and I&#x27;ve learned to listen for that.<p>Store greeters are a pretty strange trend.')
