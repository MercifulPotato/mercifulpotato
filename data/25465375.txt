Usually the alternative presented to the mark is a compromise of some kind, providing him with some of the trappings of his lost status as well as some of its spirit. A lover may be asked to become a friend; a student of medicine may be asked to switch to the study of dentistry; a boxer may become a trainer; a dying person may be asked to broaden and empty his worldly loves so as to embrace the All-Father that is about to receive him. Sometimes the mark is allowed to retain his status but is required to fulfill it in a different environment: the honest policeman is transferred to a lonely beat; the too zealous priest is encouraged to enter a monastery; an unsatisfactory plant manager is shipped off to another branch. Sometimes the mark is &quot;kicked upstairs&quot; and given a courtesy status such as &quot;Vice President.&quot; In the game for social roles, transfer up, down, or away may all be consolation prizes.<p>&gt; [...] Where roles are ranked and somewhat related, persons who have been rejected from the one above may be difficult to distinguish from persons who have risen from the one below. For example, in America, upper class women who fail to make a marriage in their own circle may follow the recognized route of marrying an upper middle class professional. Successful lower middle class women may arrive at the same station in life, coming from the other direction. Similarly, among those who mingle with one another as colleagues in \nthe profession of dentistry, it is possible to find some who have failed to become physicians and others who have succeeded at not becoming pharmacists or optometrists. No doubt there are few positions in life that do not throw together some persons who are there by virtue of failure and other persons who are there by virtue of success. In this sense, the dead are sorted but not segregated, and continue to walk \namong the living.<p>On Cooling the Mark Out: \nSome Aspects of Adaptation to Failure -- Erving Goffman<p>Psychiatry: Journal of Interpersonal Relations 1952<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;infofranpro.wdfiles.com&#x2F;local--files&#x2F;19520101-on-cooling&#x2F;19520101%20On%20cooling.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;infofranpro.wdfiles.com&#x2F;local--files&#x2F;19520101-on-cool...</a>')
