Item(by='sofixa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610439923, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25742962, text='&gt; First, Parler gets kicked off because &quot;They host violent, imminent threats&quot;. Never mind the sheer scale of terrorist groups organizing on Facebook, Twitter and enjoying free high quality encryption thanks to Whatsapp<p>What&#x27;s with all the whataboutism here? Can you honestly not see the difference? One is an echo chamber of hate with a lot of calls to violence and support thereof, and the platform does nothing about it. The others have shittons of shit ( cat videos, porn, ads, anti-vaxx bullshit, etc) <i>and</i> hate and calls for violence, which are moderated ( not nearly good enough). Apple explicitly asked Parler to come up with a moderation plan or get booted of their store, and they didn&#x27;t. Twitter, Facebook, Google heavily moderate and ban all sorts of hate-related content.<p>&gt; Tomorrow, will it be okay to point a finger at any individual and have the equivalent of mass economic sanctions destroy their ability to be a part of society because they disagree with the broad interpretation of &quot;values&quot; these tech companies arbitrarily decide?<p>I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;ve suddenly decided that if doing X to Y is okay today, doing X to Z will be as well tomorrow. That&#x27;s not how regular people work in most cases, and if tomorrow &quot;SV&quot;( if you&#x27;re so intent on throwing them all together, as if they aren&#x27;t composed of many people at different levels ( employees, managers, CxOs, shareholders) in different countries, with varying political affiliations or views) decide to deplatform something people disagree being deplatformed, people will complain, same as what people are doing together to defend the hate speech spewing fascists on Parler.')
