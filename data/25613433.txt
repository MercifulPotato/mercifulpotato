I use a Costco brand. You can add it to almost any meal. If you are lifting weights, its almost impossible to get enough vegan sources of protein to meet the 1g &#x2F; 1 lb of body weight that is usually recommended.<p>Actually, if anyone knows how to put together 150g+ protein &#x2F;day on a vegan diet in under 2100 calories I would be interested. I would switch over at least a few of my days to vegan.')
