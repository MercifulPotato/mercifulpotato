Of course it&#x27;s not useful for small inputs - it&#x27;s explicitly about large inputs.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s implemented very efficiently<p>On large inputs, it&#x27;s very hard see how, say, a linear algorithm with a quadratic algorithm regardless of how &quot;efficiently&quot; it&#x27;s implemented. Assuming you&#x27;re talking about something like cache friendliness or good register allocation?')
