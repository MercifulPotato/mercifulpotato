Seems to me that if you want to provide liquidity what you need to do is buy a wide range of stocks and sit on them so they&#x27;re all listed and available for trade.  But you don&#x27;t need extremely low latency for that.  If you&#x27;re providing liquidity you should be sitting on an insanely diverse portfolio at the end of every day.  The whole point is to make sure trades are available so nobody is waiting for something to appear on the market.')
