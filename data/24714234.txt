I love not going to a gas station to fill up every week.<p>I don’t think I will get another Tesla. I think most electric cars will drive similar to the Tesla in 2 years, and what I’m looking for is a more solid, luxurious feel to the interior. The Model 3 interior feels very cheap and plastic vs BMW that feels nice. I hate the all-screen experience of the Model 3. The X6 was probably the best driving experience I’ve had and I miss it. I also miss knowing I can get in the X6 and drive anywhere in North America without thinking too deeply about it. I would have driven my family to Canada for a few months during the pandemic but we didn’t have a car that would reliably take us that distance from SF.')
