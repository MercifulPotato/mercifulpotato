Developers and third-party libraries will always use the latest features and architecture patterns, while old experiments will be left behind to die. This should not be a problem for small and medium-sized projects because you can adapt much more easily. But for big multi-year projects, these experiments can be a deal-breaker.<p>I really wanted to use React for my current project and it would have sped up development. But I was afraid of this attitude of breaking things that pervades the ecosystem. I&#x27;m using HTML + Alpine.js. It&#x27;s more work, but no breaking changes in libraries so far. I&#x27;m still not sure I made the right call. Only time will tell.')
