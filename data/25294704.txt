I think there&#x27;s some legitimate concern that AI isn&#x27;t fair to marginalized groups for a variety of reasons.<p>Dataset bias is only one way this occurs, though.  Even if you include more colored faces, you still may be taking pictures with a camera that doesn&#x27;t capture as much contrast.  Or even if you retrain, you may have chosen model structure to optimize behavior in a biased dataset.  Or... if you&#x27;re considering the <i>cost</i> of misidentification by a facial recognition system used by, say, police, you need to be sure that you take a perspective that applies to society as a whole and not to your own interactions with police.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to say &quot;AI is worsening the experience of minorities in various ways&quot; and to differ with responses that assume with slight additional care in curating datasets that the problem will be completely solved.')
