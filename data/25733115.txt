Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610388643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25730166, text='&gt; The disgusting content was literally its reason for existing, despite all of the bland &quot;we&#x27;re just a free speech site&quot; stuff.<p>I disagree with this. My experience with Parler was very limited, but from a quick glance, I was not able to find any call for violence. I&#x27;m sure it exists, but the sense I got is that the vast majority of content and accounts are simply posting conservative content. Do you have evidence that &quot;disgusting content&quot; (whatever that means) is its &quot;reason for existing&quot;? That seems like a self-serving editorial conclusion rather than something borne out by hard evidence.')
