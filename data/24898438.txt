And it&#x27;s an exponential growth; who knows when it might taper off. I certainly don&#x27;t expect it will just stop increasing when we hit that, although maybe it will.<p>Happy to tell you that we aren&#x27;t.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Representative_Concentration_Pathway#Projections_based_on_the_RCPs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Representative_Concentration_P...</a><p>The 4-5celcius number you provide comes from the IPCC RCP8.5.

This is a grossly overestimated projection that&#x27;s worse than worse case scenario.<p>With all current actions taken by humans on Earth to reduce emissions. We are currently on the RCP4.5 path. So more like an average of 1.8celcius increase. Which is great news, very little impact to our society.<p>&gt;Also, 50 million years ago the temperature was that warm but it also happens to be around the time when an impact of a large asteroid caused one of the greatest extinction events in the history of the planet[1]. Not sure if that&#x27;s relevant to the temperature aspect or not. Just throwing it out there.<p>Here&#x27;s the graph. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eemian#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:All_palaeotemps.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eemian#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:All_palaeot...</a><p>As you can see there&#x27;s quite the variation over the last 500 million years. For about 200 million years the Earth was 2-10 celcius warmer until that asteroid.<p>Long story short, the climate change issue is far less problematic than you believe.')
