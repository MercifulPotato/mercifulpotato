You can represent &quot;not responding&quot; in a way that isn&#x27;t confused with real data (even if zero-length), and you can refuse to go down the path that expects data.  But no dependent type can <i>make it respond</i>.  And you&#x27;re still stuck with the questions:  &quot;What do I do then?  How do I handle it?  Can my program continue at all?  How do I tell the user what&#x27;s wrong?&quot;  As far as I can see, dependent types don&#x27;t help with the larger problem at all.')
