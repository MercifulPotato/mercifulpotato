Not sure if it&#x27;s true or not or why that is.<p>I think you missed the mark on this though. I never saw Wayland as being any less about mechanism over policy. In theory X does have more mechanisms to work with but in practice the well-behaved programs that get used a lot tend use toolkits that follow ICCCM&#x2F;EWMH strictly, and won&#x27;t do strange things that are out of the ordinary with the policies of the popular desktops.<p>Compared to Wayland where the idea seems to be that WM implementers actually got more freedom to add any policies they want because they also implement the display server. From a client perspective it&#x27;s still the same as X. Clients get what they need to function in isolation and don&#x27;t really have to care about a WM&#x27;s policies, and when they want to care they check for a specific policy. (In X they would check for an atom) I guess that probably doesn&#x27;t work so well for Arcan because it also doesn&#x27;t set anything in the way of policy. Maybe it would be possible for Arcan users to write policies as wayland extensions in lua?')
