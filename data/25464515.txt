Would happily be proven wrong though!<p>Seems like the cancelation happening in your scenario would likely be from a delay of half the period of the sound waves, effectively making them roughly &quot;complementary&quot; or &quot;inverse&quot;. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m familiar with the research, though.<p>On a sillier note, have you heard of the Speech Jammer? [0]<p>It&#x27;s a device to disrupt a person&#x27;s speech by playing it back to them with a delay of a few milliseconds. Hilarious results. Also easily reproducible at home if you&#x27;re bored.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2012-09-speech-jammer-ig-nobel-winners.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2012-09-speech-jammer-ig-nobel-winners...</a>')
