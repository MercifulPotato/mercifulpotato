No wonder the S&amp;P 500 CAPE ratio is beyond the 1929 high. No one has any idea of what the intrinsic value is of anything.<p>Investing in companies that don’t make a profit, investing in companies whose investment returns are below real inflation, investing in SPACs that don’t expose financials.<p>You’d literally make more money today taking your cash and starting a business than dumping it in some of these worthless pursuits.')
