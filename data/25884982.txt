Item(by='WClayFerguson', descendants=None, kids=[25885718], score=None, time=1611427569, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25884674, text='&gt; Your explanation is one popular view of QM<p>If you want to call the &quot;Standard Model&quot; merely one among many &quot;popular views&quot; then you can, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d call accurate. No one really disagrees with it. They just have different &quot;interpretations&quot; of why it holds true.<p>Regarding your claim that electrons &quot;interact with themselves&quot;, that&#x27;s actually kind of misleading too. When electrons are &quot;in the cloud&quot; (pre-wave-collapse) they&#x27;re pure probability and so none of them have an actual location in spacetime even if you had some infinitely fast camera to look. They simply don&#x27;t exist at specific locations. They are <i>genuinely</i> everywhere at once, or stated even <i>more</i> correctly: they don&#x27;t exist. Only the energy exists.<p>The &quot;Bohr Model&quot; of the atom is correct insofar as a way to track energies in a classically relevant way, but in no way at all is it actually &quot;real&quot;. There&#x27;s no electrons flying around. Only electrons that have already stopped. They don&#x27;t exist until measured.')
