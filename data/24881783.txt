Users create an account in our app with an email address and password. Eventually after some time, they forget their password. That&#x27;s fine, then can put in their email address and get emailed a password reset link to set a new one.<p>However, occasionally, they get a new email address and lose access to their original one, and then also forget their password. At this point, they&#x27;re now stuck. They can&#x27;t perform a password reset because they don&#x27;t have access to the original email address associated with the account.<p>What&#x27;s the best practice for dealing with this situation?<p>I know some sites ask a series of &quot;security questions&quot; that allow you to authenticate without access to the email address, but are there any other options? I don&#x27;t really want to store everyone&#x27;s mother&#x27;s maiden name or the name of the street they grew up on.<p>Is there a better way of dealing with this that doesn&#x27;t leave users locked out because they forgot to update the email address in our system when they changed emails?')
