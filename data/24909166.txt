Due to a family history of digestive issues, the doctor figured a colonoscopy would be worth doing. There was a long thread about this a few days. It&#x27;s not big deal. You drink a gallon of salt water, visit the bathroom a few times, and the procedure can take place in a small sterile doctor&#x27;s room - a mini hospital, you can say. Within 30 minutes of waking up from the anesthesia I was back in the office. Hardly a big deal. The hardest part wasn&#x27;t the prep, it was being hungry and running out of shows to watch on Netflix. Just do it if you&#x27;re in the age bracket and haven&#x27;t already.')
