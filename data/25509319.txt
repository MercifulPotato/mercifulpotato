I work just enough to not make it impact my life (freelance). Sometimes I work 5 hours a day, others 2, others 8. If it reaches the point where I feel stressed I downgrade immediately or take a day off. I chose programming specifically so I can do this (pays and is flexible enough).<p>Career is there just as something (i) I can keep busy with, (ii) sort of like, and (iii) gives me some income. The rest of the day is what really matters to me and I try to concentrate on that. Hobbies, family, friends etc. That&#x27;s what really matters to me.<p>To think of it differently imagine if you didn&#x27;t have to work to make a living; what would you do? I try to ask myself that question and do those things even if sometimes I have to tradeoff.<p>Your deep passions and skills might not be aligned with what society wants and is willing to pay for.')
