It doesn&#x27;t require any assumption about the distribution of the data.<p>If you wanted to make\nsome inference, like maybe about the likelihood of observing some z-score given a hypothesis, then you would need to assume a distribution.<p>But, nothing the author does assumes a distribution, normal or otherwise. It doesn&#x27;t mention probability at all as far as I can see.')
