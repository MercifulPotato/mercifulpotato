Keep the same budget, polish more and make a beautifully intense plot-line. Afterwards you feel fulfilled and have a sense of accomplishment.<p>It&#x27;s the same with a lot of computer games. I remember i loved to binge when i was younger but when you are older than say mid twenties 50-70 hour games just annoy me. A good example of this is a game like Witcher 3, pretty cool game but just completely endless -  frustrating for a person who also has a lot of work, family, friends etc. You never feel accomplished, its a stale feeling, and you don&#x27;t remember half the plot because you don&#x27;t have time to play 10 hours a day.')
