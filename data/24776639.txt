Way to much water treading going on in modern media. I have watched the first season of so many shows that just either began to repeat themselves or began to fall in quality - i think a miniseries would make a lot of things better. Keep the same budget, polish more and make a beautifully intense plot-line. Afterwards you feel fulfilled and have a sense of accomplishment.<p>It&#x27;s the same with a lot of computer games. I remember i loved to binge when i was younger but when you are older than say mid twenties a 50-70 hour games just annoy me. A good example of this is a game like Witcher 3, pretty cool game but just completely endless - i have tried to wrap it up several times but it&#x27;s just endless walking around - incredibly frustrating for a person who also has a lot of work, family, friends etc. Also you never feel accomplished, its a stale feeling.<p>Please make everything shorter and better.')
