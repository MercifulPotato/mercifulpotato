Was there a time when any person with any message could reach the whole country with their message?<p>The scarce resource here isn&#x27;t freedom of speech, it&#x27;s people&#x27;s <i>attention</i>. As always, you can say whatever you want, and as always, it&#x27;s hard to get people to listen to you. Before the internet, you basically needed an already-famous person to take an interest in you in order to get noticed. Now a message can go viral organically, without needing to involve any journalists or talk-show hosts, but the platforms are free to stop something from going viral if they don&#x27;t like it. Facebook giveth and Facebook taketh away.<p>But to answer your question, I think breaking up the platforms would be a better solution than treating them as de-facto public services and trying to regulate them as such. Or appropriate them and make them into actual public services :)')
