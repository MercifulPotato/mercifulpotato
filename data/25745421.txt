If your account doesn&#x27;t have 25% more money in it you&#x27;re losing out and someone else is gaining an advantage without working.<p>At any given instant, that new money has to be somewhere controlled by someone. People would have to be a bit naive to try and hold their wealth in dollars with that sort of unfairness built in. And also even 2% inflation makes it a stupid strategy.')
