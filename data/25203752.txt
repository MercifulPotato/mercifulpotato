From an intuitive standpoint it&#x27;s also easy to see why entropy can decrease. However the problem is, most people don&#x27;t have a good intuition of what entropy is....<p>Entropy is a probabilistic phenomena. Meaning that entropy can go lower, it&#x27;s just that there is a low probability of it happening.<p>So for example random particles in a closed system do have the potential of self organizing into a cube but it&#x27;s just a very very low probability.<p>Even the sentence above distracts from what entropy truly is because our solar system is an example of particles self organizing into spheres rather than cubes.<p>Here&#x27;s another example: Flat cylindrical Magnets will self organize into stacks. When the magnets are scattered entropy is lower, when the magnets self organize into a stack entropy has reached it&#x27;s highest equilibrium point.<p>Once you understand why the above occurs in the context of entropy than you truly understand the concept. Until then most people don&#x27;t understand it at all and explain away the self organization with some temperature increase happening somewhere else in the system.<p>The logic above holds the flaw that the system is still self organizing by shifting temperature to other regions in the system.  Moving temperature or disorder to specific regions in a system is still self organization.')
