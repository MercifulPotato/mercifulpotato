The website full30.com was created specifically because YouTube decided that talking about guns wasn’t advertiser-friendly.  There weren’t that many gun-related videos that YouTube actually removed, but they started to de-monetize just about any video that focused on guns.  So the affected creators didn’t stop making videos, they just made their own content delivery solution.<p>So it’s not just a hypothetical, it has already happened and the other echo chambers are out there with a warm embrace for the affected content creators.  The only thing YouTube is effectively doing is making its bubble more insular, so that Californians can act more surprised the <i>next</i> time the country elects someone like Trump.')
