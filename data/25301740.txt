And which notable, useful old tecnologies have been discarded?<p>The capabilities of the web have only been expanded.<p>You can still build websites in Django and Rails and myriad other &quot;old-school&quot; technologies. What are you missing? Perl and CGI?<p>To the point of this article, you can perfectly build a website with self-hosted fonts, or with default system fonts. Is this what &quot;lock-in&quot; and discarding good ole&#x27; tech looks to you?<p>It&#x27;s tiring to see this bitterly pessimistic, conspiracy-laden rhetoric on HN. With the added bonus that as of late it&#x27;s being radicalized (&quot;subverted&quot;, &quot;enslaved&quot;), as some sibling commenters are pointing out. How ironic that the people accusing everyone else of being &quot;enslaved&quot; are themselves carried away by the trends of the time.<p>But more importantly, this rhetoric is profoundly demeaning.<p>To web developers and technologists, because it assumes that they are largely incompetent or malicious, and that the commenter and his clique of retro-futurists know <i>much better</i> and are morally more pure than all tech professionals nowadays.<p>To regular people at large, because it paints them as drones and slaves to greater powers, with no agency whatsoever, instead of analyzing why they may prefer Facebook over old-school forums, and empathizing with them and their problems.<p>But above all, it&#x27;s demeaning to the authors of such comments themselves, because it paints them as dejected, bitter fanatics who have lost sight of the forest for the trees.<p>The web is still full of opportunity - artistic, technical, commercial and otherwise.<p>If you don&#x27;t think so, maybe it&#x27;s time you embrace a low-tech lifestyle and devote yourself to gardening? Everyone will be better off for it.')
