Average means absolutely nothing if you don&#x27;t take into account how  uneven the income distribution is, specially in the US where income inequality reached abismal levels.<p>To focus on the facts, the median household income in the US is close to $63k. Note it&#x27;s median, not average, and note it&#x27;s <i>household income</i>, and not anual income.<p>That means that in half of US households you still get a household income lower than those $63k even if you add two incomes.  That&#x27;s how half of the US population lives.')
