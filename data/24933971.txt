In that case, “100%” may be more like 20%, since we can only use some of it.<p>Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve used Vitamin D drops to raise my Vitamin D levels from deficient to 57 ng&#x2F;mL.  Blood tested three times to confirm stability at or around that level.  I&#x27;ve heard numerous times that vitamin supplements don&#x27;t work, or aren&#x27;t absorbed the way same, but the blood tests don&#x27;t lie.')
