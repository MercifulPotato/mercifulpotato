This shows tech companies won&#x27;t let you say the things half the population thinks!&quot;<p>3. &quot;Larry Ellison and Elon Musk love Trump&#x27;s policies!&quot;<p>4. &quot;Tech workers often support conservative policies like freedom, opposing government waste and avoiding needless over-regulation. Many tech companies like Uber embody conservative ideals, as do Silicon Valley voters through Prop 13 and Prop 22&quot;<p>5. &quot;Tech workers often oppose liberal policies like rent control, mandatory hiring diversity, and inheritance taxes on multi-million-dollar homes&quot;<p>6. &quot;Claims the party is anti-intellectual and anti-science are fake news, how could so many republicans run successful campaigns if they weren&#x27;t smart? Anyone who seems stupid is actually a genius making a 2000-IQ five-dimensional-chess move. Sadly a lot of tech workers have fallen for the lies of the fake news media.&quot;')
