This is the main reason I choose Rust or Python or literally anything else over Go for personal projects. Because I may or may not be more productive in Go if I keep working at it, and go has so many benefits over many other choices, but I mainly write software because I enjoy it. I typically do not enjoy writing Go (and I have seen this sentiment echoed widely). And I think that because enjoyment is much less important in a corporate environment, corporate representatives make up the lion&#x27;s share of the enthusiasm.')
