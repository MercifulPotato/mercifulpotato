Wine is not a windows replacement nor can Microsoft really show any negative impact on the market for windows license sales because of Wine. Wine (recursive backronym for Wine Is Not an Emulator) is &quot;simply&quot; a compatibility layer that convert between Windows ABI calls into native linux system calls. Wine is not an operative system replacement for windows, and wine user base compared to windows is comparable so tiny that any argument based on market impact should be taken with a lot of skepticism.<p>In addition I would be a bit surprised if wine has copied 11000 lines of header files from windows, arranged identically to Microsoft Windows source code.')
