And our immune system makes this very hard, as aptly explained in this excellent xkcd comic:</i><p>I feel like that really is a terrible take on what that comic shows. Based on those two lines, I was expecting the comic to be about how viruses take over a cell and use its own internal structures to turn it into a virus manufacturing plant until it finally explodes and dies, releasing these invaders into the system.<p>It doesn&#x27;t show that and it also doesn&#x27;t really show much about the immune system. It mostly talks about how hand washing and social isolation are effective barriers to the spread of disease, which is something I&#x27;m a big believer in but has nothing to do with how our immune system works.<p>Also also (a thing I said some hours ago elsewhere on HN):<p><i>... &quot;the immune system&quot; doesn&#x27;t really mean a specific set of organs like &quot;the circulatory system&quot; or &quot;the digestive system&quot; means a specific set of organs. It&#x27;s just kind of a catch phrase for &quot;how the body protects itself&quot; and it&#x27;s not really that well understood or explained exactly that happens.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25167263" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25167263</a>')
