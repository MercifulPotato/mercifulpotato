People from the cities are coming to the countryside, thinking they own it and they can remove any nuisance which does not fit they idealized view of the countryside. \nThey are dead wrong, life in rural area is all about having good relationship with your neighbors because people help each other there. I remember when a storm hit the region, everyone got out, cleared the trees on the road and repaired each other houses.<p>I grew up in a village in France: the neighbor has a rooster and the house is next to a church. When I took my wife, a city dweller, to the village, she told me she couldn&#x27;t sleep past 6am due to the noises from the church (bells ring at 6, then every hour) and the rooster. \nI am so used to it that my brain filters any rooster or church bells sound.')
