Item(by='cxr', descendants=None, kids=[25502181, 25502002], score=None, time=1608595814, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25497766, text='This is visually interesting, but I can&#x27;t help but feel that doesn&#x27;t mimic the experience of browsing in a library.  It prioritizes book covers that distract the eye (and strain it, being thumbnail-sized).  I remember feeling the same way when Apple showed off skeuomorphic bookshelves on the iPad(?).<p>Are the various scanning projects (inc. The Internet Archive&#x27;s own) failing to photograph spines?  The screenshot of the 3D view in this post shows computer generated spines.  Trying things out in the explorer, there&#x27;s another &quot;3d-spines&quot; view that&#x27;s similar (and a &quot;spines&quot; view that doesn&#x27;t seem usable at all, but maybe that&#x27;s a bug caused by browser differences).<p>The ideal interface IMO would mimic eyeballing a shelf of spines without the requirement of tilting your head 90 degrees (unless you wanted to, I guess).  I&#x27;m thinking of a fullscreen interface that resembles the &quot;3d-spines&quot; view, but it lets you drop into a narrow focus on a single shelf, with a stack of proportionally correct scans of real spines that take the full width of the screen, with the hint of the cover in the gaps superimposed by uniformly typeset labels.')
