Either way you end up with a programmerocracy, so why not try to reduce harm on others then? Maybe what you advocate for isn’t perfect, but if you can’t avoid politics in your workplace, why don’t you fight for what you believe in?<p>&gt; Political changes aren&#x27;t objectively &quot;for the better&quot;. If that was true, they wouldn&#x27;t be political decisions, but business decisions.<p>Very few things are objective. Some would argue that nothing is objective. This is not a reason not to act.<p>&gt; we resort to distributed opinion instead<p>This is not true.
