The no code approah just isn&#x27;t for everyone I guess. Most major cloud providers have some level of abstraction for ML modelling these days which is why I was curious to check yours out as well. Hence please take my main point to be the plea for something that shows what your platform is doing without exposing data. :-)<p>As for the other questions, your pitch text made claims like &quot;you can share your data with people and they can use it in their projects but cant steal it.&quot; as well as, I assume, the mere existence of these tools having some impact on bias. Both data extraction from models deployed in the wild and model&#x2F;data bias have been topics of discussion in ML research over the past few years and I was wondering if your tooling did anything specific to tackle those aspects.<p>PS: Are the icons like &quot;view_quilt&quot; on your home page huge? On mobile chrome I could read halfway down the page before those loaded in and was a bit confused about the placeholder text.<p>PPS: On your homepage in a real browser now (Firefox on Linux, recentish version), you somehow managed to disable text selection there.')
