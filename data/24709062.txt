I&#x27;m interested in the music. EVH did, in fact, push this along with his technique and compositional ideas. I don&#x27;t give a damn about his personality, or who becomes a &quot;star&quot;. Almost none of my favorite musicians are stars, despite levels of creativity and technical ability that are hard to measure or even imagine for most of us.<p>I wasn&#x27;t suggesting that technique is everything. Great musicians have imagination and strong connections to existing cultures (even when they ignore them). But so many people talked about EVH in terms of his technique (&quot;OMFG, did you see that Eruption solo?&quot; etc. etc).<p>And for reference, the &quot;mainstream culture&quot; I grew up in (London, 70s-early 80s) was unimpressed by EVH and american rock in general.<p>But yes, rock is not mainstream anymore, and thus &quot;rock stars&quot; are not a thing. Bieber is not even close to being a &quot;rock star&quot; - we had &quot;pop stars&quot; all through the 60s and 70s and they were entirely distinct from the &quot;rock stars&quot; of those same eras.')
