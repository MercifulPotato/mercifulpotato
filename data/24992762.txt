Most everyone else in the class either brought a comic book or some Dr. Seuss stuff. For what ever reason she noticed me and came to my desk while I was reading and stopped me and asked if what I was reading was &quot;too hard&quot;. I don&#x27;t know what I said, but I was super confused and scared thinking she&#x27;d take way my field guide and make me read dumb comics.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;y3LPxAX.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;y3LPxAX.jpg</a>')
