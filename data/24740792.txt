Left to my own schedule, I go to bed later and later and wake up later and later.<p>The thing that works for me is waking up (with an alarm) every day at the same time (6 o&#x27;clock) including week-ends.<p>I have a &quot;dawn simulator&quot; clock so most of the time I&#x27;m already awake when the alarm rings.
