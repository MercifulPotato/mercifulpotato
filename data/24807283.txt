But if you want to share it, you need to do that explicitly, so the rest of us can follow what it is. It&#x27;s quite common that people post 1% of what is in their mind (often in a snarky way) and assume that they expressed all of it. Then when others respond badly to the snark or totally misinterpret what they meant, it seems weird (or they seem obtuse) because you felt you expressed yourself. Actually that feeling depends on your already knowing the content of your mind and your past experiences—which the rest of us don&#x27;t. We need it to be laid out explicitly and step-by-step in order to get it and respond meaningfully. That would be interesting. When you do that, though, please do it without snark—we have that rule for a bunch of reasons.')
