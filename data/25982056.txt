But the Internet has created opportunities for all sorts of people to get together faster than ever for all sorts of things.<p>You don&#x27;t need &gt;100% short interest for a shorted stock to go to infinity.  A single share can do that.  If I own all the shares, and you borrowed a single share and sold it back to me... well, good luck.  Also these sort of attacks aren&#x27;t really new.  Short squeeze has happened before and various other similar ideas (attacking someone with leveraged positions or otherwise risky positions, including currencies).  The interesting bit here is IMO the way these people, at least temporarily, acted together. Also the way the hedge funds couldn&#x27;t grok that like they surely would if they were under attack from a more standard player.')
