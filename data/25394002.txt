Writing a batch mode parser that takes an entire correct source file and produces an AST is easy. Writing a parser that instaneously handle producing an updating AST while the user is typing in the middle of the program while still allowing semantic analysis to occur and without vomiting out a pile of extraneous errors or giving up entirely is a <i>lot</i> harder.')
