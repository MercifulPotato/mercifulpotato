I guess you want to work with the ‘normal’ integers and reals. If so, you’ll need<p>- fixed-size integers (signed and unsigned)<p>- big integers<p>- rationals with big integer numerators and denominators<p>You also want all of them to be fast, especially if you’re going to explore things.<p>If you’re going to do exact polynomials, you’ll want the ability to represent radicals (square root of 2, third root of (square root of 2 plus 1), etc). That gets you to a computer algebra system (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Computer_algebra_system" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Computer_algebra_system</a>) that will also help in doing exact analysis.<p>If you want your system to be extensible, you’ll want operator overloading (if you implement <i>addition mod n</i>, you will want to write it using ‘+’). You’ll also need extensibility if you’re going to hunt for counterexamples, as you’ll need it for performance.<p>On the other hand, if you want to do proofs, you may want an automated theorem prover (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automated_theorem_proving" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automated_theorem_proving</a>) or a proof assistant (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Proof_assistant" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Proof_assistant</a>)<p>I don’t think you can get all of the above in one system. That’s why you have to decide what kind of math you want to do before picking the system.')
