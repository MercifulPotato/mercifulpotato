The cscope features are listed on its home page.<p>The reason i like it is because it is implemented in the classic &quot;Unix Tools&quot; manner i.e. small, fast, self-contained, good feature set and easily integrated with many editors. Now of course you have lots more tools with similar functionalities but i find most to be too big and unwieldy with lots of dependencies and a pain to setup. If you have ever been forced to work on minimal systems with no Desktop GUIs, remote targets etc. you come to appreciate small powerful tools which you can carry with you everywhere.')
