Of course in a corporate environment with whole racks full of disks it makes sense, but at home I just rather synchronise single disks. Make&#x2F;buy a NAS with two disks for media files, use one as master and copy the changes from one to the other at midnight or whatever frequency makes most sense. It gives you a chance to undo stupid command line mistakes, and you don&#x27;t need to have similar models of disk. Then keep an external eSATA&#x2F;USB disk to backup the main disk once a week&#x2F;month.<p>When I was younger, all these experiments with firewalls, routers, vlans, RAID and other more professional technologies were a good learning experience, but after all those years, I rather keep work at work and keep it simple at home rather than to simulate a corporate environment on a shoestring budget.')
