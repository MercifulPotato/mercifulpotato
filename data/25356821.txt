Unless maybe if you really put time&#x2F;effort into stopping that (if it&#x27;s still possible at all).<p>This is not meant to be judgemental. I&#x27;m actually of the opinion this is better in general than leaving sysadmin duties to the general public, which was largely the situation in the 1990s &#x2F; early 2000s. But outsourcing this to Microsoft does of course have it&#x27;s downsides, like you just experienced.')
