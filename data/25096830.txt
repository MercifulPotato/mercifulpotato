Every bullet point on your resume might represent months of work (depending on how long your career has been). E.g., you may have refactored the front-end in a few days, or maybe it took you two months. There&#x27;s no way to sum that experience into one bullet point, and that&#x27;s not really the point.<p>It&#x27;s better to have some very targeted details that can reveal the depth of your experience than high level summaries which may technically be better descriptors. It helps the person reading the resume better imagine who you are and the kinds of things that you do.<p>It also can provide a bit of context that you can later expand on in more detail during e.g. a screening interview. They might ask you how you measured user engagement, which gives you another chance to talk and sound smart. You might miss that opportunity with more generic descriptors.')
