You can have a decent steak for much less.<p>It depends on what you call &quot;decent&quot; and what&#x27;s the general quality of produce in your country. There are cheaper steaks here too, but they it&#x27;s just pieces of charred mediocre meat, which you wouldn&#x27;t risk to order done medium rare anyway.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s just the rampant US-version of classism (if one think it&#x27;s bad in the UK, have them wait till they talk to some upper-middle class US people).<p>Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with classism, but classism itself is your attitude towards people, not things. Taste in food is not and cannot be classism by definition.')
