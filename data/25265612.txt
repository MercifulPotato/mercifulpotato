What I&#x27;ve seen: blatant lies in regulated industry with mandatory call recordings, refusal to do even the basic admin( I&#x27;m here to sell, not to fill in the info in the CRM system), fraud ( can&#x27;t comment,as it&#x27;s quite specific), lazyness ( watching YouTube&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Shopping while pretending your phone isn&#x27;t working). The list goes on. Those people get fired. Normal people, who work, understand what they do and are willing to be trained or corrected if they do things incorrectly, are rarely,if ever, 2 paychecks away from being fired.')
