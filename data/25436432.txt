And the next 100 people makes $100,000 a year. Then the total is $20 million dollars.<p>When you divide this by 101, you get an average of $198,000. Which is nearly double what the normal person in this example earns.<p>The better metric is to use the median salary. Which in this example is $100,000. And the executiveâ€™s salary is the outlier.<p>Then again, most executives are paid in tax deferred stock options. And they cash out for a pot of gold after a few years. So this distorts any estimates of general income and wealth of the population.')
