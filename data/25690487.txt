It doesn&#x27;t work: fails to connect because none of the machines I have (even the Windows one!) is able to trust the digital certificate from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;textsecure-service.whispersystems.org&#x2F;v1&#x2F;config" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;textsecure-service.whispersystems.org&#x2F;v1&#x2F;config</a> .

And their website has no mention about adding certificates to my chain.<p>I wanna try to move away from Whatsapp too, but when your &quot;Secure&quot; app fails to work because no one trusts your digital certificate, I inevitably start questioning your claims of both quality and security...
