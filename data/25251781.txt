He takes Tyson hostage as an unwitting totem for the &#x27;uneducated intellectual&#x27; in order to stridently indict the scholar class that he clearly despises. The author also shoehorns Tyson&#x27;s genuinely incoherent statements to fit his narrative. In short, the author had an agenda and a consequent myopia. Drivel.')
