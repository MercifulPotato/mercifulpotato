Government could then pay Google-level salaries and provide Google-level resources to the top minds in the world and give them free rein to tackle problems like this. It&#x27;s worked in the past, such as Manhattan project or moon landing. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doable nowadays because of the anti-government political culture. Even when government is fully funding things these days the work has to be farmed out to private interests.')
