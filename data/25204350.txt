Some issues, and it consumes some time, but so would managed airflow in all likelihood. Most issues are related to &quot;airflow configuration type things&quot; that presumably this solution would not fix.<p>I am really just surprised it is not a &quot;no brainier price&quot;. It&#x27;s a tough sell. I am sure it&#x27;s valuable for some people, I just can&#x27;t really justify using it.  I think value to me is like $100&#x2F;mo (as random airflow user on the internet).')
