The bandwidth, linearity, isolation, and jitter requirements all seem quite modest and distant from the edges of what&#x27;s possible along every performance axis. Is it linearity at high power that&#x27;s still a problem? With feedback techniques available, I wouldn&#x27;t think so, but I could certainly be missing something. What&#x27;s the sticking point?<p>Or is this more of a marketing game of adding hiss &#x2F; distortion &#x2F; lowpass &#x2F; other non-idealities that perceptually improve quality and convincing people to use your DAC to do it rather than software? It seems a bit unlikely.<p>If I had to guess, it would be that the narrowly defined task of a DAC has been thoroughly solved and commodified while the high end of the space differentiates itself with industrially relevant features like failover, monitoring, durability, and compatibility. But then why the interest in a DIY DAC? Maybe I&#x27;m reading too much into this, it&#x27;s all curiosity driven, and I shouldn&#x27;t interpret a desire for DIY DACs as a statement that audio DACs aren&#x27;t a solved problem.')
