A Quest V1 with Oculus Link is far from an optimal PC VR setup, but even with that <i>Star Wars: Squadrons</i> is an experience I’ve been waiting for since I first saw <i>A New Hope</i>. It’s hard to convey how cool it is to be sitting in a spaceship cockpit, dodging through asteroids and chasing down TIE fighters with the <i>pew pew pew</i> of four KX9 laser cannons on your wingtips. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vE90KIBlWyk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vE90KIBlWyk</a><p>Would I play it in VR mode for hours on end every night and stop talking to real people? No. But not all my activities need to be social either. I can go for a four hour hike in the woods by myself and no one gives me a hard time for being too isolated. Or maybe they do, but I don’t care because sometimes that’s how I want to spend my time. To each their own.<p>One other feature of the Quest that I should mention - you can double-tap the side of the headset at any time to turn the game world off and immediately switch to &quot;passthrough&quot; mode where you see through the headset&#x27;s tracking cameras. This obviously works best with single player games that can pause themselves until you tap back in, but in those games it makes it no big deal to drop out of the game for a moment to interact with people and things in the real world. A bit weird to talk to you while you have a big headset on your face, sure. But this was added in a software update well after launch, and it&#x27;s way better for staying available to the real world than needing to take the headset on and off.')
