This might be libraries and functionalities nobody uses, parts of memory of processes that is used only at startup, etc.<p>It is always better to page that memory to the disk so that the memory can be actively used to serve demand.<p>While it is nice to have application fail in controlled manner when it allocates memory, the reality datacenter life is that once a process hits memory limit it can no longer be trusted to behave correctly and should be restarted, ideally along with entire instance.<p>It is far better to have something kill the process than have the process try to continue after failed allocation request as most processes are not very well tested with regards to failing at random allocation and continue with no possibility to allocate more memory.')
