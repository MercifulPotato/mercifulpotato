Why do proteins fold the way they do? We can predict the resulting structure which is extremely significant, we have no clue why. While we get the insight of being able to predict some structures we don&#x27;t get the insight of why things are happening the way they are. In some cases like this it <i></i>might<i></i> not matter but in other cases that insight might actually be way more significant than answer the problem to begin with. Of course we can review over the problem with the additional predictions that AI gives us but this can be haphazardous because what if there is specific sequence spins in some certain way that we and thus the AI has never seen and it goes missed. I&#x27;m not a biologist to say this is possible but I known this kind of edge case can come up and what rabbit holes will we go down because we only have the AI implied insight.<p>disclaimer I think the contributions are super useful for science but they do come with worries as does every path of discovery')
