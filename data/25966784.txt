I type at ~100WPM (which is higher than average but im sure some of you are faster ;) ). I&#x27;ve learn new keyboard layouts (split, colemak), and the best way to learn is to not look at keyboard, and try to remember where the keys are (and constantly trying to type as fast possible [using muscle memory instead of memory], which makes even more mistakes).')
