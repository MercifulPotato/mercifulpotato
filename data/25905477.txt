In many cases Trump&#x27;s people went to court saying &quot;We&#x27;re not alleging fraud&quot; and instead tried to get rules changed to throw out votes in blue areas.  Evidence of actual fraud wasn&#x27;t brought to court.  Yes, there was some voter fraud; both Pennsylvania and Georgia found two voters each (yes, 2) who cast someone else&#x27;s ballot (a deceased parent in some cases).  But to flip an election you&#x27;d need thousands of people committing this kind of felony.')
