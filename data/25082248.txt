The web server using the certificate can get an OCSP response for itself (usually once every few minutes) and attach it to all TLS handshakes for that same domain (&quot;OCSP stapling&quot;). That way, clients get an up-to-date OCSP response, but without having to reveal their browsing behavior to the OCSP server.<p>Unfortunately, there is no obvious way to carry over this behavior to application binaries, since we&#x27;re not dealing with a client-server architecture here.')
