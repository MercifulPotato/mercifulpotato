Is it hardcoded in the app and encoded differently? I can&#x27;t see an API being used that references any of the products. When I refresh, it seems the data loads at the exact same time as the app which makes me think the data is hardcoded somewhere.<p>Example: There is a product with the word Dungarees in it, but I can&#x27;t find any reference to it in the Network tab.')
