(Plus a good debugger)<p>I think sadly there are some features (e.g. HM-style type inference) that I want to have but would be an order of magnitude or two slower than this. But still, I&#x27;d love to see a compiler for a modern language use something like this as a goal. Even 10kloc&#x2F;thread*sec would be quite good, now that we have 16+ thread CPUs readily available.')
