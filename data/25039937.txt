There&#x27;s no working driver as far as I can tell.<p>The Print&amp;Scan app is a disaster, largely due to how Android works on Chromebooks.  It can only access the totally separate Android filesystem, which isn&#x27;t visible in the ChromeOS Files app.  If you want to export a scan to the ChromeOS files, you have to use the &quot;Share&quot; button and pick the Files app.  You can&#x27;t use the very prominent &quot;Save&quot; button.')
