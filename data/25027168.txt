For example, even a Python toy app is likely to use a C-extension dependency that hasn’t been packaged in Nix yet, and since C’s ecosystem is a trash fire, you’ll have to figure out how to package it <i>and it’s transitive dependencies</i> in Nix. You have different problems in Go, where you need to provide the hash for the vendor derivation, but the only documented way to get that hash is to run a tool that only works on Linux (and I’m on MacOS). And in whatever case, the documentation for the Nix ecosystem is sorely lacking, so odds are you will have to reverse l-engineer other similar package definitions in nixpkgs to figure out how to make your own package.<p>Note that these issues aren’t insurmountable, but it doesn’t seem like the Nix community cares very much about them (and of course it’s open source software so there is no obligation for them to care, etc but that doesn’t magically make it a good tool for these use cases either).')
