For most systems, the waste water outputs ends up in places which are not useful.<p>The valuable output of the water (H20) is converted to other molecules (eg sugar, cellulose, ect). You could measure this by the change in plant mass from the start of the season to harvest time.<p>Some of the water will also seep into the ground deeper than the tree can reach, and some will be lost as evaporated vapor from the leaves and tissue.<p>This water would is generally gone from the system. This can and cause increased humidity and cloud formation and be blown to different locations.
