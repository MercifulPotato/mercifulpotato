No one comes to the Father except through me&quot;, [John 14:6], and &quot;But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin&quot;. [1 John 1:7]<p>And the result of faith in Jesus is heaven, which is described in this way (a couple of glimpses):\n&quot;Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. 2 I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. [Revelation 21:1-2]\n&quot;They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.&quot;[Revelation 22:5]<p>In islam, one of the five pilars is: &quot;I bear witness that there is no deity but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God.&quot;[2]<p>Salvation in the afterlife: &quot;According to the Quran, the basic criterion for salvation in the afterlife is the belief in the oneness of God (tawḥīd), angels of God, revealed books of God, all messengers of God, as well as repentance to God, and doing good deeds. Though one must do good deeds and believe in God, salvation can only be attained through God&#x27;s judgment.[3]\n&quot;Jannah is described as an eternal dwelling (Q3:136), with its supreme felicity and greatest bliss being God&#x27;s good pleasure (Q9:72)&quot;.[4]<p>The teachings in buddhism, christianity and islam are therefore very different, and points to completely different ways of salvation and afterlife. They all can&#x27;t be true at the same time.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nirvana_(Buddhism)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nirvana_(Buddhism)</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shahada" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shahada</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Jannah#Muslims" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Jannah#Muslims</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Jannah#Quran" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Jannah#Quran</a>')
