If you want the best sensory experience, then a black and white movie from the 30s is probably not to your taste. Other people appreciate the social aspect of media: being able to be participate in an ongoing conversation about some work, actor, or topic.<p>Both of those are valid reasons to like things, but ideally, you want to be able to see the value of a work independent of your own preferences. That doesn&#x27;t mean denying your own preferences. But, part of a successful education is cultivating the ability to appreciate culture of all kinds, and on its own terms.')
