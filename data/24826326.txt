Sounds like he didn&#x27;t want to talk politics but you kept pushing, trying to take some moral high ground. Voting isn&#x27;t an exam, it&#x27;s actually pretty simple even for swing voters. Believe it or not, there is no right or wrong answer or else we would not have a vote. You essentially vote on a personal philosophy that is developed over your live, or primarily in your earlier years, and by studying history, consuming art like books, movies and music, and meeting people and discussing these ideas. It&#x27;s something that happens in the background. Keeping up with what the candidates, parties and news outlets are saying isn&#x27;t nearly as relevant.')
