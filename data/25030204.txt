He has a very long rant on one of these or another series talking about how there’s no benefit to garbage collection, under any circumstances, in any way, ever. It’s a pretty mind boggling opinion frankly.<p>I spent years as a C++ programmer. Managing memory gives you power and control, at the cost of programmer time. In the same rant, he argued that the way that he manages memory imposes <i>no extra overhead at all to the programmer</i> as well.<p>This is a clear sign that he’s out of touch with reality. The point of garbage collection is to only focus on an algorithm directly, as if you were calculating it with math on paper. Do you allocate memory locations when introducing variables in a math equation? No - because reasoning about the variables abstractly takes much less effort than worrying about how to have a machine actually compute your algorithm. I’m not talking about the performance trade offs of garbage collectors at all. Of course there’s a performance hit, but it’s not for no reason. It’s for a very huge reason which is to allow a programmer to think about less <i>with every single line of code that they write.</i> That’s a very big value proposition.<p>This isn’t just a pet peeve over one rant. I’ve watched hours of his content. I think it’s much more toxic than it is helpful. Games are dominated by rendering complexity. If you are not building a video game, you generally don’t need 3D graphics and physical modeling. To think that solutions for that complexity say anything about software in the large is again, hugely out of touch.')
