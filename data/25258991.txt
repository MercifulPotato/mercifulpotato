I can&#x27;t be mad that he wants his money either.<p>However comedy has one rule - you can say anything you want <i>as long as it&#x27;s funny</i>. You can literally spout <i>anything</i>, just make sure the audience is laughing while you&#x27;re doing it.<p>I just spent 18 minutes watching a therapy session with minimal jokes. I would have thought someone as clever as Chapelle would have weaved a better narrative (although he is a talented storyteller).<p>I hope he gets what he&#x27;s looking for, I really do.<p>But I&#x27;m also annoyed with the recent trend of comedians just...complaining. Complaining constantly, with slightly more anger than humor. Bill Burr dedicated 20 mins of his recent standup to how &quot;sensitive&quot; the modern generation is. Seinfeld&#x27;s entire &quot;Comedians in Cars&quot; has numerous bits about him just complaining without being funny while doing it. Sebastian Maniscalco&#x27;s earlier specieals were relatable humor, and now his recent bits are just slightly angrier versions of &quot;can you believe people these days&quot;?<p>And now I just watched what seemed like a semi coherent rant that wouldn&#x27;t end.')
