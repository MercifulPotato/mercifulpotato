If I write a letter <i>to</i> a bank, it&#x27;s certainly theirs to turn over.  But if I put a letter to <i>someone else</i> in my safe deposit box at the bank, they can&#x27;t turn that over without a specific warrant and probable cause.<p>Google searches are tricky for sure.  I&#x27;m asking Google to look something up for me.  What I looked up is their record.<p>But for example, video rentals are specifically protected as are library checkout records.  Even though I&#x27;ve asked those places to do something for me, they can&#x27;t reveal that.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s tricky, but at the end of the day it should probably count as my personal property.')
