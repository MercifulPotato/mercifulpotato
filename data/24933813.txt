That sort of thing results in climate deniers, anti-vaxers, anti-maskers, and a whole slew of conspiracy theories.<p>If you want people to take climate change seriously, you need to publish conservative numbers and ring the bell when things end up worse than you predicted. Include a word of caution that things could be worse when you publish the conservative numbers, but don&#x27;t start out with the worst-case scenario if you want to be taken seriously in the future.<p>Of course you can be <i>too</i> conservative with your predictions, but I don&#x27;t see a lot of that except as a knee-jerk reaction to the overly-alarmist predictions.')
