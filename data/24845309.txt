These would not only not be conscious human beings in any sense, they wouldn&#x27;t even be the shells of possible people stolen from any family.<p>In any case, taking ethical debates about organ growth to extremes such as these strikes me as a form of moral masturbation. We&#x27;re barely at the point where we can even seriously consider developing single simple regrown organs, let alone worrying about &quot;The Island&quot; style dilemmas. And if we do indeed start having the capacity to commercially create genetically regrown individual body parts as stand-alone transplant treatments, the immediate human-life value of their existence would far outweigh any ambiguous worries about somehow moving to full body clones at some maybe point in the future.')
