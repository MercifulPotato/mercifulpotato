If you wait to ship till you&#x27;re happy w the code, you probably waited too long. Successful businesses are often built on surprisingly shoddy software, and time to market matters. OTOH, only ever running in naive startup mode -- &quot;ship it yesterday,  add features nownownow, any means necessary, shortcuts be praised&quot; -- is a recipe for disaster. Given your strong feelings on the matter, maybe you could find a way to help surface the costs and help your org to start fixing them. Because some amount of it is inevitable, and things within a given company only get better when someone cares enough to do something about it. If it works, you&#x27;re a hero and things improve. If not, you can still jump ship, but with a much better narrative: not &quot;I got tired of the intolerable levels of tech debt&quot;, but &quot;I did (X) in an effort to address [same], but ultimately couldn&#x27;t overcome the institutionalized patterns that led to it, so I&#x27;m looking to work for a company that cares about software quality&quot;.')
