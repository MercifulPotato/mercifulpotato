So, for example, Dylan will be selling his songs off to people who want you to listen to them as much as possible. Nobody spends 9 figures on a song&#x27;s rights without expecting to make 10 figures on it.<p>The Beatles followed the Disney&#x2F;Nintendo school of copyright management, where you just hold onto something valuable for the fear that actually making money off the thing you own will make it worth less in the future. This is what gives you shit like the &quot;Disney Vault&quot; where you periodically take old works off the market entirely for the sake of artificial scarcity. In this particular case, The Beatles were a massive hole in pretty much every digital music store&#x27;s back catalog, so much so that them finally selling digital copies of their songs was considered actual tech news.<p>Whether or not a work actually thrives once it&#x27;s been escheated to the public domain is really complicated. You see, the act of reusing something in the public domain also grants you copyright over anything you added to the work. Disney&#x27;s reuse of public domain stories not only saved them money, but it also took things <i>out</i> of the public domain, in a sense. Yes, all of the old Hans Christen Andersen stories are very much open to reuse, but only if you&#x27;re careful not to use the bits Disney added into their adaptations - and there are a lot of them. So if your goal is to just keep the work accessible and relevant, something akin to a Creative Commons ShareAlike license might be more appropriate than a public domain dedication.')
