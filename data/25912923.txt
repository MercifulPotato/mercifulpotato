Germany chose to reduce restrictions at that time. That&#x27;s reasonable, right? \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.google.com&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;map?hl=en-IE&amp;mid=%2Fm%2F0345h&amp;gl=IE&amp;ceid=IE%3Aen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.google.com&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;map?hl=en-IE&amp;mid=%2Fm%2F0345...</a><p>So New Zealand was even more successful. By July, they got things well and truly under control:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.google.com&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;map?hl=en-IE&amp;mid=%2Fm%2F0ctw_b&amp;gl=IE&amp;ceid=IE%3Aen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.google.com&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;map?hl=en-IE&amp;mid=%2Fm%2F0ctw...</a><p>Or take France:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.google.com&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;map?hl=en-IE&amp;mid=%2Fm%2F0f8l9c&amp;gl=IE&amp;ceid=IE%3Aen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.google.com&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;map?hl=en-IE&amp;mid=%2Fm%2F0f8l...</a><p>All of these are having a bit more trouble with the second wave, Clearly something has changed about the nature of Covid. But you can see them weathering the first wave, and dealing with the second wave. You see how the number of cases drops off to near 0 during summer?<p>---<p>This is the USA:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.google.com&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;map?hl=en-IE&amp;gl=IE&amp;ceid=IE%3Aen&amp;mid=%2Fm%2F09c7w0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.google.com&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;map?hl=en-IE&amp;gl=IE&amp;ceid=IE%3...</a><p>Take care: that Y axis is much larger than the other examples above.<p>On June 1 2020 there were still 22000 measured new cases on that day alone. Sure that&#x27;s a slight drop from the 34000 cases on April 9. But that&#x27;s not really safe to loosen restrictions, now is it?<p>(Now we do know that that&#x27;s an aggregate and some individual states have done better. You can drill down to get that information.)')
