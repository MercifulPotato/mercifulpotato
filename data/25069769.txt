He was all over expert systems in the late 80’s.  I can distinctly remember him excitedly explaining them to me and I just couldn’t fathom what was interesting about it at all.  Then in the early 90’s he started pivoting to neural networks.<p>Then he got killed at work.<p>I didn’t hear about neural networks again for close to 20 years, but I can attest at least someone was stoked about them back then.')
