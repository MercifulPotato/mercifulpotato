The fund has no &quot;major&quot; wins.<p>Box, Slack, Yammer, Palantir. I guess I don&#x27;t know what the definition of &quot;major&quot; is, but those seem decent. The VC fund did eventually &quot;burn down&quot;, but not because of bad investments but because he had some personal issues.<p>I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion about him as a person. I just don&#x27;t understand why a criticism was that he was a bad VC. It seems like he probably came out OK there.')
