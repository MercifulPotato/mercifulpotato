As an old film-maker, he documented his own personal journey, and ended up choosing to try Seyfrieds approach (press-push). His disease was an aggressive one and he was given no hope of recovery by his doctors. He is now the first case documented to recover fully from this type of cancer. In his film he travels to talk to Seyfried to both thank him for his research and interview him for his film.<p>I think Seyfried&#x27;s research eventually will change our approach to understanding and treating cancer, but it is an uphill battle. His research is good and his scientific approach and results are hard to write off as &quot;alternative medicine&quot; â€” but vested interests in the regular paradigm and treatments makes change a slow process.')
