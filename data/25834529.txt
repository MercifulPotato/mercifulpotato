Item(by='gpm', descendants=None, kids=[25835141], score=None, time=1611071070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834424, text='&gt; Tellingly, such redefinitions are generally broader than the accepted OSI definition, so as to include whatever product someone is trying to push.<p>I disagree. In fact I&#x27;ll present the counter example of &quot;myself&quot;. I don&#x27;t agree with the OSIs definition of open source, I think it run contrary to the plain meaning of the term, and is contrary to pre-OSI use of the term. I&#x27;ve argued that numerous times on this forum (and I&#x27;m going to avoid repeating these arguments in depth here, just google &quot;gpm Open Source site:news.ycombinator.com&quot;&#x2F;&quot;gpm Open Source site:lobste.rs&quot; and you will be able to find the arguments).<p>I have never pushed a product claiming to be open source that does not meet the OSIs definition, nor do I anticipate I ever will, since that seems to be a great way to make discussions about the product devolve into arguments about licensing, which is terrible advertising.<p>The fact that these arguments usually only come up when there is a reason to argue, i.e. someone has used the term in a way outside of the OSIs definition, does not mean that people only think the right definition of the term is something else when it&#x27;s for their own benefit.')
