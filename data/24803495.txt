In fact, arguably the most egregious aspect of the company was their work in countries other than the US and UK. In an undercover sting, Channel 4 filmed CA CEO Alexander Nix boasting of the firmâ€™s willingness to engage in unethical tactics including honeypots, bribes, blackmail and entrapment to swing an election.<p>To your point, the story largely was fake news because they failed to achieve their objective as election manipulators, not because they were wrapped up in some conspiracy theory that accused them of misbehavior.  They were caught on camera going around to powerful people and telling them that they could manipulate elections and that absolutely cannot be overlooked.<p>There&#x27;s an immensely wealthy market for this kind of service, and just because one player overhyped themselves and got caught up in a scandal that largely turned out to be nothing doesn&#x27;t mean that someone else won&#x27;t try again.')
