Like anything, balance is the key.  I am beginning to realize that it’s really important to plan for balance and pushing myself at the same time.  If I plan to have a decent baseline of time for basic activities (this is different for everyone) then I can push hard on some things over short periods of time and not burn out.  I know that incremental achievement will still boost my confidence and life satisfaction. I used to just push until I burned out: it’s not a good approach.')
