You can wind up running from every social hiccup.  (Did you flee the US for the BLM protests?  But maybe there were days when it was wiser to not go downtown.)  You have to correctly judge the level of the problem, and not run away from too many of the small ones, and not miss any of the big ones.  It&#x27;s a tough balance.  If you can pull it off, though, it works far better than a bunker.')
