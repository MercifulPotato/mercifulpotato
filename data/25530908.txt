If a company&#x27;s own email servers can&#x27;t tell the difference between valid internal mail and external phishing, that&#x27;s the company&#x27;s problem, not the employees. If the company&#x27;s email is hacked so that a hacker can send valid emails from a legitimate internal email address, that&#x27;s the company&#x27;s problem, not the employees. Nothing of value was learned by this test, besides the disdain GoDaddy has for their own employees.<p>If I put myself on the other side, I&#x27;d stop producing gross sexist ads, stop supporting overreaching internet legislation, and stop treating my employees like garbage.')
