Which one gets to use the FPGA pieces, or are they re-written every time, on every context switch? ;)<p>Re-writing them on every context switch sounds extremely unlikely, so it&#x27;d be more some kind of resource locking thing instead.  Which could mean that FPGA-using applications at least start out being fairly niche, as only one could run &quot;per core&quot; or something.<p>Maybe dedicated cores per application instead or something?')
