You&#x27;ve gotta make sure that what you buy gives you an accurate picture of what it is like to play a quality instrument because a crappy instrument is not fun.<p>For example I bought a $200 keyboard once because I thought it would lighten my load as a gigging pianist. Nice and light, 88 keys, built in speaker. Much better than lugging around my thousands of dollars of pro gear. But when I got it, it didn&#x27;t have weighted keys, ok not fun but I can deal with that, but then it didn&#x27;t have velocity sensitivity... Every note was just on&#x2F;off. This was a deal breaker, it is strait up not fun to play a piano like that. I mean it&#x27;s in the name Piano&#x2F;Forte the instrument that can play loud and soft.')
