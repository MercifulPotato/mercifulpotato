Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604384376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976175, text='&gt; Taleb insists that Clinton never should’ve received a probability of winning of 90%. Even if polls were heavily in favor of Clinton at the time, he says Silver should’ve taken into account the uncertainty that polls would change over the next few months leading up to the election, or the possibility of major news breaking.<p>Silver&#x27;s model fairly explicitly does address both the likely direction and the uncertainty in future poll movements, based on historical evidence. The 2016 model results <i>were</i> more volatile than you&#x27;d like to see, but it&#x27;s at least plausible that&#x27;s because 2016 was an unusual cycle out in the statistical tail in behavior. The 2020 forecast has behaved in a more conventional manner with mild noisy ups and downs early on, and then a smooth progression of greater certainty, the 2012 projection was similar. While this obviously is way to few to generalize from (but better than try to assess from the behavior of 2016 alone), it&#x27;s consistent with the idea that the model usually behaves in the way you&#x27;d expect a forecasting model to behave, and 2016 was just a collision of unlikely events.')
