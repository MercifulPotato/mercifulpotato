However I have a few nitpicks:<p>1. 10 classes is way too small to make meaningful estimates as to how well a model  will do on a &quot;proper&quot; image datatset such as COCO or ImageNet. Even a vastly more complicated dataset like CIFAR-10 does not hold up.<p>2. I feel like CIFAR-100 is widely used as the dataset that you envision MNIST-1D to be. Personally I found that some training methods will work very well on CIFAR-100 but not that well on ImageNet so TinyImageNet is now my go-to &quot;verify new ideas dataset&quot;')
