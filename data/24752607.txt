That has been IME one of the major issues with distributing binary packages of Python apps on Linux, because code built using glibc tends to use recent versions of common symbols, so in practice you can&#x27;t run them on a system with a glibc older than the build system&#x27;s glibc, meaning you have to build on some ancient Linux where everything is a pain.<p>Edit: Sounds like it:<p>&gt; PyOxidizer uses custom Python distributions that are built in such a way that they are highly portable across machines.')
