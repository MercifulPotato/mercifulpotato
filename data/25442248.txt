It quite deliberately says <i>should not</i>, not <i>must not</i>. If anyone is ignoring the spec here, it&#x27;s you, not me. <i>Should not</i> is sound advice; it&#x27;s telling you what you&#x27;re supposed to do <i>when you don&#x27;t have a reason to behave differently</i>. You know, like how you &quot;should not&quot; leave the lights on when you leave your room. Or—more pertinently here—how you &quot;should not&quot; assume everyone is a liar. But when you <i>actively see evidence</i> that deviates from the norm, you are given the power—and arguably the responsibility—to exercise your discretion here to adapt to the situation. If the spec wanted blind obedience, it would say &quot;must not&quot; like it did in 60 other places, but it quite obviously and intentionally decided that would be unwise, and this scenario seems like a pretty clear illustration of that.')
