What I&#x27;ve found on arXiv reads like standard fare for its genre. Hotelling famously joined an early seminar on linear programming with Dantzig only to interject &quot;... but the world is nonlinear!&quot; That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m out to do -- not with this particular researcher, nor with its proxies on twitter and HN.<p>The scenario I&#x27;m looking at is one where the polarities are not left versus right or woke versus straight, but Humanities versus STEM. If people are to reject her kind of work -- and I&#x27;ll be glad if they do, even if I&#x27;m not really willing to press them in that rejection with a proper &quot;critique&quot; -- then they could walk away burned by theory and postmodernism and all such crap. I&#x27;m proposing an entirely different path, or a space of different paths even.')
