My main point remains &quot;you were silent while 100&#x27;s of millions in damage was done and now you&#x27;re mad about 6 hours of less violent protests and a single building being damaged?&quot;<p>&gt; reasons aren&#x27;t equal<p>Reasons aren&#x27;t equal... but there is plenty of reason to pick apart the hypocrisy WAY beyond DC vs Portland riots. I can point out many &quot;police brutality&quot; stories that aren&#x27;t really when facts come out. (IE: &quot;hands up, don&#x27;t shoot&quot;). I can do the same to most of the &#x27;non contradictory&#x27; positions.<p>It&#x27;s important to stand up for what you believe in peacefully... it&#x27;s also important to try and not be a hypocrite while doing so.<p>I stand against the hypocrisy in the other positions you mentioned as well even if not mentioned in detail. The hypocrisy destroys the message.')
