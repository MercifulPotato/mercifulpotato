The part where the author performs backtesting to settle on an adequate value for the threshold? In the case I don&#x27;t really see a problem, since the author seems to be looking at historical data to come up with a value for a parameter that will be used to determine the model that acts on future data.<p>I agree with your comment in general that using test data in your training set is a clear example of an error that will lead to overfitting and a model that generalizes poorly, but am having a hard time seeing where the author commits this mistake.')
