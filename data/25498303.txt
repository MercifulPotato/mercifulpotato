We&#x27;re building it with community collaboration in mind. It doesn&#x27;t cover all the bases you mention, but we do:\n* data and model storage\n* experiment tracking\n* pipeline management\n* access control\n* data, model, code, pipeline versioning<p>We&#x27;re also strictly based on Git and other Open Source formats and tools so connecting with other tools you use like Colab for IDEs or Jenkins&#x2F;Kubeflow for training is super  straightforward (we have examples for some)')
