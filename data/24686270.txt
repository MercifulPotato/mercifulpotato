Thousands upon thousands of files.<p>- Random comments or annotations in numeric fields (preventing graphing the data).<p>We don&#x27;t all need to be data scientists, or machine learning wizards, or quantum computing gods.<p>But <i>come on</i>. This is the most basic, data entry clerk level Excel 101 stuff. Trivial, basic stuff.<p>Put rows in rows.<p>Don&#x27;t mix random notes into columns you might want to sum or graph.<p>Don&#x27;t mix units.<p>Have headers.<p>Use a sane date format.<p>That is all.<p>&lt;&#x2F;rant&gt;')
