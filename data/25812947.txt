While on the go, I can pick dongles for what I need at the time. Most of the time it’s either nothing or a memory card reader.<p>The need for memory card reader becomes increasingly rare, as devices have AirDrop, cameras have Wi-Fi, and for larger files like CinemaDNG footage I’d have to use a portable SSD anyway which connects over USB-C.<p>Besides, memory card dongle dies and I buy a replacement for $20; built-in card reader dies and part of my laptop is dead weight until I send the whole thing in for service.<p>I can’t come up with anything I can imagine being useful as far as extra I&#x2F;O is concerned, considering how blazing fast TB 2 and USB 4 already are; perhaps there are some novel connectivity options though.')
