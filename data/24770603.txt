Attacker might be root&#x2F;admin on this machine and gaining access to more creds allows the adversary to move to other machines.<p>So in a sense we know its possible but unless someone abuses these things to demonstrate it, organizations won&#x27;t care or be able to detect compromises and lateral movement.
