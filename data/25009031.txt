If the magnitude is small enough the action is negligible, regardless of direction. If the article’s figures are accurate, you can optimise away 100% of emissions from the internet - that’s the whole thing - and it would represent a reduction of 0.6% of global emissions. That just makes any individual action inside that space negligible.')
