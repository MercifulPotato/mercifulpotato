California has the strongest non-compete laws in the nation, was this something that influenced your decision?<p>2. California has IP laws which are to the effect that &quot;what you create in your own time with your own resources cannot be used by your employer&quot; (disclaimer IANAL). This has a grey area for large FAANG type employers that can enter any domain, but Bay-Area has lots of companies doing amazing things. So it opens up opportunities to start new companies in new frontiers.<p>The above two are still major factors that are preventing me from leaving California at least despite the high taxes, rents etc...<p>Bay-Area is still the best place w.r.t to getting investment and finding interesting tech-companies.<p>I&#x27;m curious what thoughts others have here.')
