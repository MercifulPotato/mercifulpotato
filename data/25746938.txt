I&#x27;m not seeing it.<p>What I do see is mass hysteria surrounding his statements.<p>&quot;I condemn in the strongest possible terms...&quot;<p>But he didn&#x27;t call them terrorists (in a quote I could find) in an off the cuff statement, so you&#x27;re entitled to telepathically divine another meaning from the statement?<p>Take another angle. When Trump said, &quot;There will be a peaceful transition to a new administration&quot;, some of his supporters imagined this meant he isn&#x27;t leaving the Whitehouse.<p>For myself, I have no telepathic abilities. Nor do I believe that those who are passionate about their love or hate for the man have telepathic abilities.<p>What I observe is mass hysteria. From the left, this is buoyed by media spin. On the right, you have the Q types. Again this is buoyed by media dishonesty. If media institutions were less misleading, perhaps there would be more trust in establishment sources. Instead there is a vacuum where deranged conspiracies can mix in among perspectives the media would rather not cover.')
