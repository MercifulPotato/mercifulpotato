I discovered a few things that work for me (YMMV, of course):<p>* Length of flight helps.  I NEVER could sleep on international flights to Europe when I lived in NYC, because those flights were ~6-7 hours, which is, I think, the worst possible length for sleeping.  By the time dinner service is done and the lights are out, there&#x27;s about 3-4 hours of solid quiet time before they start prepping for breakfast&#x2F;coffee service.  Not enough.  When I moved to SF, the 10-12 hour flights to Europe turned out to be the perfect length.<p>* Time of flight helps.  The best possible flight for sleeping for me are the 7pm departures out of SFO that land in Europe 10-12 hours later.  That&#x27;s basically normal sleep time for me, so my body is actually in sync with the flight.<p>* Supplements help.  The magic combo for me is 3mg of melatonin + 1 glass of red wine :)')
