It had achieved its goals: now Ukraine is the poorest state in Europe, on par with African countries. Biden&#x27;s son company Burisma had stolen trillions from Ukraine. All the industry is destroyed. Only Motor Sich still barely survives, but obviously not for long. Besides it was already sold to China, but now there&#x27;s some dirty scandal about it.<p>Also, my initial point wasn&#x27;t about Ukraine which served it part already - there&#x27;s almost nothing left to plunder.<p>I wanted to leave a prediction that in 2021-2022 there will be a new war because USA desperately needs it. For many reasons, mostly economical. I&#x27;ve also named next most probable targets.<p>Just to say &quot;I said so&quot; when it&#x27;ll happen and point to the original comment.')
