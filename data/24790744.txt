The obvious example is growing a giant userbase that will then stick with your product over time. Or it could be building up a bunch of infrastructure to reach a neccesary economy of scale. Hell, it could just be straight up paying lobbyists to buy politicians and do regulatory capture.<p>The implication from all of this, then, is that these businesses are directly aiming for and&#x2F;or creating inefficient markets. In an efficient market, it&#x27;s easy for participants to enter and exit, startup costs are low, and consumers can easily switch products. That means there should be nothing a losing company can buy today that would <i>prevent</i> a future competitor from eating their lunch a few years from now.<p>The fact that the market rewards losing company shows that there <i>are</i> things companies can buy now that stifle competition and reduce market efficiency in the future. These companies are spending money today to produce a worse market for consumers a few years from now.<p>That doesn&#x27;t sound like something we should be thrilled about.')
