This decision effectively held both mining rig efficiency and grid CO2 intensities constant for the next 100 yr... This unprecedented choice ignores the dynamic nature of mining rig and power grid technologies and violates the widely followed practice of accounting for technological change in forward-looking energy technology scenarios...<p>&gt; Fifth, in constructing their scenarios, Mora et al. committed key errors when analysing adoption rates within their 40-technology comparison pool...<p>[1] &#x27;Implausible projections overestimate near-term Bitcoin CO2 emissions&#x27;, available at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41558-019-0535-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41558-019-0535-4</a>')
