The characters have all just started high school, but during your first year in Norway, you and your classmates will vary in age from 15-16-17, and high school lasts three years, not four.<p>If you use &quot;freshmen&quot; to describe them, you get the &quot;new at school&quot; aspect, but viewers will get the completely wrong idea about their age. If you use &quot;juniors&quot;, you get the age aspect right, but their role and social standing at school would be completely off.<p>So in a case like that, domesticating the translation simply doesn&#x27;t work, you&#x27;d get super confused as a viewer if you use American high school terms. So you <i>have to</i> foreignize it, you have to call them something else, and you have to make up new terms when translating the various Norwegian derogatory terms for first-year students that exist.')
