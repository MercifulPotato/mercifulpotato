Imagine an internet where there are two types of IPv4 addresses assigned. The server addresses belong to cloud data providers  and are provided as elastic IPs and are used to host public websites - any kind of website that you’re likely to type into an URL bar. Client addresses are owned by ISPs and are the routable NAT addresses with thousands of customers sharing them. A few client addresses are provided to ISP customers that are willing to pay a monthly fee.<p>It’s ugly but it’s kind of the sort of system that everyone is incentivized to move to. Which kind of makes me sad.')
