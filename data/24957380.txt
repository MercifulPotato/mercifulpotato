That means if anything changes, the whole compressed binary blob changes.<p>Other than compression and such encodings, PDF files are actually text files, with a drawing model largely based on PostScript but without the programming. If you want to diff them, use `mutool clean -d -a` to first turn them into pure ASCII text.<p>That said, since it&#x27;s a &quot;baked&quot; layout format, if one word pushes the rest of the text forward, everything after that will show up with changed coordinates. It&#x27;s closer to a vector image format like SVG than a markup format like HTML or ODF.<p>There are also things like font subsetting, where removing a word that was the only use of a character, or adding a word that uses a new character, might change the font data to add&#x2F;remove those characters.')
