Item(by='oftenwrong', descendants=None, kids=[24652579], score=None, time=1601562947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24650873, text='For &quot;normal&quot; people like my mother, it is worse. She ended up in a situation recently where something worked with one cable, but not with a different cable. She thought the cable must be broken. I explained the issue to her, and she understands now, but she still has a hard time remembering which cables and adapters to use for the various purposes. She can&#x27;t just keep them in a drawer all together. She also has trouble telling USB C from USB micro and mini A since they are all somewhat similar in appearance. She still has many non-C USB devices.<p>It was easy for her to set up her computer back when we had color-coded and large, distinctively-shaped ports. For example: PS&#x2F;2 for keyboard and mouse (violet and green), VGA for monitor (blue), 3.5mm audio for speakers and microphone (green and pink), C13&#x2F;14 for power. Obviously, usability is way better these days; she can use her laptop without plugging in anything, and mostly things Just Work. However, I think these basic child&#x27;s-toy-like usability cues were valuable, and maybe we need something similar to keep USB C easily-understandable.<p>One day I hope that it will all be sorted out. Every USB cable and adapter will have full support. You can plug any USB C into any USB C and it will work like magic.')
