You contradict yourself in talking about how hell bent megacorps are in making money, and then talk about them spending 100x your salary on lawyers to go after you.<p>I know of people who suffered after they left, and a cursory internet search will turn up many more stories. There is no contradiction in what I said, if spending 100 units on a legal battle for a single employee would save them &gt;100 units on the next employee (or as a consequence of an unfavorable legal outcome), then it would be worth the cost.<p>&gt;This is definitely true, but as the GP said, it&#x27;s quite simple to leave if you this is the concern. While there, I interviewed for an internal position that involved work for China that sounded to me like part of their mass surveillance program. I don&#x27;t really know if that was the case, but it was trivial for me to decline their offer.<p>I spoke to this in the article. You were generating revenues which financed the project even if you didn&#x27;t directly work on it. They only spent $X on your salary and benefits because they expected it to create a return of &gt;$X, which they can invest into Chinese mass surveillance with impunity. You were complicit.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this to insult you or to raise a character judgement on you, but to illustrate that your &quot;ethical mental arithmetic&quot;, for lack of a better term, doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t expect you to change your mind in the face of this argument, either.<p>&gt;1. Pay less (and I don&#x27;t get FAANG salaries - perhaps 60% or less)<p>Yes, they do. But so long as we&#x27;re talking about ethics, I am disgusted by any argument that it&#x27;s justified by your payroll.<p>&gt;2. Work you as much if not more (my life in megacorp had good work&#x2F;life balance - and when it didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d simply do an internal transfer).<p>There&#x27;s little evidence to support this (that non-megacorps make you work more).<p>&gt;3. Are less stable\n&gt;\n&gt;4. Are more at the mercy of market forces, often making it equally unlikely you&#x27;ll get to do cool work. The need to pay the bills is greater.<p>I set the standard in this article at billion and trillion dollar companies. You do not need a billion dollars to have a stable, sustainable company.')
