And -O3 generates the same assembly as -O3 -fstrict-aliasing (which is not as good as __restrict__).<p>I wish there was a C&#x2F;C++ compiler flag for treating all pointers as __restrict__. However I guess that C&#x2F;C++ standard libraries wouldn&#x27;t work with this compiler option (and therefore this compiler option wouldn&#x27;t be useful in practice).')
