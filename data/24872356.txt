Making such guesses correctly is what distinguishes a good engineer from a bad one. Nobody ever spells out the current requirements to any level of detail even; so forget about knowing about future ones. You just have to know, recognize, and adapt to that constantly.<p>A lot of over engineering is due to getting this completely wrong: you prepare for something that never happens, at great cost and while underestimating the difficulty level. So you end up wasting endless amounts of time on stuff that has no business value.<p>On the other hand, a lot of under-engineering is due to not having a clue about what is obviously coming next and getting caught by surprise by completely obvious requirements.')
