Once or twice a week someone will start an Among Us session, with a parallel Google Meet video call. People will play Among Us, and then discuss who the Imposter is in the video call. Once the game resumes, people mute their mics and disable video.<p>It&#x27;s been a neat way to spend some social time with my new colleagues. Being on non-work calls has helped me get a sense of who my new colleagues are and I feel it&#x27;s helped me integrate in to the team.')
