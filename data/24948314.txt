Item(by='dane-pgp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604107035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947927, text='&gt; One of the reasons that the electricity that Hinkley will one day produce is so expensive (£92.50 per megawatt hour, compared with gas and wind at about £40) is that the constructors were required to shoulder the risk of any cost overruns themselves. EDF estimates that the cost of electricity produced at Sizewell will be somewhere between £40 and £60.<p>So even the company with a financial incentive to under-estimate the cost is saying that the electricity it produces will be <i>at best</i> as expensive as wind energy <i>already</i> is.<p>Of course nuclear power plants can still generate electricity on a windless day, but if they&#x27;re only used on such days, then the cost per Joule is even worse.<p>Perhaps the (estimated) £20 billion could be spent on energy storage projects like Vehicle-to-Grid distribution or hydrogen generation, which should be even more competitive 10 years from now when this power plant is supposed to start operating.')
