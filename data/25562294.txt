That&#x27;s why the reverse engineering work is documented (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stpihkal.docs.buttplug.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stpihkal.docs.buttplug.io</a>, but also check the github repo because I am years behind on updates based on issues now), so if people want to pick up protocols and try their own thing, they absolutely can. I want to learn from other people approaches to this too.<p>In fact, that&#x27;s exactly what xtoys has done:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xtoys.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xtoys.app</a><p>They&#x27;re just using the reversed protocols my project documented, while building outside of my admittedly complicated library interface. It&#x27;s been a great project to watch grow, because while I&#x27;m kinda hyperfocused on platform and hardware support, they&#x27;re going breadth-first with user focused features on a WebRTC platform.')
