There&#x27;s a rule &quot;never point a weapon at something you do not intend to destroy.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s horrible.  And should be grounds for firing the cop.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how many on HN have shot a gun.  But if you&#x27;ve got a qualified instructor, before you are even allowed to TOUCH the gun, you need to memorize the 4 basic rules of gun safety.<p>1. Every gun is always loaded.<p>2. Never point a gun at anything you&#x27;re not willing to destroy.<p>3. Keep your finger off the trigger until you&#x27;re ready to fire.<p>4. Be sure of your target and what&#x27;s behind it.<p>The second cop failed the last 3 rules.  Was he willing to destroy the children?  Was he ready to shoot when he put his finger on the trigger?  Was he sure of his target and what&#x27;s behind it?<p>Given that the answer is no, he shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to handle that gun.  He&#x27;s a danger to the public, and a liability to the police department.')
