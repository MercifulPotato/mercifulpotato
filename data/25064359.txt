For even better utilization, you can have gevent and process based workers depending if the task is resource or I&#x2F;O heavy.<p>In years I have never seen Celery workers hang, we process millions of tasks (hundreds of task types) every day. Since the post is very old, I&#x27;m sure that they had to deal with a few nasty bugs back then.<p>However, Celery does have real scalability issues: If you run over 1000 worker nodes Celery gossip alone will be well over 1000 messages per second. Having 1000s of gossip queues isn&#x27;t ideal either given that RabbitMQ is not easily scalable. You might end up with multiple clusters which can be a bit of a pain in a single codebase.\nI&#x27;m not sure if running Celery on SQS solves some of these issues.')
