By this they disregard all the beauty the human race often exhibits, something which is obvious to us, the human readers.<p>The aliens seem to be light-years ahead of us in technology, yet these beings of supposedly supreme intelligence, still make the same mistake of not being able to identify and counter their own biases. Although because they&#x27;re able to travel quicker in space they probably do feel intellectually superior to us.<p>The point that the writer wants to make is that this bias is not limited to the visiting aliens. Humans do this all the time (with animals, foreigners, poor people, children) but we&#x27;re rarely challenged in this assumption.')
