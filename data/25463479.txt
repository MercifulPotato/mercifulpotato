AWS had a NoSQL database, but replicated mongodb.<p>Anyway, I think that the risk doesn&#x27;t occur until and unless supertokens hits a home run. I mean, if you&#x27;re big enough for a hypercloud provider to copy, that means you&#x27;ve been pretty darn successful in distribution of your product.<p>But the risk is there.<p>As for the relicensing, I have sympathy for both viewpoints.
