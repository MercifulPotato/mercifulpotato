Windows has relatively aggressive file locking, but if you try to delete a file that&#x27;s open, it just errors out, it doesn&#x27;t tell you what&#x27;s using the file and give you the option to (force) quit it.<p>See also: networking, disk management, permissions, sound, preferences, ipc, etc. There are a hundred of these &quot;just needs a bit of work&quot; UI verticals, but designers keep trying to solve these problems with themes and functionality subsets, which are doomed to fail because the underlying issue is a lack of expressiveness in the existing UI, not an excess of it. Meanwhile, systems people live with &quot;just use CLI &#x2F; sysinternals &#x2F; wireshark &#x2F; nmap&quot; like it isn&#x27;t an issue that bog-standard tasks still require arcane tools in 2020 (arcane by the standards of typical users).')
