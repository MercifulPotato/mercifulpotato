I have the feeling that in between bursts things are still computing in the background so it looks like you&#x27;re not doing anything but the brain is still churning. This type of bursty productivity is very hard to account for in a corporate environment where one&#x27;s productivity should be accounted for on a daily basis and laid down in cookie cutter time slots. I often wonder whether I have ADHD since I can hyperfocus when Im in a productive burst. Unfortunately&#x2F;fortunately I don&#x27;t tick other boxes so I&#x27;m in a limbo with the diagnosis')
