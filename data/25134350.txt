Within any tribe there are wide spectrums of personality types, biases, needs, motivations, group dynamics, leadership styles, genetic variations etc etc etc and when all that gets added up you have this massive ever changing hurricane like structure. It props up an Obama on one day and dumps a Hillary on another, irrespective of what their tribes do.<p>Nothing is obvious.<p>Yet.<p>We still await the arrival of a Faraday or a Maxwell in those fields.')
