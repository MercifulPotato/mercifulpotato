Easily connects, looks nice and sounds nice.  Every now and then they would throw some audiphileish numbers in the product description(like it updates 3 gazillion times per second) but it&#x27;s never the central argument.<p>Apple products are always about the experience and they wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to put higher end specs when matter and lower end specs when it doesn&#x27;t and make nerds uncomfortable or even angry because it would miss-match their convention of GB per USD or Herz per Euro.  This is the way it always was, most famously with iPhone where Apple doesn&#x27;t disclose RAM or CPU frequency or battery capacity and all-knowing reviewers will angrily tell you that Apple sells 1000$ phone with 4GB of RAM and how ridiculous is this compared to, say Samsung where you get 12GB RAM for the same price.')
