While the case presented here is certainly interesting, it&#x27;s actually fairly uncommon for companies to run internet-facing honeypots, mostly due to it being a huge resource sink, and it&#x27;s fairly difficult to learn anything truely useful from observing attacks coming from (mostly) bots.<p>The more interesting use case for most is planting these in your network internals, which gives an added benefit of early, high-fidelity threat detection in addition to the &quot;threat intelligence&quot; bonuses. It&#x27;s not completely trivial to set up, but can be a reasonably quick way to build good detection capability into even very disparate environments.<p>A vast majority of organizations still lack good situational awareness of their infrastructures and this is one way of improving on that.')
