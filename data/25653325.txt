I&#x27;ll share an example<p>A group of 50 of us were planting young trees from seedlings which looked like weeds.<p>First step was to remove weeds, second was to dig the hole, third was planting the seedlings.<p>One group removed the weeds, another dug the hole, another planted the seedlings, and another removed the seedlings thinking they were the weeds.<p>In the end we drank a lot of bottled water, ate snacks, made a lot of trash, and very few if any trees were planted.<p>I think  if the dozens of us just donated a few bucks, hundreds if not thousands of trees would have been planted by 5 competent people.')
