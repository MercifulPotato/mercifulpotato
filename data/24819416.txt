I have a number of members of friends&#x2F;family who have become very difficult to be around, because they’ve become so intense&#x2F;constantly outraged about politics, even if they are on the same end of the political spectrum as me:<p>&gt; The research doesn’t reveal precisely why we tend to dislike overly political people, but it doesn’t take too much imagination to guess that constant foam-flecked political outrage makes one quite tedious. It also impedes our ability to think clearly: At least one experiment has shown that people become less accurate in interpreting data when the data concern something politically polarizing.')
