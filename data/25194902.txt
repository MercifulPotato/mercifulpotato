You can put your own router in front of the ISP one, and set your computers including your TV to use your router as the gateway, not the ISP one.  Relying 100% on a third party router (where you do not control the OS) is similar relying 100% on a third party DNS provider (many PiHoles are set up to use third party DNS providers).  This is willingly delegating 100% control to a third party.  Some of that control can be retained if desired by using own router (with OS you can fully control), or in the case of DNS by using own DNS that you can fully control.')
