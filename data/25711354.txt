We ban accounts that do that, regardless of which politics they&#x27;re battling for, because it destroys what this site is supposed to be for, i.e. curious, thoughtful conversation.<p>I hate to ban an 11-year-old account, but I had to scroll back two months in your comment history to find a post about ZFS. That&#x27;s seriously uncool. Between that and the fact that we&#x27;ve warned you many times not to abuse the site like this, I think we have to ban your account and I&#x27;ve done so. If you don&#x27;t want to be banned, you&#x27;re welcome to email hn@ycombinator.com and give us reason to believe that you&#x27;ll follow the rules in the future.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=primarily%20test%20by:dang&amp;sort=byDate&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=comment&amp;storyText=false&amp;prefix=false&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=primarily%20test%20by:dang&amp;sor...</a>')
