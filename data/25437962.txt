Did you really think somebody found a way to do real-time raytracing on a stock SNES? I saw the title and the first thing I thought is &quot;It&#x27;s not possible, so clearly they did some black magic fuckery to subvert the system&#x27;s limitations&quot;. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed either, because it&#x27;s impressive what he managed to do. Maybe try not to take every title completely literally? And maybe try a little bit harder to appreciate people&#x27;s creativity and hard work?')
