For each window, at each point in time, you have to decide what the size and position should be.<p>At one point I had lots of windows open and positioned them how I wanted with the size I wanted, every time I used them.  Then I realized that the positions and sizes actually didn&#x27;t change for certain windows.  And I hated having to move windows around all the time!<p>For example, my email program could always be in the same position with the same size, no need to make changes to this from one day to another.<p>Currently, I&#x27;ve got keyboard shortcuts to move the current window to a position&#x2F;size I like.  E.g. one keyboard shortcut for &quot;covers 100% of the screen&quot;, another for &quot;covers the right 75% (and 100% of the height) of the screen&quot;, and so on.<p>But this approach restricts you to specific arrangements of windows.  E.g. if you want to have a &quot;right 75%&quot; window on top, with a &quot;100%&quot; window below it so that the left bit &quot;peeks out&quot;, but the windows aren&#x27;t always the same, then it gets more cumbersome to arrange it.<p>(In my case that doesn&#x27;t apply because there is only one application that I run in &quot;right 75%&quot; mode and there are only two that I want to peek out from underneath.)<p>Tiling gives you convenient ways to have different arrangements without having to invest a lot of manual work, and for some people this is useful.<p>For example, dwm provides a layout of two columns, where a single tall window goes in the left column and the other windows go in the right column, stacked above each other.  It is really easy to go through the windows, and it is also really easy to move one window into the left column.  So you can have a main window that you are working in (in the left column) while you can watch the other windows on the right.  And it&#x27;s really convenient to to change the window you&#x27;re working in, and you can always follow what is going on in the other windows.<p>I encourage you to try this different way of working for a bit.  Maybe you can learn something from it.  Perhaps it teaches you something new so that you an adapt the way you work.')
