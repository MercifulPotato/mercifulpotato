You kind of expect 15-30% benefit in the same design. Whether CPU or bandwidth bound. Some latency bound benchmarks will be at par.<p>It is a perfect hit on all cylinders: a good design, a node advantage, and better memory.<p>This has happened before. We have been at a recent lull in performance, but annual performance increases used to be about 30%.')
