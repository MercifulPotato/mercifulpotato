They were already required to stop.  If you have one precipitating incident for them being required to stop, let&#x27;s hear it.  (Though, probably, there was one incident that was the last straw, with several more before it.)<p>But I was also wrong.  I was recalling accidents in the 1960s, and assuming that those were the basis for the law.  But if the law was already there in 1938, clearly those (multiple) accidents were not the reason for the law.  Those accidents happened in spite of the law (though perhaps reinforcing the reason for the law to be there).')
