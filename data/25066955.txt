Just that it makes me uncomfortable.  There are at least 3 references to religion in the first 3rd of the repair course page, including &#x27;The Ultimate Shop Manual&#x27; link.  Dan&#x27;s ultimate shop manual won&#x27;t tell you anything about motorcycles or motorcycle repair and does not belong in the middle of a &#x27;repair course&#x27;.<p>I like HN for interesting technical info like Dan has here.  But I&#x27;m not here for religion.')
