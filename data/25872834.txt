Item(by='seppel', descendants=None, kids=[25873252], score=None, time=1611331586, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25872698, text='&gt; Just putting &quot;order-550e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-446655440000&quot; does not make it an order id either, thats what foreign keys are for, mistakes can be made either way.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about the DB level here, I&#x27;m talking about what goes over the wire or ends up in logs files. And if you are handing out the uuids to your consumers, you can be reasonable sure that you only get back the uuids you handed out. So if &quot;order-550e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-446655440000&quot; is not an order, it an error on your side and not on your clients side.<p>&gt; If your sending id via json you should be using json to encode type either:<p>Yes and you should also not make any mistakes.')
