Which makes them more money.<p>&gt; Government is supposed to be &quot;efficient&quot; at serving all the people -is very hard economically.<p>This is almost never even useful.<p>Having mail service to rural areas isn&#x27;t uneconomical because nobody would offer the service for the right price, it&#x27;s because nobody would pay the price it actually costs.<p>But if it costs the government $100 to deliver a package, and the recipient would rather have the $100 than have the package delivered to their home (as compared to e.g. a post office box in the nearest town), why are we even doing that? Just let them keep the $100 in tax money they would have paid to fund the delivery but wouldn&#x27;t have paid given the choice not to.')
