Can&#x27;t just hop over the pond to go work there, and I&#x27;m fairly sure it&#x27;s easier for a US citizen to work here than the other way around.<p>Of course, that too is deincentivized thanks to US tax laws (still having to pay income taxes even though you don&#x27;t live or work in the US).')
