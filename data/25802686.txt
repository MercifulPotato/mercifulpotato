Once, when the dwarves still slept, I did a lot of work on rings and ideals.<p>Prime numbers are generators of prime ideals in the domain of Z. Of course, any multiplication with any divisor of 1 (and -1 is a divisor of 1), will leave the prime ideal intact.<p>So yes, you can call -2 or -11 a prime number if you want to.
