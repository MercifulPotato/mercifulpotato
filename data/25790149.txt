Because in my humble opinion, the command line is great solely because keyboard is (up to now) the best input device we have invented. Any graphical tool requires eye-hand coordination, which slows things down considerably. Using keyboard you basically only depend on your muscle memory and can input commands to the machine way more quickly.<p>What you seem to miss is that developers tools are the best tools created in computer science, period. That&#x27;s because we use them and we usually are too lazy to deal with stuff that bothers us, so we improve over time(and much faster than we do with tools for our customers). The only real problem is the learning curve, which is hard to avoid. So no, those tools are not bad. They just require some learning first, as pretty much any tool on this planet.<p>And yes, we could have better tools and we will have, that&#x27;s how progress works. You just didn&#x27;t make any useful suggestions how to get there faster.')
