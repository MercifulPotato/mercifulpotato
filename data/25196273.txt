I jail broke the first iphone to use it as a handle held video camera.<p>I need to jailbreak to get music off it. Lost the orginal itune laptop hard drive where the music is on. Don&#x27;t want to install some no free iMyPHone type of software to do the extract, don&#x27;t want to run them on my computer, seems a bit fishy.  I really just need root access and then I can scp off the music.<p>EDIT: iOS 10.x, old iphone.')
