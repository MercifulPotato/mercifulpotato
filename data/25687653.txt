I just think you ticked too much off.<p>This is my take:\nYour post advocates a<p><pre><code>  (x) technical ( ) legislative ( ) market-based ( ) vigilante\n\n  approach to fighting spam. Your idea will not work. Here is why it won&#x27;t work. (One or more of the following may apply to your particular idea, and it may have other flaws which used to vary from state to state before a bad federal law was passed.)\n\n  ( ) Spammers can easily use it to harvest email addresses\n  (x) Mailing lists and other legitimate email uses would be affected\n  ( ) No one will be able to find the guy or collect the money\n  ( ) It is defenseless against brute force attacks\n  ( ) It will stop spam for two weeks and then we&#x27;ll be stuck with it\n  ( ) Users of email will not put up with it\n  ( ) Microsoft will not put up with it\n  ( ) The police will not put up with it\n  ( ) Requires too much cooperation from spammers\n  ( ) Requires immediate total cooperation from everybody at once\n  ( ) Many email users cannot afford to lose business or alienate potential employers\n  ( ) Spammers don&#x27;t care about invalid addresses in their lists\n  ( ) Anyone could anonymously destroy anyone else&#x27;s career or business\n\n  Specifically, your plan fails to account for\n\n  ( ) Laws expressly prohibiting it\n  ( ) Lack of centrally controlling authority for email\n  ( ) Open relays in foreign countries\n  ( ) Ease of searching tiny alphanumeric address space of all email addresses\n  ( ) Asshats\n  ( ) Jurisdictional problems\n  ( ) Unpopularity of weird new taxes\n  ( ) Public reluctance to accept weird new forms of money\n  ( ) Huge existing software investment in SMTP\n  ( ) Susceptibility of protocols other than SMTP to attack\n  ( ) Willingness of users to install OS patches received by email\n  (x) Armies of worm riddled broadband-connected Windows boxes\n  ( ) Eternal arms race involved in all filtering approaches\n  ( ) Extreme profitability of spam\n  ( ) Joe jobs and&#x2F;or identity theft\n  ( ) Technically illiterate politicians\n  (x) Extreme stupidity on the part of people who do business with spammers\n  ( ) Dishonesty on the part of spammers themselves\n  ( ) Bandwidth costs that are unaffected by client filtering\n  ( ) Outlook\n\n  and the following philosophical objections may also apply:\n\n  (x) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever been shown practical (specifically, HashCash)\n  ( ) Any scheme based on opt-out is unacceptable\n  ( ) SMTP headers should not be the subject of legislation\n  ( ) Blacklists suck\n  ( ) Whitelists suck\n  ( ) We should be able to talk about Viagra without being censored\n  ( ) Countermeasures should not involve wire fraud or credit card fraud\n  ( ) Countermeasures should not involve sabotage of public networks\n  (x) Countermeasures must work if phased in gradually\n  (x) Sending email should be free\n  ( ) Why should we have to trust you and your servers?\n  ( ) Incompatiblity with open source or open source licenses\n  ( ) Feel-good measures do nothing to solve the problem\n  ( ) Temporary&#x2F;one-time email addresses are cumbersome\n  ( ) I don&#x27;t want the government reading my email\n  ( ) Killing them that way is not slow and painful enough\n\n  Furthermore, this is what I think about you:\n\n  (x) Sorry dude, but I don&#x27;t think it would work.\n  ( ) This is a stupid idea, and you&#x27;re a stupid person for suggesting it.\n  ( ) Nice try, assh0le! I&#x27;m going to find out where you live and burn your house down!</code></pre>')
