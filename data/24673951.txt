With the ability to drop a number of them on a flat maria. They will be made with as large as possible self levelling&#x2F;rotating ability. They can be each driven with their own solar array and will have optical data links so they can work as a large array. They will need an optically linked set of orbiters - which is doable, that can report sequentially. This is a fairly complex task, but once the design is settled and works well, it can be tested and then it can be replicated and an array gradually built with successor dishes. The dishes can be improved as flaws emerge. Being mainly made of aluminum, with vaccuum&#x2F;dust proof bearings with solar shades it will need to tolerate the temperature range. I think this is a good idea as the other side of the moon is indeed a quiet zone. The lunar lagrange point is also a good place, however the lagrange point will be a hard place for a number of dishes to be sited apart while maintaining precision array positioning.')
