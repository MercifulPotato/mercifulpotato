Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602895068, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24804500, text='&gt; Right now courts are applying the liability so broadly that companies aren’t liable even after they are notified about illegal behaviours on their site.<p>Right. While the text of the bill doesn&#x27;t remove <i>distributor</i> liability (only publisher&#x2F;speaker), its applied as doing that to, and giving even actively-moderating sites only neutral platform liability. There may be justification for this in legislative history and legal construction, so it may not be a pure judicial mistake, but from a policy perspective its at least arguably an overcompensation that Congress should correct, a correction which would be much more modest than many of the reform&#x2F;repeal Section 230 proposals but probably hit a better point in terms of dealing with the worst problems without creating more than it solves.<p>&gt; It’s also worth mentioning that before section 230 if you didn’t moderate you weren’t liable<p>That&#x27;s not entirely true. If you did actively moderate, you were liable as publisher, but if you didn&#x27;t actively moderate you would still likely be held liable as a distributor.<p>&gt; in certain senses it’s a censorship bill<p>The entire Communications Decency Act was a censorship bill and the express purpose of 230 as part of the CDA was to <i>encourage sites to do moderate content instead of taking a hands-off position</i>.<p>OTOH, so long as there is liability for knowing-unlewful content (distributor liability) and antitrust enforcement, I think that&#x27;s a good thing and reduces the social pressure for government to push the maximum line the courts will let it get away with in terms of government content restrictions.')
