Inefficiency and rigidity of the government, combined with opacity and greed of the private companies.<p>When people say privatizing things could be a solution, they don&#x27;t usually mean &quot;take tax money and award it through a no-bid contract to a private company for laughable reasons which could be either stupid or corrupt, your choice&quot;.
