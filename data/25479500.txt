I am often hyper vigilant to any perceived changes in my dad’s mental acuity and I worry that it hurts our relationship, even though I try to stay focused on the current moments I’m enjoying with him at any given time.<p>So far all seems well with my dad other than some expected age-related slowdowns in memory and processing, at least from my perspective. I can’t imagine what it would be like to deal with this so early in life.<p>I read “Being Mortal” by Atul Gawande this year and it was very helpful in some of the conversations I’ve since had with my family about the future and how we should think about death. I wouldn’t have had the courage to ask my parents what they cared about in life and in death before reading the book, and for that courage I am grateful. I recommend it to everyone because death is the only fate we all share.')
