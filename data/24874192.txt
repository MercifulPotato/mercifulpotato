There are lots of to do that already.<p>To call a mechanism a &quot;smart contract&quot; is to say that this mechanism contains both an agreement between parties and mechanism for the enforcement of that agreement - essentially one step beyond binding arbitration to automatic arbitration, by-passing courts in more complete basis.<p>There&#x27;s a reason that courts exist as the enforcement mechanism for contracts. There are many the terms or implications of a contract can different from what a reasonable person would expect and courts, with humans, are the machinery for preventing the multitude of ways this happens (and even these are far from perfect).<p>The DAO event illustrates this but even more, the real ugly will rise when smart contracts are used for all of the really abuse which normal contracts have facilitated - <i>usury</i>, <i>debt-peonage</i>, <i>sex-trafficking</i> and so-forth. Basically, it facilitates putting the weak at the mercy of the strong in uncontestable fashion.<p>I&#x27;d like to know how you can justify taking part in this.')
