For consumer devices: The Sony 1000XM4s are $270. Bose QC35 IIs are $265. You&#x27;d have to go up to pro-grade gear, such as the M&amp;Ds or Beyerdynamic Amirons, to match this price. Maybe Apple headphones are pro grade, but the AirPods are not, so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going for that market segment.')
