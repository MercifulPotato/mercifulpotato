Eventually I concluded much\nthe same as in Phil&#x27;s essay.<p>The nutshell description I formulated was\nthe VCs want a startup with a\nproduct&#x2F;service easy enough for any\ngrandmother to understand, <i>traction</i>\ngrowing <i>up and to the right</i>, in a huge\nmarket, with five founders, with all\ncredit cards maxed out, with at least four\nof the spouses pregnant, about to go\nunder, and desperate.<p>For one step more, they are looking in the\nrear view mirror and want to bet on\n<i>patterns</i>.<p>For one more, they want to fund the\ncompany to go to &quot;the next level&quot;, i.e.,\nthe big <i>go to market</i> effort.<p>The VCs in effect believe that any startup\nthat is successful will, on the way to\nbeing a big success, say, worth 1+\nbillion, at some point nearly necessarily\nbe desperate for some venture funding:\nThen that&#x27;s where the VCs want to write a\ncheck and get on the BoD.<p>Even if the VCs are willing to do <i>seed\nfunding</i>, they believe that for each\n<i>level</i> more VC cash will be essential.\nThen they hope to be the best positioned\nto make the <i>series A</i> round with the <i>up\nand to the right</i> and <i>go to market</i>\neffort.<p>Here is where I see the VCs failing:<p>First, the <i>patterns</i> they are looking for\nare too rare to be promising.  Instead,\nfor the future, the main pillar of the\nsuccess will be something new, powerful,\nand valuable for a large market.  For\nthis, it will be necessary for VCs to work\neffective with things that are new,\npowerful, and valuable.  This is not\nalways easy.  Relatively few VCs are able\nto do that.  Even if they are able, the\nlimited partners of the VCs won&#x27;t like\nthat.<p>Second, there really is a good <i>pattern</i>\nwith fantastic evidence from the past.  It\nis just that the VCs don&#x27;t see this\npattern.<p>Third, let&#x27;s look at this pattern with its\nfantastic evidence.  At first, we will\njust use some examples and then later will\nexplain with much more substance and\nmeaning.<p>(a) In WWII, the US had big need for some\nbetter weapons.  The usual VC approach\nwould have the US go to the designers of\nthe 16&quot; battleship guns and ask for 18&quot; or\n20&quot;.  Well, the US was smart enough not to\ndo that.  Instead, Szilard, Teller,\nWigner, Einstein, Fermi, etc. led the US\nto the A-bomb that ended the war in the\nPacific in about a week.<p>(b) Teller saw that fusion had promise of\nmuch more yield and in a few years had\nCastle-Bravo with 15 megatons of yield.<p>(c) The WWII aircraft engines went from 9\ncylinders in one row to four rows of 7\ncylinders per row and extreme efforts with\nsupercharging, intercooling, magnesium,\nhuge propellers with tips moving close to\nthe speed of sound, etc.  But a few people\nin each of Germany, England, and the US\nsaw the promise of gas turbines, and we\ngot some fantastic jet engines.  Four of\nthese on an airplane quickly put the\nAtlantic passenger steamships out of\nbusiness!<p>(d) A few people saw that reproducing the\nmarks on a sheet of paper would be a big\nadvance in office work and ... we got\nXerox with nearly a license to print\nmoney.<p>(e) Ike wanted to see what the Soviets\nwere doing.  So, Kelly Johnson at Lockheed\nput some long, narrow wings on an existing\njet airplane and gave Ike the U-2.  When a\nU-2 got shot down, soon Kelly showed up\nwith an armload of engineering drawings\ntalking about titanium and a special\nengine that Pratt and Whitney had (a turbo\njet up to about Mach 2.5 and then a ram\njet to Mach 3.2 or so).  Kelly got his\ncheck, and the US CIA got their SR-71 --\nspeed 3.2 Mach, altitude 80,000+ feet,\nrange on one load of fuel ~2000 miles, and\nnever shot down.<p>(f) Word whacking was a pain, really\nexpensive.  The IBM correcting Selectrics\nwere only a little better.  But an early\nmicroprocessor, a simple operating system,\nsome simple word whacking software, a\nfloppy disk, and some simple printers\nquickly eradicated the typewriters.  We\ngot Intel, Apple, Microsoft, and more.<p>The examples (a) -- (f) are only a few of\nthe dozens we could list from military\nprojects, biomedical projects, various\ntools, various services, etc.<p>So, for each of (a) -- (f), at the\nbeginning, the project had to be\nevaluated.  The rear view mirror as VCs\napply it would not help.  Instead, the\nneed was to work effectively with ideas\nthat were new, powerful, and valuable.<p>Fourth, let&#x27;s look at some &quot;substance&quot;\nsupporting the patterns illustrated by\nexamples (a) -- (f).  What is needed is a\nway to evaluate ideas that promise to be\nnew, powerful, and valuable for a large\nmarket.<p>Okay, one more example:  GPS.  If the USAF\ncharged a penny for each commercial use,\nthey&#x27;d soon own the world and everything\nin it????  Well, they&#x27;d have a lot.  Uh,\nat one time I was working at the JHU&#x2F;APL\nlab in the group that did the first\nversion of GPS, for the US Navy,\nespecially for the missile firing\nsubmarines.  I heard the stories.  The\nproject was first on the back of an\nenvelope.  With not much more in ideas, it\ngot funded and <i>the rest is history</i>.<p>So how was the evaluation done?  Sure,\nfirst some physics.  Next some math.  Next\nsome engineering.  Money allocated.  Work\ndone.  Rockets launched.  All done.<p>So, here it is:  The foundation of the\npattern for the evaluation to confirm new,\ncorrect, and significant was some science\nand math that could be checked.  That&#x27;s\nthe pattern:  The crucial core of the\nproject is an idea based on some science,\nmath, and engineering on paper that can be\nchecked.  That&#x27;s the pattern.<p>In the more advanced countries, there are\nplenty of people who can generate such\nideas, do the science, math, and\nengineering (e.g., the LHC) and plenty of\npeople who can check the work with high\naccuracy.  E.g., there are <i>problem\nsponsors</i> at the US NSF, NIH, DARPA, ONR,\netc. that can do the checking or manage\nthe checking done by others.  Research\nuniversity Ph.D. committees do such\nevaluations around the world daily.<p>Surprise.  Please sit down for this:  US\ntechnology VCs just will not, Not, NOT, no\nmatter what, not even under promise of\n$trillions, not with water torture, not\nwith anything, do or manage such\nevaluations.  Feet locked four feet deep\nin reinforced concrete, they won&#x27;t do it.<p>Results:  First, from all I can see, the\nmost promising path to the future is new\nideas, presented just on paper, as\nscience, math, and&#x2F;or engineering, that\nare powerful and valuable for big parts of\nour economy and that can be evaluated\naccurately.  Did I mention &quot;just on\npaper&quot;?<p>That&#x27;s what the JHU&#x2F;APL did for the first\nversion of GPS -- on paper.  That&#x27;s what\nKelly Johnson (there&#x27;s a picture) brought\nto the CIA for the SR-71 -- an armload of\nengineering drawings.  On and on.<p>The B-29 is what carried the A-bombs that\nended the war in the Pacific.  That plane\ncost ballpark as much to develop as the\nbombs!  A joke about VCs is that they\nwould say &quot;You build it, drop the first\nbomb, and we will fund the gasoline for\nthe flight of the second bomb.&quot;<p>For entrepreneurs, paper and pencils are\ncheap!  Can buy a lot of computing for\n$2000.  A lot of Internet bandwidth is\ncheap.  So, do the math, etc., write the\nsoftware, build a server, plug it into the\nInternet, go live, get users, run ads,\nmake money.  To me that&#x27;s the most\npromising path to success.  But VCs will\nhave nothing to do with it.<p>For the VCs waiting to fund the big <i>go to\nmarket</i> effort, in the past a lot of\ncompanies that were successful grew just\nfrom <i>retained earnings</i> and never took\nequity funding.  Now with cheap paper and\npencils, computing, the Internet, etc.,\nthat path seems relatively promising now.')
