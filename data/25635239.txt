You&#x27;re basically withholding X% of someone&#x27;s pay for 40 years, and also confiscating that pay if they don&#x27;t stay at the same company until the pension vests (so people cannot leave without incurring a huge financial penalty even if they hate their job and can find better options elsewhere).')
