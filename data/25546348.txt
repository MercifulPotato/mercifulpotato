The answer to these naysayers is that a program like RAM Doubler either works or it doesn’t – it’s a binary decision.<p>Cool that the technology was available and weird that the knowledge behind why it would work was not more widespread.<p>I take issue with the statement here though - it&#x27;s not binary. It&#x27;s of course important if it works in normal situations, but how does it work under extreme memory pressure or certain incompressible memory pages? Et.c.')
