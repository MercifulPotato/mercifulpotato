If Europe used this money to create the infrastructure for smaller companies to work together horizontally and vertically to form similar offerings they could end up with something better, at lower cost.<p>This is a model that worked extremely well in Japan in the latter half of the 20ths century, and was mostly responsible for its economic miracle: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Keiretsu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Keiretsu</a><p>In the cloud sector this would mean small companies that did everything from running electrical transformers in Berlin to data center management to running blob storage (on S3 protocol) to running machine learning SAASes or elastic compute services. All companies would work together to form a cohesive whole. Each company would own shares in related companies to insulate each other from stock market fluctuations and takeover attempts.<p>The hard part is building something resembling a cohesive service out of all of this where smaller companies can plug in to the network easily and end customers can use every service they want and still have one bill to pay.<p>If they can use the 10 billion euros for that - to minimize fragmentation - then the market will take care of the rest.<p>Of course, it could just be handed over to SAP to build &quot;SAP cloud&quot; as a direct competitor to Amazon. In which case, yeah, we&#x27;ll get a pile of shit.')
