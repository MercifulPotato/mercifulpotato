This makes it possible to work extremely quickly, with big “on the fly” changes to my implementations; performed “inline,” as I work.<p>The moment that I need to verbalize or “overall” document things, though, the whole gravy train comes to a screeching halt, as my brain needs to do some kind of “context switch.”<p>BTW: my code is pretty “anal.” Highly formatted and documented. I actually feel physically uncomfortable, if it isn’t formatted the way I like.')
