My father was an electronic engineer and one of his projects was quite a compact device (as big as 2 decks of cards) that was able, IIRC, to detect a slope of a few microns over a meter, and to take multiple measurements to make a 3d model of the surface. This was paid for by a company [1] that made big slabs of granite, which I reckon must have been these datums referenced in the article.<p>This was almost 20 years ago, and I was in my teenage years at the time. I had built the C# interface to download the data from the device, but I never understood or even though about the purpose of the whole endeavour until this article.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microplan-group.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microplan-group.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a><p>EDIT: it might have been a C interface coupled with Gtk, not C#. In retrospect, neither was a very smart or stable choice 20 years ago.')
