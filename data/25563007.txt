Honestly, it&#x27;s probably the best thing to go for right now because you have two domains that you can transfer that knowledge to if the railroads don&#x27;t hire you - electric car motors and diesel truck engines.<p>Also, keep in mind that technical schools cost a lot less and take less time time. So you could get certified as diesel electric and if they don&#x27;t take you, it should only require a few extra classes to get certified as a regular car or truck mechanic.')
