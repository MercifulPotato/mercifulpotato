Item(by='Hello71', descendants=None, kids=[25012039], score=None, time=1604700038, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011362, text='&gt; According to the article, it was one Canadian employee told by one Canadian supervisor that this was a no-go. There was no &quot;Poppies is bad!&quot; memo from Austin or Seattle. It was how a single Canadian manager chose to interpret the dress code.<p>This is egregious cherry-picking from the article. While one sentence says &quot;An employee of the Whole Foods in Ottawa says&quot;, the previous paragraph says &quot;U.S.-based Whole Foods Market says poppies aren&#x27;t allowed [...] which affects employees at its 14 locations across Canada&quot;, and the one before that (the first in the article) says &quot;a national grocery store chain has banned its employees from wearing the symbol of remembrance&quot;. Later, the article says &quot;A poppy does not comply with that policy, the company confirmed&quot;, referring to Whole Foods, not any specific location. The sentence that you&#x27;re quoting, read with any context whatsoever, is clearly anecdotal evidence provided to support the claim that Whole Foods both has a policy against wearing poppies, and is enforcing that policy in at least one store.<p>&gt; Further along in the article it shows the problem is provincial law<p>I don&#x27;t know what the hell you&#x27;re going on about here. &quot;would not be protected&quot; is vastly different from &quot;is not permitted&quot;. This sentence merely clarifies that Whole Foods&#x27; action is not <i>explicitly illegal</i>, not that it is required under any law.')
