It uses a modified virus that is only able to infect monkeys, so it is not harmful to humans.<p>I don&#x27;t think that novel is necessarily what you want when it comes to a vaccine. Kind of like saying that x software is better because they used all the very newest tech that just came out.  I would prefer something tried and tested.<p>However, the data and results for the mrna vaccines seem very positive so I would still be fine taking it.')
