Item(by='wuschel', descendants=1, kids=[25420809], score=1, time=1607968643, title='Ask HN: Re-infection data for SARS-CoV2 / vaccine viability', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='It seems that the efficacy (and safety) of the current vaccine candidates has not been tested beyond 2 months duration [1]. However, there have been numerous re-infections with SARS-CoV2 in a town near me (Germany, population ~ 90K, 3000 infected, 9 re-infected) alone. Current state of peer reviewed information is lagging behind - there are less then 7 reported re-infections globally.<p>The reinfection cases by SARS-CoV2 in the German town happened 5 months after initial exposure. No genomic analysis data is available due to the constrained resources of the public health departments. Testing and tracking has been done thoroughly in Germany until now that the capacity gets overwhelmed by the rapid growth of infections.<p>Could perhaps someone (qualified) elaborate whether the vaccines will work in the long term if they have not been tested beyond 2 months time, and re-infection has been reported occurs in the wild after five months? I am aware that the reinfection cases are quite low at the moment - however, I am wondering how the virus evades our immune system so well.<p>Is there any more data available on reinfections? The RKI [3] in Germany is just now acknowledging the data internally and is going to start a wider study.<p>---<p>[1] DOI: 10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2034577 - &quot;Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine&quot; (2020)<p>[2] source: internal public health department data from Germany (prefer not to disclose in public)<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rki.de&#x2F;')
