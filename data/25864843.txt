You are absolutely correct, this is a violence issue.<p>America has likely the most free speech protections in the world, but fighting words (violence) are not protected. There is a huge amount of precdent to support Amazon&#x27;s actions here, dating back decades.<p>Furthermore, just because Facebook did nothing is no reason for Amazon to sit idly by doing nothing. Is the advocation for Amazon to become another bystander? Is the superior situation to have all platforms supporting and enabling insurrection and possible sedition? Get off it. Amazon can make the right choice irrespective of their peers making the worst choice.')
