All packets that go direct to apple are identified with your real home ip address.<p>There is a VPN concept called &quot;split tunneling&quot; where your employer can control what data goes through the VPN via work and what data can actually go directly to and fron a destination from your home network.<p>Employers very cautiously permit or deny this kind of thing - sometimes allowing videoconferencing to use this with specific domains or ip ranges.<p>Apple goes around all this.  They can identify and correlate who works where, where they live and pierce the veil of privacy that should be afforded employees who have to work for someone else.<p>Also, if there is a vulerability in apple&#x27;s stuff, some employers would be vulnerable to attacks through the VPN, even though they didn&#x27;t permit split tunneling.')
