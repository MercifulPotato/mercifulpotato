Either you don&#x27;t want adversaries to predict your numbers and you should use a good CSPRNG, or you don&#x27;t care and predictability is not a property that matters.<p>As for reproducibility, all PRNGs give a reproducible sequence if you know the internal state, including the secure ones. You have to mix in a source of entropy to make them non-deterministic. The predictability we are considering here is when the attacker doesn&#x27;t have access to the internal state.')
