Where it the proof? What it seems you’re arguing is that H1B is proven to be absolutely necessary for American companies to be effective, can you back that up? Because in the absence of evidence of it being truly necessary for us to compete, there’s no argument for it existing.<p>Americans are more than willing to consult and do IT, we are good at it and it’s our bread an butter. China is not importing cheaper labor sources to take over their white collar jobs, no country that cares about its future would make such a short sighted mistake as to distort its own markets to suppress wages of its most valuable sector employees. It’s pure regulatory capture by the big IT consulting firms and big tech firms who have shown time and time again they will do whatever they can do suppress wages.<p>Apple and Google got caught colluding to suppress wages. Google is one of the biggest proponents of H1B, and yet since they got busted for illegal wage suppression practices, have they been at risk of going under? Have their stock prices dipped?<p>It’s not small companies who are relying on these H1Bs it’s the Fortune 500, the most successful companies are benefiting from this in majority.<p>You’re doing a lot of defending of big rich companies in favor of wage suppression and disincentivizing the next generation of American employees from learning tech.<p>Even from a long term view: do we want to encourage Americans to move into tech or no? Does this policy increase incentives for Americans to learn IT or no? Simple questions.<p>And if you truly believe the big companies can’t thrive without 40% more expensive IT (which wouldn’t even be the case, in house firms would optimize over time to compete better), then advocate for higher legal full immigration - at least then Americans win in the long run by retaining good talent. But you need to prove that it’s necessary first, and then you should argue for full legal immigration and be happy H1B are going down.<p>The only people happy with H1B are those who think indentured servants should be imported to America to suppress wages and save big companies extra bottom line. Even if you support importing more white collar jobs, you should be happy at this news.')
