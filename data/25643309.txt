But the video isn&#x27;t promising. The reason a physicist models a thing as a random variable is because they don&#x27;t know of a way to distinguish the thing from a random variable.<p>Dr. Deutsch spent far too much time talking about the fact that at a high level there are a lot of things we are certain about. That is very weak evidence of what is happening at the quantum level. The important part isn&#x27;t conceiving of something as deterministic. That is easy to do. Proving it experimentally will be the hard part.<p>There is nothing to report until there is an experiment that people can hold up saying &quot;see! we found it! This part is deterministic not probabilistic!&quot;.')
