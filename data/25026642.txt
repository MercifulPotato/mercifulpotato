Item(by='charliemil4', descendants=None, kids=[25033863], score=None, time=1604851808, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25025881, text='&gt; Mail in ballots have been the status quo in many states for decades.<p>Let’s focus on the battle ground states - not all states - and let’s specifically look at PA for a moment. Because of the electoral college, the statement that nationwide and some states we have used mail in ballots before is irrelevant.<p>So in 2018 PA had 200k absentee ballots - the mail-in ballot process [0].<p>In 2016 PA, and specifically Philly, had fewer absentee ballots requested than 2008 or 2012 [1] with around 18k for that metro.<p>In 2020, 2.6 million mail in ballots were requested 3 weeks before the election [2].<p>So you tell me, what really looks like the status quo? 2.6m ballots or around 200k. Physics would call this an order or magnitude difference, no? That would directly contradict that mail in ballots for PA are a status quo... and if you looked at the rest of the battle ground states, you will find similar evidence that mail in was never the preferred or dominate form of voting in the metros and battle ground counties.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whyy.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;pa-rejected-twice-as-many-absentee-ballots-in-2018&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whyy.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;pa-rejected-twice-as-many-absentee...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phillymag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;02&#x2F;absentee-ballot-requests-clinton-trump-election&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phillymag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;02&#x2F;absentee-ballot-re...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.post-gazette.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;Pennsylvania-mail-in-ballot-requests-2-6-million-registered-voters-PA-2020&#x2F;stories&#x2F;202010130153" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.post-gazette.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;Pennsylvania-m...</a>')
