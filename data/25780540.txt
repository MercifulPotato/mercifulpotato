You either need to have a strong enough background in CS to build the pipelines &#x2F; tools or a strong enough mathematics background to be able to propose cutting edge new ideas.  From my experience it is hard to find someone who has one of these skill just from a University &quot;data science&quot; program. At a small company (at least ones that I have worked with) being only proficient in R and basic Python isn&#x27;t enough. That being said, I have met and handful of Data Scientist who were very smart and self motivated enough to pick up on the lacking skills when given the chance.<p>My question to HN is this; are there rolls at these larger companies for a Data Scientist who who primarily just crunches data in R and Python without the ability to actually build the pipelines &#x2F; tools or conduct research?')
