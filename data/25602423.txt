Choosing not to configure a keyboard shortcut for account switching was a good call, too.<p>I tried using multiple Little Snitch profiles or different browsers on the same user account in the past but switching between them is way too low effort for my easily distracted brain. Getting back into distraction mode can be performed on autopilot in those cases.<p>That little delay in waiting for my watch to unlock my user account is just long enough to make me stop and think, and the vibration is like a gentle slap on the wrist.<p>My focus account has a single Little Snitch profile configured to block the time-vampires I know I&#x27;m susceptible to, along with Firefox configured to clear history on close. I don&#x27;t need to be reminded Twitter exists just because I opened my browser and pressed T, they should at least have to pay for the privilege of advertising to my brain!<p>In general I think that taking full advantage of computers to make absolutely everything instantly accessible is in many ways actively harmful to many types of brains. We live in an economy and too many of us just give that stuff away.')
