Just disconnect it from power once a day.<p>You can do that with cheap socket timer.<p>Not sure why would anyone set it to the middle of the day. Maybe error in setting times or clock or it was set intentionally so that you can service it at normal hours if it doesn&#x27;t come back on.<p>The problem is you can put in &#x27;off&#x27; time and &#x27;on&#x27; time but they have to be at least 1 minute apart.')
