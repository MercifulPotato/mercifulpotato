You use this for anything you want, really, from just driving the text editor from code on an ad-hoc basis to writing new extensions interactively.<p>This really is the main thing that any competitor to Emacs needs to have, in my view, much more so than the prehistoric keybindings, devoted fanbase, wide range of addons, and nasty extension language. (VSCode has 3 out of 4 here anyway.) Without it, VSCode is much more just Visual Studio with Javascript instead of C++.')
