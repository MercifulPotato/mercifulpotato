I sadly have no such story to tell regarding performance optimization, but figuring out the intricacies of any complex system (for me at least) inevitably leads to you knowing arcane stuff that might come in handy some time. But on the other hand, it also - in my humble experience - leads to you knowing a lot of arcane stuff that might have an impact on a problem, but is absolutely not related in the specific case one is dealing with.<p>Knowing when to discard arcane knowledge and when to jump onto that train of thought imho is crucial.<p>But on the other hand debugging arcane stuff in complex systems is just so much fun.
