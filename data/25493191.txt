The best ideas are motivated by problems you encounter yourself, not by trying to think of ideas. This is the biggest mistake you see with 20-something founders. Best way to come up with ideas is to use existing solutions and realize how shitty they are. Pretty much every single company was formed this way.<p>&gt; They are programmers, not creative after all.<p>Damn, this is a bold comment on HN. Since when does profession determine how creative you are? I&#x27;ve met &quot;programmers&quot; and &quot;geeks&quot; who are more creative than &quot;artists&quot;. Your profession has little to do with your innate creativity -- it just determines how you are able to express that creativity.<p>Unpopular opinion, but lists like this are stupid for people who are trying to build companies. You have to try things and be pissed off at the status quo to find real problems. Nobody is going to find real problems for you, in the same way that no quant school is going to reveal their hedge fund&#x27;s trading strategy to you. Finding ideas in a list is the last advice I would give to anyone. If it&#x27;s public, it&#x27;s probably not a profitable idea.')
