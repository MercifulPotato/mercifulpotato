I just wanted to say that equating MDMA with amphetamine is wrong. Lots of things work on the dopaminergic systems, but that alone doesn&#x27;t mean amphetamine has the same addiction profile as nicotine or cocaine, much less MDMA. LSD interacts with dopamine receptors too, but it&#x27;s really not addictive at all.<p>I think amphetamine&#x27;s action is much more affecting the <i>anticipation of reward</i> than reward itself. The selective dopaminergic effect is why it works for ADHD, but nicotine and caffeine do not.<p>Abuse comes with finding ways to spike the system and causing dysregulation, e.g. secondary dopaminergic effects across the brain. I think MDMA usually isn&#x27;t consumed in a way getting a high from a sudden spike, it isn&#x27;t smoked, injected and probably overall seldomly snorted; I think it&#x27;s mostly taken orally.<p>That&#x27;s also why people smoke meth. It&#x27;s not about efficiency, but the rapid uptake is essential for a certain type of high. E.g. nicotine patches aren&#x27;t addictive. For nicotine to become hugely addictive you need the rush from rapid uptake via inhalation in addition to MAOIs found in tobacco smoke. Crack is vastly more addictive than cocaine for the same reason. The free base allows for inhalation, that&#x27;s the whole magic.<p>Anyway, I am just nitpicking about the amphetamine ~= MDMA. I think we&#x27;re overall on the same page.')
