Brush claims off as unimportant &#x2F; ignore their messages in group chats instead of giving contra, leading them to misinterpret silence as tacit agreement.<p>2. If engaging, doing it very shallowly with platitudes like &quot;check your sources&quot; but never going over concrete examples with them.<p>3.
