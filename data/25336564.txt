Getting the game to run well requires work, from writing additional platform dependent code, through fixing issues caused by changing the graphics backend (unless you use OpenGL on Windows, which you probably don&#x27;t) to a <i>lot</i> of additional QA needed to make sure your Linux build still runs after the latest changes.<p>I&#x27;m a solo game developer (working on [1] right now) and while I get many more requests for a native Linux version than I expected, I&#x27;m still reluctant to invest the necessary development time. It&#x27;s ironic, but the very fact that Proton is so solid makes it even less likely that a Linux build will exist, since I&#x27;m fairly certain people will be able to play Slipways under Proton with hardly any issues if they want to.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;1264280&#x2F;Slipways" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;1264280&#x2F;Slipways</a>')
