As a famous example I mention Billie Eilish; I read that they uploaded their first famous song only on Soundcloud so that a friend could hear it; so not exactly an (intended) marketing measure; but as luck would have it, thousands then suddenly discovered and heard the song. The rest is history. But I know far more at least equally talented musicians who upload songs to Soundcloud without anyone taking notice.')
