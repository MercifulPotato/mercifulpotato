When I was in high school over a decade ago, I did take a required financial literacy class. Required by the state. So yes, students do learn about savings accounts, CD accounts, IRA, Roth IRA. They learn about stocks, mortgages. Various other things (like tax returns by hand). I don&#x27;t think equity&#x2F;derivatives&#x2F;futures&#x2F;bonds were covered. Another class I took that was an elective (so not required, but available) -- and possibly took it at 9th or 10th grade -- was on business stuff including how to actually go and start your own business, different types of businesses, etc.<p>Even suppose you make students take a second financial literacy course, at the expense of letting them study what they want (electives), it&#x27;s not going to help. Despite all the core curriculum that already exists, just because you&#x27;re forced to take a class does not mean you&#x27;re going to learn its material. Maybe find a better way to solve your grand social engineering problem, because &quot;more education&quot; isn&#x27;t it, and disrupts a lot of students from actually achieving a good education because they&#x27;re forced to deal with required core BS aimed at the lowest common denominator.')
