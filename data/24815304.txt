I think part of the problem is people have heard that javascript is bad and just expect it to be bad, so they never really try to learn it and just copy and paste something that works and maybe expand on the bad examples when they should just be learning how to use javascript.<p>Javascript requires some self-discipline, where other languages discipline you if you try to fuck things up yourself. It&#x27;s kind of like a drunken sailor on leave going on a bender on-shore - the minute they leave the ship all bets are off. Some people just can&#x27;t wrap their head around using weak&#x2F;dynamic typing, because it loosens the rules. But that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t any rules.<p>I code in a dozen other languages and Javascript is still my favorite because it&#x27;s so easy to use, no boilerplate, and it doesn&#x27;t give me any &quot;gotchas&quot; because javascript actually does follow some very basic easy to understand rules. The people that don&#x27;t bother to learn those rules invariably shit on javascript. It&#x27;s not fair, it&#x27;s not real criticism.<p>And practically all of the &quot;examples&quot; of bad javascript is almost always code that nobody should ever write, in any language, because it&#x27;s just stupid to write code in those ways. But people think &quot;aHa, aNoThEr &#x27;gOtChA&#x27;&quot; and the myth of javascript being somehow inferior continues. And to anyone who actually knows how easy javascript is to use, it just looks silly, pathetic, and obnoxious.')
