We&#x27;re middle of the road as far as income tax goes.  Start adding in things like sales tax, fees paid to government, sin taxes, etc. and the net tax burden is pretty high.<p>Also, local governments very much have a &quot;wring out every cent we can&quot; attitude.  Places full of rich people who step in line tax the crap out of people.  Places like New Bedford and Fitchburg know that if they charge people more than a token amount for trash they&#x27;ll just be pulling it out of the river.')
