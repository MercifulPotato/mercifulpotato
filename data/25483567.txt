I&#x27;m able, I&#x27;m OK with it. The Daoist&#x2F;Bonpa[1] base qigong I&#x27;ve studied, along with other practices (Alexander technique, self-hypnosis, NLP, etc.etc), has prepared me for this. But it hasn&#x27;t solved all my problems, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to and I have a hunch that this kind of simplistic formula is something like a weakness of the &quot;Western&quot; (philosophical) outlook.<p>I understand that the &quot;inability&quot; stateme involve an effort to cast a spotlight on many people&#x27;s inability to attain something like a &quot;meditative mindset&quot;. If that&#x27;s all you want to do, fine. But you houldn&#x27;t take awareness, a contemplative mindset, and so-forth as the answer to everything. It&#x27;s much closer to starting to explore the question, having sufficient tools to explore human existence, etc.<p>Indeed, I&#x27;d say &quot;humans are capable of sitting alone quiet in a room alone and it is the ignorance of a given person that prevents this. But to overcome your ignorance, you probably have to leave your room&quot;.<p>TL;DR; this kind of claim is more like taunting the unenlightened than helping.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bon</a> , <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academyofqidao.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academyofqidao.com&#x2F;</a>')
