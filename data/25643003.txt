It fails to explain that, for example, some players consistently beat other players, or at least have a much higher than 50% winrate.<p>If chess really did consistently just have a 50% outcome, then it really would be equivalent to an overcomplicated coinflip. So I don&#x27;t find this parable at all convincing, and remain a logical positivist.')
