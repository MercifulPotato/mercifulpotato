After failing 3 times you have the option for an oral test as a last chance and people do indeed fail math in large numbers.<p>I was on the other side as an academic assistant for a few days (no role in testing) and I can tell you that oral math exams about algebra can be as hard as you want them to be, especially if you have problems with tests and get nervous.
