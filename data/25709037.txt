I have an AdobeRGB wide-color-gamut monitor configured in 10-bit mode, use Firefox with color-management enabled, and I have the AdobeRGB profile correctly set in Windows.<p>It is incredible to me that in 2021 the web makes it <i>impossible</i> to get even vaguely correct colours onto a screen.<p>I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s to blame here: Web standards bodies, Mozilla, or the specific AVIF decoder.<p>But I do know that color-blind people are creating the next generation of imaging standards.')
