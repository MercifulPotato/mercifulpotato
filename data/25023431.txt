A lot of people say class B is bad because crossover distortion, but what they are actually referring to is class C (the classic picture where a bit of the waveform is conducted by the top one and a bit of the waveform is conducted by the bottom one, with some flat spots in between) Class AB is bad because near the crossover, both top and bottom devices conduct and that actually causes an assload of crossover distortion. Properly biased class B <i>precisely</i> hands over conduction from one side to the other, making crossover distortion practically negligible.<p>Class A is theoretically the best but you can get good performance, and perhaps even better performance than A with a properly designed class B amplifier.')
