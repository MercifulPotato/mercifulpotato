Boomers grew up in a time where cars were a major status symbol, but there&#x27;s a high percentage of younger generations that don&#x27;t even care to own a car. Based on what you stated, I wonder if the materialism has just been replaced by an experiential sense of status (e.g., who has the best Instagram-worthy vacation to share, or who has the coolest start-up story to tell, or the most &#x27;artisan&#x27; career). I&#x27;m not claiming to know, just curious if these are just different means to the same end defined as the esteem of our collegues')
