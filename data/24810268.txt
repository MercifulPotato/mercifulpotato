You might never be in the position of doing something additional than &#x27;just working one ticket of after the other&#x27; and what i mean by this: forming your environment, forming the product and making that thing to yours.<p>Something you formed, you guided, you made.<p>You will be frustrated about your job, you will complain, your colleges, well aware what your problems are, will just not tell you what you need to here because you are probably not showing them that you do care.<p>You will earn the same amount of money, your job will not change switching companies much and thats it.<p>While the others are getting rid of the standard pitfalls, making their lives easier, learning new things, getting faster, better, more valuable. Earning more money for the same time spend at work, getting cooler projects, being aksed to join teams because of reputation, having more slack than you with a much better salary due to trust and past achievements.<p>And if you realize this too late, you lost the most valuable time: early in your career. The time where you advanced the most and the fastest, were you learn easier, where everything new is interesting and cool.<p>If you read this and you spend a lot of time on imageboard or whatever and you hate your job or you are depressed because of it, its not the fault of others.<p>I have never ever had the issue of doing my things to early and then not knowing what to do else. There is always an old bug to fix, something to automate, something new to try out, to read to watch etc.<p>And there is a secret: I actually like my job because of all the possibilities.')
