Sibling comment about Chinese apple seems credible to me.<p>I can think of several orange things other than oranges: sea buckthorn as you say, but also cloudberries and carrots (which I don&#x27;t get why they are dismissed by the article: not vibrant enough? Nor is a foxâ€¦?).<p>An older word for orange (ish?) I can think of is <i>brandgul</i>. <i>Brand</i> is a big fire, and <i>gul</i> is yellow, so &quot;big-fire yellow&quot; if you will. Still a variation of yellow, but yet another naturally occurring orange :)')
