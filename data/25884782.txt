Under Obama, as I&#x27;m sure you know, the Espionage Act of 1917—one of the most pernicious laws we have on our books; it was enacted under Woodrow Wilson, and it was designed to criminalize dissent from U.S. participation in World War I—was invoked against whistleblowers and sources, like Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning and a dozen others, more under Obama than every other prior president combined. It ended up being three times more prosecutions under the Espionage Act for our sources as journalists than all previous presidents, including Nixon or Eisenhower or whoever you want to pick. And the press said almost nothing.<p>That&#x27;s fairly meaningless without a comparison of the number of people for whom it could have been applied under Nixon or Eisenhower or whoever.<p>Was it applied more under Obama than, say, Eisenhower because Obama applied it to cases that Eisenhower would not have applied it to if they had occurred during his administration?<p>Or were there more people leaking classified information during Obama&#x27;s time in office than there were during Eisenhower&#x27;s and that explains why it was applied more under Obama.')
