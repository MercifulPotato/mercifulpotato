Tenderloin was definitely sketch but I didn&#x27;t feel personally unsafe. I&#x27;ve also seen a lot of awful things, like one dude beat the shit out of another in broad daylight, but again I didn&#x27;t feel personally unsafe.<p>What I&#x27;m more used to is growing up in a bad neighborhood in Chicago in the 90s where I actually felt unsafe because the odds of getting robbed at gunpoint or getting beat up were very high. &quot;Walking around&quot; meant avoiding specific areas, avoiding alleyways, getting away from groups, not traveling alone, not having anything worth more than a dozen dollars on me or any clothing worth more than that, etc.')
