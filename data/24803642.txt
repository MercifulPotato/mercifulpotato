The tweet is accurate; the WHO was also issuing far more detailed statements including cautions about exactly what you assumed at the time - that further information was likely to arrive later.<p>Again:<p>&gt; According to a timeline of events, Van Kerkhove, who is also the WHO’s technical lead for the COVID-19 response, also said that human-to-human transmission wouldn’t be unexpected, since that is what occurs with SARS and MERS, which are also coronaviruses.<p>They were making the exact point you claim they didn&#x27;t make.')
