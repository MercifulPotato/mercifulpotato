The pandemic is on track to cause a roughly ~7% drop in emissions for 2020. And (depending on the ever changing forecast) something like ~5-7% drop in global GDP for 2020.<p>So the link and magnitude appears pretty strong and the results appear pretty much expected. We know how to do this.<p>One: stop the emissions by switching to renewables and nuclear, and away from fossil fuels for transport.<p>Two: drawdown the carbon we’ve already emitted (and will emit during the transition in One above) through reforestation, rebuilding wetlands, building new carbon sinks, and carbon capture.<p>The market and a political approach are the only solution. How else are you going to institute the subsidies and taxes and government scale infrastructure and environmental programs.')
