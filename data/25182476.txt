Item(by='AndrewBissell', descendants=None, kids=[25182783], score=None, time=1606092390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25182099, text='&gt; I think it creates a much fuller and more perplexing picture of a person who lived such different sides of his life. In the long run, in the cosmic sense, I think you can say that commitment to a cause always gives you the justification for immoral acts. And patriotism is among the most seductive of those causes because it posits the nation as a value that&#x27;s so transcendent that anything done in its service is virtuous.<p>I can buy that patriotism was used to sell MKULTRA to some of the rank and file who carried it out, but if I&#x27;m to believe that it&#x27;s what motivated Sidney Gottlieb, Jolly West, and all the rest of its leading lights, I find the idea naive in the extreme. Even their stated motivation for originally undertaking a mind control program (after U.S. pilots supposedly came back brainwashed from Korea) is mendacious. Those pilots didn&#x27;t need to be programmed to testify that we engaged in germ warfare in Korea because we actually did it!')
