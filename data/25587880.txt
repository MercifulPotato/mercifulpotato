I could also see an argument that it&#x27;s not.<p>I&#x27;m coming around to the line of thinking that another poster mentioned-- that this could be considered Adobe criminally exceeding the access to my system that I&#x27;ve granted them. I agreed to updates. Not to removal of functionality.<p>I can&#x27;t do a damned thing about it, but it pisses me off, and I want other people to be pissed off about it to. Taking away functionality in somebody else&#x27;s computer is unethical in my moral framework. Normalizing that idea is dangerous and wrong to me, too.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adobe.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;cc&#x2F;en&#x2F;legal&#x2F;licenses-terms&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Flash_Player_32_0.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adobe.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;cc&#x2F;en&#x2F;legal&#x2F;licenses-terms...</a><p>Edit: Would it be your contention that all software developers have the right to remove functionality in their software at any time? Does consideration paid factor into that? What if it&#x27;s expeditious for my business model to disable my older software to get you to move to my new software? Does such disabling constitute an &quot;update&quot;?')
