I didn&#x27;t say no statically typed languages support them.<p>But your Java example isn&#x27;t a true heterogeneous lists, very close but not really. You cannot put instances of value types into it.<p>Even if it were a true heterogeneous list. You have given up on static typing with such a list and defer it to runtime. Which is exactly the dynamic typing approach.')
