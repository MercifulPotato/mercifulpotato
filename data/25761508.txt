It covers a great deal of the technical subjects to perhaps most of the undergraduate level of understanding.<p>I then supplement a course like brilliant, with udemy courses, guided project courses and then finally in to unguided personal projects. I can pass my CS exams, work full time, and not have to ever attend a lecture.<p>I only really decided to go to university to meet cool people and go to parties. There was a legitimate decision whether it was really worth it. Thankfully I live in a country where education is essentially affordable for a student, so I didn&#x27;t stand to lose much.<p>My university has practically one of the biggest, most comprehensive libraries in the world. However, being an undergraduate, they don&#x27;t actually allow me to borrow most of them, but a small sliver of &#x27;undergraduate appropriate&#x27; books. But it&#x27;s still extremely nice to be able to grab any book, free of charge and do some research. -&gt; This is one of the main reasons I want to hang around in university.<p>Access to workshops, and labs is nearly always restricted to the people in the appropriate subjects. So I cant actually build anything physical, unless I belong to some mechanical engineering course. Figuring out a way to get around that would also be very nice for the future education system.<p>The tutor system in Oxford, Cambridge if it could be scaled, would be the final nail in the coffin for the traditional university. If I could get access to a person who is more knowledgable than me in a subject to help me understand what I don&#x27;t know and give me pointers on what I probably need to learn would save me countless hours of just trying to know what I don&#x27;t know.')
