The knob design is the much older one as it&#x27;s purely analog.<p>I don&#x27;t have a microwave anymore for almost a decade now, but even before I used it occasionally only, mostly for heating up food from the day before, nothing where I&#x27;d need sub-millisecond accuracy.\nAlso in general food tastes different&#x2F;weird if you blast it at full power, so going for lower wattage and longer cooking times would reduce the need for super accurate timing controls. Unless you grew up on microwaved food exclusively, then I guess food prepared on a stove tastes weird. :-)')
