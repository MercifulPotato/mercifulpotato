I seem to have nothing in common with these people. The signed-out recommendations are ugly and disgusting to me and people I know.<p>The search results are OK and in the language I search for mostly, except that the Wikipedia that is presented is not based on my browser&#x2F;system languange (English) or the word I type, but it has started pushing Wikipedia in French, which I do speak, but not looking for as it&#x27;s practically empty for topics of my interest.<p>I have to write &quot;$word wikipedia English&quot; or search &quot;en.&quot; on the page and it&#x27;s tiring.<p>Other sites ignore language and it&#x27;s horrible. They present the Arabic version, which I also speak, that I&#x27;m not interested in. They don&#x27;t even let me change that. It sucks and I stopped using these sites.')
