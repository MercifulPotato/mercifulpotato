Your browser is using X25519 which is the same <i>concept</i> but with Elliptic curves instead of modular exponentiation of integers.<p>If Steam were concerned about certain TLS parameters, they could just ensure they never agree the worrying parameters. It wouldn&#x27;t make any sense to instead bake some other mechanism for login and then trust TLS for everything else.')
