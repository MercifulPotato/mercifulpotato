Let&#x27;s test that. Let&#x27;s say Scotland issues a new currency. Let&#x27;s say the Scottish government believes it has to get money from markets to spend.<p>Where are &#x27;the markets&#x27; going to get the Scottish currency from to buy the bonds?<p>Now do you see how you have the monetary operations backwards.<p>Bonds are a reserve drain. You can&#x27;t do a reserve drain until you do a reserve add.<p>&quot;More you try to loan from market, higher rate will be required&quot;<p>There is no operational mechanism for that to happen. For rates to go up prices have to go down. If prices go down then the Fed simply QE&#x27;s the Treasury out of circulation and forces the price back up.<p>The Fed has complete control of the yield curve all the way up the maturity. You get to play in the Treasury market on the whim of the Fed, and under no other conditions.')
