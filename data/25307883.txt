But to be honest, I&#x27;ve not seen that much drama about it than one post. Have I been missing something?<p>This seems a very solid move from Google. Someone tried to bully their way into getting information from Google they shouldn&#x27;t give out. If you go to HR in confidence that confidence should be upheld. The fact someone had to go to HR for a peer review and the fact it was upheld states something.<p>If someone says &quot;Do X or I&#x27;ll quit&quot; when you&#x27;re not going to do X, it is a resigination and seems quite standard that they don&#x27;t want such an active detractor within their company ranks.<p>I believe she basically sent an email to fellow employees basically telling them to stop working. That alone is a firable. That is completely nuts and unacceptable work place behaviour. The fact Google didn&#x27;t fire her for that should speak volumes.<p>To me, from a HR point of view, this is completely the right move to make.')
