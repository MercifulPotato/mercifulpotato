Need an entirely new component for that in addition to maintaining the last one. Failure to deprecate will result in something like a fatal error in the editor that the user can&#x27;t recover from. It&#x27;s like PHP-era decisions with modern promises.<p>Github issues are or were stuffed with people pulling their hair out and finding byzantine workarounds to fundamentally bad decisions and indifferent responses from core developers.<p>I just logged into the WP&#x2F;Gutenberg project we developed and noticed that everything is broken due to hosted WP updates.<p>Eager to rewrite on a different platform.')
