The Jews do not believe God has sons. Christians do. So it is in the best interest of Christian translators to translate that phrase as “sons of God”.<p>&gt; but the claim that the translation &quot;sons of god&quot; is specifically wrong only seems to be based on the declaration of a single earlier source.<p>No, I only provided one source  (Chabad), but there are many others, including all Jewish translations of the Old Testament (Torah) from the original Hebrew to English. You’ll never see it translated as “sons of God” in a book translated by Jews.')
