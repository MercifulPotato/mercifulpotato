It is the primary and most natural freedom, and the people who use language and force to deprive you of it only do it because they want you to to work for them - instead of them. Privacy is not defended by words, because words themselves presume an external authority to prevail upon and get permission from. Privacy itself is freedom and it is only  exercised by action.<p>I actually worked in privacy for a decade or more, consulting to government organizations about how to preserve their legitimacy when they collect data on people. I&#x27;ve discovered there are a fair number of bureaucratic nihilists who think ends justify means, and see the idea of privacy as being anti-progress, but mainly just anti-them. Wow do they get mad when you ask them do comply with the law.')
