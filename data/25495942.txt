Total value was $19.9 ( will net approx 2 sales )<p>Now we are a 1000 user pool with chance to buy (0.2%), and will be priced accordingly, will be like approx $0.02.<p>Actually nothing will be changed. Except, the middle man, facebook, will compete with other ad networks with commission, it means more revenue for developers. More privacy for consumers.<p>For advertisers, on bigger ones, there will be not much effect.<p>For smaller advertisers, there will be more work involved, but ad networks will manage that (from opt-in IDFA users). Ad networks eventually will discover you sources (apps you can advertise on positive ROI)<p>Eventually some small advertisers may have small disadvantage on this.')
