You&#x27;d see the same people at the same library tables week after week, friends didn&#x27;t let friends study in bed because beds were mostly for sleeping, and there were always a few people who staggered unsteadily into exams to try the whole &quot;state-dependent memory&quot; thing. It wasn&#x27;t particularly evidence-based, but after a few years of wildly oscillating between thinking about different topics, you notice that your brain likes to associate modes of thought with sensory input.
