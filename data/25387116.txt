F90 and on you had more options with the layout of your program so that it was actually sensible. And you can use recursion without having to check if your compiler supports it. And reentrant functions.<p>But the built-in types are collection types are anemic, it&#x27;s similar to C in that regard. It&#x27;s a relatively low-level language compared to other high-level languages. But if I were doing math&#x2F;simulation stuffs, I would definitely consider using it again.<p>Just, please, no more embedded programs written in Fortran. That was a bad idea (unless it&#x27;s doing complex math like for the radar system).')
