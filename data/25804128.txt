Item(by='ve55', descendants=None, kids=[25804232, 25804803, 25804857, 25804948, 25804693], score=None, time=1610821313, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25803956, text='&gt;The current situation in the US is challenging. Misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories are rampant in every cohort of society.<p>Most of the higher-quality longitudinal evidence I&#x27;ve seen does not show that there is an increase in believing in conspiracy theories or misinformation (or, as we used to call it, people simply being incorrect). It&#x27;s simply much more visible now due to the Internet being widely adopted, whereas in the past you&#x27;d never know what people across the world (or even your own city) may have been thinking about.<p>Since there is no stable nor global solution to the problem of deciding who gets to label&#x2F;regulate information, nor any evidence showing that <i>even with the regulation of information</i>, people actually change their beliefs to the &#x27;correct&#x27; ones, I don&#x27;t personally see merit in this path. The temptation to find a solution is sensible prima facie, but history and human psychology show us that this is a fool&#x27;s errand.')
