The first industrial revolution had a few major staples, as did the second, and we are so eerily early in the third that who knows what will begin.<p>So, making a very rough count of revolutionary technologies, there were:<p>&gt; 3 in IR1: mechanization, steam power, the locomotive, 5 in IR2: oil + internal combustion, electric power, electronic communications, industrial chemistry, germ theory, 1 in IR3 (so far): computing + digital communications<p>Personally, I think IR3 will also have robotics, advanced manufacturing, and biotechnology (genetic editing, &amp;c) will be the defining additionals.')
