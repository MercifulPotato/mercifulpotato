I use qbserve for this. Also, having Dash to find solutions to coding problems with out using the browser helps to avoid some distractions&#x2F;rabbit holes.<p>For me interesting work is what keeps me in the zen, mostly.<p>Also, it <i>does</i> take a heavy toll on you. There are other important realms in life that you simply do not spend enough time on. It&#x27;s possible, but sustainable only if you have a terrific support system.')
