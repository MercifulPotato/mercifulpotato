I was responding directly to the comment which says that a monopoly is not defined by market share. But that is <i>exactly</i> what a monopoly is defined as - it&#x27;s the &quot;mono&quot; part in the word. If what the parent comment was talking about is not a monopoly, then they could have said that and pointed out what it is instead.')
