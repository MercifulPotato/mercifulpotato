The 600-cell is a four-dimensional regular polytope with 120 vertices and 600 tetrahedral faces.  Since 120&#x2F;24 = 5, you might hope that there’s a way to partition the 600-cell’s vertices into the vertices of five 24-cells.<p>And there is!  A new paper by some high school students shows what we&#x27;ve long believed: there are exactly 10 ways.<p>In fact, they show there are 25 ways to choose some of the vertices of the 600-cell to be the vertices of a 24-cell. \nThese 25 ways can listed in a 5×5 array, so that each row and each column gives one way to partition the 600-cell’s vertices into the vertices of five 24-cells.<p>For details and pictures go here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;the-600-cell-part-4&#x2F;')
