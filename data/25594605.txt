You can&#x27;t misrepresent what they write and call it &quot;they snuck in a word&quot;. What kind of logic is that? To respond to some other claim from somewhere else on the internet, real or imaginary, regardless of what the person in question writes?<p>While I personally don&#x27;t agree with your claim that &quot;tesla categorically saying&quot; those things, the poster still did say it even less.<p>This is what Tesla claim:<p><pre><code>    The activation and use of these features are dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions. As these self-driving features evolve, your car will be continuously upgraded through over-the-air software updates.\n</code></pre>\nYou are welcome to present any links or quotes as to where you got the idea that Tesla claims that the vechicle is guaranteed to have FSD in some specific claimed time period (including a time period within each individual vechicle&#x27;s lifespan).<p>I also personally know several Tesla owners and none of them interpret the company&#x27;s claims the way you do.
