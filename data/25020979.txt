Is it avoiding distortion?   Or both of the above (or other factors) for the price that components are available on the market?<p>Looking at some of the photos of components in the amplifier, it looks way dumber and less sophisticated than a Raspberry Pi. Why has the cost of an amplifier not come down to say, $100?<p>And maybe related, why does a &quot;good&quot; pair of noise cancelling headphones cost $300 and not $50?   Is there something related?')
