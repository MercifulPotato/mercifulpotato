We&#x27;ve been really overwhelmed with the demand and have been scaling our team and processes to be able to meet it.<p>We can also often accelerate invites for people who do have a specific application they&#x27;d like to build. Please feel free to email me (gdb@openai.com) and I may be able to help. (As a caveat, I get about a hundred emails a week, so I can&#x27;t reply to all of them — but know that I will do my best.)')
