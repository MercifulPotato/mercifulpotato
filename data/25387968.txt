For example, Spring boot should have a very low score for me. It&#x27;s backed by a large company Pivotal. They don&#x27;t need any support I think. Same thing for elasticsearch.<p>For me:<p><pre><code>    - backed by a large company ? \n \n    - number of contributor doing 80% of the work ? or active in the last 12 months ? commits breakdown (99% is done by one guy) ?  \n\n    - issues created&#x2F;closed ratio  \n\n    - PR created&#x2F;merged ratio  \n\n    - use critical projects ?  \n\n    - other from your original score\n</code></pre>\nA nice bonus: if we could use the tool to assess critical score for our project (not globally). For local dependency, we could increase the critical value if dependents count is low. Very few person is using it: that&#x27;s a bad sign. With this, we could find those dependencies.<p>We could also create a global score (like you did) by using the previous score and scaling it using the dependency usage (dependents_count like you did).<p>With this calculation, I think it&#x27;s more likely to find relevant projects.<p>How to find it&#x27;s backed by a large company ? Not sure about this, we can check if the project is part of an organization, if contributor have a company or if they have a pro account. For example, if the top 5 contributors are from Google, it&#x27;s likely it&#x27;s sponsored by it(could be done during their free time but less likely).<p>Note: check what happens with a stable project (no new issue and PR).')
