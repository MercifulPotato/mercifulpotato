Here in europe you can work 32 hours if you wanted to, but you make 20% less money. Would you work one day less for 20% of your base salary?<p>In terms of reward, this is like a 25% raise. Imagine getting a raise of 25%.<p>I&#x27;m interested how much the raises the past ten years were. Is this a big thing, or is this an overdue raise for the past ten years.<p>Will they compensate the lost labor with new hires? If not, you could also see it as Unilever firing 20% of its workforce, and it could indicate something has gone wrong with their business (I know, corona is probably the cause, but what if it is something else).<p>Initiatives to work smarter sound promotional. It sure sounds better than &#x27;our sales people have nothing to do during corona&#x27;.<p>Overall, I would be happy to have more free time.')
