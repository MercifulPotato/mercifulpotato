Why keep money in a near zero-interest bank account when I can hold beta. If markets were 24&#x2F;7 with instant settlement of securities I could hold all my money in stocks and bonds. I wouldn&#x27;t be concerned with holding cash for liquidity&#x27;s sake. More so I could hold more of my money in securities representing interest in real property -- housing, arable land w&#x2F; fresh water, and commodities which are usually a better store of value than cash unless there is a liquidity crunch. There are good reasons why asset prices have been soaring for the past decade.')
