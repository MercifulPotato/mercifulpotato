Europe has had negative interests (!) on savings accounts for many months... that, combined with physical gambling venues closed, normal gambling restricted and trading apps such as Trade Republic (the German equivalent to Robinhood) led to many people trying their luck on the stock market.<p>Additionally, Tesla has the advantage that <i>many</i> European countries are phasing out ICE vehicles and Tesla is the solid tech lead, plus the hype machine that Elon Musk has created... it&#x27;s not surprising to me that Tesla is a very much sought-after stock. And unlike Wirecard or P&amp;R Containers, Tesla has actual cars on the road with government records certifying that number.')
