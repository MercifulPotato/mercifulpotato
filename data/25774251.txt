I am currently learning Forth from Leo Brodie&#x27;s excellent books &quot;Starting Forth&quot; and &quot;Thinking Forth&quot;. It actually changes the way you think. Just as Lisp does - almost a feeling of &quot;a new planet swims into his ken&quot;.<p>The main feature of the Forth style is to write lots of 1 to 2 line functions, in such a way that at the high-level, you have essentially a domain-specific language that looks like exactly what you want a program to look like - for example, &quot;RINSE WASH CYCLE SPIN STOP&quot; for a washing machine program, and &quot;RINSE WASH RINSE WASH CYCLE SPIN STOP&quot; for an extra clean option.<p>People claim that once you learn Forth, you start programming Forth-style in other languages like C, Python etc. I can already see the appeal.')
