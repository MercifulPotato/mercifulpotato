If the most compelling thing you can say about your position is that &quot;it is so weird and obtuse that only true open minds will not reject it&quot;, I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;re making a point here...<p>&gt;  But, I see science as an individual&#x27;s pursuit. I really mean it when I say that science is something one should verify personally.<p>Sure. But you can&#x27;t. You literally can&#x27;t. And since you can&#x27;t, it means, given this sentence, that you consider all science to be in the realm of belief.
