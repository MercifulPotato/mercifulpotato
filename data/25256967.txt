Item(by='rbrtl', descendants=3, kids=[25257760, 25257606, 25257637], score=2, time=1606760182, title='Ask HN: Apple Bias – Real or Imagined?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I think it&#x27;s apparent that discussions about Apple tend to be noticeably more polarising than similar posts about other Big Tech. I have got myself into some heated exchanges in the last couple of days. I was presented with the following claims (paraphrased):<p>HN commentary and commenters are biased in favour of Apple.<p>Only Apple has defenders in the community who counterclaim against negative assertions.<p>While I argue that this isn’t true, based on my (biased) opinion and minimal experience, I would like to know if others have experienced the same claim, wish to present evidence to back that claim, or could present a different take on the situation.<p>In responding to the original claim, I went rooting through posts on major tech companies looking for those favouring other giants, and I found some. Then I was reminded that I was looking for people speaking up in favour, to oppose detractors, and again I found evidence.<p>The search caused me to ask: can we prove, or disprove, that HN has a specific Apple bias? Whether it&#x27;s positive or negative, whether it&#x27;s stronger than bias around other tech companies?')
