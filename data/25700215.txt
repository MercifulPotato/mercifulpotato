Cardano is one of such project: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.cardano.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.cardano.org</a>. It&#x27;s still very experimental and won&#x27;t have smart contracts before March&#x2F;April of this year (likely to be later). The blockchain and their smart contract DSLs are implemented in Haskell, that will be interesting to see how that compare to what Ethereum is doing with Solidity.')
