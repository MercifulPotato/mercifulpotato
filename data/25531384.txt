I&#x27;m using such one (Kanex TB2 Express) with 2015 mbp.<p>--\nOn PC side, thunderbolt is handled by firmware, operating system has on say on it, it just sees devices pop on pcie bus (on Apple side, it is by Apple-supplied drivers). So the handling should be same for Windows and Linux. One of the few things it can do is configure security policies for TB3+.')
