Oddly, some of the places that the review jarred me most were in the way he called the lack of “originality” - Having seen (a cut, since there’s so many) the film, much of it’s aesthetic seems timeless by their inclusion. To the modern eye, they seem to hint at the cyclical nature of style. To Wells, it seemed lazy. Perhaps to Herr Lang, it was a reflection of how the more things changed the more they stay the same (or perhaps we need not be so charitable and accept Mr. Wells’ interpretation).')
