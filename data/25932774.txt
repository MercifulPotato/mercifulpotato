Reading through the notes of how NASA interacted with contractors was terrifying: here&#x27;s some money to study something. Turns out it was very subtly different from what NASA had intended them to study. Here&#x27;s more money to do another study. Now here&#x27;s money to build a prototype. Oh you&#x27;re 90% done and out of money? Here&#x27;s twice as much money. Oh now you&#x27;re 99% done and out of money? He&#x27;s the same amount again. Oh it doesn&#x27;t work but you can argue it&#x27;s NASA&#x27;s fault? Here&#x27;s more money to start over. You&#x27;re done? Actually we&#x27;re gonna scrap this particular mission objective now.<p>Space X owns something much close to an end-to-end objective: it&#x27;s not a study, or a build, it&#x27;s getting the thing to orbit, end of story. I think if you could set up the situation so that a company owns the end-to-end story of your health, things might be better off. That sounds more like Kaiser Permanente and my impression is that&#x27;s exactly what happened. In reality our healthcare system is typically more like Gemini: contractors, tons of regulations, but none of them really own the end result so it&#x27;s a public&#x2F;private mix of bureaucratic mess, misaligned incentives, and buck-passing.')
