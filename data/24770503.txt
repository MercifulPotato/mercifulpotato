Truly disappointing. Siri fails to recognize commands that work great on alexa or google, the features it does have often fail (if I transfer a podcast from playing on my phone to play on the homepod, my phone often fails to sync with the location of my homepod).<p>There&#x27;s no way I will buy one of these until I hear from multiple people I know that they have one and it&#x27;s truly amazing.<p>edit: typos')
