School is probably the best public invention to systematically distribute knowledge to the masses. Some like to point out &quot;dropouts&quot;, &quot;self-taught&quot; geniuses or the &quot;lucky few&quot; as models instead of exceptions to the rule.<p>2. Not everyone is self-motivated to learn. Children, at critical developmental ages, are more prone to be led astray than &quot;follow their passions&quot; (at this age, really?). They will more likely be manipulated by vices if not constantly monitored. Note: Even adults struggle to find their &quot;passion&quot;, good for the lucky few.<p>3. Not all parents are good teachers. Usually, responsible families understand the value proposition- they wish their children have a better future- and education is the most assured&#x2F;common ticket that provides these opportunities.<p>4. School&#x27;s purpose is not to teach obedience or even getting a job. It is there to teach us <i>critical thinking</i>, and consequently, how to be a good citizen. An educated population is also less prone to fall into totalitarianism. Ex: Nazi Germany and Mao&#x27;s China burned books and persecuted the educated (1984 style).<p>Public schools, with all its flaws, are the best instruments to free the masses. \nKnowledge is democratized power to avoid the corruption that absolute power entails.')
