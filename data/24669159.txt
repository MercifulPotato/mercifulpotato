Countries with chaotic and uncoordinated responses, like the US, are too chaotic and uncoordinated to collect good data for research as well. There are not coordinated, science-led countries that let a lot of people get it for research purposes. Countries like Italy and the UK that got overwhelmed just didn&#x27;t do this type of systematic research because they were busy. In the US some large insurance systems are doing research, but they&#x27;re not necessarily incentivized to share their knowledge or data.')
