It&#x27;s still well within living memory when a legitimately elected government tried to wipe out vast swathes of their populous because they had the audacity to be born into the wrong religion, sexual orientation, disabilities or political views.<p>People like Willem Arondeus are quite rightly seen as heroes. Can you imagine how much different things would have been if the Nazis were able to get not just everyone&#x27;s (semi) public facebook posts but all of their private messages as well and use that for targeting of undesirables?
