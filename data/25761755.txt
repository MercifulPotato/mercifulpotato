U.S. just created the environment where tech business can thrive and let the competition do the rest.</i><p>The US government has always been quite involved in the rise of their tech sector, from funding to being a customer. If you look into the history of Silicon Valley, for example, you find, as often in the US, the role of the military behind early technological developments and geographical location.<p>A recent example is also SpaceX. It would not exist without decades of government funding for space and without contracts to supply NASA.<p>So, yes the US created and maintained a good environment but they did help much more than that.')
