The list of articles by Matt Levine on Bloomberg has button at the end that loads 20 older articles, when you click on it. Now since Matt is on parental leave I want to read some older articles, let&#x27;s say from 2014.<p>Am I correct, that to do that I need to click 6 (years) * 200 (work days) &#x2F; 20 (articles per click) = 60 times and wait for the page load to do that?! Is there really no other way to access these articles? Aren&#x27;t they effectively unaccessible for most users because of that?<p>(I found a way to manipulate a JS variable to get to the older articles, but this is clearly not the inteded use.)<p>The same seems to be the case for the youtube videos of a very active vlogger. You can easily access current videos or the first ones, but not like from 4 years in the past.<p>I am asking this, because I always wonder if I am just to dumb to see the obvious easy way to use these sites or if there just is no way to do it?')
