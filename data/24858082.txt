I personally started by racking servers, doing desktop support and similar before moving on to system administration, programming etc. Having the ground up understanding especially when you&#x27;re supporting sales people for an end user product gives you great insights into the entire pipeline and flow of the system. Experiencing similar things at the juggernaut that as Google its hard not to end up with this sort of end to end understanding. I&#x27;m not sure how you give it to people in practice without actually making them do the work and go through all these stages or to at least be part of that process.<p>On a more personal level, I have always enjoyed building things from nothing whether it be bikes, PCs, systems.
