A slow fire maybe sometimes burns better. A place where everybody gets infected can maybe be more dangerous for visitors when you increase the time the infection is going on?!<p>Do masks help? \nDo they reduce immunity by eliminating some light contacts?\nDo they allow to transfer the virus without being infected? For sure you wouldn&#x27;t like to have doctors (treating e.g. Ebola patients) go shopping and exhaling through their contaminated masks.<p>Is there any epidemiological evidence that masks helped? \nData using &quot;reporting date&quot; often shows trend changes around mask measures. Taking a look at &quot;date of death&quot; data those trend changes usually are gone. Why is so little &quot;date of death&quot; data available?')
