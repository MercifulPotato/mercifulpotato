Because it doesn&#x27;t actually make any sense.  Twitter is a platform that allows pretty much anyone with an internet connection to post content.  There were, on average, 500 million tweets posted per day last year.<p>So on one side you have the set of potential content creators, churning out half a billion tweets per day, and that number will almost certainly continue to steadily increase.  So, as a company with a set amount of income, and who is beholden to its shareholders, what&#x27;s your plan to moderate 500 million tweets per day while still turning a reasonable profit?')
