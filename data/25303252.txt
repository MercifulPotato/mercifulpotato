They stem from two issues. First, that workers strikes are acceptable, and second that the infrastructure is often old and in disrepair.<p>The first reason is obviously cultural, but forbidding workers from striking would have some knock-on effects that the rest of society may not appreciate. The second reason, at least in Germany, has a lot to do with the semi-privatization of our train system which doesn&#x27;t have inventives to invest in it&#x27;s infrastructure and due it&#x27;s cozy market position enabling rent-seeking.<p>The first problem, at least in the cities, could be solved with grade 4 automated metro according to the example of Copenhagen. The trains even drive much better than human drivers there, with no abrupt stops.<p>This would create unemployment, but it wouldn&#x27;t infringe on people&#x27;s rights.<p>The second problem we would have to solve by replacing the politicians that enable this. A much more difficult undertaking.')
