Ignoring the vaccines that need two doses, vaccinating 300 million people at that rate will take 3,000 days = 100 months = 8.3 years.  At 1 million vaccinations&#x2F;day, we&#x27;re still looking at 300 days = 10 months.  Logistics is not my thing, but a tenfold increase in vaccations may be a little optimistic.  Better than an infinite wait, though.<p>I got a robocall from my regular pharmacy the other day, telling me that they would be involved in distributing covid vaccines &quot;soon&quot;.<p>So I am definitely going along with the main idea about acting as if everyone I know (or run into on the street) has tested positive.')
