I&#x27;ve had projects that were in Gitlab, Github and Sourcehut at the same time. Sure, depending on how you sync them, there may be some steps (eg getting people to push their local branches to another remote) when your main one becomes inaccessible, but overall its really easy to work across multiple remotes. Its something git was designed for, after all.')
