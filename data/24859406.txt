A large part of that has been rockchip&#x27;s been more open than other vendors recently, but its still AFAIK not as clean as you suggest.<p>As far as whether the celeron is better or worse power wise, I couldn&#x27;t answer. But for sure I wouldn&#x27;t make such sweeping statements. A lot of people think ARM=low power, but the power mgmt on these more &quot;open&quot; boards is actually quite bad. A large part of that is simply the fact that mainline linux is missing much of the finer points of controlling these boards. So, maybe the board could be X watt&#x27;s with a given workload, but due to the lack of frequency control on the memory controller (or whatever) it ends up being 5-10X. The intel boards tend to be much more dynamic at this point.<p>For example, comparing an rpi4 and an atomic pi, you wouldn&#x27;t expect from the massive heatsink on the atomicpi that it ends up being much lower power than the rpi4 for quite a number of workloads.')
