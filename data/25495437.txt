It was Wistron that was witholding and lowering wages, not Apple.<p>&gt; No doubt they respond with the usual &quot;When we worked with factories promising us cheap labour and massive profit we didn&#x27;t realise people and the planet would be exploited. No one could have known&quot;.<p>Again, wut? That cheap contract labor helped the Chinese middle class, and also helped China set up the most advanced technical manufatcuring pipeline and supply chain in the world, and now China is the first place the western world goes to make their stuff. No doubt that conditions were sometimes terrible (like creating nets around the building in case workers would try to commit suicide), but those workers (probably) got paid their promised wages and the China realized some benefit.<p>It&#x27;s not always <i>all exploitation</i> by Apple all day everyday. And again, those Indian folks are employed Wistron, not Apple.')
