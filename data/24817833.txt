It’s frustrating to read because it is at once ‘high level’ with cute diagrams, and then technical (“private key plus data into VRF gives a lottery”).<p>At any rate, it would be nice to see something written for a more technical user that’s not just a formal spec (although that would be okay, too.)<p>One salient question I have is: during the account choosing phase in which the VRF is applied to each account held in a given wallet, what is the precise mechanism by which some accounts are chosen? Is it a difficulty mechanism, where the VRF(account, some blockheader data) must be less than a given number? If so, how and why does the number change?')
