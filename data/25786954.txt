In the 90&#x27;s got really excited with x86, trying all the DOS&#x2F;BIOS interrupts and CGA&#x2F;EGA&#x2F;VGA&#x2F;VESA programming. Got a computer lab evacuated with a fake &quot;computer virus&quot; Mcafee AV couldn&#x27;t detect, a resident program that would display a snake moving on the screen. So much fun.<p>It would be great to get a book on the new M1 and MacOS services, specially if it includes some guide to their Neural Engine and GPU programming.')
