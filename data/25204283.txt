In macOS 10.15, the fast path for a retain on a (non-tagged-pointer) Obj-C object does a C11 relaxed atomic load followed by a C11 relaxed compare-and-exchange. This seems pretty standard for retain-release and I&#x27;d expect Rust&#x27;s Rc&lt;&gt; to be doing something similar. It&#x27;s possible Apple added some other black magic to the runtime in 10.16 (and they haven&#x27;t released the 10.16 objc sources yet) but it&#x27;s hard to imagine what they&#x27;d do that makes more sense than just optimizing for relaxed atomic operations.')
