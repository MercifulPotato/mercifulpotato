Uber Eats doesn&#x27;t engage in the practices this law is trying to curb since they already have agreements in place with the restaurants (AFAIK), so you won&#x27;t have to phone up anyone if you use Uber Eats.<p>If you&#x27;re taking about Uber the Taxi app, or some courier service, then this law doesn&#x27;t apply to them since they&#x27;re not &quot;food delivery platforms&quot;, and you can just ask them to order on your behalf without phoning anyone.<p>EDIT: Btw I&#x27;m not making any argument in favour or against the law, I&#x27;m just doing my best and trying to interpret it.')
