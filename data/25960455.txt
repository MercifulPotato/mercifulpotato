Redstone, as a thing that the developer created, is not on its own very complex. But the things that user can <i>make</i> with Redstone are insanely complex. That is not true for most gameplay in games, but it is true for Redstone in MC and Factorio in general. That&#x27;s not to belittle those things, they&#x27;re both great. But if you compare the dev time required to make Redstone in MC vs the dev time to make other stuff, other stuff frequently wins. Hell, I bet just making skeletons took more time than making Redstone. But obviously that doesn&#x27;t mean Skeletons allow for more interesting gaming than Redstone.<p>&quot;Simple gameplay&quot; does not mean that the experience of playing the game is simple. Chess has very simple gameplay (basically just: learning how 6 different piece types move, pieces capture each other, and protect the King) but the emergent complexity from those simple rules is truly impressive.<p>Compare this to say Monopoly, which has a lot more rules than chess, but is mind-numbingly <i>not</i> complex in terms of strategy and the overall play experience.<p>That is what linkdd is trying to say.')
