Item(by='greenyoda', descendants=None, kids=[24937593], score=None, time=1604009983, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24936017, text='&gt; the correspondence is essentially the editor giving a bunch of suggestions of how to improve the article<p>From the beginning of the first letter: &quot;Overall I think this piece can work best if it is significantly narrowed down to what you first discussed with Betsy â€” media criticism about liberal journalists not asking Biden the questions he should be asked more forcefully, and why they are failing to do that.&quot;<p>In other words, the editor is asking Greenwald to keep only the part about criticism of liberal journalists, and not publish the allegations against the Bidens. That&#x27;s not just a suggestion on how to improve the article - it&#x27;s asking him to remove a substantial part of the article.<p>&gt; Glenn at no point even brings up what his supposed contractual rights are<p>As for his contractual rights, he spells those out in his original article: &quot;to publish articles without editorial interference except in very narrow circumstances that plainly do not apply here&quot;. And: &quot;my separate contractual right with FLM regarding articles I have written but which FLM does not want to publish itself&quot;. Presumably, the editors would already be well aware that his contract allows him to be free of editorial interference - he&#x27;s one of the founders of The Intercept, not some obscure random journalist that the editors don&#x27;t know.')
