The only time productivity matters most is maybe small, bootstrapped businesses where cash isn&#x27;t infinite and actual value delivered is what matters. In fact, the company behind this is Basecamp which is almost an outlier in tech at this point, as they&#x27;re one of the few out there that actually makes its $$$ by selling products&#x2F;services people pay money for, as opposed to endless VC money or acquisitions.<p>When it comes to VC-funded crap or big legacy enterprise trying to &quot;modernise&quot; itself, over-engineering allows grifters to twist the situation for their own personal gain. The business problem the tech is supposed to solve often warrants a simple solution, but why would someone solve it with a simple solution and 3 people when they can bring Kubernetes, microservices, &quot;service mesh&quot;, blockchain and multiple programming languages to the mix and suddenly become an &quot;engineering manager&quot; managing 30 people, put big words on their resumes and speak at conferences about how they solve big (self-inflicted, as a side-effect of the overengineering) problems where more of their peers (either new and genuinely believing this is the proper way to do things - like I once was - or experienced enough to know this is BS but support it as it paves the way for their own career) encourage them?<p>This happens at multiple levels too, it&#x27;s not just developers or would-be engineering managers. The funding side of things is also broken in the sense that you&#x27;ll attract more investors and raise more money (some of which you&#x27;ll keep in your pocket as salary, even if the company folds in the end) if you throw big words and pitch an over-engineered solutions such as blockchain as opposed to a simple and proven one (even though the latter is more likely to actually pay off).')
