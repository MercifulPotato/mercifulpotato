Like &quot;pretentious&quot; or &quot;elitist&quot; has become? Nobody is saying that people with crutches shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to walk.<p>edit: It&#x27;s so strange to not only demand the right to not know how to do something without a complicated tool (a right which is inalienable and not threatened), but to also demand that people who do know how to do that thing not think that it is better to know how to do that thing. I get that when one has invested their time into a tool they want to defend its usage, but people who aren&#x27;t dependent on a particular vendor&#x27;s tool have also invested time, and should be able to think it&#x27;s better to not be dependent on a particular vendor without it being considered violence or bullying (in the modern twitter sense.)')
