On the one hand that&#x27;s a problem because it stifles reporting, on the other hand they have been playing very loose and saying &quot;oops, sorry, we&#x27;ll do better next time, promise&quot; every time doesn&#x27;t work.<p>That one flip-flops in my head all the time.  Maybe the idea of reduced liability or a higher bar for proving libel &#x2F; slander in a civil suit against a publisher might be an option, but with _some_ exposure to liability.  There has to be a threshold where high quality publishers could bear the costs of honest mistakes, but bad actors would be overwhelmed financially.')
