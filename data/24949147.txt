As self driving cars take over, you could imagine pedestrians knowing that the cars won&#x27;t hit them (and nobody will get out and yell), and walking into traffic. On some cases that&#x27;s probably fine - why have lights anymore in a sparse suburb? In a place like NYC though I could see traffic just stopping.')
