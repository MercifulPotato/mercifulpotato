Either for food, or for research, unless you can propose another explanation?<p>&gt; The bats carrying CoV ZC45 were originally found in Yunnan or Zhejiang province, both of which were more than 900 kilometers away from the seafood market. Bats were normally found to live in caves and trees. But the seafood market is in a densely-populated district of Wuhan, a metropolitan of ~15 million people. The probability was very low for the bats to fly to the market. According to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors, the bat was never a food source in the city, and no bat was traded in the market.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;r4Yac" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;r4Yac</a><p>Now, I don&#x27;t suggest that the virus was created in the lab, or deliberately leaked. But it had to be brought into Wuhan somehow. I just don&#x27;t consider it dismissible, yet, that an inadvertent leak from the lab could have been the cause. I look forward to all new evidence that may emerge.<p>If the market was indeed the cause, then in the interests of global safety, wild animal markets of this nature should be prohibited.')
