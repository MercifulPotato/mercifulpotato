Most startups fail or take too long to get acquired and, unless you’re a founder&#x2F;invested, you’re not seeing the really big amounts that make it really worth it (and sometimes even then). Fundamentally the challenge is that as a regular employee (even early) your stake is too small. I think startups can attract talent more easily by taking the salary disparity and matching it with stock (ie if you’re making 300k and the startup is paying 150k, for the first few years the startup should treat you like you’re investing at least 100k into the company because that is what you’re doing with your time).<p>As an anecdote, I have a friend who was working at a startup that got acquired by Google recently (he’s a Staff SWE so he’s making really good salary). He noted if he had just stayed at Google instead of working at a few startups over the years he would have been at least break-even or better based on salary + google RSU performance over that time. My personal experience with startups was a bit different. While the acquisition I went through was larger for me at the time, the biggest impact was that it pushed me into a far higher salary band. Startups and smaller companies can be a better way to “level up” some times than the traditional corporate ladder climbing.')
