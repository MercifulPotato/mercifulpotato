People think it&#x27;s impossible to rewrite, but I believe it&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s a mess. Inventing a new programming language and new DOM api that works greatly with webassembly probably worth it, consider that the next 10 years the web is still not going anywhere. You may laugh at Flash .. but hey do you love &quot;hydration&quot; thing? I&#x27;d love to have an isomorphic?(terrible name) template engine that rendered as text as well as client program binary. Do you love OS based form control that can&#x27;t be styled? I&#x27;d love a complete separate controls from OS, clean the contract between widget and actual system api. Just stop caring (coercing) how it looks, just provide api to enforce how its functionality works, we already have these bunch of aria- thing.<p>The question is what block the progress of making it complete, what kind of problem? I believe it&#x27;s not a technical problem. Maybe incentive?')
