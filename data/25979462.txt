For example when I configure nginx + a service, if it works in my local env, I have to run one command and I&#x27;ll have the same in prod, and I don&#x27;t have to debug in the server. Also is useful to keep track of the OS dependencies.<p>But it ends up being a matter of preference, I could still do it without it, but I&#x27;m used to it now, for some reason I feel that it makes my systems more &quot;reproducible&quot; in a simpler way.')
