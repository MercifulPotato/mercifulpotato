Item(by='CaptArmchair', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609015293, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545877, text='&gt; ignores how participating is dehumanizing even as its purpose is to serve the people<p>I feel this is a bit strong worded. I think this gets into the realm of worker&#x2F;employer relationship.<p>Regardless, as an employee, you are always subject to the authority of the owner of the business, or in public context, the interests of the public. If you want agency and freedom, then the way forward would be starting an independent, private venture.<p>&gt; unneeded<p>I think that&#x27;s in the eye of the beholder. I don&#x27;t contend the merits of bcrypt over other algorithms. And I&#x27;m just as sensitive as the next person that technology often moves faster then large and complex state machinery.<p>But when you decide to be part of such a machinery, you very much accept that your own role comes with limits and boundaries. And that your sphere of influence only extends so far.<p>&gt; decision making carries risks<p>The inherent risk is erosion of the legitimacy of a public institution. That legitimacy is protected through showing public accountability, and transparency in decision making.<p>Remember, public institutions don&#x27;t exist on their own accord. The budget they receive comes with public oversight. And that budget isn&#x27;t private either. OP&#x27;s salary is paid for by taxpayers, and as such, OP needs to work in such a way that their decision making process can be scrutinized when asked.<p>Legitimacy is, when it comes down to it, a murky concept based on trust, confidence, integrity, honesty, reliability, equability and so on. But, more important, all of that is always in the eye of the beholder. These are subjective concepts. And they can easily be pulled apart.<p>A good analogy of how that fails is what happened to Boeing&#x27;s 737 Max debacle. How the integrity of the R&amp;D process broke down and, ultimately, led to the deaths of dozens. Boeing lost its most valuable asset: its credibility as reliable aviation manufacturer.<p>The difference between Boeing and the U.S Public Adminstration as that the latter literally governs and serves an entire nation of 330 million citizens.<p>In this specific case, OP&#x27;s system will be - arguably - weaker, but that&#x27;s the traded off against avoiding a potential scenario where system engineers are left free to make their own decisions with little to no public oversight, which would be far harder to defend to the general public - all 330 million - in terms of accountability in case of a breakdown. The latter would simply perceive that as a violation of their constitutional rights.<p>The attacks caused by the Solar Winds security failure this month are a good example of that. This is an analysis from the Congress Research Service stating exactly that. It refers to operational procedures and reiterates where accountability lays, and refers to the complexities and challenges of managing cybersecurities.
