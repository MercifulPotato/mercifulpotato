Book: Nonviolent Communication, by Marhsall Rosenberg PhD.  Great things are built by teams.  The more senior I become, the greatest challenges involve teamwork, and the programming is the easy part.  I&#x27;ve read countless leadership and self help books, but the simple concepts in just the first few chapters were absolutely transformative to me.<p>2. The Fast AI for coders course and associated book. (Maybe this shouldn&#x27;t be on this list, because it&#x27;s free, but it&#x27;s still the absolute best place to learn machine learning from scratch.) This is a book and a set of videos that go over the same material.  I work on a team of data scientists, and using information from the first few chapters of this book I&#x27;ve done things that are far beyond the capabilities of my teammates.  Unlike most courses, this starts with practical knowledge you can use to do useful work on day 1.  Then later it moves into the theory of how it works.  You don&#x27;t need more than high school math to get going.<p>3. The Coursera Deep Learning Specialization, a set of 5 AI courses.  Has a certification you can use on your resume and LinkedIn.')
