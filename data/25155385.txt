Not saying these libraries aren&#x27;t *useful,&quot; but community feels like a more real-time (if not necessarily synchronous) endeavour.<p>In that sense, what made the early internet cool on the community front were things like listservs or maybe even AOL rooms (I didn&#x27;t experience those but I&#x27;ve heard about lasting friendships emerging). These were places where you could find a tribe and connect in a dedicated space.<p>Twitter feels too public for this to be natural, and I suppose Facebook groups have some elements of this but are on Facebook and diluted by all the other dross of the platform.<p>I think the emergence of membership communities is actually the next wave of this and likely a better solution. These communities are by definition walled gardens where anonymity is less valuable and the tools to support them work better when there&#x27;s more of a sense of conversation.<p>I&#x27;m not saying people don&#x27;t do this on forums or Reddit, just that those seeking community can do better.')
