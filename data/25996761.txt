An example, in a modern car I recently purchased, there are settings in the head unit for a bunch of personalization aspects of the head unit...<p>To change settings on the ADAS behavior, you have to use buttons on the wheel to control a menu that appears directly above the steering wheel: The entertainment unit has no ability to control settings for vehicle motion-related behaviors, so you have to deal with a less friendly menu that isn&#x27;t touch capable to set them.<p>This is also why Tesla is particularly unique (reckless?) in pushing OTA updates which can change the car&#x27;s driving behavior. Nobody else would use OTAs that way, and most OTA-capable hardware in cars can&#x27;t actually interact with driving behavior components.')
