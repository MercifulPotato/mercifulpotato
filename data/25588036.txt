I only brought up the question because this is the second paragraph of the original comment in this sub-thread:<p>&gt;Would it be possible or plausible that singularity actually does not exist, but just that the theory of general relativity is not a correct description of space&#x2F;time&#x2F;matter in small scale? I am thinking in classical theory, when things were treated as point mass&#x2F;charges, infinity exist in the solution of point sources.<p>Basically, I wasn&#x27;t sure why they were getting so much criticism for this, because it sounded pretty reasonable to me.')
