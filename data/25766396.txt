I&#x27;m starting my ninth class this term. Here&#x27;s my take...<p>Pros:<p>- video lectures are generally pretty polished, and include animations and other visual aids to help build intuition<p>- the course material is mostly high quality. this is the same material that on-site graduate students are presented, and the graded projects are challenging.<p>- there is opportunity to interact with other students and TAs: online message board, video office hours, unofficial Slack, etc.<p>- flexible enough to schedule around a full-time job<p>- inexpensive compared to in-person programs (the entire program with 10 courses is $7-$8k)<p>Cons:<p>- quality of materials, TAs, and organization can vary from course to course and term to term<p>- harder to build relationships &#x2F; network than in-person programs<p>- it&#x27;s course-based by default. you can pursue a research-based degree but it&#x27;s nonstandard.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Georgia_Tech_Online_Master_of_Science_in_Computer_Science" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Georgia_Tech_Online_Master_of_...</a>')
