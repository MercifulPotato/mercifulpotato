The same servers (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org</a>) are used for all Python versions, and they keep old versions of packages around. If everything works as it should (which, to be fair, it might not :) ), pip running on Python 2 ought to find the latest Python 2-compatible version of packages, including the latest Python 2-compatible version if itself if you ask it to upgrade itself.<p>It&#x27;s theoretically possible that the API used could change in a way that old versions of pip can&#x27;t handle, but a) the API is super simple and there isn&#x27;t a strong reason to do this and b) doing that would break the ability of old versions of pip to upgrade themselves - that is, for released versions of Python with bundled pip to work - so they&#x27;re very unlikely to break the existing interface, even if they add a new one.<p>Still, since PyPI is a free service with no support contracts, and especially because <i>packages hosted</i> on PyPI are uploaded by the individual volunteer authors who have the ability to delete old versions of their own packages, businesses who depend on Python 2 would be well-advised to download&#x2F;mirror what they need locally to ensure continuity of business.')
