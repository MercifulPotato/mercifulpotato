When I think of scrypt, I think of the Litecoin and the numerous &quot;altcoins&quot; that use scrypt that were forked from Litecoin in late 2013&#x2F;early 2014.<p>I know that Litecoin used scrypt to harden it against GPU&#x2F;ASIC mining, but GPU&#x2F;ASIC miners ended up coming out anyways.  With this in mind, is scrypt actually a better option than bcrypt?')
