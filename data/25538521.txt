My father has an old Galaxy Note 3 Neo (Dual Sim edition). That particular model never got any updates at all, so it was stuck on the release Android 4.3.<p>While it&#x27;s old, it actually fulfills all his needs very well and he has little need for a newer phone... but he can&#x27;t get new apps, because all of them require at least Android 5.0 (regular Note 3 &#x2F; Note 3 Neo Single Sim got the update to 5, but not the dual sim). And the applications that are already on the device (Google stuff) actually no longer gets updates, and occasionally pops up &quot;This version is too old! You have to update!&quot; warnings that he can do nothing about..')
