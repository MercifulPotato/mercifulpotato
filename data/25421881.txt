Knowing about different products that can help you is actually really good. Sure you can get this information from friends and word-of-mouth, but it&#x27;s not always accurate, and there is nothing wrong with using advertisements too. Plus, there are some advertisements that are genuinely works of art.<p>Even personalized ads are good if they&#x27;re done in a way that ensures your privacy is safe. It would be awesome if Steam could find me some video games that are actually interesting.<p>The problem is a lot of current advertising is completely broken. It&#x27;s been said a lot before, but: companies making you watch ad after ad that you&#x27;re just not going to buy, ads encouraging me to ignore them because they&#x27;re ugly and make it harder to see content, advertisers that are so obnoxious and bad at advertising their products that I&#x27;m <i>less</i> inclined to buy them. Idk how this kind of crap advertising actually gets companies more money, but I guarantee it&#x27;s not &quot;subtly influencing&quot; me to buy &quot;Slots Royale&quot; or fake medicine, or even Geico - and I know I have human biases and distortions. Also, ad tracking which takes all of my data and doesn&#x27;t even work.<p>Idk what the current trend is but I&#x27;ve heard that advertisements are generating less and less revenue. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if, as population the gets more tech-savvy, ads will be forced to change &#x2F; die out because so few people actually use them. Or at least get better at advertising.')
