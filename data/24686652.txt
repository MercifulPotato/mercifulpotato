Certain publications and politicians - starting I think with the Times - pushed the narrative that this was the real number of people being tested, and that the reason it was so far below the stated capacity was because the real capacity was far lower than the Government claims: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;n3Yku" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;n3Yku</a> This was bullshit on multiple levels - there are several important uses of testing, like routine screening of NHS frontline staff and hospital patients being admitted and discharged, that result in people being retested who&#x27;ve been tested at some point previously, and those obviously use actual testing capacity on people who haven&#x27;t been tested that day or week. (Testing two samples from the same person in short succession, on the other hand, is unusual and not general policy.) Not only that, the people tested number is from pillar 1 and 2 testing in England only for the week ending the 2nd of September, whereas the capacity figure seems to be for all pillars in the entire UK at around the 12th or 13th. It makes absolutely no sense to compare them. And the cherry on the top is that I&#x27;m pretty sure this number is from before the problems with test shortages and testing delays that they&#x27;re implying it explains.<p>The not-so-secret weekly report in question with the number of people tested for the first time is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;publications&#x2F;nhs-test-and-trace-england-and-coronavirus-testing-uk-statistics-27-august-to-2-september-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;publications&#x2F;nhs-test-and-trac...</a>')
