All of those are viable choices (except the ones that literally don&#x27;t exist anymore), and there were many more viable choices before FAANG began their dominance that consumers saw and abandoned in favor of the dominant products we have today.<p>Not that I don&#x27;t know how you feel, there are areas where I hate all the options too.
