Very visible people have been talking about it, including the outgoing President, who mentioned the mental health costs of lockdown multiple times.  Leaving aside the fact that even true things that Trump says are discounted due to his lunacy, most people are too dim to understand the concept of trade-offs, so anything that gives &quot;aid and comfort to the enemy&quot; is systematically downplayed among most of those that are pro-Covid-restrictions (I say all of this as someone who think that restrictions have tragic costs but are necessary).<p>That is to say, the problem isn&#x27;t that no one has thought of factoring this into decisions, it&#x27;s that the discourse upstream of policy is driven largely by the majority of voters that don&#x27;t actually care about pandemic policy as anything other than another wedge issue to fight pre-existing cultural&#x2F;religious wars over.')
