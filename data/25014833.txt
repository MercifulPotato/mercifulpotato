When I was less experienced I introduced a lot of technologies to the companies I was working for. I thought I&#x27;m doing the right thing. If I were fully honest I just thought these tools are amazing and I wanted to have a play with them. Over the years I learned that I was wrong a lot of the time. I introduced kubernetes to a company that never really had the need for it. It wasn&#x27;t the right move for them. I didn&#x27;t fully understand the business. I think, as developers, it&#x27;s important to develop balanced views and get better at decision making. It&#x27;s important to not focus on tech too much but understand the business implications and derive the strategy from that.')
