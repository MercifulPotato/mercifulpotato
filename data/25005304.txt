It&#x27;s literally an order of magnitude difference, and contracting hourly rates seems like a similar story.<p>I would happily pay 3-5x the taxes for a similar salary to emigrate, but if you offer me 1&#x2F;10 the pay? That&#x27;s tough. It makes me feel like there isn&#x27;t a big market for my services across the pond.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, because I love tech and I lean heavily left. But this has been the case for at least the past decade, and it shows no sign of stopping.')
