Does this thing have a name?<p>GHB would be the natural acronym and that would be a terrible idea.<p>P.S. Thank you HN for being a place where I can ask this question and knowing people get it. I appreciate the feeling of community.\nP.P.S. If you&#x27;re reading this and thinking: PURDAH. Call me')
