It looks like there have been so many people wanting to switch, that Signal was overwhelmed by the new demand.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it is true, but for your peers it certainly is a different story to tell them about all the people who are switching than just about a service who had an outage. Hopefully, the next days will bring some light to the cause of the outage.')
