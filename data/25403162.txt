I do need to run ffmpeg&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;pulseaudio to record sessions, which has been problematic on Ubuntu in the past, but it seems to work reliably on Ubuntu 20. I also have many customers running my service on their Ubuntu servers, so it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen, Ubuntu 20 is probably going to be simpler to set up than Centos 8, as (I think) it has many of the required packages such as ffmpeg without needing to add epel and various other third party repos. It also doesn&#x27;t have selinux, which I generally need to turn off on Centos (after spending a lot of time trying unsuccessfully to get everything working properly with it).<p>My only issue with Ubuntu LTS is the shorter 5-year lifecycle.<p>Perhaps by this time next year there will be some alternative repo that we can simply switch to in Centos 8 so that it just continues as-is, without us needing to take the risk of upgrading everything to a completely new distro.')
