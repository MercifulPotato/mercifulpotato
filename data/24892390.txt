Along my normal driving routes I had seen quite a few, but over the past few weeks they have mostly been taken down (in every case, other republican candidate signs still stand). Scenario one, Trump supporters supported him all the way up until now, enough to donate to his re-election campaign to buy a yard sign, and in the final weeks of the election, decided that they&#x27;d had enough and taken down their signs. Scenario two, some random stranger decided that it&#x27;s their right, nay, their responsibility, to moderate someone else&#x27;s yard signs.<p>Not every Trump voter is a &quot;Proud Boy&quot; or noted white supremacist, maybe even some of your friends are who &quot;just aren&#x27;t interested in politics&quot; because they know that if they were honest with you, you would flip out. Some understand that this attitude about yard signs is actually representative of an entire worldview, and opposing that might actually be the lesser of two evils.')
