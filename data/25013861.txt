Item(by='zozbot234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604738446, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25008554, text='The nice thing about early microcomputer BASIC is that it was a &quot;clean&quot; extension of a desk calculator interface. You could input simple computations at the REPL, preceded by a &#x27;?&#x27; sign (the abbreviated token for the PRINT command) and they would be performed using floating point arithmetic. (Those softfloat routines took up a <i>lot</i> of space in home computer ROM!) The UX was thus perhaps rather inelegant compared to something more principled like FORTH, but it would&#x27;ve been quite appealing to many novice users seeking to make some use of their newly-bought machine - back then, such users would&#x27;ve been expected to learn programming and develop their own programs on the machine itself.<p>Of course those computers also had worthwhile graphics and sound capabilities, but typically those were machine-specific and programmed by dealing with the memory-mapped hardware directly, even in BASIC. (There were special instructions PEEK(addr) and POKE addr, val for this purpose.)  Similarly, other instructions (SYS, USR()) were used for calling custom machine-language routines either from ROM or user-loaded code - which could be plenty useful since BASIC itself, being interpreted, was relatively slow.')
