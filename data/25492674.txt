I did spend perhaps 15-20 minutes exploring the web site and Git repo. I found the &quot;how?&quot; and &quot;why?&quot; but I was having trouble coming up with valid, &quot;real world&quot; use cases for PJON and wasn&#x27;t finding a lot of examples. I was impressed by all of the (minimal) hardware and mediums&#x2F;transports that could be used -- I just couldn&#x27;t think of what to actually <i>do with it</i>!<p>I&#x27;ve just recently started to become interested in &quot;home automation&quot;, though -- mostly because I&#x27;m a geek and, as I looked around, I realized that there&#x27;s so much data that I could be gathering and things that I could be controlling and&#x2F;or interacting with or, at the least, monitoring.<p>Knowing what others are using PJON for is enlightening, however, and is giving me ideas and inspiration. Hopefully I&#x27;ll think things through and come up with a real plan before I go on a shopping spree and end up with <i>even more</i> piles of electronics laying around!<p>Thanks again -- to you and the others -- for taking the time to enlighten me!<p>(On a side note, I sincerely feel that it&#x27;s a shame that your &quot;Show HN&quot; got flagged and I apologize on behalf of HN. I can only say that, like anything else, it isn&#x27;t perfect and odd things can happen at times. At the least, though, your submission <i>was</i> successful in making PJON more widely known!)')
