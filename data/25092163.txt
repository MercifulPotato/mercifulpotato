This is thanks to simple yet powerful Go syntax, which doesn&#x27;t allow constructing implicitly executed code. I.e. it doesn&#x27;t support the following &quot;features&quot; from other programming languages, which instantly increase code complexity because it becomes impossible to understand the code by just reading it top down:<p>* Operator overloading<p>* Function overloading<p>* Constructors and destructors<p>* Implicit type conversion<p>* Implicit types (classes)<p>Go also doesn&#x27;t support type templates and function templates yet (aka generics or contracts). This also plays significant role in easy-to-read Go code.<p>P.S. I wrote many packages and apps in Go during the last 10 years [1] and I absolutely love Go!
