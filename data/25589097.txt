The people of Flint were under emergency management appointed by the governor, rather than local elected officials. The emergency managers switched municipal water supplies to save money. They also failed to treat the water to prevent the leaching of the lead into the drinking to save $140 a day. The water was contaminated with Legionella also, though, and that killed a dozen people. It was so bad local manufacturers had to get emergency waivers to switch back to the old water because it was corroding metal parts.')
