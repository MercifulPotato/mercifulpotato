The &quot;search&quot; you are talking about is simply plain sight&#x2F;smell&#x2F;etc. A cop writing a parking ticket can look through the window of your car and run the plates to see if it&#x27;s stolen, lacking registration, etc. In either case they need probable cause to do an actual search of your vehicle.<p>Not to mention, they can stop (in most states) you even if you didnt commit a crime, like at a DUI checkpoint.')
