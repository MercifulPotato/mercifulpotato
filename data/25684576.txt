(Bought X once, sold X once)<p>Assuming X drops to 0, wouldn&#x27;t people that have BTC just use another coin X&#x27; to get back to USD?<p>Assuming company Y creates X out of thin air and buys BTC with it, why doesn&#x27;t X drop in value? Because arbitrageurs buy it? So arbitrageurs have lots of X? Should I care if they go broke in the process?')
