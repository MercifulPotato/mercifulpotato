First, games are significantly faster (10 minutes instead of 30, plus no setup&#x2F;teardown), but more importantly, it eliminates the need to constantly shuffle your cards. If you play this game in person, you have to deal with these annoying factors, which I admit may detract from the experience. Then again, this is a flaw common to most Eurogames, so take from that what you will.<p>I play board games exclusively in physical form. The moment you are playing using computer, your competition suddenly grows enormously and some of your design choices become flawed (because e.g. keeping state is hard for people and trivial for computers). I don&#x27;t believe board games can win that competition.<p>The physical form has its unique appeal: tactile experience, being offline and distraction free, no stupid sign up requirements etc.<p>Of course I realise there will be some that disagree with me, but that is fine!')
