Item(by='dxdm', descendants=None, kids=[25594981], score=None, time=1609416942, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25591076, text='&gt; If those workers were capable of earning enough money to no longer be eligible for public benefits, they would choose to take those jobs instead.<p>It seems weird to me to accept it quasi as a law of nature that large parts of the population get paid below subsistence level for their work, often doing physically or emotionally hard labor, while others earn big in bullshit-rich environments.<p>I get that we need some sort of market for effective allocation of resources. But  seeing how rich western societies are as a whole, while still giving many of their members trouble with feeding themselves, housing and (in some countries) getting adequate medical care, makes me wonder how far we&#x27;ve really come with finding a good way to distribute wealth adequately.<p>Saying that &quot;the market forces&quot; don&#x27;t allow people to make enough money to get by seems like such a cop-out to me. Yes, public benefits are a way of redistributing wealth for a better outcome, but let&#x27;s not forget that the market is a human creation and we can influence how it operates in multiple ways.<p>If public benefits subsidize cheap labor in exchange for cheaper consumer prices, that is (as has been pointed out) a way of shifting some of the price off the product to be paid via taxes, externalizing some of the cost to the general public, incurring a human cost on the people who provide the labor, while allowing private investors to take a share of the transfer as their profit. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the most effective way of distributing resources here, but let&#x27;s not forget that we might not only want to optimize for money making potential here, but also for harder to price things like the pursuit of happiness.')
