The post makes this quite clear and the author and others have pointed out this distinction to you multiple times here. Just because you made an inference and argued against it doesn&#x27;t mean the article was making such an implication.<p>Your second point is certainly arguable and does represent a substantive disagreement with the post unlike your first comment. I think the post makes a solid case that gratuitous use of newtype absent any abstraction boundary is an anti-pattern that provides little benefit if conversions are done ad hoc.\nSprinkling on some newtype can certainly help some cases, but the post encourages critical thinking about these issues and explores where this reasoning falls down. If your claim is that critical thinking gets in the way of cargo-culting approaches that lead to &quot;nominal&quot; type safety then you would be right. Your last parenthetical doesn&#x27;t seem like a reasonable response of someone who has read and understood this post. The post specifically encourages the use of newtype with abstraction boundaries where practical and works through an example.')
