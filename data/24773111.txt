Remember that as recently as the early 1970s, it was broadly promoted, almost as a nootropic. In my home town in Australia it was common to add spoonfuls of sugar over breakfast cereal, Nutella and Milo (chocolate milk drink) were promoted as healthy sports foods for children, and a tablespoon of sugar (I know!!) was promoted as a good way to fix hiccups. My mother was ostracised by the other mothers at my school (in the early 00&#x27;s, not the 70s) for not giving me Nutella, Chocolates, Lollies etc in my lunch.<p>I&#x27;m not making excuses here - it&#x27;s more that unless you come from a privileged or niche background, especially before the internet, you would think this is normal.
