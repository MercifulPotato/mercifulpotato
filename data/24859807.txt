Waiting for my backpack, I saw something that blew my mind: locals who arrived with  me taking all kinds of TVs, ovens etc. from the conveyor belts.<p>It never occurred to me that you can fly somewhere, buy big stuff and have them checked in as your baggage. It&#x27;s not something I ever saw in Europe&#x27;s airports.<p>(Not sure if reason was more the price, or lack of availability of goods; probably a mix of the two.)')
