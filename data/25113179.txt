From impartial sources?<p>I&#x27;m honestly skeptical of the claim based on my life experience. I&#x27;ve heard directly from people of numerous of terrible errors that destroyed their lives. e.g. bone implants that were poisonous, different implants that weren&#x27;t sterilized properly, forced saving of patient life to charge&#x2F;steal his assets instead of passing to family - direct from people I know well, that happened to them.<p>Then I&#x27;ve personally experienced a common pattern of doctors not being able to identify things that weren&#x27;t common or obvious based on their flowchart style diagnosis. I&#x27;ve also experienced a lot of successful diagnosis of simpler obvious issues.')
