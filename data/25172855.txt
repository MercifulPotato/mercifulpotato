But I am personally also always weary to put stuff in online services, that&#x27;s why I made it all open source: other than observable actually all the pieces are there (including editor and offline support), not just runtime&#x2F;parser. You can download the files and check them into git, and edit them, and host them trivially. There&#x27;s no &quot;download all&quot; button yet but if there&#x27;s a demand for that why not :)<p>* Private notebooks make a lot of sense, and perhaps this is where it can be a viable product as well instead of just a useful open source tool? I have plenty of runway, but still it would be more sustainable if it could eventuallu pay my rent.. Similar to the (old) github model I mean (pay for team features &#x2F; private notebooks you can share with some) with some reasonable limits? \nMy main goal right now is to raise awareness for it. I think many many web developers especially would find the notebook paradigm really useful, but how do I show that?<p>* A lot of stuff.. auto save, I store every revision but currently you only can retrieve the latest, social features (e.g. recent notebooks, avatars), actual documentation (in notebooks of course).<p>If you have ideas or thoughts on where I should take this, do reach out!
