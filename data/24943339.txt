Not all of them will close, maybe some of them will be archived, maybe moved to other domains, maybe cached somewhere. But having a lot of content under paywall, without any license on the code shared (or at least I don&#x27;t know about it) is not creating a comfortable feeling for myself.<p>Of course if the purpose is to monetize then maybe Medium is the right place.')
