Item(by='d33lio', descendants=None, kids=[24726496], score=None, time=1602183280, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24705212, text='I have not, only since the latest &quot;health supplements&quot; scam of our time is exactly these kinds of &quot;healthy mushroom boosters&quot;.  Claiming all kinds of insane health benefits from &quot;mushroom extract&quot; etc.  But wrapping it in an earthy Goop-esque marketing cascade targeting rich house-wives and wall street types.  You&#x27;d be surprised how much BS wall street types fall for (even when something is just priced idiotically high), for instance Molekule air purifiers (literally fake science and work half as well as a $12 HEPA filter) and anything made by Dyson haha.')
