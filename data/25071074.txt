Item(by='fpig', descendants=None, kids=[25071503, 25071217], score=None, time=1605196098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25068800, text='If you need a computer for serious (long hours) use, I would always go for desktop, as you can get a vastly superior machine to any laptop, with massive amounts of disk space, memory, tons of cores, screens, etc. If you want a Mac, I&#x27;m not familiar with desktop Macs but I&#x27;m guessing the Mac Pro machines blow laptops out of the water the same way high end desktop PCs do.<p>For travelling, I don&#x27;t think anything beats a Macbook due to how light, thin, and resilient they are. But my 2016 MBP is a pretty shit machine for its price. It&#x27;s also loud (like every other laptop I&#x27;ve had). I avoid using it. Sure, if you take size&#x2F;design&#x2F;mechanical quality into account, it is probably unmatched. But for 95% of my computer usage, those are irrelevant, as I just sit at my desk. I had a company provided HP laptop (not sure if stock or upgraded by our IT staff) at my previous job which was far more performant than my Macbook, so I don&#x27;t really agree that Windows laptops are necessarily bad, but it was even louder than the Macbook, and of course clunky and ugly.<p>For me personally, the new Macbooks are disqualified as viable work machines if it&#x27;s really true that you can&#x27;t use more than 1 external screen. That&#x27;s just not a viable computer for me (for work). I will always have a Macbook though just because of how much I love them for travel. But a Macbook is more of a toy than a serious computer, especially if the 1 screen limit is true.')
