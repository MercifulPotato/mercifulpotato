Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[24872953, 24872245, 24872906, 24873290], score=None, time=1603469615, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869741, text='&gt; Occasionally, though, conspiracy theorists escape the harmless fringe and become actively harmful to society<p>To some degree, of both &quot;frequency of escape&quot; and &quot;magnitude of harm&quot;, both of which are valid variables to be considered <i>within the aggregate of all(!) variables</i> related to conspiracy theories (of which these are but two, contrary to popular consensus).<p>&gt; A racist conspiracy theory that posited, contrary to all evidence, that our previous president was born in another country, combined with some conspiracy theories popular among &quot;the Tea Party movement&quot; as they were known, <i>propelled our current president into office</i>, where the theories have snowballed and escalated into shots fired in a pizza parlor, protesters murdered by car, protestors murdered by gun, illegal voter intimidation, and a significant chunk of the population not quite ruling out the possibility that a huge chunk of elected officials and others are part of a cabal of devil-worshipping pederasts who drink the blood of children.<p>This is an interesting sentence, and certainly a popular story.  The interesting part is that it uses epistemology as a tool for dismissal (&quot;contrary to all evidence&quot;), but then proceeds to assert <i>several other</i> complex ideas that involve coordinated behavior between multiple people (there&#x27;s a word for this sort of thing:  <i>conspiracy theory</i>), and does so <i>with no concern whatsoever for whether evidence actually (and entirely) supports it</i>.<p>&gt; There are people on this page, right here at HN, stating misleading nonsense tangentially related to QAnon. The spread of this stuff is pervasive already.<p>There are various forms of misleading nonsense on this page.  For example, numerous people asserting that QAnon, and conspiracy theories (conspiracy theorists) in general, &quot;are&quot; or &quot;believe&quot; certain things.  If one pays close attention to these threads every time they appear on HN (or elsewhere, be it social media or formal media), one may notice that the asserted descriptions are always very vague, and always <i>only</i> include the very worst&#x2F;silliest of ideas that exist within the communities - very often, ideas that <i>really don&#x27;t have high consensus agreement in the actual communities themselves</i>.  And again, with no with no concern whatsoever for whether the assertions <i>are actually true</i>.<p>The same talking points can be observed in every thread on these subjects, but one talking point you will <i>rarely</i> make an appearance:  <i>what is actually true</i>?  What is the <i>actual(!)</i> truth of what is discussed&#x2F;believed among <i>actual</i> conspiracy theorists, as well as what is the <i>actual(!)</i> truth of <i>of each discrete idea (and the sub-ideas within each</i>)?<p>It is very concerning to me how easily such a powerful subconscious heuristic can be mass installed into the minds of the populace, <i>even those of the relatively competent critical thinkers here on HN</i>.  This heuristic is roughly:<p><i>if [an idea has been labelled a Conspiracy Theory], then therefore [the epistemic status is FALSE]</i><p>How often does the output of this heuristic make an appearance (as a rhetorical, unchallenged axiom) in this thread (and in all others)?  I would say: extremely frequently.<p>How often does the fundamentally more important heuristic make an appearance: <i>what is actually true, at a discrete level</i>?  I would say (as an understatement): rarely.<p>If truth and rationality is truly on the side of the &quot;anti-conspiracy&quot; side of the divide, you&#x27;d think it would be child&#x27;s play to &quot;destroy conspiracy theorists with facts and logic&quot;.  And yet, what accompanies the heuristic seems to be an inoculation to any epistemic challenges: circling of the wagons, typically via insubstantial&#x2F;rhetorical dismissals (ad hominen character attacks), appeals to ends justifying the means, or simply downvoting + silence.<p>Please pay attention to what is really going on in your countries, and in your media.  I do not ask that you believe anything specific, but only that you always ask: <i>what is the actual truth</i>?  And also, when forming your worldview, do not consider only what you see (or are told, often without any actual evidence), but also <i>what you do not see</i>.<p>Pay attention to what portions of reality are freely discussed in the media (and in turn on social media), and the manner in which they are discussed (watch out for framing via a small set of perspectives <i>that are not inclusive of all details</i>).  Observe <i>the nature of</i> the ideas being asserted (are they specific, and supported by logic and evidence, or vague conspiratorial slurs?).  Compare specific claims (like &quot;X&#x27;s believe&#x2F;say Y&quot;) to what is actual reality - which requires <i>going and seeing for yourself</i>.  It is regularly recommended that climate change &quot;deniers&quot; &quot;educate themselves on the facts&quot; - be careful that you are not holding them to a standard <i>that you are unwilling to meet (or even acknowledge) yourself</i>.')
