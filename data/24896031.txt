In one launch, the rocket exploded and even then the radioactive parts were unharmed[0]<p>And &#x27;accidentally reenters the atmosphere&#x27; isn&#x27;t really a thing. Once an object is in orbit above a certain height, it takes a lot of energy to get it <i>out</i> of orbit. The only alternative is waiting for the very faint amount of atmosphere to drag on it and bring it down- and anything about 1000km, that would be decades of waiting.<p>We launch the radioactive components safely, as we have lots of experience doing. We then assemble the nuclear engine in-orbit at an orbit above 1000km. Then we go to Mars!<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rps.nasa.gov&#x2F;about-rps&#x2F;safety-and-reliability&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rps.nasa.gov&#x2F;about-rps&#x2F;safety-and-reliability&#x2F;</a>')
