None of those headphones has the ease-of-syncing these will. I&#x27;m pretty sure none of those headphones support the spatial audio stuff these will. My corded Sennheiser HD280s started flaking off around the ear not too long after I bought them, while these seem like probably they&#x27;ll wear better over time.<p>Audio quality? Yeah, I&#x27;m guessing Apple&#x27;s aiming for &quot;good enough for most people,&quot; nowhere near studio quality. But on everything else, I suspect they&#x27;ve nailed it, especially for people who&#x27;ve used AirPods or AirPods Pro and appreciate the syncing, spatial audio, etc.')
