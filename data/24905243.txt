But it seems that most of the people I&#x27;ve met seem to enjoy the hugs I take for granted and usually offer.<p>Some people say &quot;No hugging&quot;, or &quot;Ahh yes, you&#x27;re British we  must hug now..&quot; with a bit of a smile.  But on the whole I&#x27;ve always been one to touch friends and people I&#x27;m close to.  I&#x27;ve always regarded physical contact as an extremely important part of communication.')
