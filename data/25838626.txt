I don&#x27;t care about buzzwords like misinformation or hatred - Twitter cares neither - but I do care about inciting violence.<p>In exchange I show you tweets from Khamanei - ayatollah of Iran.<p>&gt; Because by that logic, we should also allow ISIS, Al-Qaeda et al. to do their thing.<p>ISIS&#x2F;Al-Qaeda&#x2F;Al-Nusra&#x2F;Taliban whatever are terrorist groups; they don&#x27;t only incite violence. Also putting misinformation and hatred in the same category as actual terror groups is really not wise.')
