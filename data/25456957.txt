You can have it completely done, but in essence the first customer doesn&#x27;t get the software until you get paid. Then they are free to do whatever they want with it once you release it. Updates can be released on the same model. NOBODY gets it until you can support yourself on the income before releasing it into the wild, because once you do, there&#x27;s no way to get compensated without some kind of support contract (which is no guarantee) or restricting the user from doing what they want with their own bits.')
