I believe the commenter above is doing his best to be a reliable narrator, but it&#x27;s always possible there was more to this story that was not visible to him at the time, that might exculpate a bit. It&#x27;s also notable that people change over time, can improve on their faults, and might have learned something in the years since. Best not to view their past mistakes as forever damaging.')
