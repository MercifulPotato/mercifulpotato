I would argue that is a little low to afford a TV of that price, but at 30k that would be around a month&#x27;s take-home pay. Doable I guess.<p>That&#x27;s a tiny fraction of world population than can even possibly buy that TV, and only a fraction of those that can will. Even in rich countries, a large number of households wont have it. Dropping a grand+ on a TV would be considered a high-end luxury to the vast majority of the world&#x27;s population.')
