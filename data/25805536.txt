When you open a business in the real world, sure you have to tell the authorities about it (because it&#x27;s the law!).\nWhen you open a digital business, you have to tell Google (via Google Search Console) about it... But Google is not the law, not even an authority; it just happens that Google owns google.com and Chrome and that makes Google the de facto Godfather of the internet: if you don&#x27;t comply, your business is practically dead.\nAgain, sad.')
