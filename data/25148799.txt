You said &quot;easier&quot; syntax than APL but APL is honestly a very easy syntax for working with arrays. That&#x27;s a significant part of the advantage of APL, it makes it very easy to come up with, talk about, and maintain array algorithms.<p>Matlab and Julia and other languages aimed at scientific computing have some array language-like traits but lack a lot of the functions that make APL more generally applicable. And .map is all wrong; it&#x27;s extra noise and it doesn&#x27;t generalize down to scalars or up to matricesâ€”the defining feature of array languages is that operations are <i>implicitly</i> polymorphic over the rank of the input.')
