The formula already says it depends on ripgrep (that&#x27;s fine since I have ripgrep already installed and use it regularly). I still was surprised when I executed Rga for the first time and got an error message that &#x27;pdftotext&#x27; was not found. Since pdftotext has been officially discontinued, I am not sure if I want to install an old version just to make Rga work on my machine. Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an good idea to rely on a project which is not maintained actively.')
