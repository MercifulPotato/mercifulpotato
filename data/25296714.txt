If I understood its capabilities right, minisketch seems indistinguishable from magic.<p>Would you please clear a bunch of things:<p>0. Is my understanding that total elements in a set doesn&#x27;t matter (afa reconcilation is concerned), right? See #1.<p>1. If Alice knows for sure there have been, say, 50 new additions (or rather, updates to existing elements) of elements of size 10 bits each (to a set of say 100M total other unchanged elements) since the last sync with Bob, does a sketch(10, 0, 50) by Alice cover all changes Bob needs to see or sketch(10, 0, 100) is needed?<p>2. A sketch(10, 0, 100) would occupy atmost 10x100 bits? Or, atleast 10x100 bits?<p>3. What&#x27;s state of the art in set-reconciliation research right now apart from Pin Sketches?<p>4. Do implementations in other languages exist?<p>An ask:<p>1. A WASM executable would be great.<p>Thanks!')
