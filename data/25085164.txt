I could look outside my window in my urban American city and see people walking around without a mask, especially when the weather is nice. Last night my downstairs neighbors had a big loud party and another tenant yelled at them to turn the volume down. In the summer, not one pre-teen or teenager was wearing a mask in my neighborhood. Are we really gonna compare the limited instances of people being weld into their apartment to sheer collective wantonness going on stateside? And I live in a blue city.')
