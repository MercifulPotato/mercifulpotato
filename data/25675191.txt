We only have circumstantial evidence -- namely that Durov (and thus Telegram) escaped Russia after having been approached by intelligence services. That&#x27;s all we have to go on.<p>Maybe he was able to break encryption and hand the keys to the agencies but preferred to escape to avoid that. Or maybe it was something else.<p>To be fair, I don&#x27;t care much if Telegram is well-encrypted. History has shown that state actors prefer to sabotage the roots of encryption algorithms and&#x2F;or embed backdoors if the service isn&#x27;t truly end-to-end encrypted. But as I said, that isn&#x27;t my number one concern when using messengers.')
