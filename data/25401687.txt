Item(by='Reelin', descendants=None, kids=[25402882], score=None, time=1607807011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399428, text='YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc (and to a lesser extent search engines) are the modern equivalent of the printing press in terms of the effect they&#x27;ve had on how we communicate. A domain and VPS are simply not a viable substitute for access to mainstream social networks; to claim otherwise is disingenuous.<p>They are not at all similar to publishing. There&#x27;s no editor. There&#x27;s no approval process for the typical use case, only a retroactive removal process. They don&#x27;t have an audience in the traditional sense of people paying someone to curate information for them but rather depend on network effects to maintain a monopoly on their segment of the market. To that end, they have more in common with a dating app than they do with the New York Times. The presence of advertising revenue is the only legitimate similarity I see to a traditional publishing model.<p>In spite of your claim that YouTube isn&#x27;t infrastructure, it appears to me to have far more commonalities than differences with it. That it isn&#x27;t (yet) regulated as such is merely a legal peculiarity from my perspective.<p>(And the above doesn&#x27;t even begin to consider the effects that dumping VC and megacorp funded free product has had on the market. Good luck starting a competing platform when there&#x27;s no viable way to operate a subscription model and your direct competitor has a monopoly on the relevant advertising market.)')
