Although you got to love the ending, even after being scammed, the writer said she&#x27;d still use it:<p>&gt; I can’t say I’ll be leaving the platform, either. Dealing with Airbnb’s easily exploitable and occasionally crazy-making system is still just a bit cheaper than renting a hotel.<p>And also dicking around renters when shit does go bad? (Typical example: host says $2000 in damages. AirBnB offers $200. Deliberately frustrate host with weeks&#x2F;months of back and forth &quot;negotiation&quot;.
