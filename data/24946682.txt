It&#x27;s not going away and we have to treat it as such. We can&#x27;t put that genie back in the bottle so to speak. Because of the western liberal ideals of freedoms Europe and the rest of the west will never be able to enforce a proper true 100% lockdown on the scale of Wuhan.<p>What we have to do is continue to mitigate risks and evolve medical treatments. We are making great strides in this regard. Many companies are working over time and we have proven treatment methods that help minimize and reduce negative outcomes. Now we need to scale these treatments. What we need most is Time and that&#x27;s arguably the one thing none of us have excess off.<p>Wearing masks in public are fine, washing hands diligently are fine. These are good things. Long term though secondary effects of the disease are proving to be just as damaging to the world. Lockdowns aren&#x27;t the fix and are arguably not likely to be legal.<p>Both the left and the right have to stop poo pooing advances and yelling at each other with blame. Yes, people aren&#x27;t wearing masks as they should, thing is that was and will always be the case. We account for that by majority working with the system. There will always be a minority that fights against it and accounting for that is more important.<p>The #1 thing I think that will help with managing covid, is Civility. The more we respect each other, the easier it is to find common ground and social agreement on best steps to take.<p>We will get through this as we do everything else. We have to stop over dramatizing things for the sake of political points. No one disputes the harm of this virus, or the deaths it&#x27;s caused. One death is too much, but we also have to recognize that we have people dying in large amounts because of a lot of issues.<p>Notably, the second thing that will improve our success in beating this long term, is emphasis on healthy life styles. The fact that I hear almost 0 about health and minimizing comorbidity issues is astounding. Yes, I realize people can&#x27;t all of a sudden not have co-morbidities, but we can instill these behaviors now with evidence that may help prevent issues the next time something like this transpires.<p>TLDR: Being more civil with each other and addressing personal health issues will be the biggest impact to collectively reducing risk and improving survivability.')
