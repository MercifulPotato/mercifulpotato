I our current work situation right now is causing a ton of stress and mental health issues, but COVID and our current political climate have a much bigger hand in that than just the WFH part. What WFH looks like right now is not what a 100% WFH lifestyle would look like in a year or two. I&#x27;ve had the ability to WFH when ever I wanted for the past 4 years and I can tell you, my current WFH situation is much more draining that it ever was before.<p>I think your video game analogy is pretty spot on. There are problems with 100% WFH, but &quot;mass mental health issues&quot; just seems like a boogieman.')
