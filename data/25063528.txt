I know I&#x27;m putting faith in Notion staff to follow GDPR guidelines because if they accessed my information without an extremely good reason it would be a breach.<p>The only other option would be for me to create my own solution, and while I could do that, I don&#x27;t have the time or the desire to do it.<p>I think you got to be careful and read the TOS and know what you&#x27;re in for.  For example, I stopped using the free version of Grammarly after I found out they weren&#x27;t GDPR compliant and their support wouldn&#x27;t confirm if they were going to be GDPR compliant.  A year later I evaluated Grammarly again and they were, so I subscribed to Grammarly premium.<p>However some companies are so egregious in their lack of respect of privacy that I will never trust them again, for example Facebook.  Others are so impossible to get away from, like Google, that I limit my exposure as much as possible.<p>Bottom line is be aware of how your privacy will be handled and make sure you&#x27;re conscious of the trade off decisions you&#x27;re making.')
