Value can be provided in many forms.  For someone with zero or little relevant experience, having a good recommendation from someone at a large company can easily separate you from the crowd.  What about your tech companies giving 20 hour work &quot;exams&quot; as screening?  Guess what?  Many times, those are REAL problems they are looking to solve.  There is nothing wrong with this from my eyes.  If someone has skills, and just no connections and needs a break to get into a world they don&#x27;t know, this is a great way to do that.  Plus, I&#x27;d be happy to mentor someone who shows excellence, work ethic, and drive.<p>So, I&#x27;ll be using this and making sure those that need help launching their desired career have a chance. Instead of just getting $200 for a project and still having nowhere to go.  What&#x27;s more valuable?  Access to a network of connections and a recommendation, or $200 one time?')
