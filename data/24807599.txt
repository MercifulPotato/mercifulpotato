Not many physical books, CD&#x27;s etc.<p>I was searching the other day some playlists in my youtube account for old songs, interesting videos etc that I loved, only to find out that almost half of these were gone (without even leaving the title as evidence of what it could be there). Then I suddenly realized in shock that in 10 years from now, nothing that I use today to learn, to laugh at, to question myself, to have fun with etc, are guaranteed to be there for me or for my kids.<p>All of my books are e-books, my pc games are digital, I rely on a music subscription, netflix &amp; youtube for video, google for accessing interesting websites, my photos in a cloud service and the list goes on.<p>A book will be there for me regardless of what happens to the publisher. But there is no guarantee about my favorite website&#x2F;streaming&#x2F;cloud service.<p>How do we modify the internet and DRM to deal with the future volatility of the businesses behind the content we consume today? What can we do as individuals?')
