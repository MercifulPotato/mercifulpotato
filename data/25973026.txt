I remember it as one of the most productive periods of my life but it was incredibly anti social and got the strangest looks from management.<p>I&#x27;d do 35 minute naps with an alarm at 0430, 0830, 1230, 1630, and without an alarm at 2030 and 0030 (on the basis that I thought my body would sleep through if I was &quot;doing any damage&quot;).<p>It made going out at the weekends or playing poker in a casino incredibly difficult so after 3 weeks I had to pack it in.<p>I was lucky to live a 5 minute, folding, bicycle ride from the office but I also had a little card I&#x27;d leave on my desk for the corner that said, &quot;I have not collapsed I&#x27;m having a nap.&quot;<p>The one thing I&#x27;ve kept from those days is that I still wear a sleep mask to bed.')
