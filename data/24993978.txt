I mailed my ballot in a couple weeks ago, and BallotTrax told me when it was picked up by the post office, and then when it was delivered to election officials and accepted.  But that&#x27;s just an email telling me this; anyone can type up an email and send it, while dropping my ballot into a shredder.<p>Now, I <i>do</i> believe that my vote was actually counted, but I have no rational basis for this, as I don&#x27;t have any kind of record or visibility into the process.<p>I don&#x27;t think <i>any</i> voting process can actually really tell you that your vote was counted.  At the end of the day you&#x27;re just trusting that the people running it aren&#x27;t corrupt, or at least that there are enough people involved that keeping shenanigans a secret would be incredibly difficult.')
