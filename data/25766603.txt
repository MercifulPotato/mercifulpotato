I think it&#x27;s more fair to complain that XMPP&#x2F;Jabber died, because those were widely used by everyone who used Google Talk (and the original FB Messenger maybe?) and then were killed off. The big companies have done some awful bait-and-switch in terms of interop.<p>&gt; <i>Everyone has moved to things like FB and reddit, who have then killed off and censored many of these communities.</i><p>I think the perspective you are missing is that the censorship is the value for a lot of people. I personally didn&#x27;t start using reddit until they started actively banning neo-Nazis and abandoning their &quot;everything except violence is fine&quot; policy.<p>The ultimate unregulated venues used to be (or maybe still are) forums, and I personally run a niche industry forum that has a lot of traffic. The problem with forums is that they require extensive, aggressive moderation to prevent spam just as a starter.<p>Then what you&#x27;re left with is a choice of what culture you want. Do you want a mainstream culture that appeals to lots of people? Because you can&#x27;t have that unless you create the kinds of rules that the corporate giants have created.<p>In summary, I think the issue with censorship is that everyone loves it and wants it in their social networks, but no one can 100% agree on what should be censored or not.')
