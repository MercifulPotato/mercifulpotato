A small annoyance, but for De Zwart it signifies something bigger</i><p>Oh yes. At some point this was a very annoying problem on Facebook. Our last name has ‘de’ as well and Facebook refused to have ‘de’ in lowercase in my wife’s name unless she sent them a photo copy of her ID.<p>At some point they started permitting lowercase Dutch ‘tussenvoegsels’ again.<p>But it showed so little appreciation of other languages and cultures. (It’s like Apple&#x2F;Siri and others pretending that everyone uses a single language in their daily life.)')
