I wrote a small script to export my notes to a static website because I figured someone could use the knowledge, even if it&#x27;s just a brain dump:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.stavros.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.stavros.io&#x2F;</a><p>I also had an idea to make a site where you could take notes and have them be auto-published (like the above, but as a service), to create a community of random knowledge dumps. Think of a Wikipedia, but made of personal sites and not as rigorous, with a very &quot;personal Web 1.0 website&quot; feel, but talking to a few friends it didn&#x27;t seem like they saw much point in it.')
