Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604799849, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25021343, text='&gt; When both said Iraq had WMDs, did you believe them?<p>Biden voted for the Iraq War and 70 million people just installed him as President so we can go back to the glorious way things were before. Certainly the billionaire elites, deep state, globalists, big tech, pro war Democrats and Republicans, big business (which loves infinite cheap labor), China - they&#x27;re all thrilled with where this goes next.<p>I wonder if all the people cheering for Biden (including the Europeans) will be offering apologies when Biden &amp; Co. start the next round of wars, as we return to the ways things were pre-Trump. Biden&#x27;s brain is jello, so somebody else is going to be steering the ship the next few years until he steps down for health reasons to set up Harris to run for re-election in 2024 running as the incumbent. Zero chance Biden&#x27;s health holds up against the rigors of the job given how much he has collapsed mentally in the past four years (the stress of the job will make it that much worse).<p>As an American, I&#x27;m increasingly interested in leaving the country. Not specifically because of Trump or Biden, but because of everything, the general direction of the country, the imploding culture, the partisan venom, the fiscal disaster, the superpower globalism (including the war machine), the disastrous immigration policies. The US is fundamentally broken and will not be repaired, it&#x27;s only going to get worse as real authoritarianism rises on both sides (socialism and fascism, both of which require extreme political violence, a small taste of which we&#x27;ve just recently been getting). The future of the US is Brazil, with more money. Canada is looking very nice (sane immigration policies, national selfishness regarding their priorities, no war machine, spending allocated effectively (the US spends more of its economy on its mediocre welfare state than Canada does and gets a lot less for it), a stable culture, and national civility).')
