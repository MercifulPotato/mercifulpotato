Item(by='tertiary', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602431362, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746455, text='&gt; but those teams are only deployed in situations like bank robberies, hostage situations, school shootings, etc<p>That&#x27;s not true and is the reason people are upset.  Nobody disagrees with the use of SWAT teams for school shooting and the like.  However, that isn&#x27;t how militarized units are used in real life.  There simply isn&#x27;t enough violent crime in most areas to justify a full time force dedicated to it.  Instead, SWAT is used to target drug offenses (often times w&#x2F;o an indication that there will be violence).  In fact, the federal 1033 program (which funnels military hardware to the police) was founded to help fight the war on drugs.<p>The other big use of SWAT is for search warrants where they have replaced patrol officers in 80% of cases, the vast majority of which don&#x27;t involve any suspicion that things will get violent.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2015&#x2F;08&#x2F;new-documents-reveal-fearmongering-local-cops-use-score-military-gear-pentagon&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2015&#x2F;08&#x2F;new-documents-r...</a>')
