Bank runs are bad because banks are assumed to be massively liquid---in the average case, if you walk in and provide the proper ID, they can hand you the cash you&#x27;re asking for. If they can&#x27;t, one of their primary value propositions is at risk and people start demanding their money out because the bank isn&#x27;t able to provide the services of a bank.<p>This is not (and is not expected to be) true of stock brokerage. Nobody generally has an expectation of moment-to-moment liquidity (or even closure of deals), even in a stock with significant availability. However, a brokerage deciding independently &quot;You&#x27;re not allowed to buy this one stock&quot; is unusual, and can cause people to start backing towards the exits.')
