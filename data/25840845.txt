This may be true for high-performance computing or other applications that are sensitive to the ratio of compute to price (or mobile consumer devices with a small thermal envelope), but it&#x27;s not necessarily true for power electronics, automotive ICs, or missile control systems. Some of those chips aren&#x27;t even made of silicon, instead being made of more expensive gallium nitride or gallium arsenide because of their thermal, high-frequency, radiation, and voltage properties.')
