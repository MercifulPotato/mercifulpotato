But it absolutely did not replace a laptop<p>Honestly that is basically what I wantâ€”a few hours here and there for when I can&#x27;t be at a desk. I currently use a 16&quot; MacBook Pro as my primary machine. I purchased it shortly before the pandemic, because I needed to use it both at home and in the office, and I didn&#x27;t want to buy two machines.<p>Since COVID, my department has transferred to permanent remote working, so 99% of the time I&#x27;m at my desk. I would love to ditch the MacBook for a desktop machine and fill the remaining 1% with the iPad, even knowing the limitations of the form factor.<p>When more desktop Macs are updated with the Apple CPUs I&#x27;ll probably look into the feasibility of VNC-ing into a machine at home from the iPad, but it just seems like a shame to squander all this potential.')
