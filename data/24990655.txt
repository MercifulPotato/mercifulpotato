I&#x27;m middle of the road on them.<p>Pro: \n- They are stupid fast to develop, deploy, and update. \n- Firebase tooling emulators makes local dev much easier.\n- Simple enough a developer can build, deploy and monitor; \n  Cost less then hiring another person to handle devops.\n- Now has decent IAM restrictions\n- Baked in access to almost all other GCP tools.<p>Con: \n- Like any google product could be deprecated at any time.\n- They have poor versioning compared to App Engine or Cloud Run. No rollback, A&#x2F;B, or multi-version deployments\n- Cold starts are slow.\n- Like any google product could be deprecated at any time.')
