You inadvertently stumbled across a thorny example.<p>The history of 晴 indicates pretty clearly that 青 is meant to be a phonetic compound rather than a semantic one, but it&#x27;s not obvious how that came about.<p>晴 originated as the character 夝 and originally meant a clear night with visible stars after the rain has stopped (夝 is a 形声字 where 夕 means dusk or night and 生 is the phonetic compound) rather than a clear day. By focusing on the stars, we got alternate &quot;spellings&quot; of 暒 (which is a cross between using 星 phonetically and semantically) and 精 (borrowing its connotation of brightness). Gradually this focus on stars became a focus on brightness while maintaining the original &quot;clearness.&quot; The latter character 精 then kept its phonetic component 青 and got a new semantic component 日 to distinguish itself from 精 and that&#x27;s how we got 晴.')
