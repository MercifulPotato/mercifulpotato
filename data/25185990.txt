You can&#x27;t use the App Store (even for free apps) without an Apple ID, and you can&#x27;t get an Apple ID without a phone number. (In many countries, you can&#x27;t get a phone number without a government ID.)<p>Similarly, if you wish to publish apps widely, you can do so with unsigned ones, but users won&#x27;t ever figure out how to run those.[1] If you want your app to be widely used, you must ID yourself to Apple, who can deny&#x2F;censor at will (or under state (or Hollywood) compulsion).<p>It builds a world in which it is impossible to easily build or distribute tools that the state really doesn&#x27;t want distributed or used, because Apple is too large to deny them their demands.<p>I think the phrase used is &quot;turnkey tyranny&quot;.<p>Anonymous publishing is essential to the preservation of a free society.<p>Imagine if there were one company who could remotely disable printing presses, or televisions&#x2F;radios.<p>For those of you who aren&#x27;t yet worried about this possibility of state compulsion, I ask you this: Dubya is to Trump as Trump is to x? It&#x27;s not a matter of if these remote censorship tools built by Apple will be used to abuse human rights en masse, but instead a matter of <i>when</i>. Apple is already compromising their crypto due to requests (not compulsion) from the federal policeâ€”today.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lapcatsoftware.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;unsigned.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lapcatsoftware.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;unsigned.html</a>')
