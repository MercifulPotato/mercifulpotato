I&#x27;ve been curious on how indie shows can support themselves and it seems like it&#x27;s really not feasible long term which is very disappointing. After paying for music, talent, hosting, and the payment platform&#x27;s cut it seems like you&#x27;d need a huge listener base to get a small percentage of users that donate.<p>Patreon donations being higher than the others has to be due to user familiarity. It seems that most indie creators that ask for donations use Patreon so listeners might be more comfortable using that versus something like Liberapay or Interac.')
