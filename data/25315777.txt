A Mastadon node is still publicly available.<p>But I can kind of see the distinction you&#x27;re getting at, and it&#x27;s especially clear with Reddit. If you have a sub which is moderated by the users, there is no longer any call for the corporation to do any moderation whatsoever, because it&#x27;s already being handled in a decentralized fashion (each sub has its own independent moderators). You don&#x27;t need the corporation itself to do any moderation at all, and so anything they do there is unnecessary and unwelcome.<p>The question is how to draw that line. You essentially want decentralized moderation even when there is centralized hosting. How does that look when you apply it to e.g. Facebook?')
