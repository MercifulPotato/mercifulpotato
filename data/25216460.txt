I&#x27;d expect servos in an active loop as you mentioned, rather than steppers - which tend to settle at 1.8* increments.<p>Either way I have no idea how they work out the firing solution for the comm lasers with sufficient accuracy. Hypothesizing: maybe they shoot multiple lasers, the main comm laser and a alignment pattern with auxiliary lasers which could be used for targeting feedback?')
