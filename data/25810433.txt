It ruled my life for many years. There&#x27;s no way to indicate this in a way that isn&#x27;t patronizing over the internet but I urge you to find the root of this hate which you are now projecting on a guy you don&#x27;t know much about and transform it. Meditation has been a powerful tool in my arsenal and I can recommend it but there&#x27;s many other things you can do about it. There&#x27;s far, far too much hate on the internet and in this world as is.')
