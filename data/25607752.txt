We&#x27;re broke.&quot;<p>Sure... but you may still come in and find &quot;this project has been nixed&quot;.  Upside is that you may still have a &#x27;job&#x27; in the bigger company, but everything you worked on may be thrown away, you may lose whatever political power your project had, etc.  Certainly there&#x27;s an &#x27;immediate safety net&#x27; issue of &quot;you may have a paycheck next week&quot;, but doesn&#x27;t address any of the emotional stuff that goes along with &quot;we&#x27;ll have a scrappy startup mentality!&quot;<p>I had been in something similar - not quite a &#x27;startup in a large company&#x27; situation, but similar.  And... we hit a &quot;hey, this project is being shut down, and there&#x27;s no other budget in the company for this team&quot;.
