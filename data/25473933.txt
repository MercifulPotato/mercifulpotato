My struggles with over-eager developers turning everything into a smorgasbord of over-abstract design patterns outweighs any benefits I ever got from them (there&#x27;s a similar tendency with some functional programming enthusiasts). I think we&#x27;re better off tucking these into language documentation and calling them &quot;idioms&quot;, to keep the zealots and dogmatists from turning them into thought-terminating cliches.<p>&gt; Meanwhile vast amounts of memory and CPU power mean flyweights and object pools aren&#x27;t so useful and immutability is now a valid design goal.<p>I don&#x27;t agree, they are still widely used in most languages, but are often hidden behind abstractions so that developers don&#x27;t need to know about them.')
