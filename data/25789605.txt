It would have fit perfectly as it was also a two-port model. Maybe it has to do with the keyboard being broken in the 2018 model, but (to this layman) it sounds easier to fix that than to add support for the TouchBar on Apple Silicon for a single (!) temporary hardware model.<p>Now they have to keep that TouchBar code around in AppKit even after they inevitably drop Intel support. Extremely curious decision.')
