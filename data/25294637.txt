Intel is now years behind in their process nodes. Ryzen right now is already significantly better than any Intel CPU. M1 has been released which trounces all of those and PC manufacturers now have to compete with Apple in a way that they haven&#x27;t really before. I don&#x27;t remember Apple ever being this competitive in performance and they&#x27;re going to take the lead once the Macbook Pros are released. The only way for manufacturers to keep up is a top-to-bottom switch to Ryzen.<p>So I do think we&#x27;re going to see a big shift towards Ryzen, since I&#x27;m not sure how Intel could possibly entice manufacturers to stick with them when they haven&#x27;t been able to deliver in years.')
