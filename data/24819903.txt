Very cool, looks like it is more of a world hard drive for now, but sounds like you have bigger plans for it. Very very cool. I&#x27;m downloading it right now. I&#x27;ve shot you a connection request on linkedin. I would really like to stay updated on this project. I work in blockchain development sometimes and I think ease of use has been a HUGE hurdle for adoption, but it seems you have overcome that a bit in your project. In fact I think your project could be compatible with&#x2F;useful for one of the blockchains I develop on.<p>I specifically liked when you talked about people (kids in particular) being able to program simply again without the need of specialized knowledge in networking etc. I think this is actually what Stadia and other streamed gaming services have been trying to do. Except they seem to be doing it ass backwards (centralizing the service and serving it to the customer).<p>Anyways, really cool project, looking forward to using it.')
