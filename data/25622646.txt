I thought it would be nice if AI can help us to summarize them to save our time. Thus, I spent my Christmas making this tool.<p>All you have to do is pasting your video URL (with CC turned on) to the website, and it will generate the chapters (kind of summary) for you. You can use them to find the parts you&#x27;re interested in. It might not as accurate as human-generated chapters. But it can give you a quick tour of what the video is about.<p>It took me longer than I thought to develop this web app. I spent most of the time dealing with its deployment (so many hurdles!).<p>Let me know if you think it&#x27;s helpful or not, and how I can improve it. Thank you very much!')
