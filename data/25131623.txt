Good luck configuring the one they give you for different machines without lots of pointing and clicking. (Yes I know about `defaults write`, I tried to maintain a script to configure everything that way and similar for several years, things change every version, and it&#x27;s a mess even when it works. It&#x27;s not how they want you to do it, and it shows.)')
