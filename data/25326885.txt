Pulled out the 1&#x2F;2 width PDP board, made a few console changes and voilla, VMS magic.  In between was the interminable tape drive but it messes up the story.<p>I left for Maynard&#x2F;Nassau a few months later, the 6 best&#x2F;worst years of my life.  Watching us piss away the WS market to salvage big iron was the worst but as GB much later pointed up -- VMS was the gold and we had no idea how to mine it.')
