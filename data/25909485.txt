So that paper ballot is a useful auditing mechanism for checking on machine-generated vote counts.<p>If I electronically cast votes on a machine, and the machine prints out a paper record of my ballot, unless I, the voter, leave some record that I inspected that piece of paper and agree that it reflects the votes I intended to cast, it&#x27;s useless as an auditing mechanism. As far as I can tell, no such voter inspection record is made with electronic voting machines.')
