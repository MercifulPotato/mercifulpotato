Satoshi himself said that SPV clients would be enough for most users:<p>&quot;Simplified Payment Verification is for lightweight client-only users who only do transactions and don&#x27;t generate and don&#x27;t participate in the node network.  They wouldn&#x27;t need to download blocks, just the hash chain, which is currently about 2MB and very quick to verify (less than a second to verify the whole chain).&quot;[0]<p>It&#x27;s not clear what benefit the user or the currency gains from having 90% of users running full nodes instead of, say, 50% or 10% doing so.  In any case, when people in poor nations have phones that can manage uninterrupted 24&#x2F;7 connections to the bitcoin network, they&#x27;ll probably also be able to afford 2 TB of storage (currently costing about $50) which would be enough to store 10 years of 4 MB blocks.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blockchain.news&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;satoshi-quote-on-trust" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blockchain.news&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;satoshi-quote-on-trust</a>')
