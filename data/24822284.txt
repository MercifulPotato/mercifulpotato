Plenty of companies still make them. There&#x27;s other ways of connecting a battery to chassis even in a small form factor like AirPods. For instance, a threaded base that screws in. It&#x27;s not rocket science.<p>What you&#x27;re saying is that Apple, the great innovator, can&#x27;t find a way to make <i>replaceable battery</i> in a clean and elegant form factor for a small device, and that&#x27;s the reason that <i>nations are wealthier</i> now than they used to be?<p>C&#x27;mon now, that&#x27;s hard to make with a straight face isn&#x27;t it? Failure is now success. Private profiteering at the expense of the environment is technophilia. Feels a lot like Owellian doublespeak to me.<p>tl;dr: Apple spends $16B per year on R&amp;D. They can figure out how to screw a battery into an AirPod, and no, that&#x27;s not why we&#x27;re all wealthy now. It&#x27;s why <i>Apple</i> is wealth<i>ier</i> now.')
