The species that went extinct due to us industrializing the planet, and the species that will go extinct due to climate change (even if brief and ultimately mitigated) will not come back.<p>Sure, evolution keeps running its RNG and eventually new and interesting species will start showing up. But that doesn&#x27;t replace the causal link that is lost. Today, the variety of organisms on our planet gives biologists a chance to understand how crucial mechanisms of life evolved. As we erase that history, we make biological sciences that much harder, and by extension, slow the progress of everything from medicine through biotech to chemistry and material sciences.')
