As you say, not a big priority.  But some people would sign up, who otherwise would not.  And some people would keep their accounts, who otherwise would not.  Win for Facebook?  Hard to say.<p>Now, what if Facebook gave each person 10% of what they personally brought in?  That wouldn&#x27;t take much more tracking than what they already do.  But in this case, you&#x27;d have a lot of people maximizing their time on Facebook in order to increase their payout.  Win for them, bigger win for Facebook.  Heck, Facebook could even get rid of all their stupid dark patterns, and stop the endless research into more dark patterns, improving their bottom line even more.  No need to trick people into engaging if they are voluntarily engaging for a small sum.')
