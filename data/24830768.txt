See overview at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-wildfires-forests-insight&#x2F;california-outpaced-trumps-forest-service-in-wildfire-prevention-work-data-idUSKCN26E2QO" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-wildfires-forests-ins...</a>. The hard numbers seem to come from the historical state-by-state statistics from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nifc.gov&#x2F;fireInfo&#x2F;fireInfo_statistics.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nifc.gov&#x2F;fireInfo&#x2F;fireInfo_statistics.html</a><p>From the Reuters article:<p>&gt; The number of acres treated by the U.S. Forest Service in California during fiscal 2020 was the second lowest under Trump&#x27;s administration, and 40% below a recent peak of 424,486 acres treated in the state during the last year of the Obama administration, according to the data.<p>But that seems a little misleading considering the impact of COVID-19 on 2020. Here&#x27;s a nice table of historical prescribed burns broken down nationally: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nifc.gov&#x2F;fireInfo&#x2F;fireInfo_stats_prescribed.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nifc.gov&#x2F;fireInfo&#x2F;fireInfo_stats_prescribed.html</a> (also <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov&#x2F;intelligence&#x2F;2019_statssumm&#x2F;wildfire_charts_tables19.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov&#x2F;intelligence&#x2F;2019_st...</a>). From that it doesn&#x27;t seem Trump&#x27;s administration is substantially any better or worse than Obama&#x27;s. Other than that Trump&#x27;s accusation seem off-base--if California is to blame, to a first approximation so too must be the Feds, and in any event states seem to perform several times more prescribed burning by acreage than the Feds--I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much else that can be said without some domain expertise. The types of lands and their locations, the appropriateness of mitigations (or lack thereof), the distribution of fires, etc, would all seem to be important to drawing any serious conclusions about what has happened and what is practicable in the future.')
