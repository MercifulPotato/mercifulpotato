With a high power single shot weapon, you can sweep over your target and pull the trigger at the right moment. Works great for games that accurately record your input timing regardless of whether there&#x27;s a frame drawn at the right moment or not. But once you learn this technique, playing games that require a frame to process input becomes very painful.<p>edit: Sure, it doesn&#x27;t specifically need to be implemented as a thread if the controller events come with a timestamp, but my sibling comment indicates that in CP2077 the input event between frames might actually be lost.')
