Do comment on the feasibility of this goal.<p>Background: \n- Strong Computer Science background with advanced degrees but I went to school when there were green screens, and I have not written a line of production code in ~20 years.\n- I have 10-20 hours per week.<p>Preferences:\n- I find that instructor-led programs are too slow and I get bored; hence, a self study program.\n- I want something with massive amounts of feedback. The best I&#x27;ve found is Udacity for software development and Dataquest.io for data science. Haven&#x27;t found anything for blockchain.<p>Biases: This is not hard. It can&#x27;t be hard when a non-STEM major can go to a data science bootcamp (like Flatiron) and have an 85% chance of getting a $75K job. Hard is winning the Best Paper Award at NIPS.<p>Response to &quot;if you could self study, you wouldn&#x27;t need to ask this question&quot; and similar: Thank you for your input.')
