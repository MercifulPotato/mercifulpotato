Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25511770], score=None, time=1608672556, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506580, text='<i>&gt; is this similar on how integrals always have a constant as a free parameter that need to be determined by other means?</i><p>Not really, no. It&#x27;s a consequence of the assumptions made when the Einstein Field Equation (EFE) is derived from a Lagrangian using the principle of least action.<p>The assumptions are that the Lagrangian should be a Lorentz scalar (which is required of any Lagrangian) and that it should include no more than second derivatives of the metric. The Ricci scalar R meets this requirement and is the Lagrangian that was originally used by David Hilbert to derive the EFE (without a cosmological constant). But a simple constant (the cosmological constant) also meets the requirement, and therefore should be included in the Lagrangian; including it leads to the cosmological constant term in the EFE.')
