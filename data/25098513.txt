It’s not in Apple’s interest to do it. There is a ton of software, open source in particular, that Apple benefits tremendously by. It costs Apple nothing to maintain the status quo.<p>Going Mac App Store only would drive tons of developers off the platform and do absolutely nothing to increase sales on the Store anyway. It would be widely panned as a ham-fisted move.')
