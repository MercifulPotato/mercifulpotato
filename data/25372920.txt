Most people can&#x27;t understand all the ramifications of a policy, but a lot of people can spot a crooked liar if the know them a little, we do it every day. That is why I like the older idea of picking state legislators and letting them pick the president and maybe the senators. And up the number of people in the house. The idea is that you should know or know a lot of people who know the person you are voting for. Media won&#x27;t come into it, civics education won&#x27;t come into it. It will be like picking a plumber in your neighborhood.')
