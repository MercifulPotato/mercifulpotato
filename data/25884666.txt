Apparently a large fraction of the piston engine aircraft fleet is decades old, and the replacement rate is very low. So you&#x27;d have a very long transition period. Further, GA is such a small niche market anyway that smaller airports are very reluctant to provide more than one gasoline variant.<p>I think it&#x27;d be more realistic to set some date after which sale of leaded AVGAS is prohibited. That&#x27;s what was done when leaded automotive gas was banned. Those with cars unable to use unleaded gas just had to suck up whatever expenses were needed, or stop driving.')
