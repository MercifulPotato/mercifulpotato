And I can say without a doubt that it is my favourite keyboard of probably 10 macs I&#x27;ve ever owned. There is a Macbook Air sitting nearby which I just tried for comparison. It&#x27;s pretty good too. But the MBP 16&quot; is just lovely. Quiet. Enough feedback.<p>The only gripe is, and this might be true of all Mac backlit keyboards. Is that I can see light coming from under the keys when viewing it at a low angle such as when I&#x27;ve got my feet up and it&#x27;s on my lap. Not just through the letters, but little slivers of light under each one.')
