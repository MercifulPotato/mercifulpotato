I think a more empathetic lens is that you can either provide a remote-first or in-office-first experience for a team, and that at a larger office many or most teams being remote-first would detract from the office-first experience. I think it&#x27;s short sighted to assume that having 200 people primarily in the office would be significantly different than 400 people, for example, but going from 400 to 10 certainly would.<p>The good thing is that after companies finish out corona, engineers will have more remote-first work options and still plenty of office-first options - I don&#x27;t think there will be much in the way of hostage taking, but I&#x27;m sure some folks will be (rightfully) miffed if they joined a team for one experience and post-pandemic are getting a different one. They are also able to find a new job :)')
