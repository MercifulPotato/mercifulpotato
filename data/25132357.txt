For example, a common refrigerant now is C3H8 aka &#x27;r290&#x27; or propane. Its adoption has been limited because it is highly flammable, but it has a ODP of zero, and a GWP of 20--lower even than the natural gas that is currently burned directly for heating (and for which there are also substantial leaks).')
