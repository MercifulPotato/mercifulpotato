Item(by='h0l0cube', descendants=None, kids=[25404034], score=None, time=1607827780, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25403776, text='&gt; enriching people is fairly effective at eliminating human rights abuses<p>By what mechanism does it do that?  Everyone who is motivated to make profits has incentive to pay the least possible on payroll and taxation.  Human rights empower people to demand higher wages, and any government-sourced provision of quality of life increase taxation.  People who&#x27;s talents align with in-demand skills may have some leverage to increase their wealth and provide a better life for themselves, but without government intervention, that means little for everyone else.<p>Edit: Do agree about unionization - but once again, the right to start or join a union is something that must be enforced by government policy, and voters need to care about human rights for that to occur.')
