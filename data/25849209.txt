It&#x27;s much easier than the turbopumps on the rocket. The rocket pumps have a much harder job than these refueling pumps, since the rocket&#x27;s pumps have to raise the pressure to higher than the engine chamber pressure, so in Raptor that would be about three hundred bars (4500 psi). No such issue in tanking as the rocket tank pressure is low.<p>You can also just use electrical pumps with no weight or size constraints, since it&#x27;s not flight hardware. Large scale LNG pumping solutions at least are off the shelf items for LNG tanker ships.\nThere also exist solutions for what to do with the gases in the LNG tank when it&#x27;s filled. Oxygen tank contents you can of course just vent to the atmosphere.<p>Falcon 9 first stage flight lasts 2 minutes and 34 seconds. \nTanks go from full to empty. [1] You could design the refueling operation to be ten minutes if it provided some benefit to you.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spaceflightnow.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;falcon-9-launch-timeline-with-turksat-5a&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spaceflightnow.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;falcon-9-launch-timeli...</a><p>There are other reasons though why flying a lot of people routinely won&#x27;t be a thing.')
