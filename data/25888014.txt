Item(by='GuB-42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611451931, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25882636, text='Simply because light aircraft represent a really tiny proportion of global emissions.<p>And for &quot;random Joe who wants to dick about in the sky&quot;, chances are that he is the one who is flying your airliner. Flying light aircraft is actually a really important part of what will eventually make good commercial pilots. There is a lot to say about that but the idea is that letting people dick about in the sky is not without merit.<p>Of course, it doesn&#x27;t mean things shouldn&#x27;t change, and I sincerely think 100LL has been a problem for way too long.<p>Problem is: change in aviation is really slow. Regulators are very conservative, every modification requires tons of paperwork, inspections and approval. Also, light aircraft tend to last long, they are actually simple, robust, and easy to repair machines, and many 50+ year old planes are still flying.<p>As for &quot;all new training aircraft in Europe&quot;. I fly in France and I never saw a diesel plane. I know they exist, I just never saw one. On the other hand, I saw many Robin DR-400s with good old Lycoming engines running 100LL. In fact, in small airfields, when there is fuel, it is usually only 100LL. Maybe you can find diesel planes in larger airports where they stock jet fuel and have high turnover flight schools. I don&#x27;t fly there.<p>And BTW, I a fly a Tecnam P92 with a Rotax 912 engine. It runs on unleaded gas, same as my car. But it is in the ultralight class, a much less restrictive category regarding regulations, and as a result, usually a bit more &quot;modern&quot; (if you can call a carburetor-based engine that...).')
