It&#x27;s basically a subculture built around writing impressive little graphics demos.<p>What exactly makes them impressive depends on the category, e.g. a limited hardware platform like some 80s computer, or limited space. A popular category is &quot;4k&quot;, meaning that the program has to fit into 4096 bytes. 4k demos can actually get quite visually complex and even feature music.<p>Many modern games that let you explore gigantic, seemingly infinite spaces (e.g. Minecraft, No Man&#x27;s Sky) owe a lot to the ideas that originated in the Demoscene.')
