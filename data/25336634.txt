My guess is that laying a lot of cable to remote locations could possibly be even higher than the $1376.52 per customer cost?  It seems like something like Satelite internet connections could be less to set up, but it&#x27;s not clear to me the cost of the equipment, installations and upkeep are in that case?<p>Also 1376 &#x2F; 12 months averages out to only about $110 per month per customer for just one year.  Which honestly doesn&#x27;t sound too bad.')
