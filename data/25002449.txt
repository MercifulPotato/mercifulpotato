How is it a good store of value when you take 2 to 3% of the value away every single year?  Imagine, you&#x27;re a retiree with 200K in savings and you loose 6K every single year, just to what&#x27;s considered &quot;moderate inflation&quot;!!!???<p>People will tell you, you need to invest in real assets, like real estate or equities.  In other words, barter, which defeats the whole purpose of using a currency in the first place.<p>Honestly, How is it that 2% inflation is so acceptable?')
