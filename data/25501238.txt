Things were built like that pre-WW2; see street view of this Toronto, Canada neighbourhood:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;place&#x2F;150+Westminster+Ave,+Toronto,+ON+M6R+1N7&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;place&#x2F;150+Westminster+Ave,+Toron...</a><p>Those houses (actually land) are very expensive now, but that&#x27;s because urban living is now cool again. Up until the late-1990s they were quite affordable because all the Cool Kids wanted to live in the suburbs: downtown was mostly for immigrants post-WW2.<p>There&#x27;s a bus line to the west of there (Parkside), a streetcar line to the east (Roncesvalles), and both of those connect to a subway line (Bloor). And one doesn&#x27;t have to give up their car: it simply becomes optional for day-to-day stuff instead of being a necessity.<p>There&#x27;s no reason why post-War suburbs couldn&#x27;t have been built this way. The above neighbourhood was a suburb of Toronto and folks commuted via streetcar &quot;to the city&quot;.<p>For slightly smaller sized homes, but still with backyards and laneway garages, see the next street over:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;place&#x2F;50+Geoffrey+St,+Toronto,+ON" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;place&#x2F;50+Geoffrey+St,+Toronto,+O...</a>')
