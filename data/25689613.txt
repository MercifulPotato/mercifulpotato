To my knowledge, the president can&#x27;t just order an attack, this has to be at least confirmed by one member of a small group of people of necessary rank. Beyond being mostly a political move, Nancy Pelosi reminded by this this group, that a possible launch order most likely is bogus and they should be extremely careful before confirming it.')
