I promise. It&#x27;s just that developers should realize – especially if they are exploring serverless models for the first time – that this technology is not a straight replacement for servers.<p>Ha. So the name didn&#x27;t give that away then?<p>In all seriousness though, I think another avenue for serverless to still explore seriously is declarative application definitions rather than just functions&#x2F;runtime as a service. Hasura[0] are doing this with GraphQL but I think we&#x27;ll soon seen (are already seeing?) a surge in these kinds of cloud abstractions that do much more for you than a simple on-demand runtime ever could.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hasura.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hasura.io&#x2F;</a>')
