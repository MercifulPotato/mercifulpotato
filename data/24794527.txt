You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find any significant body of people of that time who didn&#x27;t.<p><i>&gt; For example, climate change denial.</i><p>I would also say, climate change alarmism. Which, if you are inclined to disagree (you might not be, I don&#x27;t know, but I suspect at least some people reading this will be), illustrates another aspect of the problem: it&#x27;s hard to improve mainstream beliefs when there is not general agreement over <i>how</i> to improve them--which new beliefs should take the place of the ones that are claimed to be wrong.')
