No matter how much revenue you process on Stripe, you’ll get unlimited use of Billing’s Starter plan included in the price you currently pay for payments. All new features are available in your account now, no API version upgrade necessary.<p>If Stripe pushed ahead forcing an additional 0.5% with no new features adopted, that&#x27;s pretty predatory and the kind of rent seeking that will leave a bad taste in a lot of people&#x27;s mouth which then when starting new projects won&#x27;t be looking to adopt Stripe with the same passion they did years ago.')
