Not sure what the OP is on about; of course both surfaces wear, the important thing is the sequence of which surfaces are compared&#x2F;lapped against each other, and how they are oriented.  The orientation is quite important - if each pair of plates are always at the same orientation relative to each other (or I suppose 180 degrees from that) then the plates may meet evenly, all having the same twist.<p>Foundations of Mechanical Accuracy is a great book if you&#x27;re in to this sort of thing.')
