I find people who hold views whatever they hear in the media to be the absolute truth and that they are well informed because they read a lot of news to be extremely naive. This Mark Twain quote completely represents how I feel:<p>If you don&#x27;t read the newspaper, you&#x27;re uninformed. If you read the newspaper, you&#x27;re mis-informed.')
