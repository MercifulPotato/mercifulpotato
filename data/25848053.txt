After all, if there&#x27;s only one thing you don&#x27;t need to think of it as a <i>set</i> of things, so there&#x27;s no counting to do.<p>(I think in some quarters it was even argued that two isn&#x27;t a number, but I forget the details. Compare the fact that some languages treat <i>pairs</i> of things differently in their syntax from larger groups.)<p>But it turns out that mathematically it&#x27;s a really good idea to count 1 as a number and allow sets of size 1, and these days everyone does it and no one is very confused by it. (Well, maybe by the &quot;sets of size 1&quot; thing. Exhibit A: Perl. Exhibit B: Matlab.) And because we&#x27;re now all used to thinking of 1 as a number, it&#x27;s hard even to understand how anyone might have found it unintuitive.<p>If we all started counting from zero and taught our children to do likewise, intuitions 50 years from now might be somewhat different from what they are now.')
