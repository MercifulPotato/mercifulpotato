I will add that Russian interference was not their top beef — Comey’s statements seemed to be more disconcerting for these people.<p>The crazy shit that Trump is saying is a figment of his own imagination and nothing more. There is no basis in reality. No one will come in later and confirm that any of his ramblings were actually correct.<p>Free speech has always had limits when it has had the potential to harm others.
