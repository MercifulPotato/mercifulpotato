If you don&#x27;t have that as your starting point, things will be hard.<p>Rails is great for certain types of web applications because of the fast feedback loop.<p>With that said, there are many other good stacks out there today that allow you to go fast. I think Rails is really a victim of its own success. What DHH got right was to focus on developer UX. Now all the other major stacks have understood that there&#x27;s a new normal in terms of minimum acceptable developer UX quality level and minimum feedback cycle speed. Spring Boot (possibly with Kotlin), .Net Core (possibly with F#), SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose, React Native, React, etc. etc. Everyone is building to the &quot;sexy&quot; dev experience that Rails introduced. jQuery and Prototype were a big deal when they first came out as well.<p>You also need a good CI&#x2F;CD pipeline and modern DevOps practices so you can decouple deployment from release.<p>But like I said before, team communication above all else.')
