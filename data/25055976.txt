And have it scale with time.<p>You get... 20 years? If you want 21, it costs 1,000. If you want year 100, it costs 1,000,000. Some sort of scale to it. If something isn’t worth 1,000, let the public have it. And the older it is, the more you need to justify its value. Disney is the perfect example. They pay some price, maybe 50M&#x2F;yr to keep their multi billion dollar enterprise afloat seems a good trade off for the public good. I’m sure there are much better numbers but if you aren’t willing to put any skin into owning your copyrights, the public should get them. Having culture as a whole perpetually owned is not healthy.')
