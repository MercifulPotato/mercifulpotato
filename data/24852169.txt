How much waste heat is that hot? Combined cycle natural gas turbines already do this. Natural gas combustion drives a turbine, then the &quot;waste heat&quot; drives a steam cycle. Even though that steam cycle is less than 50% efficient, I&#x27;m guess the wasted heat there can&#x27;t be used, right?<p>How high of a COP would it take to make a heat pump a feasible way to make lower temperature waste heat a source? Or is this where the thermodynamics breaks down?')
