The point I was disputing was the idea that changes in mass communication technology gives an advantage to unions.<p>However, to your point: your phrasing &quot;using communication to persuade people...to vote for your side, that&#x27;s called democracy,&quot; obscures some important distinctions.  If your success at persuasion stems mainly from the greater power you have to project your message (e.g. via wealth), then that&#x27;s arguably not actually very democratic.  That&#x27;s pretty easy to see when greater <i>political</i> power is used (e.g. the CCP suppressing dissenting voices and successfully persuading the people with a thick blanket of weakly-opposed propaganda), but there&#x27;s a similar dynamic when one side can greatly outspend its opponent, since wealth is a kind of power [1].<p>For a union vote, the employer typically has both greater wealth and greater political power: it can blanket the workplace with anti-union messages and require employees to <i>repeatedly</i> attend anti-union &quot;education&quot; sessions during work hours (which is typical before a union vote), while the union organizers have much more limited access, and must try to reach employees <i>outside</i> of work.<p>[1] this is an area of tension in liberal democracy, where trade-offs need to be made.')
