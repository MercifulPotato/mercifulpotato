In much of the US, for example, the cost of putting solar equipment on some land is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the cost of the land itself.  If a country is land constrained, then in an era of cheap solar they&#x27;ll lose heavy industry to other countries with more land.<p>If land cost ever did become significant globally for renewables then renewables will have already slaughtered the competition, by being cheaper by a huge factor.')
