Apparently a few motherboards, if you probe certain addresses, will destroy the PC.  He said it was total -- rebooting the pc wouldn&#x27;t even get bios. Suprised that is even possible.  I think OpenRGB mentions some of these edge cases on their page now and takes some effort to block those options.  I thought it was interesting that such a failure can happen.')
