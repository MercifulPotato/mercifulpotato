It is unpopular but it is an adaptation to widespread lack of trustworthiness. The lack of popularity has some motivated reasoning elements - it isn&#x27;t reassuring to believe that mistrust is the right option, it isn&#x27;t conceived of as &quot;how it should be&quot;. It feels better to say &quot;You should be able to trust the people around you.&quot; even if they really aren&#x27;t. As an idea it is &quot;uncuddley&quot;. Not all mistrust is correct nor rational of course.')
