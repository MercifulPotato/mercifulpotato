Item(by='Mediterraneo10', descendants=None, kids=[24787552], score=None, time=1602761720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24787442, text='&gt; It surprises me that nativist anti-immigration demands are considered righteous in some regions and evil and backwards in others.<p>Nativist anti-immigration demands in Europe or North America are generally criticized as hyperbole because immigration will not actually lead to demographic replacement in the near future, in spite of those activists’ claims. Furthermore, in Europe the immigrants invariably assimilate linguistically to their host country – by the second or third generation, the language of the old country is forgotten. Xinjiang is a very different case entirely: China has the numbers to change Xinjiang’s demographics, and virtually none of those Han Chinese immigrants are learning Uighur and using it in public.<p>&gt; Radical Uighur groups did help China make the case with their knife attacks on civilians to be painted as &quot;just another brand of islamic terrorism&quot;.<p>The major wave of knife attacks (which can be seen as a late sign of desperation) postdate China’s attempt to tie the crackdown on the Uighurs to the West’s War on Terrorism. Again, the chronology here is important.')
