It shouldn&#x27;t be confused with the DST issue.<p>And if we can get DST all year round (which I&#x27;m personally all-for), it could help <i>be</i> the impetus to finally shift high school times.<p>The fact of the matter is, our sleep schedules are determined largely by our school&#x2F;work schedules. Simply from the popularity of DST in the summer, it seems clear that people <i>do</i> prefer for society to coordinate to wake up an hour earlier in order to have an extra hour of daylight at the end of the day.<p>Here in the northeast, it&#x27;s horrible in the winter when it&#x27;s dark by 4:30 pm. For a lot of people, it&#x27;s a huge life upgrade to change that to 5:30 pm.')
