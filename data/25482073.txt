But if a satellite was tracking everyone even in heavy weather conditions at all times and all they had to do was reverse the camera then there won&#x27;t be a lot of crimes we can&#x27;t solve. At first probably just used to catch high profile killers because they won&#x27;t want the knowledge out that they can track anyone. So it will be used to track down high profile targets who won&#x27;t have much of a trial anyways. Then other countries will utilize the same technology and track down any dissidents. After some time and many other countries are using it and tracking becomes the normal and it is more accepted that you will be tracked then every day crimes can be persecuted. No more slow stopping at stop signs you better come to a full stop or an automated ticket can be sent to you. Pettie crimes like vandalism will be tracked down and people arrested. Of course then there will be private entities that launch their own satellites and begin tracking people. Want to know where your spouse goes, no problem for a monthly fee. Track your teen sure. Safety monitoring of old grandma would be a nice one now she won&#x27;t wander. What neighborhood is a person driving in from a nice neighborhood well I will push the penthouse suit and extra  amenities since they can afford it. Those are just a few of the ideas I thought of.')
