Quite similar to a stroke victim, that relearns speech, by &quot;re-purposing&quot; a different brain area.<p>Fasting indicates a food scarce environment, so the brain might do the same thing every body does - and reduce calorie consumption in all areas, including the brain. So the &quot;reconnection&quot; might just be a side-effect of the &quot;down-sizing&quot;.')
