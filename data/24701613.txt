I&#x27;d love to use Wayland for everyday use but the libinput touchpad drivers are impossible.<p>Like you stated, the big problem is very fine movements just don&#x27;t work in libinput. On X11&#x2F;synaptics I can make movements as fine as rolling my fingertip in place on the touchpad, or drawing a minuscule circle, and it will pick it up. Libinput on the same touchpad does nothing, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s stuck in molasses. And libinput has almost no configuration options so there&#x27;s nothing I can even tweak.<p>I really hope they address this soon, or I&#x27;ll be stuck on X11 forever!<p>Edit: I&#x27;m using a Thinkpad P1 Gen2, a top-tier recent-gen workstation laptop, and this is a big enough problem where it&#x27;s forcing me to use X11 on Ubuntu 20.04.')
