That way you can see how things are changing at each hop—if my network isn’t working perfectly, I always jump to mtr rather than ping, because it shows me whether the problem is between my laptop and the router, the router and the ISP, the ISP and the world, or near the end server. For best results you’d probably want a full 3D chart rather than just side-by-side 2D charts which is the best you could do in a terminal.')
