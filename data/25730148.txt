Absolutely loved it!<p>WSP (World Standard Pinning) &quot;standardization&quot; story with management naive dreams of selling own products in Asia without cannibalizing home European market while simultaneously moving Consumer Hardware Development to Asia .. where all the hardware was thereafter designed with Asian parts first was priceless.<p>Philips TV division deciding to second source, skipping Philips Tuners division thus eroding own company market share and profit. Then in turn Philips Tuners division commissioning a cheaper clone of Philips MOPLL from Siemens with a huge minimal volume quota, consequently eroding Philips Semiconductors market share by 25% and forcing Tuner division to manufacture inferior products with already obsolete part. Just beautiful, &lt;Chef&#x27;s Kiss&gt;, Pure genius!<p>&gt; The most devastating development, however, was purely internal and of severe structural impact.')
