I&#x27;ve tested this recently and it uses a different ephemeral source IPv4 after a few minutes when doing this.  Tested with HTTP, HTTPS and ICMP ECHO.  It is definitely NAT.<p>At the same time, my connections from the phone to IPv6-only web are not using NAT.  The server sees the same source IPv6 as the phone reports as its own.<p>When I enable tethering on my phone, it creates a local IPv4 wireless LAN.  Devices on that LAN such as my laptop access the web using IPv4, which is NAT&#x27;d twice: Once on the phone when crossing from the WLAN to the cell network, then by the cell service provider to get an ephemeral source IPv4.  This is double NAT.<p>When the Linux VM on my laptop connects to an internet service and I&#x27;m using the Wifi hotspot on my phone, there&#x27;s yet another NAT in the way, on the laptop itself.  This is triple NAT.<p>All this NAT means it doesn&#x27;t matter so much that we are out of IPv4 addresses for phones.  They can connect to both IPv4-only and IPv6-only services while assigned only a public IPv6.<p>In fact phones don&#x27;t need a public IPv6 either.  They don&#x27;t need any public address.<p>Those NAT&#x27;d IPv4 connections don&#x27;t go over the IPv6 link.  They are not being translated to IPv6 and back.  Rather, they go over what is effectively a private IPv4 tunnel to the cell provider.  Just as IPv4 connections can work like that, so could IPv6 so there&#x27;s no real need for the phone to report that it has any public IPv6 or IPv4 address at all.<p>However, mine is currently reporting a public IPv6 and no IPv4, while able to make connections to both.')
