I like Linux&#x27;s a-la-carte container APIs but their flexibility seems to increase complexity, as you end up dealing with multiple namespaces as well as cgroups, etc..<p>Then there are Kubernetes and Docker which add a lot of complexity on top, while providing some levels of abstraction which don&#x27;t entirely eliminate the need for understanding the underlying internals.<p>Having some more mid-level container and networking APIs would be nice, but I&#x27;m not sure it would solve the complexity problem.<p>Guaranteed employment for networking&#x2F;container&#x2F;linux experts I guess.')
