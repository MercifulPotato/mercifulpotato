Specifically the pgup&#x2F;dn, ctrl+a navigation things. Ctrl+a works in every text editing context ever, that it suddenly means &#x27;this paragraph only&#x27; gets me every time.<p>I&#x27;d love for these to be fixed and the performance to be improved, but Notion is a great tool. We ran our whole startup on it, and I recommend it to everyone.')
