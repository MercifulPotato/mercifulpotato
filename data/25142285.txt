All M1 Macs come with Thunderbolt 4 ports.<p>I think there&#x27;s some nuance and technicality to this, because even though the ports themselves could meet Thunderbolt 4 specs under different conditions, they don&#x27;t in the current configurations. Apple deliberately calls these &quot;Thunderbolt &#x2F; USB 4&quot; ports, leaving out the version number from Thunderbolt. One of the requirements of a Thunderbolt 4 port is it can drive 2 4k displays, which Apple is very clear it cannot in the current models. So, that alone makes these not Thunderbolt 4. I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s tested the rest of the Thunderbolt 4 features to know which ones are and aren&#x27;t present.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newsroom.intel.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;11&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;thunderbolt4-comparison-chart.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newsroom.intel.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;11&#x2F;2020&#x2F;...</a>')
