The difference is the part that actually motivates you to pay an affiliate.<p>&gt; We have already established it is on other stores.<p>When you look at other services that are just doing payment&#x2F;download, it&#x27;s far cheaper than 30%.<p>&gt; You can choose not to do business with Apple.<p>That doesn&#x27;t disagree with what I said, which is that you can&#x27;t choose the type of relationship with Apple.<p>&gt; You can. You can not deal with the app store.<p>&quot;Take it or leave it&quot; is the opposite of choosing the type of relationship.  I&#x27;m so confused by your response here.<p>&gt; No we cannot agree. Firstly 90% is not viable to anyone, nobody would agree to that and people wouldn&#x27;t publish on the app store. So to start your premise is completely absurd.<p>It&#x27;s not absurd.  People still made apps when the market was a lot smaller.  People make apps for android.  If revenue is greater than cost, then apps will get made.  And a cut like that would remove a lot of competition, so the actual drop in pay wouldn&#x27;t be as extreme.<p>But okay, what if I said 75% instead?  If you get 3x the market share while getting paid 25% of gross revenue, you actually make more money than if you were paid 70% on 1x market share.  So there would <i>absolutely</i> be viable apps for some developers.  But at the same time, if Apple took a 75% cut that would be <i>unreasonable</i>.<p>&gt; The vast majority of would just pull their apps and Apple would have to lower the rate again.<p>They wouldn&#x27;t if Apple was really committed.  The app already exists, removing it would mean less money.<p>&gt; Now if another player releases a new phone with a store and they have a better market rate and a decent market share then Apple will lower their rates (like Nintendo did).<p>Even with a better rate, Android&#x27;s app payment market is smaller.  It wouldn&#x27;t do enough to make the apps there significantly better, and the number of people willing to switch off iphone for the marginal difference wouldn&#x27;t do anything.')
