Take Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for example. What is the mechanism for the disease? We don&#x27;t know. But the consensus is it&#x27;s not amyloid plaques, based on the most recent data. Some scientists think it still is, but the consensus is it&#x27;s not.<p>The scientific justification we have (in the situation you describe) for our belief comes from the data, not the the consensus.<p>&gt;Scientific truth is not black and white but rather shades of gray. Yes, some things we know the absolute truth (or rather there is so much evidence that it&#x27;s unlikely it&#x27;s wrong), but there is plenty that we&#x27;re just &quot;pretty sure&quot; and that&#x27;s typically based on consensus.<p>On the one hand you speak of scientific truth, on the other hand you speak of what we say we know. It&#x27;s important to consider these things separately. While what we say we know is often based on what we perceive as a consensus view, scientific truth is not. Yes, a person might be pretty sure that the speed of light is three hundred million meters per second because that is what he perceives to be the consensus among physicists. But the &quot;scientific truth&quot;, to whatever extent it is an actual thing, is determined by other factors.<p>Of course, consensus plays a part in the scientific process. When doing research scientists take into consideration scientific consensus. But when it comes to the strength of a scientific theory, consensus is irrelevant. That is determined by things like how much empirical evidence is there that the theory is correct? Are there simpler explanations? etc.')
