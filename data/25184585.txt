And I do not think it&#x27;s at all unreasonable to suspect that the bird learns that putting a piece of trash in a slot yields 1 foot pellet, so if they tear the trash in two they can get 2 pellets.<p>A crow at the beginning of this talk figured out how to bend a metal wire to use as a tool when a straight wire wouldn&#x27;t work.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0fiAoqwsc9g&amp;t=17s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0fiAoqwsc9g&amp;t=17s</a><p>And the crow in this video figures out how to drink water at the bottom of a bottle by displacing it with pebbles.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xVSr22kqSOs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xVSr22kqSOs</a>')
