Most startups can&#x27;t afford that, so they will never run POWER hardware, and the startups of today are the big corporations of tomorrow. POWER will likely disappear just like &quot;minicomputers&quot; did.<p>This makes me think of Apple making their ecosystem increasingly more locked in and restrictive. The result is that Apple devices become increasingly less fun for developers to play with. The end result is that more developers will migrate towards Linux. These people will then be less likely to develop software for Apple.')
