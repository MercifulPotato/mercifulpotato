It&#x27;ll also help tremendously when staff changes, and you can do things like &quot;rotate all keys every quarter&quot;<p>- separate API keys for different services and environments means that even if your staging network-layer key is exposed, it can&#x27;t affect your staging database (= data), nor your production database (= critical data).<p>- I&#x27;ve used &quot;search for AWS secrets&quot; as a pre-commit and also CI hook with great luck. I&#x27;ve even accidentally added a secret myself :) but with the checks the error was immediately found. No problems!')
