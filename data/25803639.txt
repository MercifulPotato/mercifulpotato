Given government commitments to these things, consumer demand for them, and actual technological progress, this seems extremely exciting to me.<p>We will see AI become adopted in healthcare, long-term care homes, and other facilities where humans interact with AI on a regular basis. I think this will come in the late 2020s, and will be driven by the demographic changes that are affecting every major country in the world (i.e., significant declines in working populations relative to older groups).<p>Related to the above, I think countries will aggressively compete for skilled immigrants. This will lead to significant changes in tax policy, immigration policy, etc. I consider immigration like this a hedge against the risk that productivity doesn&#x27;t actually improve (as per the paragraph above).<p>I also personally think major developments in space are overblown until we figure out a cheaper&#x2F;more effective way of launching into space or manufacturing in space. This will happen, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be in the 2020s. I wrote an entire business plan for space-based mining a year ago that convinced me of this and am happy to discuss it.')
