I&#x27;ve done a fair number of benchmarking of different CPU architectures and never seen a latency lower than 60ns or so.  My jaw dropped when I saw the M1 chasing pointers on large random array (much bigger than cache) at 30ns or so.  That&#x27;s a pretty amazing latency for l1 cache miss, l2 cache miss, and retrieving a cache line from main memory.')
