The obvious pros are I don&#x27;t need to commute or really drive at all, I can work from bed (probably doesn&#x27;t matter to most, but I&#x27;ve got 10 screws in my spine from past surgeries and it matters to me), and I can live in a 3,000 square foot 4-story townhouse within spitting distance of downtown for less than my sisters in California pay for a third of the space in the middle of nowhere.<p>I don&#x27;t really see any cons or hurdles, honestly. Timezone coordination is clearly harder for the people on the coasts, but I&#x27;m right in the middle anyway. I have a security clearance and some of my software is deployed into a classified runtime environment, so not having access to a SCIF without traveling does make that challenging, but I imagine that specific challenge doesn&#x27;t generalize much and doesn&#x27;t apply to you.')
