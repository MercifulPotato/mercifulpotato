Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605031832, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25048751, text='&gt; Does that mean whenever medical information is sent via phone or Fax, HIPAA is being violated today?<p>Phone and fax are not considered “electronic” under HIPAA, so the rules, including the rule regarding encryption for exposed PHI to be considered secured vs. unsecured, specific to electronic communication don&#x27;t apply. I think they may be explicitly given special treatment for some of the not-electronic-specific rules, too. They are well-known to be legacy loopholes to HIPAA privacy&#x2F;security rules, which is one of the reasons fax held on so long in healthcare as a way of minimizing compliance costs.<p>You absolutely should not try to intuit what HIPAA requires for anything else by how fax and phone communication in healthcare operates.')
