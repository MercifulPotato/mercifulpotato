Several C++20 features like Modules and co-routines were driven by their VC++ implementations.<p>Apple, the company hated over here by bringing the end of open platforms, without it LLVM and clang wouldn&#x27;t ever exist.<p>Google, the spying company and forking Linux with Android, the second major clang and llvm contributor.<p>IBM and Red-Hat, with their own Linux agenda pushing stuff like systemd hated over here, major GCC contributors.<p>You are missing the whole point with Java, it isn&#x27;t about Java, rather all mainstream languages just like Java only move forward with dirty money (from HN point of view), but hey it is cool to hate Oracle.<p>Hint they are one of the first enterprise contributors to the Linux kernel and have been ever since.<p>Do you also feel like removing Oracle contributions from the Linux kernel?')
