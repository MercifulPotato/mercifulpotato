Item(by='scoutt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602512490, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24754182, text='Maybe, but what checks would the compiler do on my small embedded memory for a program that processes a sensor and raises a pin? It might sound simple but it&#x27;s an important core project.<p>Would the compiler check a write outside the buffer that is filled with sensor data? Is that it? I&#x27;m not allocating anything so I cannot double free. The program executes in a main loop so there is no data races (perhaps one if the data buffer is shared with an interrupt, but it&#x27;s a problem as old as the bible and we already have 1000 libraries with safe circular buffers).<p>Or is the check done at runtime? Will it waste my cycles?<p><i>Is that all I should change my language for?</i><p>Would the sensor manufacturer help me if I give them a failing case written in Rust?<p>Is it worth the risk of compiling on a nightly thing that will change next week? Note that people might get hurt for real.<p>Damn! Now my MCU&#x2F;sensor is going NRND. Should I freak out because Rust is still not supported for that new MCU yet, and I should write the thing all over again?')
