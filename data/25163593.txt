Item(by='bsder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605898435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159796, text='&gt; Things changed when I found out about the existence of the applied psychology category.<p>Really?  That&#x27;s the epiphany?  Um, okay.<p>Reading is like wine--you need to figure out what suits <i>your</i> palate.  I don&#x27;t understand why teachers don&#x27;t assign way more short stories to read.  This is how you figure out &quot;Hey, I <i>liked</i> that story, what else has that author done?&quot;<p>However, the <i>real</i> trick to reading is to realize that &quot;Yes, the books you are assigned to read in high school really <i>ARE</i> crap.&quot;<p>&quot;Tale of Two Cities&quot; by Dickens is a wonderful book buried in a sea of irrelevant chapters he got paid by the word to write.  &quot;Tom Jones&quot; is basically a 1749 soap opera.  Anything modern (&lt;30 years) is almost <i>guaranteed</i> to be crap.  (Norma Fox Mazer was big when I was in school and was complete garbage in my estimation.  A funny story was I unknowingly told her this to her face when I was in 7th grade--don&#x27;t ask teenage boys what they think as they may very well tell you the unvarnished truth.)<p>Books that are <i>interesting</i> for a teenager to read are probably 1) lowbrow (ummm, what&#x27;s wrong with that?) 2) controversial on some axis and 3) quite often outside the level of the average English teacher to comprehend.<p>I suspect that Number 3 is the worst offender.<p>&quot;Caunterbury Tales&quot; is <i>satire</i> and needs a teacher who can point things out (Why does a &quot;chaste&quot; priest have the symptoms of syphilis--a sexually transmitted disease?  Erm, that&#x27;s a touch controversial, no?)  Anything having a <i>slight</i> science bent is just completely beyond most English teachers--so sci-fi simply isn&#x27;t on the menu (even though you have stuff like &quot;The Forever War&quot; which is basically an indictment of the Vietnam War).  And, heaven, help us, if the book has even a hint of human sexuality about it <i>GASP</i>--especially if such hint isn&#x27;t precisely mainstream.')
