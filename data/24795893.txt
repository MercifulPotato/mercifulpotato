Is there ECS support for Fargate, specifically, and how does waypoint exec (for a shell) work if Fargate is supported? We hacked a bastion container together using SSM remote activation, and it feels so brittle.<p>2. If I want to deploy multiple versions of my app into the same VPC is that possible? My use case is having 1 giant VPC&#x2F;RDS that multiple app&#x2F;feature versions will take a slice off and use. Rather than setting up a VPC + all services per staging&#x2F;feature environment.<p>3. Is there support for dynamic URLs using native cloud tools? For example, I&#x27;d love to use ALB auto-provisioned certs and carve off dynamic URLs on a subdomain.<p>Thanks :)')
