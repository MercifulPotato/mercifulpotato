Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25936251], score=None, time=1611792711, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25936013, text='&gt; There is nothing wrong with the word retard.<p>Well, sure, in that it&#x27;s a word with lots of nonproblematic uses.<p>&gt; It’s a legitimate dictionary word.<p>This implies probably a more normative role for dictionaries than is appropriate, but, sure, it is. However, as a noun applied to people (as distinct from the verb meaning “to slow down” or the noun meaning “a slowing down”) it’s one which every dictionary I can find flags explicitly as “offensive”, so insofar as one uses dictionaries as arbiters of usage, I think there clearly is a problem with the <i>use</i> of “retards” in question.')
