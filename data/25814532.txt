The claim at the time was that Segwit and LN were sufficient to solve all the scaling issues, the hardforks were going to solve anyways with their block size increase. It also falsely states that the hard forks take up more hard disk space, when in fact BTC still takes more...<p>- The hashrate comparison, the way it is charted is completely nonsensical, between BTC &amp; ETH... it is quite literally comparing apples to oranges, their POW algorithms are completely different from one another and cannot be compared in hash&#x2F;s terms. They are each respectively at the top of their hash domains. I&#x27;m doubtful this is due to ignorance, but moreso malice. Would love to see BTC miners do a 50% attack on ETH, which the author is essentially trying to instill into the minds of readers.')
