When you do machine learning and you have to deal with large models and datasets, loading them each time you save your code and triggering a unit test really gets tedious. You can definitely do it with caching and reducing the dataset size, but it only gets you so far IMO. There&#x27;s nothing like being to inspect the state of your environment. Particularly when it takes a long time to create that state.')
