The first is that some smart tvs refuse to complete the setup process without an internet connection. Until the setup process is completed, you cannot use the tv. A few people also mentioned older smart tvs effectively becoming bricked because the manufacturer&#x27;s servers were shutoff, which put their tv into a mode of demanding internet access or the user couldn&#x27;t use the tv. The second issue is that some tvs will connect to any open network it can find. If your neighbors or anyone nearby has an open connection, the tv will make use of it. Some theorize that eventually smart tvs will have cellular modems included, so they won&#x27;t even need to use your home network to phone home. Don&#x27;t believe any tv has been seen in the wild with a cell modem yet.')
