Using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flutter-webrtc&#x2F;flutter-webrtc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flutter-webrtc&#x2F;flutter-webrtc</a> I was able to pull something together that works on Android, iOS and native. Best of all is that I wrote&#x2F;prototyped in the web. My hope is that between this and Pion we can make WebRTC more accessible.<p>If you are familiar with WebRTC these are some of the features that excited me.<p>* Trickle ICE<p>* Re-negotiation<p>* Multiple inbound&#x2F;outbound tracks per PeerConnection<p>* No codec restriction per call. You can have H264 and VP8 in the same conference.<p>* Low LoC. 160 (Frontend) and 350 (Backend). At those numbers I think it is easy enough for a beginner to jump in and make changes&#x2F;build something cool.')
