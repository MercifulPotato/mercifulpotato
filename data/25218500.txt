What we care about is the expression of life, we don&#x27;t write laws to protect &#x27;random bags of talking jelly&#x27; - our entire cultural foundation surrounds this notion of our being alive. And FYI - most common definitions of life exhibit this &#x27;consciousness&#x27; problem, in that they may use biological terms, reproduction, all of that, but it&#x27;s ultimately mechanical and materialist.<p>Valuing life is a purely emotional and cultural thing. We care more about the lives of our relatives and friends than random strangers but we also care more about random strangers because they are the same species as us than we care about the lives of other species.<p>Sometimes humans (by that I mean the Nazis) think other humans (e.g. Jews) are &quot;inhuman&quot; and deserve death as a punishment. (e.g. Holocaust)<p>There is obviously no scientific basis in valuing life. It&#x27;s a choice everyone makes for themselves.<p>The HN submission about male chicks being shredded or even gassed is basically the same thing as the Holocaust but for chicken. Industrial killing of life, yet we don&#x27;t care as long as we get our eggs.<p>Thousands of years ago the world used to be lawless even for humans. Tribes were constantly engaging in violent conflicts. They didn&#x27;t care one bit about the life of someone or something they deemed unimportant.<p>We care about life because we are selfish and if someone takes a life away that we care about we want to satisfy our selfishness and engage in revenge against the killer.')
