If they make optimizations they <i>know</i> work on their CPUs but can&#x27;t guarantee AMD CPUs will work exactly the same, I also don&#x27;t find fault in them only supporting their CPUs with those optimizations.<p>Where I find fault is bullshit marketing saying their CPUs are x% faster than AMD and then point to code compiled with their compiler. I&#x27;d be fine if they wanted to say ICC produced faster results than GCC or LLVM. There&#x27;s no problem selling your CPU with your compiler to get the best performance possible.<p>Instead they&#x27;re saying our chips are <i>faster</i> than AMD. Full stop. Once you wade into the bullshit you see they&#x27;re using ICC with FMV enabled. This means even if you know what compiler flags they used you still can&#x27;t be sure what code is running on each CPU. It&#x27;s bullshit marketing and I think it needs to be called out whenever it happens.')
