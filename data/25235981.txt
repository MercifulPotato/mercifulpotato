I do see them in the road.  e-bikes that comply with the existing laws have similar capabilities to mopeds yet people ride them on bike paths.<p>Another dimension of this phenomenon is electric cars.  Teslas are somehow synonymous with &quot;self-driving&quot; even though they could have the same capabilities with gas motors.<p>Somehow electric motors are translating to &quot;new rules&quot; even though we have existing rules that apply.<p>&gt; At 20MPH your turbo assist turns off completely leaving the rider in this weird state where 1MPH slower is easy and 1MPH faster is brutal. If you are going 30MPH anywhere on this, it&#x27;s because you are a world-class cyclist or are going downhill.<p>A buddy of mine bought an e-bike this summer that can go 30mph for 30 miles.  I see bikes like this on the local bike path regularly.<p>&gt; People ride on roads with no education all the time, we call them drivers. People going 20MPH on a 30 pound bike aren&#x27;t dangerous to others. People surfing the web while driving a 6 ton truck are dangerous to everyone.<p>What?  Where can you drive a car without taking a driving test and getting a license?<p>30lb bikes going 20mph are <i>absolutely</i> a threat to pedestrians.<p>Inattentive drivers are dangerous but that&#x27;s entirely irrelevant to this conversation outside of it being a reason people are scared to ride their electric motorcycles in the road.')
