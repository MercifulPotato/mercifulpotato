The article made it clear he did not. Did Gruber invent the name &quot;Markdown&quot; from whole cloth? No, it is a pun based on the word &quot;markup&quot;. Did the Standard Markdown consortium make changes that broke compatibility with Gruber&#x27;s users? No, because nobody was using Gruber&#x27;s perl parser. Were they competing with the standard Gruber wrote? No, because he never wrote a standard.<p>The article spends a great deal of time explaining how markdown codified existing conventions. It describes, not invents. Gruber didn&#x27;t create markdown, because it already existed. Should he then hold the privilege to control it in perpetuity?')
