IF data storage and&#x2F;or social media can be viewed as critical digital infrastructure, an argument can and will likely be made that the services are tantamount to a digital company owned town. We&#x27;ll see! Either way it&#x27;s very interesting and highly relevant to the industry.<p>Seems like the core of your argument is that private companies could be subject to constitutional protections if they got too big enough&#x2F;powerful.<p>Even ignoring that you&#x27;ve essentially invented a new interpretation of US law&#x2F;ignored all existing precedent, the fact that AWS (32% market share) isn&#x27;t a monopoly by either common definition or as defined by federal law completely undercuts even such a novel legal theory.<p>So you&#x27;re on the outskirts of both law and basic facts here.')
