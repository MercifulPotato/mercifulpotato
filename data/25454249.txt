The only real reasons left to use C in the wild are:<p>* Legacy code<p>* Embedded (including drivers, bare metal etc.)<p>* Portability, FFI, etc.<p>Performance used to be another major reason, but in $CURRENT_YEAR, if that&#x27;s your goal, C++ and Rust are just as performant and there&#x27;s very little reason not to opt into them.<p>The other major reason to learn C is that it&#x27;s a great &quot;hardcore introductory&quot; language that will expose you to foundational concepts like pointers and memory management (it&#x27;s really hard to understand what problems Rust is trying to solve if you&#x27;re not familiar with malloc and free, for instance), but if you&#x27;re already programming that&#x27;s less of an issue.')
