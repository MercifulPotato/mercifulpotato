Low carb diets work, low fat diet work, intermittent fasting works, plain old fasting works, McDonald&#x27;s diet and Twinkie diets work<p>And none of them creates sustainable long term weight loss. Overwhelming majority of people who loose weight, gain it again. Keeping diets long term means that they feel bad all the time, you are tired etc. And you fail the moment keeping diet is not priority number one.<p>Which leads to search for something that will work long term for majority of people.')
