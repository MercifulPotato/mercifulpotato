Though it isn&#x27;t thightly locked with the whole STX-side of things which isn&#x27;t as interesting to me.<p>Only needing some &quot;dumb&quot; storage media to store your application data and &quot;cloud&quot; files unlocks suddenly a user-centric way for everyone to store data. It also unlocks real competition on the infrastructure layer.<p>You don&#x27;t make your own generator and make your own power, -- you don&#x27;t buy power from say Dell because it needs &quot;Dell electricity&quot;. Data should be like this too, ability to be owned and controlled purely by the user (as in you have solar panels + battery) or what most people would do: delegate the work to a power provider.<p>Ofc not real competition in the &quot;power provider&quot; case since there&#x27;s physical stuff happening, but for data storage (and batch&#x2F;&quot;offline&quot; computation and event&#x2F;webhook handling) a user will be able to set up their own raspberry pi or just use say Amazon to store the encrypted data. :)<p>I find it fits 100% in to the world I&#x27;d want to live in. ^_^')
