I had a previous account that for some reason I dropped before this one. I believe that account also only accrued one or two comments over the course of a few years, as well.<p>I happily lurk and consume along with the other 99%.[1] In part, this is because when I read HN, I attempt to stay on the front page for the sake of time and though I appreciate those who sort by new and filter what gets to my eyes, it&#x27;s rare that a conversation is fresh enough that it makes it worthwhile to comment in terms of viewership, nor that it&#x27;s valuable enough insight to take up someone else&#x27;s finite resource pool of time to read.<p>It seems upon personal review that by posting I may now have committed violence twice today on that valuable resource. My apologies. I&#x27;ll attempt to post less regularly or more profoundly in the future.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)</a>')
