Now, I&#x27;m a casual gamers, I haven&#x27;t bought hardware since PS2 and play games on my mobile occasionally, but I have been blown away my Stadia. I simply cannot get my head around how it can stream a game, in 4K, to my TV.<p>I recently purchased Cyberpunk 2077 and was stunned at the amount of complaining about poor graphics, glitches, gameplay etc. as I have experienced none of those.<p>As for latency and lag, my most popular game to play is PUBG, which is any game should suffer from those issues you&#x27;d think it would be a multiplayer, battle royale game like PUBG. But no, other than being very bad at it, I&#x27;ve never experienced what feels like input lag or latency issues.<p>Sales pitch over!')
