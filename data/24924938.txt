It would have to be in the form of permanent reforestation, and I don&#x27;t think anyone can credibly promise that.<p>The climeworks program looks like exactly the kind of thing I&#x27;m looking for, however, so thanks for pointing that out. My CO2 emissions are on the order of 10 tons per year, going by the average per capita number, so that would be around $10,000 per year, with no tax deduction available (my marginal tax is 40%). Also, looks like their pilot plant sequesters 50 tons per year, corresponding to the output of five people.<p>But it&#x27;s very much the right type of idea.')
