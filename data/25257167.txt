The <i>cheapest</i>, crappiest, smallest house in a neighborhood like Santa Monica (which is nice, but not Bel Air or Malibu nice) is $1 million dollars. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t complain, because I have friends in San Francisco that have it even worse. The &quot;making six figures and living with 4 roommates&quot; is basically a meme at this point if you live and work in SF.<p>The solution here is to move to Austin (which a ton of people have been doing recently) or just travel the world because, thankfully, I can do my job remotely (but <i>many</i> people cannot). This was actually my plan, but the pandemic kind of killed that -- maybe next year.')
