But the second example seems to suffer from the defect of the first. Removing default contracts and representing fixed contracts as intervals leaves it possible that these fixed contracts can overlap....which is probably...undesirable?<p>In that case, applying the remedy of the first example (a set of dates, and inferring that every 2nd (even zero length, to account for adjacent fixed) interval will be default,) introduces another bug where if you lop off any random date in that set or list, you invert everything.<p>I love the concept represented here, it <i>is</i> akin to normalization as in...simplify the representation so no redundancy is introduced as this usually leads to better results...but it seems it&#x27;s no guarantee of better results.<p>But maybe that&#x27;s just because the &quot;model&quot; we are simplifying from was not an optimal representation. Perhaps there&#x27;s a better model of the second example that doesn&#x27;t end up with the defect of the first example.<p>I really like this article but am struck by how something that I wanted to be almost a silver bullet trick for modeling, ends up being a mass of compromises mired in tradeoffs that doesn&#x27;t show any clear way forward in the general case. Still, probably a good rule of thumb, but I guess this rule is not optimal...as it can have so many unworkable misinterpretations&#x2F;misapplications.<p>It would be cool to see a list of, like, &quot;Programming Heuristics&quot;, ranked by decreasing general applicability, of which this rule was a member somewhere far down the list.')
