Those options basically amount to prescribing drugs or becoming a friend for hire, not changing the structure of society.<p>And there are plenty of therapists (and researchers) who would definitely say that the quality of the relationship with a depressed patient makes or breaks treatment, in many cases it actually is the distinguishing factor. At the very least, it&#x27;s a necessary one.<p>&quot;The literature&quot; isn&#x27;t even clear on what major depressive disorder is. Well, the clinical definition is clear: literally sadness&#x2F;low mood for at least 2 weeks. But what does that mean?<p>I guess what I really mean to say here is that we have essentially created a situation where people are pushed toward being alone. Then when a whole bunch of them feel empty about their state of being, we assign the label of &quot;depressed&quot; on them and give them drugs that are only barely effective. The lucky ones can afford to buy someone who basically takes the place of a close friend or parent. We have no framework to describe this state of affairs because every single one of us only has our permanently modern society as a point of reference.<p>It&#x27;s easy to forget that the human brain is not designed to live the way we live. It&#x27;s designed to spend every waking moment together with a very small group&#x2F;family, always outdoors together, always doing something entirely tangible and physical together. Seeing a stranger was a rare occurrence. Imagine that!<p>&quot;Sadness&quot; happens when someone close dies. &quot;Depression&quot; happens when a huge number of human relationships that the brain needs get replaced by vastly inferior alternatives -- coworkers, social media, video game friends, service workers, etc. Nothing else but modern society creates this.')
