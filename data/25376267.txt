Item(by='glitcher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607622418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25375672, text='&gt; Usually people point to the judges&#x27; casual dismissal, as justification for their own casual dismissal<p>I can&#x27;t say how usual this is without evidence, but sounds like you might be casually dismissing other peoples&#x27; thought processes, including the judges.<p>I think some of the issues and concerns being raised absolutely should be looked into, and at minimum they should help inform us on how to improve election processes going forward. But the bar for deciding to throw out votes needs to be very high, so I expect the evidence required to reach that level to go far beyond seemingly legitimate witness complaints. Those complaints seem like a great starting point for investigators though, and it&#x27;s beyond my expertise to evaluate them myself.<p>Unfortunately we also have an administration coming at these issues in rather dubious ways, which seems to harm their efforts for seeking out the truth. It makes me suspicious they are really only seeking their version of the truth, otherwise why would they be arriving at such strong conclusions _before_ enough evidence has been gathered to determine real, quantifiable effects of specific events? If I have a hypothesis and want to legitimately evaluate it by gathering facts and then I proceed to announce conclusions before the evidence has been gathered and vetted, I would be correctly dismissed as biased and only looking to advance my own agenda, not seeking the truth.')
