Docker and all (edit: some!) of the GNU tools won&#x27;t work for a while on the Macbook.<p>What I would suggest, if your target is Linux and your tooling allows, is to develop directly on the cloud. It is completely seamless with Visual Studio Code. You can run edit your files, build your code, run it and debug it on a cloud VM just like you would do it locally. It also means that it doesn&#x27;t really matter how fast (and expensive) your Notebook is, since all the real work takes place in the cloud. Not sure how well other development environments support it though.<p>Another issue you may run into is that none of the ARM Macbooks support two external screens. You can only use a single screen, plus the built-in screen. I don&#x27;t mind, since I prefer to use a single widescreen, but I know a lot of people who work with 2 monitor setups.')
