Lastpass - Use your browser&#x27;s built in manager. Chrome has a custom sync password and Firefox has a master password option. One less extension.<p>4. HTTPs everywhere can be avoided if you use Brave, as it automatically upgrades to HTTPs when available. You can set dom.security.https_only_mode to true in Firefox for a https only browsing experience.<p>5. Decentraleyes - Not that useful as it doesn&#x27;t contain too many cached resources. Use LocalCDN if absolutely insist on using something similar.<p>6. Nimbus Screenshot - Screenity (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alyssaxuu&#x2F;screenity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alyssaxuu&#x2F;screenity</a>) is open source and much better.<p>The more extensions you install, the more people you are trusting not to sell out. Most of these extensions request access to all sites (passwords, cookies, browsing history). Try to keep the number of extensions as low as possible.<p>Productivity extensions usually lead to more wastage of time. I do not recommend anything. Use whatever you like.')
