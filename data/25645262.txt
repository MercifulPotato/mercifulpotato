I could offer my own for a quick startup. Mailing patches to each other, Linux kernel style, is not a viable backup plan. The cultural gap is too wide.<p>If Travis is down we can run tests locally.<p>We build the deployment artifact on one of our servers. If that one is down probably our production server is down too.<p>If Slack is down, ah, I was on vacation yesterday. I guess the fastest backup for us would be WhatsApp Web.')
