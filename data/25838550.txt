Which isn&#x27;t to say that it applies here. Simply pointing out that stripping out context can lead to false equivalences is lazy, it needs to be shown.<p>Each of these things certainly has a context that can be gone and read. That&#x27;s why I included sources rather than not including them. There&#x27;s also Google.<p>In addition I&#x27;d simply say that whatever your perspective on context is and how it applies to calls to violence and interpretations thereof, that it should be applied equally to all sources from all sides. This doesn&#x27;t really seem to be what is happening, which is the largest factor in what seems to me a rather clear observation that the newsmedia&#x27;s portrayal, and those who promote it and give it reach uncritically, are full of shit.')
