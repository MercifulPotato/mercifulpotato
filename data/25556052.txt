That far too many usages of macros in the Lisps were for performance rather than for abstraction.<p>In modern languages, though, macros are really the only way to get at something like the AST of a language and act like the original developers of the language.  I personally approve of this--the Go &quot;Me, but not for thee&quot; attitude of the language developers pisses me off.<p>However, given such power, usage of a macro should set off your &quot;I&#x27;m using a macro.  This language ecosystem is deficient somehow&quot;.  And that should give you pause and you should ask &quot;Am I really adding something to <i>this</i> language or am I just carrying over my habits from <i>other</i> languages?&quot;<p>Finally, using a macro merely for &quot;abstraction&quot; should set off gigantic klaxon warning bells.  A macro has to pass a <i>really</i> high bar if you could actually do the task with just functions and a little extra bit of keyboard typing.')
