These diversity training people do use a different definition of racism then what you are thinking of. The diversity training definition of racism doesn&#x27;t simply mean prejudiced, it means a part of a system of power that benefits people considered &quot;white&quot; at the expense of others. By that definition, most white people are probably &quot;racist&quot;. If you understand the context used when they call themselves &quot;racist&quot;, it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal. It&#x27;s basically just them saying, &quot;I&#x27;m white, and I recognize that society treats me a little bit better cause of that&quot;.<p>I will say, I think it&#x27;s strange they are asking them to admit to being racist, and &quot;be better&quot;. It&#x27;s a systemic thing, so it requires systemic change. Asking them to say they are racist and that they need to be better seems unneededly divisive.<p>Edit: As others have pointed out, the last sentence is kind of wrong. The paraphrase should probably say, &quot;I recognize I&#x27;m a part of a system or systems that uphold racism&quot;. Look at the ADL&#x27;s definition for racism to see what I mean:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adl.org&#x2F;racism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adl.org&#x2F;racism</a><p>By their definition, you are racist if you help uphold any of the &quot;systems, institutions, or factors that advantage white people and for people of color, cause widespread harm and disadvantages in access and opportunity.&quot;')
