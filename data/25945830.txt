I lost a bunch of weight on it. Then it seems that my body adapted and without changing the ingredients, my appetite returned, and so did the weight.<p>Something similar happened to me with a low carb paleo diet years later. I&#x27;ve had to become more extreme to succeed. But I think that&#x27;s because of the damage I&#x27;ve done to my own metabolism with a fork and spoon, and isn&#x27;t true for most people.<p>Most people, I think, would benefit greatly from changing to a complex carb diet from a Standard American Diet.')
