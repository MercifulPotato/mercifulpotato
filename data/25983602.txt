Obviously not.<p>It&#x27;s not obvious to me why not. It&#x27;s a trade-off. You put the responsibility on the user to keep their keys but you save a lot by not spending anything on solving fake or real issues like this.<p>In this case if you want assurances like this you can trust a third party that handles that stuff for you.')
