I’m reminded of a radio conversation with a derivatives trader after the financial crisis over a decade ago. They said they knew what they were doing was wrong (in the sense of being shoddy and unsustainable) but that it wasn’t worth the risk of sticking their head up to sound the alarm. It’s much safer to just try to ride the wave with everyone else.<p>Likewise I’ve worked with plenty who knowingly kept along the easy path when they knew it wasn’t the best for the organization. But it was easy and safe. Instead of following the cliche “nobody ever got fired for hiring IBM” they would have been a better leader if they followed the military aphorism of “taking the harder right” decision.')
