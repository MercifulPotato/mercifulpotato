Sympy allowed it to do symbolic modeling in parallel with numerical simulation; you could pick any two nodes in an arbitrary system and get the symbolic transfer function from one to the other, and generate Bode plots and such. For nonlinear systems it could linearize about some operating point, and for tuning, sympy helped derive an objective function to pass to the optimization routine.<p>Sympy was a little slow sometimes but very powerful and pretty easy to work with.<p>We&#x27;re considering open sourcing that project now; I just need to find time to support it.')
