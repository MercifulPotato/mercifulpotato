It&#x27;s got the &quot;accrete everyone else&#x27;s business processes&quot; problem that you mentioned, but it&#x27;s also got the problem that it&#x27;s quite spaghetti on the inside as well, probably for the usual reason - startup founders writing lots of code in a hurry and conflating the purpose of the software with its architecture due to being too close to the problem.  Compound that with the usual startup-in-growth problem of more people than necessary (with presumably very uneven capabilities) working on the codebase and you&#x27;ve got a recipe for a maintenance problem.<p>I do know that getting put in the jira team is one of the least fun parts of working for atlassian.')
