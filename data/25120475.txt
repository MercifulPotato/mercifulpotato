However, reality does not agree. Apparently, the law&#x2F;rules&#x2F;whatever state that a death must be reported within 14 days (I have no source for this). I do not know about deaths in general, but for Covid-19 deaths in that Excel sheet on the Arcgis site, the death count takes about 10 days to stabilize. (Why? My guess would be: because public health care in Sweden is managed by the 21(?) regions, each with their on systems for everything.)')
