There&#x27;s no justification for that, and it&#x27;s a far cry from &quot;justice.&quot;<p>Disrupting law and order - by definition - turns you into a criminal.<p>I&#x27;m not defending any side of the political spectrum, so it&#x27;s interesting to see how people interpret this argument.<p>Manifesting for social change never justifies the type of chaos we saw last year, and if you think otherwise, don&#x27;t complain about what happened to Congress.')
