Everything is more expensive, taxes are much higher, traffic is 10x as bad, homelessness is more severe... Who&#x27;s this &quot;house of cards&quot; supporting?<p>The minimum wage is up, that&#x27;s the only thing, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. Since a couple making minimum wage could actually have an apartment in 2008, which is not the case now.')
