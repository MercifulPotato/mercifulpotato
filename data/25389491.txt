I mean, it&#x27;s possible that they actually end up going through with a complete exit on Dec 31.  My guess, however, is that there will be ongoing negotiations for a long time to come.  The UK is likely to be out but only in the sense that they don&#x27;t now get to vote on EU resolutions.  They&#x27;ll likely make negotiations with the EU which end up putting them right back where they were (regulation wise).<p>That&#x27;s my expectation at least.  They may feel the full pain of a full exit on Dec 31, I doubt they&#x27;ll want to continue in that state for very long.<p>There&#x27;s also the possibility of yet another extension on the transition period.')
