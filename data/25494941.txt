Item(by='SAI_Peregrinus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608559001, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486017, text='This is called &quot;Understanding How AES Encryption Works&quot;, but it doesnt describe that.<p>AES is a &quot;block cipher&quot;, a primitive that approximates a pseudorandom permutation (PRP) and can be used to build a variety of functions. E.g. AEADs like AES-CCM and AES-GCM, encryption like AES-CTR, message authentication codes like CMAC, hash functions like Whirlpool (that uses a modified AES), and random number generators like AES-DRBG. In theory one could even build a public-key signature scheme from AES: use it in a Sponge construction to make a hash function, then use that to construct a hash-based signature scheme. The only thing I don&#x27;t know how to build using just a PRP is a Key Encapsulation Mechanism.<p>This article is a bit like writing &quot;How To Program In C&quot; and talking about NAND gates and ALUs and instruction decoders.')
