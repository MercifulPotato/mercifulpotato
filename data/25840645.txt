As Winston Churchill once said...<i>”Never let a good crisis go to waste”</i> [1].<p>Democrats are seizing upon the opportunity created by this incident to permanently silence their opposition and attempt to cement long-term political power.  A former Facebook official has even publicly suggested that cable companies banish conservative news networks, and that Facebook and YouTube expel conservative influencers from their platforms, in reaction to the incident [2].<p>Attempting to silence and ostracize vast swaths of the population seems like it might backfire in pretty dramatic fashion.  Even Jack Dorsey acknowledged that we had entered into dangerous territory when Twitter blocked Trump and the rest of big tech killed Parler, and he seemed to suggest that the only long-term solution was decentralized social media [3] (something I have been saying since they did this).<p>In any event, we are certainly in for a wild ride over the next few years.  American society is cracking at the seams, and our “leaders” and financially-incentivized media companies seem to be actively encouraging it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;agriculture&#x2F;never-waste-a-good-water-crisis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;agriculture&#x2F;never-waste-a-good-water-cr...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;former-facebook-official-suggests-cable-providers-drop-oann-and-newsmax-turn-down-the-capability-of-these-conservative-influencers&#x2F;ar-BB1cPZ9P" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;former-facebook-offic...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jack&#x2F;status&#x2F;1349510769268850690?s=21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jack&#x2F;status&#x2F;1349510769268850690?s=21</a>')
