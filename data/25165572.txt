It was a wild ride for a few years but I eventually returned to Windows and then OS X.  But back around 2013 I got back into Linux on the Desktop.  First Ubuntu, then Arch, and now Fedora for the past three years.  Just set up my third Fedora machine.  With the Cinnamon window manager, it&#x27;s honestly better than the experience provided by OS X.  Plus I can put it on a $200 netbook and use it for real-world work, which I did for a year around 2015.')
