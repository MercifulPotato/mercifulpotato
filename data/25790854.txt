Low interest mortgages and credit in general start to fly out the window. The huge stock piles of cash they have help mitigate their risks effectively. Lower volume of loans also means a whole lot of financial vehicles people invest in for their retirement, are going to wash up as well. Right now, I dont see a viable replacement outside of private lenders like pay cheque loan and car title loans. Huge interest rates and really predatory capital requirements. Sub 20% interest rates, like it or not, come from all the things digi coins want to get rid of.')
