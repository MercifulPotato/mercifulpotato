The general purpose cores will have all the usual extensive you’d expect.<p>Meanwhile, the GPU cores will be simple cores with huge vector engines. This honestly seems somewhat similar to RDNA at a high level where you have a large SIMD unit with a scalar cores for branching and one-off calculations.<p>The big payoff is cohesiveness. Your RISC-V GPU shares the same memory model as your CPU. This should have a payoff in easy integration. Likewise, sharing a good permission model can probably help with all those GPU exploits in third-party code (like webGL).')
