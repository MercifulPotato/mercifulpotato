Most visible is push back against Facebook. During COVID, the local volunteer (mostly retirees) steam railway paid for and setup a good old emailing list, and not a Facebook group as many people seem to expect. At the most recent local election, a young candidate (who ended up winning a seat) in her platform had stated not using Facebook for communications and was even quoted as saying &#x27;Fuck Facebook&#x27; from Q&amp;A sessions. I have four elderly parents, none of whom use Facebook. During COVID, Zoom birthdays have taken over from face-to-face gatherings. While I have Signal installed, mostly people are sticking with SMS for messaging. One of the neighborhood groups uses Telegram. Google really means the search engine, email and Youtube. Nobody logs into Youtube and find it creepy when it remembers what they have been doing. It is not entirely like this, with a number of active community Facebook groups for things like &#x27;free stuff&#x27; and &#x27;want to buy&#x2F;sell&#x27;, and some businesses that are only online on Facebook, from when that was still cool. But it isn&#x27;t cool any more.')
