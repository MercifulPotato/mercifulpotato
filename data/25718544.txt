The processor in the M1 air is about 20% faster than the one in my laptop (£550 IIRC), but to spec an M1 out with the same amount of storage and RAM brings it to £1999.<p>I should stress that my now slightly ageing laptop is much thicker than an Air, but it&#x27;s also used to play modern games so that balances out.<p>Personally, for the price of an Air I could actually use I&#x27;d just get something cheap and a big PC setup.')
