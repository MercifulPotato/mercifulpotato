They are choosing not to allow them because they are being strong armed by a part of the political establishment that considers the spread of the information this websites want to share as dangerous for the country or its citizens.<p>So yeah, there&#x27;s some government action against this domestic terrorists and it&#x27;s resulting in private companies banning their websites.<p>You can agree with the action or not, I think it&#x27;s a good idea to have infrastructure in place that thwarts the spread of dangerous misinformation, but that shouldn&#x27;t be censorship.
