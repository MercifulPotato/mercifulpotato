You explanation seems to be extremely precise.<p>(My qualifications: I&#x27;ve lived permanently in Norway since before 2000, I speak a Norwegian dialect and pass as a Norwegian all the time. I&#x27;m also married to a Norwegian woman so I kind of know the nuances. For Norwegians here: in my family it stops at &quot;kone&quot; even though by the dialect I speak it should rather be pronounced as &quot;k√•ne&quot; : ).')
