Item(by='IkmoIkmo', descendants=None, kids=[25657317], score=None, time=1609935589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25656325, text='In virtually all countries, the size of the mortgage allowed is based on capacity to carry debt, by law or by market practice, and expressed as the percentage of monthly income that may be used on a mortgage, which is capped.<p>That means increasing interest rates and halving the payback time will massively increase monthly cost to carry debt &#x2F; monthly mortgage payments.<p>Given the cap, that means people can borrow much less. Their ability to buy or afford a home does not improve. Why would that be preferable?<p>What you&#x27;ll also achieve is that those with cash now will have a big advantage over those without cash, but with a stable income, who&#x27;re willing to work for 30 years, because mortgage-based buying becomes less interesting.<p>Lastly, you&#x27;ll make sure that much less capital flows to real estate, which means it&#x27;s less interesting to build more of it, reducing the long-term supply, and exacerbating the housing shortages you see in many countries.<p>And you&#x27;re doing all this, artificially. Set interest rates above market rates. Set loan terms to max 15 years, while a 25 year old will need to live somewhere after 40, too, and is fully capable to take on a loan at 41, or 51, or beyond.<p>There&#x27;s simply no easy solutions to this issue. This idea that messing with interest rates will magically solve things is myopic.<p>What I will agree with is this: make owning or renting fiscally neutral. In many countries, home owners get subsidies, tax breaks, interest rate deductions, while renters don&#x27;t. That must be stopped.<p>Second, we need to consider government policy to deter hyper-concentration, i.e., in many countries, the 5% top-1 tier cities get 25% of the investments&#x2F;attention&#x2F;projects&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;universities&#x2F;infrastructure. That leads to massive demand in a few spots, and a brain&#x2F;capital drain from the rest of the country. Because land is finite, it makes no sense to concentrate all economic activity in one or a few cities. Cities are efficient and necessary, but tier-2 and tier-3 cities need more attention to spread people around more. There&#x27;s actually plenty of housing, but some of it costs $500 per square foot, and some $50. That must be balanced more.<p>Third, national government should exert its power more over local governments to be more accommodating, e.g. when it comes to zoning, building laws, density etc. Local government is often captured by existing home owners, which must be heard, but whose voice is currently overpowering generations of future citizens who outnumber them and aren&#x27;t being accommodated. You have an industry captured by NIMBYism, and local government has no governance model to give future citizens a voice. In a municipality with 60% single family owner-occupied homes who wish to keep construction low, vs 30% long-term renters and 20% transient renters, and 500% future renters, who wish construction to increase, the current democratic governance model keeps favouring the 60% SFH owner-occupiers. But it&#x27;s not necessarily a net benefit to society, or the most democratic outcome.')
