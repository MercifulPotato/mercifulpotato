If you wanted to learn about &#x27;Russia&#x27; you went to the &#x27;Library&#x27;. Now - you can read Russian News, videos, TikToks, Instas, communicate with Russians, heck - you can even work with them.<p><i>HackerNews itself</i> is an amazing opportunity for information clearing and individual expression that <i>did not exist in any form</i> 25 years ago! The very comment you are writing is &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; in the broader picture of time. There was nowhere to do this before. Nobody could interact with people from around the world about &#x27;daily tech news&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s not even a debate how much more expression there is today.<p>To your point about &#x27;education&#x27; - obviously that would be wonderful, but that&#x27;s not going to be good enough.<p>Just look at the issue here: we have incredibly more power as individuals to express ourselves publicly - and a &#x27;very educated&#x27; HN board can&#x27;t seem to grasp that.<p>We&#x27;re just starting to grasp the power and influence of Social Media - and now that Trump has shown &#x27;what can be done&#x27;, I&#x27;m afraid it will be an &#x27;arms race&#x27; of misinformation for a while.<p>Our system depends on integrity: that your doctors is certified, professional, moral. Same for your teacher. The Judge. And the same applies to information. We &#x27;fact check&#x27; books, reports. We certainly expect that in the Scientific domain. So we must have that for public information as well. Which is not to say we won&#x27;t have other expressive channels, but randoms on &#x27;TikTok&#x27; just can&#x27;t be a source of news, other than the experience they might be able to grab on their phones (which FYI can be enlightening).<p>So yes, education, but we need credibility in our institutions as well.')
