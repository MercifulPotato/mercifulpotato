This implies to me that $1.4B of $2B Pfizer is supposed to have spent on development was actually just updating their supply chain for mRNA based vaccines.<p>While I’m happy that they made such a dramatic investment in the interests of bringing a product to market as fast as possible I think it’s also fair to imply it’s R&amp;D that can’t be applied to other products later.')
