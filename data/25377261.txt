In all but the &quot;mere aggregation&quot; case, the GPL is considered to be viral, and the LGPL relaxes that in some more &quot;linking&quot;&#x2F;&quot;bundling&quot; scenarios.<p>The AGPL to do its work has to close the &quot;mere aggregation&quot; &quot;hole&quot; in at least <i>some cases</i>, which alone makes it &quot;more viral&quot; on the spectrum of GPL licenses. That&#x27;s before you get into problems with how the APGL defines &quot;some cases&quot;, in that it doesn&#x27;t do a great job so <i>no one knows</i> exactly how viral it is because it will take court cases to sort out its bad wording on the subject.<p>(For instances: 1) The AGPL is intended to expand to include &quot;running it in a SaaS environment&quot; yet the way it (doesn&#x27;t) define &quot;SaaS environment&quot; is so poor it could mean running it <i>anywhere</i>. 2) The AGPL was written by a PHP company and so a lot of the definitions, distinctions, and clauses from the GPL regarding the differences between binary and source distributions were struck out. Because <i>most</i> of the known legal definitions on &quot;mere aggregation&quot; with regards to the GPL hinge on those distinctions we have fewer and fewer ideas of what &quot;mere aggregation&quot; means with respect to the AGPL, and it again possibly implies that the AGPL&#x27;s virality is potentially unbounded, that their &quot;some cases&quot; is intentionally or accidentally written as &quot;all cases&quot;.)')
