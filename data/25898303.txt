If you were born in 1900, you would (most likely) have witnessed: the internal combustion engine, human flight (from nothing to faster than the speed of sound), a major world wide economic depression, two world wars, the invention of nuclear power, major social and legal changes in the &#x27;60s (in some places at least), and the exploration of space, starting from nothing and most likely including humans walking on the moon.<p>Or another way to look at it: during the N years I have lived, how much has the the world changed compared to the period of time between 1900 and 1900 + N? Though on reflection, I guess this is probably the sort of thought experiment that becomes more interesting as one gets older..')
