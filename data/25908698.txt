Item(by='hntrader', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611607983, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25908517, text='&gt; You&#x27;re telling me 10,000 (if even?) guys sitting at home doing retail trading have $1M each in positions driving this? 100,000 people with $100,000 each, during the day?<p>No, it&#x27;s the same retail people trading in and out. Someone w&#x2F; $100 in buying power can generate $2000 in traded value pretty easily just buying &amp; selling 20 times, which some retail people do because they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>There&#x27;s also going to be HFT market makers flipping their position and taking the other side, which almost doubles the volume compared to what it would be if there were no MMs. It&#x27;s not a capital intensive business and they can trade huge volumes with very small capital.<p>Then there&#x27;s going to be GME options market makers who are getting gamma squeezed and hedging their deltas. That would explain a bit.<p>The hedge funds getting squeezed explain about ~30m of the volume (assumption that 50% of the short float got squeezed), or perhaps more if they covered their position yesterday and decided to put it back on today.<p>Probably also some totally new hedge funds coming in today with a short as well, although that won&#x27;t explain much volume since the entire float was shorted (and them some, due to naked shorting) and naked shorting is technically not allowed.<p>I&#x27;m sure all the prop firms were all over it today, as well, and they&#x27;re going to be in and out with up to $1m positions.')
