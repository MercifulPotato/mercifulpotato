Then the BBC Micro hit general availability and the software that shipped with it was lightyears ahead of whatever else was avaialble for personal computers, and BBC Basic was actually a fairly good language to learn structured programming (can you imagine an era before functions?).<p>I too owe my career to the 8 bit machines that allowed me to own a proper computer.')
