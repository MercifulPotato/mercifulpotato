I&#x27;ve done a few of the previous AoCs to various levels of completion.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been quick enough to figure on the leaderboard. I&#x27;m not a competitive person so that aspect of it doesn&#x27;t really appeal to me and I&#x27;ve been able to totally ignore it every year without it really intruding on me or causing me any stress related problems.<p>You&#x27;re imaging a scenario which doesn&#x27;t really exist with this &quot;ignorant recruiter&quot; situation. Why not just worry about that if &#x2F; when it really does become a problem...?<p>We can look at a myriad of potential stress factors that come out of the design of so many every day items. We&#x27;d be overrun with worries if let them dominate our mind.<p>Just chill out and try to ignore the competitive aspect, its not that difficult')
