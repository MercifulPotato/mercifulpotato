I mean, a CSR may identify some obvious need, but will only be in contact with the techs at the target company, not the decision makers. And they won&#x27;t understand the customer&#x27;s budget, so they may not realize that there&#x27;s no budget for the customer to get what they actually need.<p>The sales guys tend to understand that structure a lot better, so they can qualify the leads from support and perhaps package that advice for the people who need to hear it if it&#x27;s funneled to them appropriately.')
