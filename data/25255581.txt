The accent then persists for a few minutes. They don&#x27;t even realize they&#x27;re doing it.<p>Indeed I think it&#x27;s a natural thing everyone does, to some extent, to try to fit in.<p>However, some people naturally mirror other people more than others. I have a pet theory that the tendency to synchronize gait with whoever you&#x27;re walking with, the tendency to mirror accents, and other forms of subconscious &quot;fitting in&quot; are all correlated.')
