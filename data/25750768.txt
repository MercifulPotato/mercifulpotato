You can be convinced of something without being brainwashed.<p>I genuinely believe that free speech should have limits in order to maintain the cohesion of our societies and protect people from mobs. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been brainwashed into it, I&#x27;ve just seen what unbridled and unchecked hate speech can lead to.<p>Of course there&#x27;s the problem of where the line should be drawn and who should draw it, but in order to have this discussion we need to move away from these strawmen (strawpersons?) and accept that maybe people just have convictions they haven&#x27;t been brainwashed into.<p>After all, I&#x27;m sure you wouldn&#x27;t be very happy if I erected billboards along the highway featuring hardcore pedopornography with your faced photoshopped in. One way or an other we all have limits to what we consider acceptable expression, it&#x27;s all about figuring out how this should be codified and enforced.<p>And I want to add that having taboo topics and forms of expression is probably a good thing overall. For our lives to have meaning we need &quot;sacred&quot; things to protect, things to fight against, things to think about. We need to be able to shock, we need to be able to be transgressive, to make revolutions and counter-revolutions, to express frustration.')
