A better title&#x2F;approach would have been &quot;These aren&#x27;t DRY, they&#x27;re silly &#x27;no common code&#x27; bigotry&quot;.  I find the article resonates because I&#x27;ve seen all of these anti-patterns defended with &quot;because DRY&quot;.  I agree, it&#x27;s not DRY; but so many people get stuck on the &quot;no code duplication&quot; part.  I&#x27;m not sure if the &quot;This isn&#x27;t DRY&quot; is the best fight or &quot;Sometimes DRY is not the best&quot;.<p>My favourite block of &quot;DRY&quot; code was a method that had a triple nested loop (for all object A, for all objects A.B, for all objects B.C) with a bunch of flags (like 15 different bools, ints, dates and arrays) that changed the ORM filters for A, for A-&gt;B, for B-&gt;C, and then changed what operations were done on A, B, C.   Basically, at the end, the only similarity was the foreach part.  The comment on the block of code had &quot;Keep this loop together for DRY&quot;, as if they knew this was going wrong but not sure why.  It ended up being 3 or 4 much simpler methods, based as you say, on requirements NOT code &quot;shape&quot;.')
