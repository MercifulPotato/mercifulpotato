Cynicism isnâ€™t a morally neutral stance. Assuming everyone <i>else</i> is arguing in bad faith and in favor of their crude short-term political&#x2F;economic interests. Asserting that all property is theft and that the system is rigged. Dismissing those who disagree as gullible or stupid or (themselves) cynically trying to manipulate people. There is so much of it here and it comes from every angle. It is disgusting. That people who are here tend to self-identify as high-IQ does not help.')
