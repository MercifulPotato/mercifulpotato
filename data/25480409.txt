It&#x27;s one thing to point out the influence and connections to racism&#x2F;slavery&#x2F;people of color on American history and society but it&#x27;s incorrect to include it at the top of the food chain as the primary motivator of everything down through American history. That&#x27;s just a naive and lazy argument. I love when people point out the hypocrisy of those who want to sweep such topics under the rug, but to consider them as the primary reason this country exists and why we are the way we are is ludicrous.')
