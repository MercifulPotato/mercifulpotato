Pfizer announced the end of the phase 3 trials on November 18th, they submitted an application to the FDA for EUA on the 20th of November (or sometime shortly after), and the EUA was granted on the 11th of December.<p>It didn&#x27;t take 11 months for the FDA to give the OK. It took 11 months to design a vaccine from scratch, conduct phase I safety trials, phase 2 human safety and dosage trials, and a phase 3 trial to determine efficacy. This includes actual production of the mRNA &amp; its vector in quantities sufficient for the trial, subject recruitment, shipping logistics worldwide to participants, administration of the test doses, data collection, analyses, and compiling results. Honestly, 11 months from start to finish seems like an amazingly short time to achieve so much.')
