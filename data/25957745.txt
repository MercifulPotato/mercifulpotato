We are a tiny target, but we have been able to observe these objects for a very short period of time.  Unlike regular solar satellites, they are only visible for a very short period of time.  Like comets, if one hit us it would end life on the planet.  They don’t need to be massive with how fast they are.  We can estimate how many comets are out there with orbital mechanics models, but what about objects originating from outside the solar system?  We could one day not wake up because we couldn’t even see one of these coming before it hit us.')
