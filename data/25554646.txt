Not really for a 350m region.<p>You don’t need to go outside the US to be able to contrast two different regions of 5 million people.<p>Showing that some administrative groups of 5 million have better outcomes than others does nothing to explain how to run a state of 350m in a better way.<p>You have offered us nothing of explanatory value, merely a statistically obvious observation.<p>My “counter argument” is predictable because it’s pointing out a <i>predictable flaw</i> I’m what you are saying.  Ignoring it doesn’t make it less true.<p>If you understand the causes of NZ’s better than average governance, and can also explain why it underperforms some states, then why not offer an explanation?<p>If you can’t offer explanations, then perhaps that tells us something.')
