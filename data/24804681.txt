That&#x27;s why I couched it with &quot;that was implied&quot;.<p>Secondary endpoints, decisions about when to end trials, etc, are all fraught with peril.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that neither SIMPLE nor the ACTT-1 Remdesivir studies moved from a mortality to a non-mortality endpoint.   SIMPLE did have an endpoint change before any data was available, but it was a relatively minor, innocuous thing.<p>&gt; The primary efficacy end point was clinical status assessed on day 14 on a 7-point ordinal scale consisting of the following categories: 1, death; 2, hospitalized, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 3, hospitalized, receiving noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices; 4, hospitalized, requiring low-flow supplemental oxygen; 5, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen but receiving ongoing medical care (related or not related to Covid-19); 6, hospitalized, requiring neither supplemental oxygen nor ongoing medical care (other than that specified in the protocol for remdesivir administration); and 7, not hospitalized (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org).')
