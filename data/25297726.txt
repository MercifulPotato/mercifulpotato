I mean that in the sense of, I have built applications every possible way - when you work in a big company and inherit one of everything, you have to do that often.<p>In my past, I built one application that was fully database driven, and at the time (2004-2005) it would have been difficult to pull off without stored procedures and table driven logic - fully maximizing the power of SQL - especially in the timeframe I had to do it (&lt;3 months).  I mean, I pushed the technology HARD (expert system for fraud detection that worked hand-in-hand with basic machine learning).<p>I will never forget how I was derided by people for that choice - even though, that system is still running today and working well, in the bowels of an acquirer.  I mean, literally, I was derided to the point of getting imposter syndrome for feeling that I made a choice that others regarded as so limiting.<p>The truth is, I learned everything else about distributed applications and databases because of being derided in that way.  Ultimately, I now know how to architect things many different ways and can choose when I feel it is appropriate.  I also know not to let the negativity of others prevent success.<p>I am not sure the moral of this story.  If you can build a system, and it serves its purpose well and for a long time, and it works and provides the needed value.. it really may not matter.  But, you can choose sometimes, and if there is one truth it must be that there is not always only one way to do something.  Try to pick the right tool for the job as best as you are able.<p>Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re dumb just because other people don&#x27;t like your idea.  Keep your mind open, and be willing to learn, but if you can make it work, and prove it works, you are just as right as anyone else.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s the moral of the story.')
