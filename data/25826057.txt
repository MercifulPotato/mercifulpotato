That is a reasonable criticism in general. Politics involves a great deal of claiming that someone else’s policies are detrimental. No one would claim Putin is “more aligned”, only perhaps less of a danger. They may also believe that Putin is at least instrumentally better for Russia than Pelosi is due America.')
