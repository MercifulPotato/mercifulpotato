Door position plus sun elevation based on NTP accurate clock equals lights on &#x2F; off in the laundry room.  Position of garage door equals garage extra lights on&#x2F;off kind like a giant fridge door and its fridge light.  The complete set of presence code for my home office is a little more elaborate.')
