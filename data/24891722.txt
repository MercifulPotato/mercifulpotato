Politics is <i>not</i> everything; at some point we have to understand that politics does not make a society, a society makes politics.<p>Ask yourself this: if these same mechanisms, that again are used by autocratic governments, get taken advantage of by a future administration and we <i>somehow</i> defeat them will you be willing to admit accountability and culpability for the outcome?
