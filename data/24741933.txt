Item(by='petra', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602364521, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24725391, text='&gt;&gt; but from what I&#x27;ve seen from the few reports so far, the prices aren&#x27;t all that different from other services.<p>Current prices include a safety driver and small scale. Prices should go down in the future.<p>And sure, regulation and trust should be huge barriers. But besides the customer service issue(which seems too pessimistic), Google should be leading over others, on the trust issue(no accidents, more miles, highly skilled tech company), And on the regulation issue(good ties with Washington).<p>But those 2 are still a big risk, like you mention.')
