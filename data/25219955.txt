In order to learn about marketing, I held a monthly closed-doors growth hacking meet-up with other bootstrappers and founders to share our experiences about what works, so I&#x27;ve seen a fair amount of the territory.<p>Anyway I&#x27;ve got a YouTube channel where I share a lot of what I know, especially with respect to getting those first 1000 users. The focus is on marketing techniques that appeal to engineering types like me (e.g. scalable SEO generated from data; paid ads that you can leave running long-term etc.)<p>My context is scrappy (the biz only had between 1 and 4 employees), but what I know should be of interest to people in the early stages (less so for funded startups, where scale changes the game somewhat) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aCzT-LQI6x0&amp;list=PLpkoC9yJXDKlGz7SPwofn1joJH9nAABmX" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aCzT-LQI6x0&amp;list=PLpkoC9yJXD...</a>')
