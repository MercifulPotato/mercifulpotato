Aka a plotter. Using an inkjet cartridge or a laserjet toner on a piece of paper outside the context of the printer it was designed for seems foolhardy at best... but what about moving a pen up and down?<p>Shameless plug, I&#x27;ve been working on a project called Robot Draws You! (www.robotdrawsyou.com). I&#x27;m currently using an off-the-shelf machine and the software &#x2F; cloud hoops it requires me to jump through were enough to convince me to build my own machine. For the proof of concept I&#x27;m using a Duet2 board, but eventually I want to write some code that will sit on a raspi and talk to the Duet to allow the machine a more granular drip-feed style control over the &quot;printing&quot; process&quot;. More on that later.<p>&quot;Why is it hard?&quot; The challenge starts with taking in a given SVG file, making sure it scales &#x2F; fits within the bounds of a given writeable area, and then generating GCODE to send to the printer &#x2F; plotter. Because there&#x27;s no extruder, custom GCODE needs to get created to take advantage of the GPIO pins to move a servo up&#x2F;down to control the pen. The software challenge is replacing the much-hated cloud interface I complain about. It may suck, but it does a lot and it actually works.<p>The more I use &quot;the cloud&quot;, the more I am reminded it does not provide adequate controls&#x2F;info on:<p>- The size of the rendered image relative to the writeable area<p>- The order in which the layers of the file get rendered<p>- Information about the progress &#x2F; time left per layer<p>- Repeatability of failed layers without re-writing entire project<p>So crazy me decided &quot;I&#x27;ll make my own plotter UI and hardware!&quot; It&#x27;s slow going but it&#x27;s really fun and I enjoy the challenge. The end solution is going to be a mix of hardware and software that allows you to upload an SVG &#x2F; vector file to a web UI, start&#x2F;stop&#x2F;repeat layers and control the order of the rendering. I like to make drawings of people, and also want to use this to make gigantic maps as well.')
