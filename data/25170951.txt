I’m taking anything that pops in your head. Sometimes getting an idea, any idea, written down gives the brain the chance to expand and improve on it over time even subconsciously and this is where tons of good ideas develop.<p>One side note here: don’t assume you’ll remember an idea you have. I can’t count how many times I’ve thought, “oh I’ll write that down later” only to forget what it was entirely. Stop whatever you’re doing and jot the idea down somewhere. This is especially annoying at 2AM.<p>I watched a writer’s room work on a comedy show I enjoy and they talked about how for each episode they aim for about 30-40 jokes, which requires around 300-500 ideas be written down. No idea was mocked and everything was written down and taped to the wall. Most of the time good ideas evolved from some that were initially half-baked.')
