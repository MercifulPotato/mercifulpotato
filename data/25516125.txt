The transformation of software into ever-smaller and more specialised &#x27;ticketing&#x27; is as much a result of managerialism encroaching in. Basecamp have this bit in their Shape Up handbook about responsibility and how it affects their approach to software:<p>----------<p>Making teams responsible<p>Third, we give full responsibility to a small integrated team of designers and programmers. They define their own tasks, make adjustments to the scope, and work together to build vertical slices of the product one at a time. This is completely different from other methodologies, where managers chop up the work and programmers act like ticket-takers.<p>Together, these concepts form a virtuous circle. When teams are more autonomous, senior people can spend less time managing them. With less time spent on management, senior people can shape up better projects. When projects are better shaped, teams have clearer boundaries and so can work more autonomously.<p>----------')
