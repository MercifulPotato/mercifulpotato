You can refer to the sha256 of base images to avoid things changing, but I&#x27;ve never seen anyone do that.  (The advice is &quot;never use &#x27;latest&#x27; because that could change out from under you&quot;, but other tags are just as mutable, and so that isn&#x27;t real advice.  You can follow the advice and have something just as bad happen.)<p>The thing the upstream Linux distributions are missing are a lockfile with the hashes of installed packages.  Programming languages figured this out (go.sum, package-lock.json, etc.) but distributions have not.  Thus, people are often running &quot;whatever&quot; in production, because they simply don&#x27;t have the ability to lock dependencies properly.<p>I assume Nix solves this problem, and people should pay attention to how important it actually is.')
