Stand next to a freeway and hold up a stop sign. Drop a foam mannequin from a bridge over the road. Paint some bogus lane lines. Shine a laser at their face.<p>Any of the above will cause accidents with humans, and you&#x27;ll be arrested and charged with a felony. Deliberate attempts to compromise autonomous car systems carrying humans inside should be treated no differently.')
