Probably never talked at length to a variety of different county health departments to understand their needs.  Never had a persona written so they didn&#x27;t understand the need for IE or that people might be using it on a mobile phone.<p>Deloitte just coded the spec, cashed their check and walked away.  Deloitte probably outsourced development overseas.<p>I know some smaller government contractors in the D.C area who would have done it for a third as much and done some of the CDC&#x27;s work for them when they saw that it wasn&#x27;t done.')
