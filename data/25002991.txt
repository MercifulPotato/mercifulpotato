At home, I feel it’s OK to treat your server as a pet. One self hosted server that does it all is not a 2020 anomaly, it’s just boring and effective :)<p>I have spent a small part of my imposed 2020 free time simplifying my family digital cattle to a cow self hosted digital pets. I liberated myself both from gear and services I was maintaining for affective value or some professional distorsion; the openbsd systems I love but don’t use enough, the apple rmbp I never use, the VPSes for my personal services, ... donated, sold, resigned. It feels great.')
