The first one had a relatively linear weapon plot, as you gained levels, you&#x27;d find a replacement weapon (one of four) about every level or two. borderlands 2 was a &quot;better game&quot; except for the weapons and overall upgrade path. Borderlands 3 i couldn&#x27;t get through without cheating due to extremely low drop chances of anything good, and i had already passed the refund time limit - family emergency caused me to leave the house with the game running, out $60.<p>Having &quot;literally millions of weapons&quot; looks good on paper, but it makes for non-engaging gameplay if done incorrectly, which it was in the numbered sequels, in my opinion.<p>overall, borderlands 2 and 3 felt like a chore to play, &quot;get one hour of grinding in&quot;, regardless of how pretty it was or interesting the other mechanics were.<p>And you know what the main difference was between 1 and 2 &amp; 3?
