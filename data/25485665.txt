However traditional alarm clocks are very lacking. Things that I&#x27;m looking for:<p>- It should have a dummy interface, probably black and white, definitely not something like Amazon echo show.\n- It should be programmable, at least having several alarms and distinguish between weekdays and weekends. Also, it should be able to update to summer time automatically. This takes away all traditional alarm clocks.\n- I&#x27;m ok with setting up the alarms in the phone, but in that case I&#x27;d like to check them on the clock. This takes away xiaomi&#x27;s, I believe.\n- Ideally, it wouldn&#x27;t depend on a central server, I&#x27;d rather not have my clock deprecated in a couple years.<p>Is there such an alarm clock?')
