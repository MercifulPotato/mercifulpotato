I find it interesting that same people don&#x27;t seem to be upset with Apple, while Apple is largely playing the same game.<p>Forget all you know about Facebook ad practices for a second, and take a look at what Apple is doing, but putting &quot;Mom and Pop LLC&quot; in place of Facebook.<p>Apple is using their enormous power to essentially pick and choose what is allowed to execute on your device. Sure, they give user a &quot;choice&quot; to either restrict and app, or to allow it, but they never, ever, give user the same choices about Apple itself. Apple &quot;helping&quot; users to restrict others is no different from Microsoft installing internet Explorer for everyone, to &quot;help&quot; users browser the internet.<p>In this case Apple is getting all the goodies about the user: their location, their usage, their connections, everything. Meanwhile, they are blocking others from having it.<p>The difference is that Apple is waving the freedom-fighter flag first, thereby making everyone else look bad in comparison.')
