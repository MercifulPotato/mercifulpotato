But nowhere does his article reckon with a very basic fact: The New York Times has opted to assist a teenager&#x27;s desperate quest to ruin the life of a young woman who said something stupid when she was 15.<p>The entire place is rampant with racial bullshit and the article writer is like, &quot;But this poor girl&#x27;s life is ruined!&quot;<p>They then equivocate the experience of racial prejudice with cheating on a math test, amongst other relative frivolities:<p>&gt; Or better yet, he could have simply not written this story, which concerns bad but by no means uncommon teenager behavior. If Groves had cheated on her math test, or planted a kick-me sign on a rival&#x27;s back, would this constitute national news? No crime was committed; the utterance of the word did not even take place at school. The only thing novel about this situation is that it attracted the national media&#x27;s attention.<p>Like, you just got finished explaining there&#x27;s a whole big racial problem at the joint, confirmed by third-parties and yet we&#x27;re still talking about how there&#x27;s &quot;no crime&quot; and &quot;it didn&#x27;t happen at school&quot;... like, what? Amazing feats of hand-waving going on.<p>I&#x27;d take the writer more seriously if they gave any kind of weight to the racist experiences occuring there, but those just aren&#x27;t actual problems to them. Like, where do you think racist behavior comes from?<p>This entire culture of looking the other way when casual racism is happening is a massive problem, and I&#x27;ve seen this stuff from educated, affluent people (whom apparently are also the subjects of the article). You can&#x27;t really talk about how society is crumbling when you don&#x27;t give two shits about recognizing the qualms at hand.')
