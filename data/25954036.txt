What makes you think the stock is &quot;out of balance&quot;? The hype men will have you believe that there is some magic percentage or tipping point that makes it a good buy but it&#x27;s pure bunk. If GME has any relationship to the company GameStop (which it does) the stock should be in the toilet and is very likely to go out of business soon, which makes a massive short position very reasonable.')
