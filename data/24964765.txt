Tamilians sort of dominated of dominated Sanskrit literature in 7th-10th centuries.  Dandin, Kumarila, Shankara, Dharmakirti, Ramanujan and Madhva. Not to mention the Bhagavatapurana, which very quickly became probably the most important religious text in India! I wouldn&#x27;t say Tamilians rejected sanskrit... they just kept the two seperate.  There aren&#x27;t very many tamilian words itself in sanskrit (mina meaning fish is the only one I can think of), but there are proto-dravidian loan words in Sanskrit.')
