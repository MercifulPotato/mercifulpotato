I&#x27;ve used them both on the same project, and it&#x27;s painful to use VS Code.<p>The main advantage of the JetBrains IDEs is that their built-in hinting&#x2F;linting and code sense are much better. VS Code will fail to warn me about things that JetBrains does by default.<p>(I say this as someone heavily using eslint, by the way.)')
