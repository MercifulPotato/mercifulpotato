Perhaps it is a feature of vaccines in general?<p>Given that this is a completely novel vaccine, and there is zero clinical data to support that statement, there is literally no way she can know that for sure.<p>However, the Moderna vaccine confers an immunity approximately equivalent to convalescent COVID-19 patients within two weeks of the first dose, so she&#x27;s probably fine.')
