There weren&#x27;t nearly so many &quot;time saving&quot; abstractions back then, so if you wanted to see anything happen, you had to have a good understanding of what was going on under the hood.  Although it was at times frustrating back then to put so much effort into something as simple as drawing a circle on a screen, I&#x27;m fortunate that I was forced to spend so much time internalizing the details - I don&#x27;t know if I would have the patience to learn it all if I was starting right now if I could see that shortcuts existed.')
