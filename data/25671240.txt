Item(by='pelasaco', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610028956, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670844, text='big words, unfortunately little common sense.<p>I can give you some scenarios:<p>- Practically every school (elementary school) in Germany uses WhatsApp for communication among Parents and Teachers. If you don&#x27;t have WhatsApp, you have go to the school and read the official announcements in the wall. Lot of important information there, for example Teacher short-notice absence, protocol from meetings, etc.<p>- The favorite communication channel of my university is via Whatsapp. There are lot of tools to consolidate and do the customer relationship via WhatsApp.<p>- Back in the normal days, every single airbnb host that i contacted, were using WhatsApp<p>So to make it clearer, the main difference between all IM listed are:<p>- the user base itself (two billion users for WhatsApp[1])<p>- The number of 3rd part tools offering integration with that tools (zendesk, salesforce, etc).<p>References:<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.messengerpeople.com&#x2F;global-messenger-usage-statistics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.messengerpeople.com&#x2F;global-messenger-usage-stati...</a>')
