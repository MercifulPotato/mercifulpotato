They&#x27;re absolute beasts. Seeing the 500GBps VRAM bandwidth on the 6900xt or 6800 xt makes me think that they couldn&#x27;t just keep up... but that 128MB cache is clearly key.<p>They&#x27;ve got the thing working on a wide variety of games (if they&#x27;re publishing those FPS numbers already). So the cache has to be transparent. I wonder what the rules are for it: 128MB seems too small to hold much texture or vertex information. So I wonder how it helps.')
