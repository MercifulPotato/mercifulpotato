I see them hiring here a lot, anyway.<p>I&#x27;ve always wondered what the cutting-edge technology or business model it aspires to provide, such that the idea was worthy of startup funding and so much interest. After all, hiring a developer to set up a Wordpress site with a few plugins and integration of some subscription payment plan through Stripe or similar couldn&#x27;t be that hard, right?<p>Maybe Substack&#x27;s goal, then, is to create a truly censor-proof platform for independent writers. I&#x27;m not sure that is currently one of their goals, but after the last few weeks, it probably should be. Otherwise, what&#x27;s the point vs just some generic &quot;Shopify for writers&quot; that I&#x27;m sure already exists, though would be heavily dependent on the big players who could cut the platform off without notice.<p>So do we know if Substack is ensuring that they control their &quot;sub stack&quot; down to the utilities level (e.g. electricity and ISP)? Otherwise, one bad apple (e.g. Andrew Sullivan daring to reference a best selling book from the 90&#x27;s that&#x27;s no longer kosher amongst the woke) could ruin it for the rest of their customers.')
