Compare this to AMC which basically tripled its shares since last year. This leads me to believe that this is not all kosher. GME counsel is probably advising them to not go through with it. Frankly, I think Ryan Cohen bit off more than he can chew. His ideas to revive Gamestop is mostly half baked and there are way too many big players to compete against. Any money they raised from here will only delay the inevitable.')
