If the instance is too big, it feels like reading from the firehose and if the instance is too small it is better to just browse the directory and find the profiles that seem interesting to you.<p>To me local timelines only make sense if the instance has a very clearly defined group with some kind of shared access, e.g, a company that has an instance for use by its employees, or a club or organization have some kind of membership. Unfortunately Mastodon&#x27;s culture seems to about aggregating around instances with a very loose sense of &quot;community&quot; - e.g, &quot;photographers&quot;, &quot;open source developers&quot;, &quot;lgbtq allies&quot;. To me this is - quite frankly - stupid. Not a day goes by on &#x2F;r&#x2F;mastodon where someone asks &quot;is there an instance for X?&quot; thinking that Mastodon instances works like subreddits.')
