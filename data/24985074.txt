Item(by='tdeck', descendants=None, kids=[24985113], score=None, time=1604444866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24985012, text='I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way to extend this concept so that you could hear singers &quot;after&quot; you if the delay is not significant (e.g. maybe you can hear everyone within 15-30ms). That would mean the leader might not have to go it entirely alone. For example, if I ping vultr from SF I get 4ms latency (tested this a while back) meaning it would be theoretically possible to have some simultaneous singing with a low-latency server. The bucket brigade approach could then be used to extend participation to those with greater geographical distance or poor connections.')
