Given the general level of ignorance on firearms issues among the majority of Canadians who don&#x27;t own firearms (and don&#x27;t know much about them), I expect the laws to get much, much worse than they are even today. Even though I have been thoroughly vetted and done training and been tested, there are about 1,000 arbitrary and stupid ways in which I can be criminally charged for things that are not actually dangerous.<p>The recent arbitrary ban on &quot;scary&quot; semi-automatic rifles is a perfect example of this point. Because many of these rifles are classed as &quot;restricted&quot;, and thus registered along with requiring more onerous licensing requirements, they are trivially easy to confiscate - this allows the government to score a political victory by appearing to be tackling gun violence, while ultimately threatening with criminal punishment Canadians who have attempted to be insanely diligent in following the law. The story that these guns have no purpose other than to kill people is simply a lie, a brazen one at that considering that the Prime Minister himself has owned such guns over the years.<p>Long guns, particularly legally-acquired restricted long guns, are used in homicides so rarely that it wouldn&#x27;t be statistically significant. Legally-acquired handguns are also almost never used in crime or homicide.<p>Guns are also an important part of Canadian culture, and historically were a symbol of self-sovereignty: the ability to put food on the table and protect your family are simply part and parcel to living life on the frontier. Many in the city have apparently forgotten this in a sea of pleasant conveniences, but it is still a way of life for those of us who have chosen a life of self-sufficiency. (I used to live in a big city, btw)<p>Honestly, given the statistics on the prevalence of firearms vs. their use in violent encounters in this country, the fear many Canadians have of firearms is highly irrational.')
