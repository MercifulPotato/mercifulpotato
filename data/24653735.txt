Was super hyped going in, but when I saw the footage itself, it just felt off.  Like the colors maybe weren&#x27;t quite right or the motion was super messed up and the whole thing just felt weird and made watching it unenjoyable.  I would have prefered to see it in black and white.<p>My other gripe with the film was that he also loaded it up with sound effects and even added not well mixed VFX like extra explosions and shingles falling off roofs that appear from nowhere (hence why I&#x27;m pretty sure they were added in post).  Dumping that kind of cheap blockbuster action elements actually felt pretty disrepectful of the soldiers that got filmed.  Kind of like they were using them as action figures to tell a story that wasn&#x27;t quite what happened in reality.')
