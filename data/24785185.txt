Qualcomm Modem is at least $8 more expensive than Intel according to last court filling. And generally inline with industry expectation of its BOM Cost. Those numbers were for 4G Modem. And I would expect 5G Modem to be even more expensive.<p>2. mmWave isn&#x27;t Free. I am <i>very</i> surprised Apple put mmWave inside iPhone 12 as well.<p>The problem with Multi Port Charger is that it is very Un-Apple. What happens when you charge a MacBook and iPad Pro at the same time? You now either expect customers to add up their Wattage to see if your chargers fits or design a multiple port charger to include this scenario, and if you include Apple&#x27;s normal accessories margin that Charger is going to be insanely expensive.<p>So it is better to leave it to third party to do it. Apple will just recommend you to use their own charger.')
