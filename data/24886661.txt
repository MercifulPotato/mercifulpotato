Including gaming (Steam, as well as some standalone games), work, software development, multimedia.<p>From where I&#x27;m standing, I find Linux desktop much less bothersome than Windows or Mac these days. Every other week, there is an outcry about some new Bad Thing that Apple or Microsoft has done to their OS and half the tech community is up in arms about how all of their workflows are broken.<p>Or random Twitch streamers often having to fight against Windows more often than I thought reasonable, in order to get their streaming setup back under control.<p>Or work colleagues annoyed every other month about some VPN app not playing nice with Windows TCP&#x2F;IP stack and locking them out of company network until they reboot.<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;m in my little Linux corner, quietly doing my thing and not really having to fix anything other than mistakes I make, and bugs I cause.')
