It turns Alt Gr on my keyboard into a “compose” key, so I can press that followed by a short sequence of other keys to quickly type numerous common symbols. As a result, I can type “ or † or ≤ almost as easily as I can type &quot; or * or &lt;. Similar functionality is available on other platforms, and I expect anyone who was typing the same symbols frequently, as programmers do, would internalise the shortcuts for them in a matter of minutes.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wincompose.info&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wincompose.info&#x2F;</a>')
