Item(by='hilbert42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601827510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24672511, text='Yeah, there&#x27;s a few things there that are a bit of a worry, not to mention that <i>element 17</i> seems overly represented in the wrong places (instead of <i>element 7</i>)!! Bit a nonsense really.  Incidentally, in my other post I refer to an organic chemistry book given to me by my father decades ago when I was a teenager.  It also had descriptions of the production of fulminates and it described the different sensitivities of the more common Hg and Ag forms. (When one&#x27;s a budding chemist of about 14, one&#x27;s chemistry books get well thumbed around such descriptions.) ;-)<p>The same book covered picric acid in considerable detail.  It made a specific point of mentioning that sometime during WWI TNT replaced picric acid in shells for various reasons including safety.  Being a reasonably strong phenolic acid, picric acid readily formed metallic picrate salts with shell casings and that these salts are much more unstable than the straight acid.<p>It seems that even nowadays with the still-regular roundup of WWI munitions on the &#x27;Western Front&#x27; (in Belgium, etc.) old corroded picric acid shells are a major ongoing problem (dozens of them still turn up (usually plowed up) every year).  If I recall correctly said acid was also largely implicated in the enormous Halifax disaster of 1917.<p>One final point:  when I was a school picric acid was one of the standard reagents in our school chemistry lab.  Seems it was no big deal back then, nor was the &#x27;fertilizer&#x27; which we used to remove tree stumps.')
