The #8CantWait proposal is problematic because it calls for strict bans without accounting for real world situations.<p>As for active shooter situations, guidelines now call for the first responding officer to immediately move in and attempt to stop the shooter by any means necessary. They aren&#x27;t supposed to wait for a SWAT team to respond. It&#x27;s ridiculous to propose separate use of force rules for them.')
