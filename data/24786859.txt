This will be a slaughterfest :) I rarely find a news channel with accurate COVID-19 information. The UK Telegraph being one of the rare good cases.<p>* Most e.g. present the latest positve PCR test numbers per day as &quot;confirmed new infections&quot;, whilst they are not &quot;new&quot; and not &quot;infections&quot;. They are just &quot;confirmed positives&quot;.<p>They are not &quot;new&quot;, because the statistics don&#x27;t give away if they are old or new, they don&#x27;t store old PCR or antibody tests results.<p>And they are certainly not &quot;infections&quot; just &quot;positives&quot;, as old infections and therefore immune people will test positive with PCR. Given the 7 months timeframe and the immense high dark figure of asymptotic cases, and the upcoming cold season with many people getting suddenly symptomatic (getting the common cold) and therefore getting tested finally, the real infection rate could be 20% less than the reported one. Those people did not get tested before, will be tested now, will be positive but not infected.<p>* Previously they reported for months the mortality rate as CFR, not IFR. The CFR is only relevant for healthcare providers (&quot;how many people die in hospitals&quot;), but not for policies (&quot;how many people die after being infected&quot;). The CFR just looked much better being 10-30x higher (citing Ionnadis latest stats here), so policies looked much better.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;eci.13423" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;eci.13423</a><p>* They continue to mixup HCQ prevention with treatment, for pure political gain.<p>And many more such lies and inaccuracies, mostly by intent, not by mistake.<p>But not even news and politics are guilty, even scientific research: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.08.13.249847v1.full" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.08.13.249847v1....</a><p>Getting rid of all the misinformation would be a godsend, but we certainly don&#x27;t need even more censorship, as already done under the conspiracy label.')
