Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=[25924766, 25924595], score=None, time=1611719038, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25923906, text='What about &quot;content&quot; that certainly is a <i>document</i>, but which just happens to not be a <i>hypertext</i> document? For example, a mind-map, or zoomable-level-of-detail timeline. Content that, on the modern web, you&#x27;d expect to be sent as a lightweight Javascript viewer app wrapped around the document itself. But where that&#x27;s only <i>required</i> because the web-browser itself isn&#x27;t already doing the job of attempting to render that document. Like it does with, say, SVG.<p>A lot of people think that &quot;web browser&quot; has some fundamental identity with &quot;hypertext document viewer&quot;, but that&#x27;s not what &quot;the Web&quot; is — the web is the set of resources you can <i>request over HTTP</i>; not the subset of those resources that are formatted <i>in HTML</i>. A &quot;web browser&quot; is fundamentally &quot;a tool for letting you <i>navigate to</i> the resources at HTTP URLs&quot; — essentially an address-bar with a &quot;meta-renderer sandbox&quot; attached.<p>(Remember RealPlayer, QuickTime, and other plugins you could install that would enable your <i>web browser</i> to &quot;natively&quot; render new content types? Those things are all <i>also</i> &quot;the web&quot;!)<p>And to put an even finer point on it: if you put a PDF, or an SVG image, at a URL; and that PDF or SVG image <i>contains clickable links</i> — then that document <i>is a web hyperdocument</i>. A web of PDFs is just as much a <i>web</i> as a web of HTML documents is! So not even &quot;publishing hyperdocuments on the web&quot; is necessarily coupled to HTML. (Tangent: remember VRML? It allowed clickable links, too. VRML was a hyperdocument format!)<p>(Are plaintext files that happen to include textual URLs, hyperdocuments? If so, then a gopher or FTP client would <i>also</i> technically be a &quot;web browser.&quot; That&#x27;s going a bit too far, I think.)')
