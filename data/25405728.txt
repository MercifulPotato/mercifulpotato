For some reason apple gets a pass on HN</i><p>Or, you know, Apple gets the same or more kind of criticism, but since you are biased to agree with it, you are blind to it, and only see the praise&#x2F;defenses.<p>&gt;<i>for things like fighting to keep forced labor camps open</i><p>That&#x27;s probably because the framing of this by the media is BS, playing into the trade war objectives and narrative of the US foreign policy.<p>It&#x27;s just that these companies have a lot of suppliers in those areas, unrelated with any &quot;labor camps&quot;, whereas the US&#x2F;law has put a wide canvas that includes a huge area and all kinds of inoffensive suppliers. Seeing that the companies can&#x27;t just cut off their supply chain on the drop of a hat, they ask for extention period, better monitoring on which and if any of their particular suppliers might actually involve such labor, etc.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t make for good headlines for the masses, or for good propaganda.')
