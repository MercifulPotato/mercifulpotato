Even if such a lawsuit is entirely baseless, it takes time and money to deal with.<p>It&#x27;s the reason so many companies prefer contractors to short-term full-time employees. You avoid all the new-hire overhead, and you can always renew someone&#x27;s contract for another six months, but if&#x2F;when you want to let them go you just let the contract end and that&#x27;s it.')
