Item(by='disgruntledphd2', descendants=None, kids=[25104080, 25101224], score=None, time=1605445038, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25100730, text='This is a deeply misleading (though somewhat accurate) comment.<p>The reason it&#x27;s misleading is because the 70% above (who may be called data scientists) are not actually data scientists, at best they are data analysts.<p>In general, the core difference between data scientists and data analysts is that the former can code in at least one language (SQL doesn&#x27;t count, unfortunately).<p>However, because the term data science became so popular, everyone re-branded their analyst roles as data scientists leading to this concern.<p>Additionally, the post I&#x27;m replying to is pretty biased, as the OP talks about productionising models. While this is a major facet of DS work, it&#x27;s not the whole thing. TBH, I can find people to productionise models a lot quicker than I can find people who can figure out what to model, and how to measure it.<p>Some of those people are most comfortable with Excel, and while I&#x27;d prefer they used a different tool, I can&#x27;t argue with their output.<p>Also, the OP here is focused on deployment of Python ML models, which again is a subset of a very, very broad field.<p>That being said, i agree with most of the categorisations, except that the two critical attributes of good data scientists are a strong background in statistics and data common sense.<p>Data common sense is a weird attribute where when you look at the numbers and see if they are reasonable. For example, if you are running a mobile gaming company and see an ARPU of $5, something has either gone horribly wrong, or you&#x27;re going to be a billionaire (assuming you have equity).<p>This attribute is actually not that common amongst DS people, so it tends to be the limiting factor, rather than ability with containers and deployment (which I do agree is very important).')
