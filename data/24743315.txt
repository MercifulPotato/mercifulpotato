I would really have liked more perspective in the story from the music producers POV, as I feel like I got a unique and more objective point of view seeing both the business, personal, public, and artistic side. While many of the rappers are just kind of lifestyle method actors, and as the years go by I wonder about these late stage interviews.<p>Interesting article though')
