(At least, the vast majority of them who go into programming, rather than pure theoretical computer science.) Aside from a tiny minority who get to write infrastructure, whose customers are other programmers, the vast majority of programmers will be employed in some domain.<p>I&#x27;d rather see programmers have any outside experience... even literature or music or one of those other fields we often deride. The people who majored in that field are likely to be our customers, and when we don&#x27;t know how they work, we won&#x27;t be able to serve their needs.<p>At the very least, every programmer should have a minor in some other field. (And ideally not everybody going into the same physics or math fields.)')
