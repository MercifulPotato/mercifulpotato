Ergo, the only possible way to be safe is to destroy other civilizations as soon as they pop up their heads.<p>I feel like a lot of so-called solutions to the Fermi paradox fail when they speculate on what &quot;aliens&quot; would do. Would they seal us off and make a zoo, or find it morally wrong to contact us, etc, etc. It&#x27;s bold to assume a single policy, since there would likely be multiple alien civilizations, or multiple factions even if there is only one.<p>So I give this one more credit in that once you have reached 100% understanding of physics, you will know whether this premise true or not true and it more or less dictates that you answer it if it is true. However, I&#x27;m not convinced that with 100% knowledge of physics you would find yourself so vulnerable. And even if you were, it still seems various forms of containment would be just as effective as a genocidal attack.')
