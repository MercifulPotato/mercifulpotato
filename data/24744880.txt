It looks like an important point to me.<p>I am referring to two serology studies, one in Spain [1], one in Italy [2], both with the same conclusion. Health workers got more infected than the rest of the population, but outside of health workers, same % with covid antibodies between essential workers who were not locked down and people who were locked down.<p>The shape and timing of infections or covid deaths in Sweden is also almost identical to other European countries, suggesting the peak had more to do with the natural evolution of the virus rather than lockdowns.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)31483-5&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.istat.it&#x2F;it&#x2F;files&#x2F;&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;ReportPrimiRisultatiIndagineSiero.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.istat.it&#x2F;it&#x2F;files&#x2F;&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;ReportPrimiRisultatiI...</a>')
