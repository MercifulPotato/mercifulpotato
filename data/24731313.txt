Item(by='mdip', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602259824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24719680, text='&gt;  With so few firsts available in life, take those that present themselves and have a crack, even if failure is always an option.<p>About two years ago I realized I was doing the opposite sort-of without realizing it.  I&#x27;d <i>want</i> to do something given a set of constraints (say, create some app in some specific programming language or for some platform), google it, find that there was some loose chatter <i>around</i> the idea and I&#x27;d dismiss it thinking &quot;well, &#x27;The Internet&#x27; hasn&#x27;t done it&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible, so I shouldn&#x27;t bother&quot;.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a form of imposter syndrome.  For me, I think it&#x27;s more complicated:<p>I&#x27;d reach a point in a framework&#x2F;subset of &quot;whatever stack&#x2F;language I was focused on at that time&quot; where I was running out of obvious &quot;new things to try&quot;, so I&#x27;d Google and find the same list; &#x27;The Internet&#x27; decided for me that there&#x27;s really not anything else of use to do with these this framework, let&#x27;s learn a new one.<p>I need to &quot;do X with Y&quot;, I Google it and find &quot;Y&quot; nowhere, but find &quot;Z&quot; everywhere.  It&#x27;s a bad fit but that&#x27;s how &#x27;The Internet&#x27; does it.<p>The most common, and one I specifically guard against and it happens <i>consistently</i> with endeavors like this: I want to make &quot;X&quot; do &quot;Y&quot; knowing full well that &quot;Y&quot; is not designed for (or more frequently specifically designed to prevent me from) doing &quot;Y&quot;.  After wading through replies to countless other people daring to ask the question in a forum -- the usual: &quot;You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, can&#x27;t be done, you shouldn&#x27;t try it&quot;, &quot;Why would you even want to do that when you can get &#x27;Y&#x27; for $.$$ on eBay?&quot;, &quot;Google it&quot; (I did, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here after 4 pages of clicking).  Lovely how every question has 3-4 unhelpful-non-answers in one of these categories.<p>I changed my approach more than a decade ago while trying to reverse engineer the obfuscation a large telecom vendor used for their mobile broadband password storage in the Windows Registry[0] and succeeded in writing an &quot;obfuscator&quot; in a day from first introduction to deployed solution.  Ever since then, I trust my instinct when I have expertise.  When I do not, I read a very positive signal when &quot;a lot of are people asking if something can be done&quot; IIF there isn&#x27;t a good answer to why it &quot;can&#x27;t be done&quot; and any reasons why it &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be done&quot; don&#x27;t apply to the issue at hand.<p>[0] I recall, at the time, most of the answers were some form of &quot;IANAL... but...&quot; -- our purpose was to assign a random password to a user&#x27;s account, then install the client to the user&#x27;s company-assigned laptop with that password pre-populated (I didn&#x27;t come up with the idea, I just had to figure out how to do it).  The remainder of the answers were variants of &quot;you can&#x27;t crack AES&quot; and &quot;IM L33t H4x0R - WiLl CrAcK 4U&quot;.  It was <i>very clearly</i> not AES or anything resembling a hash.  It took so little effort to figure out that I would have <i>saved</i> time by &quot;Starting Before Googling&quot;.  Nobody (searchable) had tried.  Probably nobody had a (legitimate) reason to try.  It was just surprising how many people had a reason to &quot;not try&quot; <i>while also</i> discouraging others from trying with either wrong information or no information at all.')
