I haven&#x27;t had a need to look at CLRS since I took my graduate (!!!) algorithms course in college.<p>I don&#x27;t work in FAANG, but I am a senior developer in another industry.  It would take me way more than two and a half weeks to work through all of the problem sets in CLRS; two and a half weeks is more for someone who is a year or two out of college.  I don&#x27;t think being able to work through the problems in that book is indicative of a senior developer either...<p>Anyway, this is why I&#x27;ll probably end up never changing industries.  The barrier to entry is (too) high; especially for those of us who already make comparable money.')
