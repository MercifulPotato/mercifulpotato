Item(by='cubano', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610382598, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729085, text='I have 0.75BTC locked away in an encrypted distributed Android wallet that I am unable to remember the password for.<p>I received this BTC from an amazing soul here on HN (again, THANK YOU so much for that blessing if you are reading this!) who, after I wrote up a blog post about how I was arrested <i>without any probable cause</i> in Las Vegas, so very generously sent it to me after asking if it could &quot;be of use?.&quot;<p>BTW, the end result of the bullshit arrest was I was released with time served and the felony possession charge dropped due to the improper nature of the arrest, which was all caught on the officers bodycam.<p>So at the time I read the email, I was literally walking down Fremont Ave. wondering where I was going to sleep that night (remember I had just been released from Clark County Detention Center) as my 34 nights in jail had made me lose everything I owned in the weekly place I had been renting.  I was asked for a wallet address, so I quickly jumped on the playstore and dl&#x27;ed the first app with a good rating and was highly &quot;secure&quot;.  At the time I thought he or she would send me $50-$100 TOPS, so imagine my surprise when 0.75 (at the time worth like $600) plopped into my wallet.<p>I must have fat-fingered the password entry, and of course I couldn&#x27;t remember the 12-word phrase that the app author pleaded with me to &quot;write-down and store in a safe, secure place&quot;..no matter I thought at the time because <i>of course</i> there must be a password-reset email&#x2F;text thing. right?  RIGHT?<p>Well, no.<p>Alas, no happy ending here...I lost my very interesting and well-paying remote LAMP-development job working for a fast-growing company that was focused on lowering the overall cost to everyday people of filling drug prescriptions ( I know the irony of it all has not been lost on me ).<p>The owner was someone I really respected and was smart enough to know his systems needed a total re-design for security and performance reasons, and to be honest years later I still have not recovered, work-wise and economically, from that night I was illegally (not my opinion, the actual criminal court finding and its&#x27; legal outcome) arrest. I still hate the feeling I get in the pit of my stomach I get when I think of the bind I put him in...ugghhhhhhh.<p>So anyway...I still have the wallet safely stored away on an unencrypted USB (kind of late for that) that is physically locked away.  I did contact the app author and fortunately for me, his app code was FOSS on github and I have the archive.  Another fortunate item here is that I know I only used lowercase letters and the password was 12 char long.<p>At approx. $30k in value, it&#x27;s getting to the point where a concerted effort at cracking the damn thing is in order...however, I am personally very optimistic on the FV of BTC in particular and think I will hold off my attempts at cracking it until 1BTC=$100kUSD.<p>Finally...the main reason I wrote this up this long post was to ask the community if anyone here knows of any reputable services that crack wallets such as mine for a reasonable fee and that I can feel secure that they will not just steal the BTC if they do manage to open it?')
