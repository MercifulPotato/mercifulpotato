We have evidence of this happening repeatedly. Income tax being the prime example.<p>I believe the problem is this: we hardly ever describe the end state. We don&#x27;t define a metric that we look to achieve and then what we change about the policy when we&#x27;ve achieved it. So what happens is bloated bureaucracies become established and fight for self preservation, even if the mission they were on is complete.')
