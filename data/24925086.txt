Item(by='KorematsuFred', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603925461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24923679, text='&gt; how your mind is a channel of the Higher Mind of the universe<p>However trashy these headlines might sound, I will not dismiss them as junk without actually reading the article. (Again, I do not mean to say his article was not trashy, just that I wont judge it based on headline alone.)<p>For example millions of people do Yoga which literally means to &quot;join&quot; where the joining implies joining with &quot;cosmic self&quot; which is the the supreme objective of Yoga. People can benefit immensely from Yoga despite not having belief in any kind of cosmic self. In fact people claim to benefit from all 8 limbs of Yoga (Yama, Niyama, Dhyana, Asana, Pranayama, Dharana, Pratyahar, Samadhi). Plenty of people benefit from Kundalini Yoga though the ideas that there is a snake like thing in our backbone that can rise to head is purely nonsensical in scientific terms. I think the article on Randi, does summarize a lot of problems with modern skeptics. They dismiss things their own prejudices and premises can not explain without bothering to reach out to other side.<p>I think someone like Nissim Taleb has a far better perspective on these sort of things.')
