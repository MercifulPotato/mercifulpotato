And they&#x27;re probably right that this is the overwhelming use case!<p>I spend a few months in a corner of Twitter with lots of open-minded and free discussion of politics between non-celebrity nobodies. Many accounts in said corner were brigaded, and then shadowbanned or banned outright, etc.<p>I&#x27;m still sore about the platform&#x27;s intolerance, but it was a powerful lesson about the intolerance in modern society. Birdwatch seems to be yet another mechanism which enables and furthers the shutdown of free expression.<p>I&#x27;m very happy that HN is still capable of having thoughts that stray outside the Overton window, and that zealots are usually ignored =)')
