I could never get my DPM to work more than ~80% of the time, so I had to haul around a supplementary password store anyway. Now I&#x27;m on bitwarden, too.<p>I&#x27;d rather have a store that&#x27;s on another piece of hardware with logging and rate-limiting. Unlike TFA, I&#x27;d consider this a strength, not a weakness, but right now the convenience price is extreme.<p>U2F is good but it&#x27;s still only a second factor right now and the migration story is abysmal. If they can extend it to serve as a first factor and add a migration story, it would be perfect.')
