The exception for libel is in the First Amendment in the US and in many other countries. This is not just about the US.<p>And as for payroll taxes, they are still taxes, but they are not applied on all income. For example, they do not apply to capital gains, or to income above ~$140k. Also, social security is (at least in theory) a forced savings plan, and people who pay into it more over their career then receive more out when they retire.<p>Income taxes, on the other hand, are not capped at a certain level, and you never get money back later based on how much income tax you paid in the past.<p>There are times where it is silly to refer to them in the aggregate, but it is not &quot;Doublethink&quot; to talk about them separately. They are different in important respects.')
