Item(by='bccdee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605201082, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25071660, text='Yeah, it has a strange sense of economic blindness. The article seems to think that the big innovations they&#x27;re talking about are &quot;renting clothes by the day,&quot; or &quot;everyone uses driverless cars,&quot; but in reality the innovation is in how the economy doesn&#x27;t need money to function.<p>Like, I get that this is a post-automation utopia, but at no point in history has capitalist automation ever meant that people need to do <i>less</i> work. It has always meant that people lose their income and go hungry. &quot;We created a society which encourages people to innovate &amp; pitch in  without punishing them when they don&#x27;t work&quot; is, sociologically speaking, a much more interesting and important development than &quot;the algorithm recommends me clothes in the morning.&quot;<p>The most interesting thing is that the author seems not to realize that this all entails an end to capitalism. They say things like &quot;my living room is used for business meetings when I&#x27;m not there,&quot; but what business meetings? How is anyone making money in a society where everything&#x27;s free? If no one&#x27;s making money, is it even a business? Does everyone do it purely out of passion? Or do we needed some form of soft incentive for people to be involved in the economy? What form would that take?<p>This article raises a million interesting questions, but seems interested only in entertaining the most boring ones, like &quot;how would algorithms be involved with this?&quot; and &quot;what if I had no privacy?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s as if they picture every business being like Gmail, where it&#x27;s free because that&#x27;s in the interest of the service provider. But Google still needs to turn a profit from <i>somewhere.</i> It&#x27; can&#x27;t be Gmails all the way down. He&#x27;s trying to propose communism, but imagining that that would merely entail businesses gradually reducing all their prices down to zero for some unexplained reason.')
