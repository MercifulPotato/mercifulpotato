It&#x27;s made to ease the life of the developer, usually an inexperienced one, at the expense of the user.<p>&gt; IMO, for security reasons alone, it&#x27;s no longer realistic to expect software without at least occasional updates.<p>If people would stop rewriting things that already work fine, we&#x27;ll run out of vulnerabilities at some point. Or, if you must rewrite them and have a good reason to do so, at least use a memory-safe language. Even C++ is much better than C and raw pointers. Anything is better than C and raw pointers. Yet all major OS kernels and most userspace components are written in C and use raw pointers and vulnerabilities in those are being found all too often.')
