When he wants to log into something, he then uses the sites’ “forgot password” as his “OTP” to assign a new one, log in with it.  He does not store the random string, so his password is random, he doesn’t know it.  Sounds like a lot of trouble, but my point is “forgot password” can kinda be otp for those paranoid enough.')
