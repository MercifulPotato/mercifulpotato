Then I would make sure to compute <i>literally everything</i> multiple times and check that the results match. At this point, the execution characteristics of the computation are dramatically altered from the real world, the test results are unlikely to be useful.<p>You suggest tactics that stop short of redundant computation. Would that really work? Like, how do you gain perfect confidence in your system emulator? I donâ€™t see how you would fully account for bitflips...')
