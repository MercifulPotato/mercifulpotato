But speech also has an element of being heard.<p>When the First Amendment was ratified, speech in a public square was the commonplace way of getting a message out to the world. Now, that commonplace medium is controlled by private corporations that don&#x27;t fall under the jurisdiction of the First Amendment. If &quot;free speech&quot; continues to be important, then we need to create additional protections for speech in these virtual public squares where people can be heard, not just for speech in Internet wastelands that are the digital equivalent of an ice floe in Antarctica.')
