I&#x27;d be happy to put down a $10 stake to participate in something like Hacker News, for example, if that would help to combat astroturfing and bad behavior. (Honestly for how much I post on HN I&#x27;d be prepared to stake more.)<p>There&#x27;s been a lot of research done in this area by the Ethereum devs under their migration from &quot;Proof of Work&quot; to &quot;Proof of Stake&quot;, including research on the game-theory of &quot;slashing conditions&quot; (i.e. when you lose your stake). You get some cool community-policing possibilities by allowing any member of the community to collect a bounty paid for by claiming part of the forfeited stake, if they can present an example of a member breaching the rules. For something requiring review this would perhaps have less benefits, but could still be useful; rather than moderators having to watch every message go by, they would just look at the &quot;flagged&quot; queue, and users would now have a financial incentive to add something onto the flag queue, perhaps also having to pay a small amount to take that action as well, to disincentivise spamming &quot;flag&quot; entries. I&#x27;m sure you could build this all on Ethereum if you were so inclined, with &quot;admin moderation&quot; being a call to an external trusted Oracle service where the moderators live.<p>Of course there are also substantial risks in turning a system based on community goodwill into a financial game; people behave differently when they are purely optimizing for a financial game vs. when they are not.')
