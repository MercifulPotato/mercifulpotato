Plenty of people understand that just fine. It&#x27;s so easy to understand that there is even a simple ancient parable about it (of the Chinese Emperor and the chess board).<p>The problem is people who are obsessed with the concept of exponential growth even though &quot;grows exponentially until everyone is infected&quot; is not a real thing that happens with viruses, even though COVID-19 no more shows exponential growth than the sine wave does (sin roughly doubles at points), even though Farrs Law is all about how microbial diseases show S-curve type growth.<p>This leads to crazyness like the UK&#x27;s chief medical officers going on TV and presenting a graph in which the last few data points are in decline, but with sudden endless exponential growth projected into the future, along with claims that &quot;this isn&#x27;t a prediction, but clearly, we have to take extreme action now because of exponential growth&quot;.<p>Observing exponential growth for a few days in a row does NOT mean endless growth until the whole world is infected. Growth rates can themselves change over time, and do. That&#x27;s the thing people don&#x27;t seem to understand.')
