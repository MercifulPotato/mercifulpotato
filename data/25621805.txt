I have tried writing a VM with Rust (crafting interpreters) but outside of that I don&#x27;t have a lot of low level experience with it. I am also in the minority that believes Scala codebases are simpler than all the Java codebases I have come across. Maybe it&#x27;s just me :D<p>I didn&#x27;t know Zig can provide memory safety using it&#x27;s features. If that&#x27;s the case it&#x27;s great, I need to try it out! Although I am sceptical about the claim that in truly safety-critical domains Rust would not be adopted where Zig would, but I am again out of my depth here, so :)')
