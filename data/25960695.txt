Consider, for instance:<p><pre><code>    I am a paragraph belonging to the previous section but it looks like the heading belongs to me.\n\n\n    I am a heading indicating a new section\n    =======================================\n\n    I am a paragraph belonging to the heading but the heading is weirdly separated from me.\n\n    I am another paragraph belonging to the heading.\n\n</code></pre>\nIn some editors&#x2F;IDE, the underline even gets highlighted &#x2F; boldfaced, thereby exacerbating this effect.')
