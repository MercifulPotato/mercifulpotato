Item(by='mikedilger', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610829865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25802987, text='I&#x27;m unsure whether it would be ruled libel, but I lean towards yes it would. There are two ways of seeing it:<p>1) It is a false statement by google themselves (so no ยง230 protection) that caused material damage  and is thus libelous\n2) It is an opinion protected under free speech, and the free behavior of a private company, and the words like &quot;may have&quot; show it is not a statement of fact, and &quot;deceptive&quot; is just an opinion.<p>Yet it feels very wrong and definately Google&#x27;s fault, and Google should be responsible for the damages, morally speaking.<p>It&#x27;s more than just a false statement, the pop-up is keeping users from visiting the website.  However, Google doesn&#x27;t intend to harm these companies in order to gain competitive advantage, it just harms them accidently, so the monopoly argument also has problems.<p>It seems to me that we need a new law, or that current jurisprudence has let this one slip through and perhaps there will (in America) never be a proper crime for this situation due to divergent jurisprudence in this space that left open this gap.<p>I would like to know whether it has been tested in court, or if anyone is in process of doing so.')
