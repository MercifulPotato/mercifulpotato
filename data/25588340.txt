Often cages stacked on top of each other.<p>Factory farming of eg, chickens and pigs has previously led to avian and swine flu outbreaks, so there&#x27;s strict monitoring of viruses around those farm monocultures. But in the wet markets of Asia there&#x27;s often multiple species together that would rarely encounter each other in the wild.<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine uses bat feces, pangolin scales and other exotic products, with an emphasis on live animals. Bats and pangolins are a vector for virus and cross-species virus transmission.<p>Moving wet markets indoors into sanitary conditions, and banning the sale of live produce would go a long way to preventing future outbreaks.')
