Part 2) In different positions the spine has different load pressures (see chart <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;owsleychiro.com&#x2F;positions-that-put-the-most-strain-on-lumbar-discs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;owsleychiro.com&#x2F;positions-that-put-the-most-strain-o...</a>).<p>In any higher pressure (non-lying down position)  the problem then is simply the combo of higher pressure preventing diffusion and no movement increasing diffusion.  Fix one, or the other or both.<p>Hunch is though 60 min straight without movement in any other non-lying down position is way too long. Sound right?<p>(me: bike accident, L2 compression fracture, now paying attention to my back) I am working on this too from another vector but get the lie-down desk angle, and at the moment it is credible to me.')
