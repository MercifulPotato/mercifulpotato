Some people drop their fifth formal working day to become bicycle couriers, Uber drivers or whatnot in the &quot;sharing economy&quot;. The reason is taxation regimes.<p>80% or 100% gross wage as a median income employee will hardly make any difference in net wage around there. A friend for example recently got a promotion from an entry level job (with tax discounts) to something more in line with her qualifications (without tax discounts). 600€ gross salary increase translated to 155€ net salary increase. All the rest got eaten by tax and social contributions increases.<p>Belgium combines high formal job taxes combine with a low tax scheme meant to formalise &quot;sharing economy&quot; jobs. These enjoy super low 10% taxation up to 500€ per month. Many people actually do the math. They switch to 80% formal jobs hardly losing any income. Some actually increase their income by becoming pizza couriers or Uber drivers in their 20% time...<p>UPDATED: corrected the net wage delta from 100 to 155€.')
