Item(by='vkou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607451905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25348432, text='&gt; There are two parties to a transaction, and by definition of agreeing to a trade, both benefit.<p>1. So, what you&#x27;re saying is that banning imports hurts ourselves.<p>2. The parties who benefit from a trade are not necesarily the countries involved, but a handful of individuals in the countries involved. Foreign policy should not be set for the purpose of maximizing their comfort. It should be set for the purpose of maximizing overall welfare.<p>3. If China wants to export useful goods, in exchange for worthless pieces of paper that they can&#x27;t buy anything with because of tariffs, that sounds very much like &#x27;not our problem&#x27;.<p>Either way, this is all a complete tangent from my original point - that Google, Facebook, etc, <i>do</i> operate in China, and <i>can</i> operate in China, when they adjust their local operations to comply with local law.<p>The TikTok ban has nothing to do with lack of compliance with local law, and everything to do with an arbitrary executive order, not approved by congress, issued by what is now a lame-duck president. (Which is, ironically, the very same kind of capricious behavior that folks accuse the CCP of.)<p>You don&#x27;t want foreign social media companies operating in the US? Fine. Pass a law banning that. Get ready for the world to reciprocate, though. I&#x27;m sure there are Indian, German, French, and British startups chopping at the bit, waiting for an opportunity to move into the space that banning Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;LinkedIn&#x2F;Yelp would do in their countries.<p>The US has everything to lose, and nothing to gain by getting involved in this war - because it has a monopoly on exporting social media. By your logic, for example, Germany would lose nothing from banning US social media platforms, because it <i>has</i> no social media platforms that are being exported to the US market, and thus, a reciprocal ban would have no effect on them.')
