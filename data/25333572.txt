But this is just what non-innovator say.  It is an excuse for mediocrity and failure and stagnation.<p>There is tons of uArch improvements in Apple&#x27;s chips.  That is why they consistently beat even the other ARMs chips on the same process nodes.<p>AMD also has been significantly innovating with uArch.<p>I love the innovation we are seeing these days.  We are definitely not in an TDP era (where only TDP matters!  but of course TDP is important), we are in another golden age of CPU&#x2F;GPU innovation and it is beautiful.  Reminds me of the 1990s and early 2000s.')
