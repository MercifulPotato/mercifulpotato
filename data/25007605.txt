Strong entrants either get acquired, and merged into the Borg, or are sidelined as the incumbents defend their turf sometimes through enhancements to the product &#x2F; feature set, but often through somewhat anti-competitive actions that bar entry from new entrants.<p>While I would like to think the world is a meritocracy (&quot;let the best product win&quot;), the truth is far from that. And I think a lot of this piece from 2008 rests on half-truths and wishful thinking.')
