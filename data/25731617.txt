Personally, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of racism&#x2F;sexism&#x2F;etc. so I find it hard to mind, but as I&#x27;ve shown, they also moderate contested political claims, like stuff about Biden&#x27;s crime bill, Hunter Biden, etc.<p>Those are political issues, and I&#x27;ve provided evidence of them enforcing that viewpoint. The original comment provided no actual evidence of Parler enforcing a single viewpoint, but we all know what Parler is so it doesn&#x27;t take (me at least) much convincing.<p>I&#x27;ve explained both why my comparisons are not logically flawed (no evidence that Parler pays for a &quot;certain political agenda&quot;) and have stronger epistemic backing than the claims being made about Parler.')
