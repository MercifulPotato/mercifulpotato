While I was good at highschool math, matrices never clicked for me until almost 3rd year of university, when a good prof took the efforts to make it &#x27;click&#x27;. I never felt like cooking until I began staying alone, gave it an honest (an necessary) try due to monetary requirements, and now it is my main hobby that I can&#x27;t live without.<p>I understand that this argument can be use like the great filter, where if you don&#x27;t like something it hasn&#x27;t clicked yet, so keep going and it will click. But, for most things, we know &#x27;click&#x27; checkpoints. For musical instruments, it tends to be the first song. For programming, it is your first repository. For math, it tends to be your first moment when a group of seemingly unrelated things fall into place to give you a neat derivation or when you find a visualization that works as an analogy 100% of the time.<p>The first few weeks of a lot of things are straight up miserable. (new Musical instruments and new languages being major examples of it). It is only after you have understood the basics can you start enjoying them.<p>&gt; The problem is school forces it on kids, without investing in showing the kid why they would want to learn it in the first place<p>Absolutely. That investment is key to making forced learning work. Much like training wheels, once they can balance the topic on their own, you can stop trying to make it click, and the student will sustain their interest on their own.<p>&gt; having to follow the classroom&#x27;s pace<p>This is incredibly annoying. I remember binging the whole English textbook in the summer before the year started, then impatiently fidgeting or reading fantasy fiction novels under the table because the class felt that it went too slowly.')
