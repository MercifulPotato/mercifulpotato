As the GP mentioned, billing is delayed, but you could set alarms on your lambda usage. You could even use something like X-Ray to get more insight into what your usage looks like.<p>The problem is there&#x27;s not a clear way to tell the difference between recursive calls and heavy traffic.<p>AWS components are fundamentally a network of nodes that are sending traffic to other nodes. But there&#x27;s no unifying language that can model this, so you can&#x27;t describe what this graph ought to look like. (e.g. you want to be able to say &quot;lambda Foo should be called twice for each event to Bar&quot;.)<p>And that&#x27;d be hard to do since most nodes are general purpose computers, like Lambda and EC2, that can send traffic anywhere for arbitrarily complex reasons.<p>Since you can&#x27;t describe what it ought to look like, trying to alarm on it becomes a problem of detecting anomalies. You can sort of do it, but AWS doesn&#x27;t want to do it because they&#x27;d be making a promise they couldn&#x27;t generally keep.')
