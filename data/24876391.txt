Major accidents can render tens or hundreds of kilometers of sterile earth uninhabitable for thousands of years, during which time floods and fires can continue to poison surrounding areas as was seen recently with the wildfires of Pripyat.<p>We still, to this date, have no comprehensive or cogent plan to properly extinguish a nuclear fire the scale of Chernobyl other than sacrificing first responders until the catastrophe abates.  We didnt even have a competent plan to prevent or arrest the meltdown at Fukushima which created its own 400km exclusion zone.<p>finally, we have no competent architectural, structural, or societal plan to alert or inform anyone 20,000 years from now of the vast areas of nuclear contamination we will have left buried in the earth in the desperate hope of staving off irreversible climate change.  The idea that we would so foolheartedly blaze a trail of atomic poison without considering in any of these articles a future generation smacks of a pandersome tone that seeks a quick and dirty answer to a problem that renewables --which require careful consideration and study-- can easily achieve.<p>Nuclear is the dullards flex-tape solution to a much larger concern of careful consideration, moderation, and sustainable lifecycles of energy for the future.')
