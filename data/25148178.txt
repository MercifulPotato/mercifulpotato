If the decision is &#x27;switch&#x27;, it is a lot easier. You can be open-minded about opportunities. &#x27;quit&#x27; does not mean anything. You don&#x27;t quit your current job and then start search for a new one. When you are not happy with what you currently have, you will see anything not current job a help rope (see current election). It is going to lead to some bad decisions. It is important to see what you are doing from a different perspective, and seek values. Then be open minded to explore other things now. Once you find something you really love, you will switch without asking anyone here. Wish you the best.')
