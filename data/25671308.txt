The NYT reported that there had been gunfire as Rittenhouse retreated, and he may have thought it was aimed at him.<p>The Policeman was with a number of other cops. They had ample room and time to retreat. There was a closed and barricaded door between him and the woman he shot. He fired the first shot.<p>They both have a case for self-defense, but the Cop&#x27;s case is going to be a harder sell.')
