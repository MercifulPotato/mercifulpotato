Probably for the first 3+ years.  They&#x27;re a disaster, and it&#x27;s taken my company a year -- with another year or more to go -- to recover.<p>It&#x27;s not even necessarily their fault; they just need piles of time and mentorship and direction that you can&#x27;t afford to give yet.  Worse, you&#x27;ll quite possibly end up firing them when you eventually start reigning them in and they don&#x27;t like being told how to build things.<p>Trust me, it&#x27;s been an extremely painful experience.')
