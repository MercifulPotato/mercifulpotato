Let&#x27;s say you have a setup with Nginx managing input RTMP and producing HLS segments in a local directory and you want those distributed to different &quot;edge&quot; servers. I can think of using inotify + rsync or pushing into an object store and let in handle replication (not sure if it would be fast enough?).<p>For various reasons (and for now) I would like to skip pushing them into S3 and use Cloudflare&#x2F;Cloudfront.')
