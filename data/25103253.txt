And if you continued reading you would have noticed that multi-threaded rendering context implementation is already provided. So, I don&#x27;t really understand what is your point here.<p>There are Blend2D users that started using the library based on their own benchmarks that compared Blend2D, SKIA, and also AGG. So there are already users that use Blend2D instead of SKIA based on their own benchmarks, and I think that&#x27;s a much saner approach than following your &quot;expert wisdom&quot;.')
