I can do chores like dishes or laundry so they&#x27;re not all waiting for me after work. I can go for a walk without being that guy who takes too many walks. Truly anything so long as the time allocation and availability to plug back in are appropriate.<p>For me, this is why I prefer remote meetings be strictly business, and changing that isn&#x27;t particularly compelling. My coworkers are cool, but prioritizing them over the rest of my life makes no sense to me so long as the value I bring to the company remains just as strong.')
