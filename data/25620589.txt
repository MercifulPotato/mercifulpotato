What is the value of that?<p>One might say it is $100B because interest rates are 0.<p>Not discounting future earnings would make companies extremely valuable. Usually, high P&#x2F;E ratios are reserved for growth companies. But without discounting, even a company that does not grow at all would be well worth a P&#x2F;E ratio of 1000. It just has to keep going for 100 years.<p>What do you guys think?')
