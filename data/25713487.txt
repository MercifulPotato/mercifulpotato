The fact that a court upheld the view in contradiction with fairly plain language of the law caused some controversy.<p>The above doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;The election was stolen&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t mean it would have turned out differently. But I think there is some room for debate. Even though Trump is aggrandizing the issue politicians do that all the time and aren&#x27;t de-platformed for it.')
