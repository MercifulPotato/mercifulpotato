Spent the first few years of my career as as a VAX sysadmin, and basically lived in front of various VT220s, 320s and 420s. Never got to use an original VT10x though.<p>I still hanker for a VT420 as they were the best - I can&#x27;t afford one though[1], so I&#x27;ve had to settle for a Wyse WY-50 for my retro collection, which although is VT compatible, is not nearly as nice.<p>---<p>[1] If you have one you want to sell, let me know!')
