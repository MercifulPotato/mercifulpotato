The solar incidence may be too weak to support much of anything.<p>Says who? The solar constant on Earth is about 1360 W&#x2F;m².<p>Due to the atmosphere, only about 1025 W&#x2F;m² actually get to the surface.<p>Mars, just from applying the inverse-square law has an average solar constant of about 589 W&#x2F;m². Due to the lack of clouds and thin atmosphere, most of that reaches the surface.<p>So basically you get more than half the energy per unit area than on Earth. Coupled with batteries or power-to-gas and even wind power, I see no major power problem on Mars.<p>It&#x27;s not as if there&#x27;s a lack of usable land for solar arrays or big stacks of batteries on Mars...')
