Not in theory. Not academic or institutional one offs... no, it’ll be mass-produced and in the hands of consumers.<p>Intel’s failure to get their fabs running has put them into a death spiral unless they pull off a miracle.<p>Also, if Apples ARM chips are really that fast they will be purchased by the shipload to be sent to performance critical operations like HFT. They will be put into servers or turned into them to squeeze and eek out every possible advantage... which will shit on intels most profitable lines (Xeons for single threaded workloads).<p>It’s gonna be a crazy time.')
