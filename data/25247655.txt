What would happen is the world would move on from Windows and the world would be a better place for it.</i>&quot;<p>Linux users can&#x27;t make Linux desirable, so they want authority to ban the competition. So much for &quot;freedom&quot;.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>Something that&#x27;s been desperately needed for like two decades now.</i>&quot;<p>People weren&#x27;t interested enough in buying BeOS, and Linux organisations can&#x27;t even give it away for free.
