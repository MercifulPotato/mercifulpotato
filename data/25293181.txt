The conversation is about DEI, the fact she pointed out more accountability is necessary, the abruptness of it all, etc. I didn&#x27;t know who Timnit Gebru was and almost didn&#x27;t click on it because this sounded like some random researcher and I&#x27;m sure Google fires people all the time.<p>Once I was reading it I realized this is quite interesting after all.')
