They really are that deluded and dangerous. This needs to end, now.<p>The nutcases also believe that the governments are working with big tech to eliminate cash so that anybody who doesn&#x27;t toe the line can be &quot;permanently cancelled&quot;. Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous? I hope in the future we can just have an algorithm that disables the bank account of anybody who spews such divisive nonsense online. There is no place for that kind of hate in a society that strives for any kind of progress.')
