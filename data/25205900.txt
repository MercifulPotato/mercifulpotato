The &quot;hopes and dreams&quot; simple progress bar is labelled factually and can&#x27;t be accused of lying. And more information is available upon request and is simply factual.<p>A lot of work for a simple case of transferring files though. Much easier to default to the boring progress bar and some 0% to 100% assumptions to abstract things away so the &quot;dumb user&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to worry...\n(NOTE: I hate the seemingly persistent concept of &quot;dumb user&quot; that so many people have.)<p>If your users have worries about your application performance to the extent that you are required to address them, then 90% of the time a dumb progress bar isn&#x27;t the full answer. It may be an answer that makes management or user testing groups happy, but perpetuates the lie the article addresses.<p>Edit: snipped crap and added caveat note.')
