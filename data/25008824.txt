To show interactive progress use<p><pre><code>  rsync -vP file.bin server:\n</code></pre>\nUse &quot;-e&quot; to set ssh options, just like with scp. Use &quot;-r&quot; to transfer whole directories, just like with scp. But you&#x27;re likely to use &quot;-a&quot; with rsync instead which is recursive preserving all attributes and timestamps.<p>Another difference is that rsync will resume transfers, which scp can&#x27;t. It can do sparse transfers reasonably well. It also has more sane security defaults And, as implied by the name, update a remote directory including deletions.<p>Check out &quot;man rsync&quot; for the full story. It&#x27;s not long after your shell and editor in daily usefulness.')
