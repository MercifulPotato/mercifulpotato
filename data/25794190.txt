Unity rules all right now (yes I know there are other engines but Unity is clearly the big dog). 1000&#x27;s and 1000&#x27;s of games developed or being developed. Steam has endless lists of them. A lot of the Flash games moved to Unity but the bar was raised as developers pushed to stand out. So now you Flash game isn&#x27;t enough to stand out. You need something really special. A perfect example is Team Meat, they made Super Meat Boy and Super Meat Boy Forever. Half of that team started making Flash games and now it&#x27;s indie games. That pattern has repeated itself over and over. The difference is the delivery platform, it&#x27;s either mobile games or indie games or both often.')
