It should have a detailed description of what&#x27;s wrong, reproduction steps if appropriate etc, basically enough to show that you know what you&#x27;re doing, have put some effort into it, and care about the project. Perhaps you&#x27;ll get a response from a project maintainer, and can ask if they&#x27;re open to a PR to fix it. IME, there&#x27;s pretty good chances of positive engagement and eventual PR merge if you&#x27;re fixing an actual bug in a good way, and not trying to add some massive new feature or completely change the way the thing works or something.<p>If it&#x27;s excessively difficult to find a way to communicate with a project maintainer, well, maybe there&#x27;s your sign that this is not a good project to contribute to.')
