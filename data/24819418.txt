The study found that those watching <i>only</i> Fox News and MSNBC answered worse than people who watch no news programs at all. As far as I can tell, this latter group doesn&#x27;t exclude people who read newspapers, blogs, political websites, etc. Meanwhile, all of the viewers of other programs&#x2F;networks (NPR, Daily Show, CNN,  etc.) score higher than average, so saying &quot;often less knowledgable&quot; kind of buries the lede if you ask me, which is that some &quot;partisan&quot; viewers are in fact, much more informed than others. Also, since the quiz the survey participants answered was split into domestic and international topics, FOX is the only network whose viewers consistently failed both on exceeding the average number of correct questions than achieved by &quot;no news&quot; viewers—MSNBC at least seems to be informing their viewers on domestic issues better than that baseline.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;publicmind.fdu.edu&#x2F;2012&#x2F;confirmed&#x2F;final.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;publicmind.fdu.edu&#x2F;2012&#x2F;confirmed&#x2F;final.pdf</a>')
