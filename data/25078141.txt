I&#x27;m sure Covid has been a factor in the deaths of many people.<p>Deaths, as reported, peaked in the spring. Epidemiologists have a name for an entirely mainstream explanation of what happened. They call it a &quot;harvesting effect.&quot; I agree that the name is unsavory. It refers to a disease quickly culling the weak in a population.<p>The majority of the excess mortality has accumulated since spring, _after_ the country went into forced lockdown. There is no reason to default to the belief, as you seem to be doing, that Covid has continued killing masses and masses of people. Certainly not compared to the much more salient explanatory force of the massive, nationwide lockdowns.')
