Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[24758864, 24759756], score=None, time=1602530456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750484, text='I feel like most surveys on this topic are not going to be a reflection of reality.  People are tired of being at home for a variety of reasons, including child-care difficulties and their inability to do much&#x2F;any socializing outside the home, plus added COVID-related friction when doing normal chores like grocery trips.<p>These stress points make people associate these unrelated negative things with &quot;working from home&quot;, which, in normal times, need not be quite the negative experience.  Sure, there are valid reasons to prefer working in an office: lack of a workspace at home, desire for professional social interaction, desire to separate work life and home life, etc.  But I think a lot of people who are so negative about working from home right now would be more positive about it if the COVID-related difficulties were removed.<p>I&#x27;d like to see this survey repeated, say, a year after things go back to normal (or as normal as they&#x27;re going to get).')
