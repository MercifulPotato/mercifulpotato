Either trusted third parties (that are currently being maligned to shake our faith in the voting system), open ledger voting, or steep cryptography. I&#x27;m personally in favor of the cryptography, but I&#x27;m also able to understand it. Unfortunately as it goes against making the system widely understandable, I&#x27;d expect the same kind of &quot;fake news&quot; attacks were seeing presently.<p>FWIW mail in voting also gets rid of the secret ballot. Organizations haven&#x27;t really adapted to taking advantage of this, but we&#x27;re on borrowed time. The fundamental problem is that our current system relies on trusted third parties, and that trust is breaking down.')
