Pick up some of them. You know a good chunk of shows won&#x27;t make it past S1. Some won&#x27;t make it that far. But, especially pre-reality show, you still have a schedule to fill with scripted TV. So you throw a bunch of mostly economical stuff at the wall and see what sticks. The stuff that does, you pick up and groom it.<p>STREAMING: Same deal with pilots. But now your main objective is to find that hit which will net you a bunch of new subscribers. Yeah, you need filler too but that&#x27;s not as big a deal. So you&#x27;re probably incentivized to do more swinging at the fences. And you probably don&#x27;t care about having as many slow burn series because it&#x27;s all about how many new subscribers you can sign on and, especially with serialized TV (which streaming&#x2F;internet has also helped enable), if you don&#x27;t grab people up-front, it&#x27;s probably a waste.')
