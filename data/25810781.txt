People do judge each other and have opinions and put them in little mental boxes all the time. Impressions matter and can make or break your life. For example, anyone who used to be fat and then loses weight can attest that it matters what others think of you and they do think things. It&#x27;s comfortable and uplifting and &quot;wise&quot; to say that nobody cares but they do. People assess their relative status and success all the time by comparing with others.<p>Now this doesn&#x27;t mean you have to go crazy trying to satisfy everyone because you can&#x27;t. People want contradictory things from you. You need to have your own moral or other principles to keep on track of a certain path in the face of rejection. But if everyone thinks you&#x27;re an asshole, the answer isn&#x27;t to just ignore everyone.<p>I think a better lesson is that it&#x27;s better to have some haters and some who really like you than to have everyone be lukewarm about you and ignore you. The haters are no big issue unless they are really determined enemies, and the upside of the truly appreciative people is bigger. You can only get true deep connections if you accept the risk that some people won&#x27;t like you. As long as you try to please everyone you won&#x27;t really please anyone.
