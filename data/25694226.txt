It&#x27;s possible to believe that BLM-related vandalism and anarchism is bad and that an attack on congress is bad.<p>But... sorry, a direct attack on a joint session of congress that forces the lawmakers and VP to be evacuated is WORSE than what happened in Portland.<p>This country can tolerate another bunch of fires and broken statues outside the Portland Federal Courthouse.
