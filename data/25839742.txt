Most people need a certain amount of conversation to &quot;calibrate&quot; on how to interpret others&#x27; words and actions. Who&#x27;s a skeptic? Who&#x27;s a neophile? Who uses sarcasm a lot? Who doesn&#x27;t get sarcasm? Who expresses disagreement openly and often? Who hides it behind subtler signals, or avoids it altogether? (This one&#x27;s often cultural BTW; the more diverse the group, the more important this calibration becomes IMX.) &quot;Teamwork and common goals&quot; don&#x27;t ensure that this calibration will happen.<p>If it&#x27;s a group who have already calibrated, you&#x27;re more likely to get away with avoiding small talk. If you regularly have to interact with members of a broader group who don&#x27;t already know each other well, things can take a bad turn. Tiny misunderstandings can add friction, and even snowball until people are working at complete cross purposes or are even in open conflict. In 30+ years, 10+ of that working full-time remote, I saw this happen <i>over</i> and <i>over</i> again. Introverts, extroverts, whatever. Nine times out of ten, just a little bit of conversation outside of the  by-then-contentious subject areas helped a lot.<p>I&#x27;m not going to say your own experience is less real or important, but I will say it&#x27;s a bit presumptuous to issue a general challenge or say things like &quot;relationships aren&#x27;t built on small talk&quot; as an absolute truth. Often, they are.')
