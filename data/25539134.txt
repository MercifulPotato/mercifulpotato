If any entry level or junior level person is ever underperforming, management is 99% to blame. You cannot have high expectations from people who have no idea what they&#x27;re supposed to be doing and are essentially just winging it.<p>In all, I feel like that happens way more than management is ever willing to admit. It&#x27;s never the musician that&#x27;s bad, it&#x27;s always the instrument.')
