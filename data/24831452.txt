He developed software - who cares what tools he used to do it? Is a farmer who farms via tractor not a farmer?<p>The OP gave an apt example in FORTRAN - as FORTRAN is literally something which automates writing (lower level) code for you. Are software developers who use FORTRAN not software developers?<p>&gt;Because the only requirement for the new breed of &#x27;specialized&#x27; software developers might be they know English.<p>You assume everyone knows &#x27;English&#x27;. To my knowledge only ~20% of the world &quot;knows&quot; <i>basic</i> English - let alone the specific English required to instruct an AI to craft a website <i>precisely</i> to do what you want it to do.')
