It is not how the system currently works.<p>I&#x27;m not against moving to such a system, but it cannot be applied selectively to a couple few companies that would profit from it (in this case Uber, Lyft, Doordash etc).<p>Uber and Lyft are unprofitable by design. They are only profitable if you don&#x27;t account for the huge driver&#x27;s incentives and other users promotions that are always written off as a &quot;one time thing&quot;. (I looked at Uber&#x27;s financials).<p>If they want to become profitable, they need to increase price and most users would stop using it all together. They don&#x27;t want to go this way as it would instantly make the stock tank.')
