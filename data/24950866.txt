Good luck.</i><p>To counter that with my anecdata, my Debian installations usually outlast the hardware they&#x27;ve been built on. I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s much easier to start new builds with a backup (or the original disk) of the machine they&#x27;re replacing, that&#x27;s how easy it is to maintain a Debian system for me.<p>Heck, my first Linux desktop started out as Ubuntu Breezy, and ended its life as Debian Squeeze. Its replacement started out as Debian Wheezy, and is now on Bullseye.')
