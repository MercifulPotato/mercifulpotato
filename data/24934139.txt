Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[24935842], score=None, time=1603997740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24933460, text='&gt; There have been a virtually uncountable number of high-profile investigative pieces that criticise people in power published in the last 6 months! This argument is nonsense.<p>They have been attack dogs of one political party or the other. But its always been this way. Social media ( especially twitter ) has shown people that journalists are political actors, not dispensers of &quot;truth&quot;. They are part of the power structure, not a counterweight to the power structure.<p>At this point most newspapers should just be part of the democratic, republican or intelligence agency because that&#x27;s all they are.<p>I can almost guarantee that most of the people here attacking greenwald and partaking in the downvote brigade are news employees or members of a particular political party. It&#x27;s hilarious.')
