Getting rid of mandatory arbitration means that only large cases (with lawyers on contingency) and class-actions (where the lawyers are the only ones who benefit) will go forward. Mandatory arbitration is the best venue for medium-sized individual (settlement&#x2F;judgement) cases, and courts are not viable for them.<p>I see mandatory arbitration as a trade-off, and would simply prefer that people take that kind of clause into account when they transact with others.')
