Apple had used Samsung for the iPhone 4 through iPhone 5S.  The iPhone 6 was TSMC and the 6S was dual-sourced (20015&#x2F;2016, 5 years ago).<p>I&#x27;d guess that some of TSMC&#x27;s rise to prominence was partly driven by Apple not wanting to help Samsung.  Apple was really pissed about Samsung copying the iPhone - not just by shipping an Android phone, but by copying icons to make their phones seem as similar as possible.<p>You can definitely look back at MacRumors articles from 2014 and see that there&#x27;s a bunch of Samsung&#x2F;GlobalFoundries&#x2F;TSMC &quot;who will be able to make it happen&quot; talk.<p>In fact, re-reading through these articles, it seems that people thought that Samsung and its alliance with GlobalFoundries would be the winner of the iPhone 6S generation, but it&#x27;s possible that Apple saw better yields from TSMC and saw the potential there.  When you&#x27;re as big as Apple, you&#x27;re going to be really deep with your suppliers and you&#x27;re going to have a lot of expertise to judge suppliers and their future potential.  Maybe it was a combination of seeing TSMC over the iPhone 6&#x2F;6S generation that gave Apple the confidence to move away from Samsung.  Back in 2015, analysts were still expecting Samsung to be getting future business from Apple like the A10X processor.<p>Given that Apple is a buyer that can move mountains, how much of TSMC&#x27;s ascendency is potentially Apple committing to a lucrative multi-year deal allowing TSMC to invest a lot of money knowing they had guaranteed orders?  One of the hard things in business is knowing what to spend your time on - what do customers really want.  Google, for example, has spent plenty of time on things that weren&#x27;t good investments whether that&#x27;s Wave or AppEngine or Google+.  If you know &quot;doing X will definitely make me a lot of money&quot; it makes it easier to invest heavily in an area - basically, you kinda get the benefit of hindsight ahead of time with a long-term deal.<p>I hope Intel and Samsung continue to do well (or get back into the race as Intel&#x27;s position might be) since more competition means lower-cost processors over the long-run.  But I think it&#x27;s definitely important that you point out that only a few years ago TSMC wasn&#x27;t the powerhouse it is today.  While I believe TSMC is going to continue to invest and improve, Samsung is producing Qualcomm&#x27;s Snapdragon 888 on its 5nm process and if you&#x27;re right about Samsung&#x27;s 3nm process, that should provide a lot of orders there too - especially if Intel is willing to outsource manufacturing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;05&#x2F;a8-chip-underway-tsmc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;05&#x2F;a8-chip-underway-tsmc&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;tsmc-apple&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;tsmc-apple&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;tsmc-16nm-a9&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;tsmc-16nm-a9&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;samsung-tsmc-still-competing-a9-chip&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;samsung-tsmc-still-comp...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;samsung-apple-processors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;samsung-apple-processor...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;30&#x2F;tsmc-chip-production-yield&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;30&#x2F;tsmc-chip-production-yi...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;14&#x2F;apple-diversifies-arm-chips-macs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;14&#x2F;apple-diversifies-arm-c...</a>')
