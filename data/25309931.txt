College students at some universities get a lot of these, but don&#x27;t have much space to store them.<p>There&#x27;s gifts from well-meaning family members that don&#x27;t fit or are totally inappropriate (clothes for the wrong gender, fancy clothes that have to be dry-cleaned and don&#x27;t follow the work dress code).<p>There&#x27;s clothes that used to fit but don&#x27;t any more (again, basically everything teenagers and young adults own). There&#x27;s clothes that were required for one job and aren&#x27;t for a new one, especially clothes that would have to be dry-cleaned.')
