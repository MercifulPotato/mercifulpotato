I guess the Ministry of Truth has spoken.<p>There couldn&#x27;t possibly be other dissenting views on that.  It&#x27;s _true_ my friends.<p>Vox is clearly an impartial observer.  The Senate hearings which led to impeachment hearings on Trump (because he investigated Hunter Biden, who has been under FBI investigation for over a year now... a materially true fact) could not _possibly_ have been politically motivated.<p>Shutting down speech does not lead to &quot;facts&quot; or &quot;truth&quot;, it leads to uncertainty.  YouTube is basically the Catholic church, claiming they know the facts, they know the truth, and Galileo is spouting nonsense.<p>If you&#x27;re so confident, then let those people speak and use arguments (even your ludicrous wall of links) against them.  That&#x27;s rational and dare I say it, scientific.')
