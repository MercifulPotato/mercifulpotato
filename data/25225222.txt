Positive comments get upvoted and praised, negative experiences get dismissed with a mix of victim blaming (usually &quot;set and setting&quot; comments) or explained away as exacerbating pre-existing underlying conditions. Eventually those with bad experiences give up on participating in discussions.<p>It does appear that Psilocybin has some therapeutic potential, but all of the good studies are performed in conjunction with professional-guided therapy sessions. DIY unguided experimentation is a different animal and shouldn&#x27;t be confused with what&#x27;s being reported in studies.')
