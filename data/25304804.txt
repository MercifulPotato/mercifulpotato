Viewed externally, much of the world cannot see a difference here.<p>Put another way, the differences between US political parties are exceptionally tiny, when measured against the <i>sameness</i> of those parties.<p>Yet what you&#x27;re describing instead, is how radicalized &#x2F; unable to communicate with each other, a party may be.  Or those with opposing political viewpoints.  Yet I see the same degree of &quot;They&#x27;re wrong, WRONG!&quot; coming from both main political parties in the US.  From people on both sides.<p>I agree that this is &quot;worse than it was&quot;.')
