The vectorization can also happen at the superscalar level, if borrowing the instruction queue concept from out-of-order designs: buffer operations for a while until you&#x27;ve filled a vector unit&#x27;s worth, align input data in the pipeline, execute. A smart compiler could rearrange opcodes to avoid dependency issues, and insert &quot;flushes&quot; or filling operations at the right time.')
