She&#x27;s had lots of experience in print and digital design, including at the DTC kid&#x27;s clothing brand Primary Kids, where she was responsible for email campaigns, social campaigns, direct mail, catalogs, webpages, and product packaging. As a first-10 hire at a small startup, Meryl wore many hats, managing campaigns, hiring other designers, and generally producing creatives wherever creatives were needed.<p>Meryl especially loves print design, and left Primary to start her own wedding stationery business, Jubilee Paper. She works primarily for clients with six-figure weddings and her work has been featured on Ruffled and The Knot. Working for these clients is just as much about exquisite design as it is an exercise in client and stakeholder management, managing vendors, and keeping all manner of production on schedule. Meryl consistently stood out to her clients as an excellent and organized project manager.<p>As COVID has dried up a lot of the wedding industry, Meryl&#x27;s seeking another full-time Graphic Design role. She&#x27;s very open to other DTC opportunities as well as the wider print &amp; publishing industry, including primarily digital roles.<p>Portfolio: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;meryl-miller-portfolio" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;meryl-miller-portfolio</a><p><pre><code>  Location: NYC or Philadelphia &#x2F; Remote\n  Remote: Ideally remote during COVID and in-office post COVID, but open to options\n  Technologies: Adobe products, Mailchimp, Sailthru, DAMs, Squarespace\n  Website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jubileepaper.com&#x2F;\n  Portfolio: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;meryl-miller-portfolio\n  Email: meryl.e.miller [at] gmail [dot] com</code></pre>')
