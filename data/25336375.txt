It&#x27;s been amazing for me. Not exactly what you&#x27;re looking for, but I got it after extensive research and it seems to be the best keyboard to get if you have RSI&#x2F;injuries.<p>Kinesis has several split models too that are cheaper, maybe you could build a side-holstered version if you got one of those.')
