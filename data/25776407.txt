It helps that I have a traditionally-male forename. I do not conflate others&#x27; pronouns with their sexual orientations or preferences as they are rarely any of my business.<p>If I&#x27;m asked I am not uncomfortable to state my pronouns and I consider such a question to be perfectly cromulent.<p>If someone proffers pronouns I take great care in using them correctly, as I do the spelling of their name and how they express any title they may have. What&#x27;s in a name? Respect is part of the answer.')
