They can choose without restriction who&#x27;s allowed to use their platform,&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a straw man. I never said anything like what you are pretending I said. They obviously could not ban users on the basis of race or religion or a number of other criteria.<p>But that&#x27;s not really what&#x27;s under discussion.
