Let&#x27;s say I prefer to get my hair cut by a barber that makes public statements in favor of gender equality instead of patronizing one that publicly advocates for the dynamics of Western society&#x27;s traditional gender roles. For the sake of this scenario, let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s no other relevant difference between the two barbers, except where noted. Should my disfavored barber be able to insist that I shift some or all of my hair care business to them since the reason I&#x27;m not using them is their speech? How much of my business should they be able to force?<p>Would it be any different if I preferred the traditionalist and the one who wanted to force my business were the equality advocate? What if my preferred barber just stayed quiet and it were the one who vocally advocated either view who insisted on my business? What if the business terms of the barber with distasteful speech were worse, and how much worse would they need to be for that difference to outweigh their free speech rights?<p>None of this seems very plausible to enforce well.<p>More importantly, who would decide among all these possibilities? That&#x27;s quite the power of imposing one&#x27;s views (and financial policies) on others. I&#x27;m not sure I trust any government or private regulatory authority with that much control over private lives and livelihoods.')
