The issue predates them and the ROC (Taiwan) has virtually the same claims.<p>In fact the &quot;9-dash line&quot; so strongly defended by the Chinese (Mainland) Government dates from WWII and the ROC claims over Japanese-occupied territory.<p>There is no right and wrong here. For a long time the neighbouring countries, including China, did not pay much attention, then Europeans and Americans colonised the region, now everyone is fighting their corner to further their own interests. It so happens that China has regained strength and has adopted a &quot;just do it&quot; approach similar to the time-honoured one Western countries have historically taken. I.e. they&#x27;ve learned the game at their own expense.')
