What happens when Pharma companies get caught lying in about effects of drugs? Are they going to be de-platformed? No, because they pay for ads and so they can spread lies all day.<p>Look at Study 329 by GSK which said that Paxil was effective in children (when in fact the data showed that it doesn&#x27;t work and causes suicidal behavior in children <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Study_329" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Study_329</a>\n). That published study was a lie and was published and used to put millions of children on drugs. Proven actual harm done to innocent kids.<p>Yet, GSK and other Pharma companies (which have all been caught doing the same thing) are still allowed to buy ads, to put things on TV, use social media (by the way often with fake grass roots organizations - Astroturfing - which also presumably is against social media policy).<p>I have no problem with the concept of it, but let&#x27;s be real, this is not done in a fair way. This is done for specific political reasons. Look what is going on with Dr. Mercola as a real life case study of this.')
