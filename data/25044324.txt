By its very nature, most vote fraud is hard to prove as due to the privacy protections in the system, it will boil down to people saying &quot;I saw fraud happening with my eyes&quot;. And there are people in the US making that exact allegation right now under oath. I take no position on whether they&#x27;re correct or not, merely observing that polls show the number of people who don&#x27;t believe the election was run properly is dramatically higher now than it was before election day (amongst Republicans, Dems of course love it and are sure there&#x27;s no fraud at all).')
