For some tests, FreeBSD was much faster, and for some it was much slower.<p>So, it depends on what you&#x27;re doing. A lot of the tests where FreeBSD was much slower were media related; it makes me wonder if some CPU acceleration didn&#x27;t get enabled; which could be FreeBSD (or Clang) missing a feature, or a benchmark issue or something else.')
