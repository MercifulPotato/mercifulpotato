They also analyze ORF8b and ORF3b sequences, specifically noting versions of ORF3b they&#x27;ve studied can &quot;antagonize interferon function&quot; (interferons boost immune system response) and discussing their own previous studies on ORF3b. The aim of the chimeras is to create a virus targeting the human ACE2 receptor like SARS-CoV did. They succeed — noting that some of their variants &quot;have a stronger effect than SARS-CoV&quot; — and also note &quot;It is very interesting to investigate in further studies whether [one wild virus variant&#x27;s] ORF3b and other versions of truncated ORF3b such as [their chimeric virus variants] also show [interferon] antagonism profiles.&quot;<p>Reading a paper from NIH on COVID-19 sequencing — <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7180649&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7180649&#x2F;</a> — guess what gets implicated?<p>&quot;The SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported to possess 14 ORFs encoding 27 proteins ... When researchers compare the SARS-CoV-2 with the SARS-CoV at the amino acid level, they found the SARS-CoV-2 was quite similar to the SARS-CoV, <i>but there were some notable differences in the 8a, 8b, and 3b protein.</i> [Emphasis mine.]&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know a lot about this subject. But as a layperson, it seems a little suspicious that WIV was making SARS-like coronaviruses in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, from bat viruses collected from Yunan, where the closest living relative of COVID-19 is from, and experimenting specifically with the proteins that are the most-novel in COVID-19 as compared to SARS?')
