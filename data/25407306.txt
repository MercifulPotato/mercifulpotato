If you buy less stuff in your local corner store and have Amazon deliveries instead, the stock market sees only the Amazon&#x27;s growth in revenue and ignores the loss of revenue of the non-publicly-traded store. If a company rents less office space and instead invests in various services and software for remote work, the owner of that now-empty commercial space isn&#x27;t publicly traded but the service&#x2F;software providers are.
