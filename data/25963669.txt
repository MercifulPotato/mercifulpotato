The big thing to be aware of is that managing remote people requires better management skills, so you need a boss who cares about doing it right. I had two experiences go sideways, in both cases my manager got stressed and busy, and because I was their only remote report, they did a crappy job. Prior to them getting too busy to do a good job, it was fine. It really is a lot better if they are a mostly remote shop.<p>pro tip: apply to places you want to work anyway, whether or not they say they will hire remote. I worked at a couple where they had not considered hiring a remote Canadian, and just needed me to tell them how easy it was after they saw I was a good fit. (one form, the W8-BEN. So easy.... but so many payroll departments don&#x27;t know that!)')
