I think it&#x27;s normal.<p>When you&#x27;re younger, you&#x27;re trying to figure out who you are and a big part of it is seeking out new people to learn about the world and yourself. I think you also tend to need others to validate you more. I can definitely tell that when I was younger I would share more about my hobbies or interests with others in the hopes that they would like them too and want to share in them with me, with a little bit of wanting to be complimented on my uniqueness. Now that I&#x27;m older, I do that far less.')
