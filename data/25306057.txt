All fundamental particles are point like and have no physical size.<p>Except ..... that&#x27;s not the right way to measure size, you measure the size of a particle by the forces interacting with it.<p>By that measure an electron has an infinite size (since an electric field is infinite), and a chair has exactly the size it appears to have, because that&#x27;s the size measured when you interact with it electromagnetically.<p>Objects don&#x27;t have one single size, their size varies depending on what tool you use to measure them.')
