I&#x27;m not being facetious. It might be that Pinterest is much bigger internationally. Yelp hasn&#x27;t taken off here because it&#x27;s not trusted and provides no real benefit over Google Maps.<p>There&#x27;s also things like this on Yelp, which makes a lot of people not want it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehustle.co&#x2F;botto-bistro-1-star-yelp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehustle.co&#x2F;botto-bistro-1-star-yelp&#x2F;</a><p>Pinterest is also a search engine for images. &quot;Images&quot; may include recipes too. Sure Google Images does that too, but Google bases its results on what it thinks you&#x27;re interested in, but Pinterests&#x27; results are based on what you tell it your interests are. Google might think I&#x27;m a 20 year old college female because of my interest in memes and cooking, and not give me the results I want.')
