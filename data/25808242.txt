I used to think the people who called out tyranny everywhere were just nuts, but it never ceases to amaze that everything nowadays keeps going &quot;centralize and control&quot;.<p>The recommendations are for enterprise networks, although they&#x27;re also reasonable (although not really accessible to the non-technical) for individuals who care about their privacy as well.<p>An enterprise network isn&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t be) some sort of individual free-for-all.  In fact, good security practice recommends (although this isn&#x27;t universally implemented) that <i>all</i> perimeter network traffic, regardless of type, be proxied (or MitM&#x27;d, as you put it) to protect from both intrusions and exfiltration of data.<p>Are you claiming that Enterprise networks should allow external resolvers to be used on internal resources willy-nilly?<p>In fact, good security practice demands that devices that aren&#x27;t authenticated (e.g., with 802.1x) shouldn&#x27;t be granted access to internal resources at all.  On the flip side, internal devices shouldn&#x27;t rely on <i>external</i> infrastructure resources either.<p>This isn&#x27;t censorship or some sort of fascistic control mechanism.  Rather, it&#x27;s an appropriate organization response to extant and potential threats to their IT infrastructure and data.')
