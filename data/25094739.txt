Pluses:<p>- tasty even by itself; can even be eaten without cooking<p>- fairly good in protein although has less per gram than milk, I think because some is lost in the whey that is discarded; but if you make it yourself (see next point), you can drink the  whey or use it in soup stock, or to cook any other dish like like a stew<p>- easy and fast to make it yourself from just milk and lemon juice<p>- goes well in  many other Indian dishes such as mutter (peas) paneer, alu (potato) paneer, palak (spinach) paneer, mix veg paneer, paneer chilli, paneer bhurji, etc. \nGoogling should find many recipes for all of these.')
