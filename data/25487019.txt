The actual circuit board looks to be about 2x the size of the pi. Their only reason for the massive mini case is economies of scale. They have to leave that case around for the intel mini for another year or two and all the tooling exists, so they didn&#x27;t have any costs there either.<p>I think the real next-gen mini should have been the iPhone 12 pro. Imagine a desk with just an Apple monitor, charger, and wireless keyboard. Pop your mag-safe phone onto the charger so you have a trackpad. The mm-wave connects to the monitor for video and giving access to it&#x27;s USB-c ports. You get the normal mac desktop ready to start working for the day. It&#x27;s not as powerful as most desktops, but it can give tons of plugged-in laptops a run for their money. More than good enough for 95% of users.')
