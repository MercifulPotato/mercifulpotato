Most importantly this: <i>&quot;...there seems to be two camps of people: those who want constant positive reinforcement and those who it completely has the opposite effect ...&quot;</i><p>If you are leading and or managing a team, one of the most important things you need to know are how do people want their feedback. My experience is that it varies from person to person (I suspect that there are many more than two camps :-)) and as such it is unlikely that you can meet that need in group feedback.<p>Because of that, my choice these days is to split feedback into two fora, the group status meeting and 1:1s. In the group, feedback is modulated by progress against plan. So &quot;we need to work harder&quot; for behind plan, &quot;neutral&quot; for on plan, and &quot;this team is killing it&quot; for ahead of plan. In 1:1s the feedback is based on the expectations that have been set for that team member, do they know what is expected of them? Do they know how it is being measured? And where are they with respect to measurement vs expectation.<p>1:1 feedback often times (for me) takes on more of a mentor&#x2F;mentee tone rather than a how are we doing on the schedule tone. Doing that well also requires a certain amount of trust which, as a manager, you have to earn by being honest with your team members.')
