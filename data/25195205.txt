A handful of my friends and I go to NAMM every year and just sit down and play every guitar all weekend. Play different things with different techniques all over the fretboard and you will almost always find something.<p>Most of the are minor issues, but it helps a lot in narrowing down something to buy.  Brand reputation doesn&#x27;t mean much these days, especially with electric guitars. The way those are priced you&#x27;ll see a huge spectrum in cost and construction techniques and the economics of electric guitars mostly means labor priced towards zero and cut corners.<p>11 and 13 piece laminate necks are a trend that I would like to see go away. It&#x27;s a &quot;look&quot; that nobody can really see, usually means worse tone and says you couldn&#x27;t find one good neck out of the wood you had.  Same with the relic look.<p>We usually find a couple of good Hall E brands every year with  a 1-3 year waitlist for a good custom guitar.  Some of those are today&#x27;s &quot;good&quot; brands (Aristides...).  Martin always has  a few beautiful acoustics to sell out of the custom shop that cost as much as a car.<p>Every year we usually find a different model Yamaha that&#x27;s probably $1000 cheaper than it should be.')
