I went on to read the details of their &quot;PUR subscription&quot; via Google Translate, and it seems to truly be a &quot;pay OR give up data&quot; model, the first one I&#x27;ve ever seen. That said, it still isn&#x27;t advertising-free[0] and contains some amount of internal, first-party tracking[1] (but see [2]).<p>Below are excerpts run via Google Translate. I&#x27;m truly very surprised by what I just saw - the directness and honesty of communications is even more refreshing than privacy-friendliness itself. Their FAQ covers privacy <i>and</i> advertising concerns separately, and is very specific. If I had a need for German-language news, I&#x27;d subscribe to this just as a token of appreciation.<p>--<p>[0] - &quot;We continue to advertise our own products discreetly because SPIEGEL readers expect information about new products from the company. We cannot technically remove advertising from podcasts and our digital edition, but this is played without tracking. Individual sponsorships are just as difficult to fade out, and separate page areas such as voucher and sports betting marketplaces that are independently offered by the providers there are only to be made inaccessible in the navigation of our journalistic offers - but not, for example, for searches from outside. This is the level at which the exceptions move.&quot;<p>[1] - &quot;We depend on it [internal usage measurements] for both basic control and further development of the news site, especially in order to optimize our payment model: Which texts are of interest to readers, where do operating elements not work, which pay offer might interest a reader and which rather not?&quot;<p>[2] -  &quot;What data does DER SPIEGEL collect from PUR subscribers? The customary reach comparisons and usage statistics for the control and optimization of the site, especially via our first-party service provider Adobe.&quot; - I&#x27;m not sure what they mean by Adobe being a &quot;first-party service provider&quot;, but I don&#x27;t like it collecting anything.<p>--<p>EDIT: here [3] is a list of cookies they set for PUR subscribers. Seems to be true to their word (and it&#x27;s nice this list wasn&#x27;t hard to find in the first place), but I&#x27;m worried about the presence of Outbrain on that list. I can&#x27;t imagine any legitimate interest a third-party chumbox provider would have.<p>--<p>[3] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odbdegi64ni2b3m74jattyok7i--www-spiegel-de.translate.goog&#x2F;services&#x2F;diese-cookies-nutzen-wir-im-pur-angebot-a-9d4ce0b4-1f37-4982-8582-9fb18d1fb5ba" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odbdegi64ni2b3m74jattyok7i--www-spiegel-de.translate...</a>')
