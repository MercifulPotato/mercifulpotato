It&#x27;s on the C++ side and does &quot;some funky things&quot; in the way of SIMD to eke out more performance. If memory serves, it took them about eighteen months to get an Intel native version out the door after the PPC&#x2F;Intel transition started.<p>Any serious audio apps are going to have an equally hard time, they do a lot of hardware tricks in order to lower latency, and since they&#x27;re not mainstream apps like MS Office or Adobe CS, they have much smaller teams of developers. That whole industry is very slow moving.<p>Finally you&#x27;ve got CAD and 3D stuff. Obviously that requires good drivers. In fact, that&#x27;s another way in which Microsoft will have a much harder time with this transition. Apple only has to write a driver for the one audio device that&#x27;s in every Mac, the one GPU, etc.')
