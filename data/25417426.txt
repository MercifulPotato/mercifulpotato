Someone can easily get between two rows of cars turning left without realizing it and get knocked over even when the cars are doing everything correctly.<p>The same is true of sharing lanes even on city streets, lanes simply are not wide enough to safely share as the motorcycle or cyclist has vastly reduced visibility and may miss construction lane markings etc that unexpectedly move traffic.')
