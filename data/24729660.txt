My aunts (3 of them) either teach physics or have a phd in Maths. Same on my father&#x27;s side.<p>In fact, you would be considered a loser if you didn&#x27;t have a degree or knew maths really well in my family. Which I don&#x27;t agree with.<p>The problem in the arab world is more political, with a bunch of people staying in power and using media and force to stay in power. It also doesn&#x27;t help that the west cry for more democracy but propels and supports those same dictators to stay in power to help their interests.')
