If it&#x27;s maps or vectors it works.<p>The basic implementation is predicate composition as we support multiple combinations of filters.<p>I hadn&#x27;t thought any deeper about &#x27;traversal systems&#x27; or optics, just parsing a grammar, creating predicates, and composing them. This is an interesting read, perhaps I should take the Clojure impl. further.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7krDIMjVzZM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7krDIMjVzZM</a><p>Probably the most fun coding I&#x27;ve done this year because I had an excuse to use the wonderful Instaparse again.')
