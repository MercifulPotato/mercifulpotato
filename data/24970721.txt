And yes, he has a bit of &quot;I&#x27;m the most important rockstar in the room energy&quot; but so do a bunch of VCs and founders.<p>The idea of moving towards market socialism with universal income and using central banking as a mechanism to reduce inequality is new-ish. There are many threads in his writings that are not about anti-capitalism, nor a return to previous types of socialisms, but of how to harness market forces to continue to generate progress while reducing their massively negative externalities.<p>In any case, his ideas are worth more discussion than his personality.')
