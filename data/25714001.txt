In giant megacorps I saw plenty of incompetent clockwatchers, mostly in management positions, where the business could function the same without them but they were inexplicably kept around, at least as long as the business was booming. Often times they would just have their teams switch offices so they would have something to put in their annual performance review (<i>&quot;I optimized personell location, fostering a culture of synergy and creativity leading to future improvements in productivity and innovation&quot;</i>).')
