(FYI: the following is not a sales pitch, everything is free )<p>As you should have realized by now, TikTok is the #1 organic growth opportunity for companies and personal brands alike, but sadly the tech scene has been lackluster in its efforts to make the most out of these free eyeballs while they are ready for capture.<p>I’ve personally built my TikTok profile from 0-100K+ followers in under 90 days, gathering over 17,700,000 views in the process, and have helped mentor other creators and small businesses which have amassed multiple million followers in total, which have translated into tens of thousands of dollars in revenue for many of them.<p>However, my passion is in technology, and as a consequence of this I live and breath startups every day of my life, which has inspired me to dive deeper  into this ecosystem and lit a fire in me to get my hands dirty aiding those who are currently in the trenches making things happen.<p>For this reason, I’d love to personally help you create a detailed TikTok growth strategy for your app or company that translates into actual username and revenue outcomes absolutely free.<p>I am looking to build experience in this new transition, for which all I ask in exchange is that once we’ve drafted and executed the strategy, you give me honest feedback on my performance as a consultant so that I can improve my skills and abilities for the future!<p>If this sounds remotely interesting to you, please feel free to reach out to me directly at jan@miabistro.com, or reply to this thread!')
