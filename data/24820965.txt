I had a driving license all my life but never bothered to buy one because public transport in switzerland is cheap and good enough for a single person. The situation changed now: I am not alone anymore and Corona happened. I do not plan to use public transport on regular basis in my life anymore. It is unimaginable to me how we did groceries before. Also we can save some money by buying more in bulk. It&#x27;s something simple, many people have it and it&#x27;s just insanely useful. I hope this will be my first and last ICE. I hope the next one in 3-7 years will be a (self driving?) compact(?) Tesla.')
