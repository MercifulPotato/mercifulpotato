From there, if you add in full async&#x2F;await support with a web server framework, you&#x27;re looking at ~6sec iteration time. If you bring in LLVM&#x27;s LLD instead of GNU or MSVC, you can bring that down to ~3-4sec. They&#x27;re working on adding support for their own LLVM competitor, Cranelift, that should further reduce those times. It&#x27;s only intended for debug&#x2F;development builds, though, so you&#x27;ll still need longer compile times for release.')
