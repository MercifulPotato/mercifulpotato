Item(by='refulgentis', descendants=None, kids=[25078751], score=None, time=1605239513, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25078551, text='Lots to unpack here:<p>&gt; It discourages exactly the kind of behavior it pretends to want to see<p>Assuming cartoonish levels of bad faith and asserting a contradiction in terms becomes the foundation for a lot of what follows<p>&gt; Dads are disadvantaged in the same way Moms are, but then they&#x27;re screwed over at work more (since expectations are set by articles like this one that it&#x27;s the mom&#x27;s duty).<p>As you noted above, the article advocates for the opposite of what you&#x27;re asserting here.<p>&gt; They&#x27;re screwed over a third time in custody battles, when thanks to stereotypes like these, they will invariably get the short stick on custody. Best a Dad primary caretaker can hope for, unless the Mom is a drunk psychotic, is 50&#x2F;50. Typical is Mom gets custody.<p>This simply isn&#x27;t true, 2 of the 3 cases I know the dad got 80&#x2F;20, primarily because he had a more stable situation, such as a full time job as a nurse, and&#x2F;or owning a house.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s perfectly possible to write an article like this in neutral terms &quot;primary caretaker,&quot; and point out the majority are women, and there&#x27;s a disparate gender impact. It&#x27;s an article about primary caretakers. By implying by correlation that it&#x27;s 100% women, it does a ton of harm.<p>As you noted, you believe this was _implied_ - as a neutral reader, I&#x27;m not inclined to just agree with your assertion that it was implied, you actively threw away that opportunity by opening strong with the claim that the article is &quot;pretending&quot; to &quot;want to see&quot; things - you can intro people with a strong take, in fact, I need to do that more in my writing. But, you can&#x27;t be three paragraphs in reasserting your strong claim, at this point we should have some discussion of evidence.<p>&gt; As a footnote, that problem is pretty common. We don&#x27;t have domestic violence laws. We have a &quot;violence against women act.&quot; I&#x27;m not even sure how that&#x27;s constitutional, but the result is that law enforcement ignores domestic violence against men.<p>You are asserting that the marketing name for one piece of legislation 24 years ago means that everyone only uses violence against women against preferring the general neutral.  There&#x27;s plenty of laws against &quot;domestic violence&quot; specifically, that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s referred to in law, and domestic violence is used _much_ more frequently - 22x as many, in fact.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s not to speak of the whole LGBTQ community, whom the author thinks it&#x27;s okay to f- over by assuming a family is a husband and a wife.<p>All of your observations through this point were about how men are unfairly treated compared to women. This gives the reader <i>absolute</i> whiplash, because now you&#x27;re claiming it&#x27;s offensive to _talk about gender at all_ in relation to this.')
