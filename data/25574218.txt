Item(by='tenacious_tuna', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609272567, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574096, text='Fellow Model 3 driver here.<p>&gt; You might as well be comparing your experience driving a BMW or Cadillac ....<p>But OP isn&#x27;t--he&#x27;s comparing the current <i>live</i> Tesla features with paywall&#x27;d &#x2F; betawall&#x27;d features on the same car, from the same manufacturer. I cannot think of a more relevant comparison! I think it&#x27;s completely reasonable to doubt Tesla&#x27;s (and Elon&#x27;s) claims in this realm, when the existing, public examples of this technology fall far, far short of the kind of confidence we&#x27;d want to have in these systems.<p>&gt; Your experience on the old tech stack is irrelevant.<p>I 100% disagree. If Tesla can&#x27;t even get a basic function like cruise control to work well enough that drivers are confident in it, why would I trust that they can get <i></i>self drving<i></i> to work well? Especially following things like the Summon beta, or similar fiascos?<p>I still get twitchy when my M3 comes up on an off ramp it&#x27;s not supposed to take on autosteer--I&#x27;ve had the same behavior as OP (sudden unexpected speed decrease) happen far too many times for me to have confidence in that system. In turn, I have even <i>less</i> faith in the more complicated systems, like autosteer or FSD.')
