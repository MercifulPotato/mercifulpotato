You claimed &quot;no one is&quot;, the response was to show a counterexample and say that &quot;some people are&quot;, which is true and clearly falsifies your claim.<p>You then stripped the &quot;some&quot; out -- _while quoting the response_ (!!!) and asking for more examples.  Are you making a different claim now?  Because the response was certainly sufficient for your original one.')
