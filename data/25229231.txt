Item(by='toyg', descendants=None, kids=[25230999, 25229460], score=None, time=1606489590, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25228859, text='<i>&gt; that means less independent thinking, paradoxically.</i><p>This is indeed the paradox of our times. An accelerated technology shift (the global computer network) has generated large amounts of people who are rationally self-reliant to a fault, since they are either the only ones in their social circles who understand the new tech or the only ones who can spend a lot of time reading stuff from the internet. This cult of &quot;independent thinking&quot; leads them down dark alleys for which they simply don&#x27;t have the necessary preparation (conspiracies, flat earth, etc), but from which they cannot get out (because admitting your own reasoning is wrong is extremely difficult).<p>How do you get out of flat-earth on your own, without re-living centuries of astronomic research? How do you get out of moonlanding negationism, without personally examining all the retrieved moon rocks? How do you get out of antivaxxing, without personally living through pestilence? (well, at least Covid19 should help with that...)<p>I guess it&#x27;s a balance. Society simply would not hold if we all were radical independent thinkers, since we&#x27;d be constantly questioning everything that we cannot individually and immediately determine as true. A degree of conformism is actually necessary for progress of any sort.')
