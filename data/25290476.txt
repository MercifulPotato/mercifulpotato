As was mentioned in the anecdote, even as it exists AlphaFold can be an extremely powerful ally in structure elucidation in combination with lab methods. So this will help us increase the targetable list of proteins, especially the tricky ones that were harder to crystallize.<p>Once Alpha Fold or future programs get better with side chain modeling (not even for the entire protein just some parts), they will also allow complete computer based design of new antibodies against any target of choice (this is currently only possible through experiments and the technologies that allow this are all heavily patented and proprietary).<p>Variations of AlphaFold will also be significantly useful in research in general, potentially becoming fundamental enough that every project working with proteins might reach out to this tool like they reach out to to say mass spectrometry or flow cytometry.')
