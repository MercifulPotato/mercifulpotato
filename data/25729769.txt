I saw his shop in person when I purchased some solar from him and was quite impressed with the work they&#x27;ve done and the research and testing that has gone into their products.  I had already purchased my batteries by the time I discovered his product or I would have purchased from him: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outlandsolar.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outlandsolar.com&#x2F;</a><p>My partner and I live aboard a 41ft sailboat and both work remotely as programmers.  I installed 1920w of solar on the boat and get approximately 3.5-4.5kwh per day in output, depending on which way we are oriented while at anchor.  I installed 600ah of LiFePO4 batteries @ 12v and when combined with that amount of solar, we have pretty much all the power we need.  We frequently cook with an air fryer and have a dishwasher on the boat that we run daily-- all off solar.')
