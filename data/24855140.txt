Item(by='brundolf', descendants=None, kids=[24855533], score=None, time=1603344227, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24853115, text='I&#x27;ve always had a sharp sense for <i>relative</i> tones - whether two notes are the same, or I can even tell specifically what interval they are, usually - but despite having played organized music for eight years of my life I&#x27;m hopeless at telling you what <i>note</i> a tone or chord actually is (or what key something is in). Zero indication whatsoever.<p>I do have a friend who can do that, though. You press the Bb key on a piano and he&#x27;ll tell you it&#x27;s a Bb and that it&#x27;s slightly out of tune on the sharp end. It&#x27;s amazing.')
