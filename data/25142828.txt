I hate the new website, sorry. The old one was clean, focused and clearly portrayed what TW does. The new one is IMHO big, loud, and a lot less focused.<p>3. I have had endless issues compiling with npm[1], and am using yarn just because of tailwind. Anyone else with this issue?<p>4. 30 minutes to upgrade is a lot when you manage thirty sites. Though if it is not worth it, no one is forcing me to upgrade.<p>5. There are some really awesome tools out there that complement tailwind, like tail-animista.vercel.app and tailwind.ink, and some collections like bestoftailwind.com.<p>6. tailwindui is really nice, and gives the best of both worlds compared to something like uikit.<p>Partly I feel that the creation of tailwindui took the wind out of the sails of sites like tailwindcomponents.com (of which there are quite a few) which is a shame, since a community can do more than even a dedicated team.<p>But partly I wish they would filter, organize and promote all the neat tools that there are on tailwindui.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tailwindlabs&#x2F;tailwindcss&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;1891" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tailwindlabs&#x2F;tailwindcss&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;1891</a>')
