I was surprised that the cheapest cases, which were little more than steel boxes with cutouts for ports and fans, were more than twice the price of cases with side windows and half a dozen RGB fans.<p>I also followed posts for component sales and saw a lot of people complaining when a sale didn&#x27;t apply to RGB RAM or some such.<p>I ended up buying a case with a side window and incredibly bright fans. I couldn&#x27;t disable just the fan lights without an additional motherboard adapter, so I  cut the LED leads on the fans and called it a day.<p>All this to say, am I alone in wanting my computer to be a plain box? All those extra lights are just distracting to me.<p>Edit: after a cursory glance at the comments, it&#x27;s obvious I am <i>not</i> alone. Maybe I&#x27;m just curious why there&#x27;s such a large market for light-up components.')
