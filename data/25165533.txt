Esp. public sector unions? They may not have their fingers in the pot, but they still likely a massive barrier.<p>What about exposing the fact that a ton of workers in infrastructure are in the country illegally? Who&#x27;s going to &#x27;clamp down&#x27; on that and pay the political price?<p>What about the fact that all these firms are massive political donors to the powers that be? How do we solve that one?<p>And fighting entities: SF is a tiny city. So is Palo Alto. So is Oakland. The &#x27;Bay Area&#x27; needs coordination and nobody really wants to give up their little fiefdoms of power. So there are a lot of problems like that.<p>The issues are complex and a lot of it has to do with vested interests and power, not &#x27;technology&#x27; or anything like that.')
