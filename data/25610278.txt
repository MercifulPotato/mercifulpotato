I think we just need more awareness, first?<p>As someone who has gone through the legal system in the US and was illegally detained for activism and then later accused of false charges (with no evidence) and illegally arrested: I don&#x27;t think awareness alone will do anything. Everyone knows the Police are corrupt and the city will do little to nothing if they are caught committing these abuses--the officer who stood on George&#x27;s neck had several prior complaints for violence in his department and was still allowed to work as an officer.<p>The BLM movement to me is and will always remain a Police abuse issue first and foremost: one that was highlighted because of the death of George Floyd, but was yet another reminder that Police are in a position in which their crimes are exempt from actual punishment due to qualified immunity, and they know that and behave as such.<p>In CO after the protests from Floyd&#x27;s death the Police had their quality immunity removed [0] for abuses they would commit against protesters and were recorded for everyone to see as it became very clear they had no intention of hiding how egregious things got but this only addressed the issues that happened from 2020 onward. There are cases of physical violence and as you said what is likely torture of people who were detained&#x2F;restrained in which the State refused to prosecute the officers for despite having the evidence and had to be taken to the Supreme Court before it was heard [1]. This case was only settled out of court with the COUNTY paying $400,000 (which is really to say people like me in Boulder) and the police involved were not even punished. The female officer in the video seen abusing the women was the same person who handled my transfer to my hearing from my cell and refused to allow me to make a phone call at a time when they refused to tell me my charges when I was brought in.<p>Honestly, defunding the police and slashing their pay based on actual performance based reviews are the real starting point, and using social workers instead of Police for mental health cases has been experimented with favorable results in CO. Scaling that would be the next meaningful step to eventually have a bare-bones, non-militarized police force as that at least has the right incentives in place. But that may be a pipe dream in the US at this point.<p>One need to only look at France to see what and how Civil Society is actually maintained and it starts with keeping Police in a very confined and constrained leash and reminding them of their limited role, which sometimes means rioting and revolting against police abuse to remove poor legislation from passing.<p>&gt; Unfortunately most of the people suffering in the prison system are poor, so we don&#x27;t hear what they have to say. If you&#x27;re rich, you can afford your own lawyer and get a much better plea deal, and get out quickly. It&#x27;s also very racist:<p>Incredibly so, the DA of my last case never even bothered to look at the incriminating footage of the officer abusing his authority and clearly violating private property laws and abusing my civil liabilities for unsubstantiated allegations. And I HAD a Lawyer, upon release because I couldn&#x27;t speak to one while I was arrested, and had it known I was willing to be compliant with the questioning process before being illegally arrested provided my attorney was present before I spoke to anyone, as its my (supposed) Right to do so.<p>My case was eventually dismissed after 2 missed court dates by the DA who finally looked at the body cam footage and I had my career placed in jeopardy, an injury I still deal with to this day as well as well as the trauma from the abuse and the embarrassment of the arrest as it happen at work for all to see because an officer thought they are John Wayne and knew they never face punishment for their crimes... in addition to a significant legal bill for the privilege of it all.<p>My only recourse was to lawyer up again and pay 10s of thousands of dollars to a Civil Rights attorney after paying for my defense attorney and take the case as high as the Supreme Court like the other women did before a settlement would even be considered, at which point most of the legal&#x2F;court fees had already eaten through most of the settlement money. There are no heroes in this system, and Lawyers are just as much responsible for perpetuating this corrupt system as the corrupt judges and officers.<p>And this is all told from an innocent person&#x27;s perspective, actual convicted criminals get hung to dry and are seldom if ever allowed to return to Society without being constantly denied the ability to live a normal life in Society anymore, while the criminals with badges commit comparable crimes with impunity.<p>Honestly, BLM protests need to return and be far more targeted, as in localized to city counsels and mayors&#x2F;governors offices&#x2F;homes instead of looting department stores before anything serious is done. COVID may be dangerous, but Police are likely the greater danger to overall safety in Society if you know how the system really works--and while its an unpopular opinion for some, this applies to white people, too. We all saw how even members of International media were treated, and felt only the superficial outrage that people who have been victimized by the legal system have.<p>I have several horror stories of white middle class women in Boulder being abused by the Legal system, too, and further drives the point that this is not a solely a Black issue. I saw the systematic destruction of these People&#x27;s lives during my arrest and the first hearing: armed police showed up to one woman&#x27;s home for a reported car accident against a bicyclist days after it took place, and another of an owner of a home being arrested and forced out of her own home in cuffs when a guest made allegations of her threatening to use force to remove the guest who overstayed and refused to leave all while her underage children were still in the home with that person.<p>It&#x27;s completely abysmal and terrifying to be honest.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themarshallproject.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;colorado-tries-new-way-to-punish-rogue-cops" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themarshallproject.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;colorado-tries...</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.9news.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;boulder-county-settles-excessive-force-lawsuit&#x2F;73-5b3b9295-43de-4a7e-b4ba-26f48fff2211" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.9news.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;boulder-county-sett...</a>')
