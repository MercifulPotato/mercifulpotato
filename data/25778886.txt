This is actually what is required to argue with what I wrote.<p>The topic is &quot;what were these people thinking in taking these actions?&quot;  My reply was &quot;there were similar actions in the past which resulted in trivial punishments.&quot;  Would amending my reply to &quot;there were similar actions in the past which resulted in trivial punishments and no one took seriously anyway&quot; somehow have made the group that entered the Capitol less likely to have done so?  If so, please explain.')
