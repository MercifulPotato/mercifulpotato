Item(by='takeda', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606889601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25264665, text='I don&#x27;t think what you said necessarily contradicts what I said.<p>NixOS is easy to use as long as as what you&#x27;re trying to do is contained within the configuration, then set up is pretty much just editing that configuration file (which essentially is just series of dictionaries and lists). I wouldn&#x27;t for example have with installing NixOS for my grandparents.<p>Here&#x27;s example config when that&#x27;s true: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;areina&#x2F;nixos-config&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;thinkpad-x250.nix" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;areina&#x2F;nixos-config&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;thinkpad-...</a><p>If you want to do something that&#x27;s not covered then you&#x27;ll have to learn Nix, and that part is indeed hard, because it&#x27;s like configuring linux through use of saltstack&#x2F;chef&#x2F;puppet&#x2F;ansible through a functional language (which many people don&#x27;t have experience with), but as you said it pays off.<p>I think the hardest part is the paradigm shift where everything you do is no longer imperative but declarative. It also doesn&#x27;t help that documentation is always behind what nixpkgs can do and Nix functionality would cover multiple books.')
