I&#x27;m with really young kids, one an infant.  So sleep is a luxury.  ... and kids are a time sink.  I&#x27;m also a senior engineering manager, I don&#x27;t have to code again in my life if I don&#x27;t want since I committed to and enjoy the management track.   But with that said, here&#x27;s a few tech I have learned as in really dove into in the last few years by myself that I didn&#x27;t need to learn for work, golang, angular, typescript, kubernetes, some ML, scikit-learn, J(APL), couchbase, hybrid mobile development with ionic framework, these are just a few that I can think off my head.  I started &amp; run the k8s meetup in my city.  In the last 5 years, I have probably build 20+ side software projects for the fun of it and currently have 3 brewing in my head right now.   Besides wasting time on social media (twitter, facebook, reddit) and watching netflix&#x2F;prime&#x2F;hulu like normal folks, I also have the occasionally hobby of minor home repairs (My house is over 100+yrs old), fixing up my &quot;classic car&quot; 85 bmw, and teaching myself the piano.  My typical work week is about 50-60hrs.  Since March I have been the one to take care of the kids while WFH since my wife is an essential health care worker.    So what&#x27;s the point of telling you all this?  I&#x27;m not single, not young, now north of 40+. I&#x27;m just a doer.<p>Here&#x27;s what I googled and read up on this weekend, how to repair rotted roof rafter tails because the garage needs work.  I was looking at the repair manual of the broken elliptical to see if I can repair too.  As for coding, I was building a daycare app before the pandemic put a lid to that and I shelved that for now.   Since the pandemic, I have just written toy throw away sim codes to run simulation of whatever that came to my head, predicting the pandemic numbers, housing market, etc.<p>Point is, I can somehow find out a little time here and there to play on the computer, most people can.')
