Didn&#x27;t spin at all. The MacBook never complained (except when running the Apple hardware diagnostics). It didn&#x27;t overheat or shut down unexpectedly. It just got a bit slower due to more thermal throttling.<p>I expect it would work the other way, too. Improve the cooling and performance under load would improve.')
