Should&#x27;ve been &quot;the styles defined via Tailwind classes already only apply to the element they are added to.&quot;<p>(Ninja edit:) So to clarify: if I want to add some padding to an element with plain CSS, I have to think of a class name for that element, and then define styles for that class. However, if I happen to use that class name elsewhere in my code, then the styles I&#x27;ve defined there suddenly apply to that element as well. And vice versa: before I can delete a class from my code base, I have to be aware of every element that uses it.<p>CSS-in-JS solves that: all styles defined for a single component will only ever apply to that component.<p>The same holds true for Tailwind: you define the styles through the classes you apply, which will not affect other components in your codebase, and likewise, removing them (the Tailwind classes) is safe as well.')
