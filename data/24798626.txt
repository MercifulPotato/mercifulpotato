Item(by='bleepblorp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602834912, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24793898, text='I wonder if there&#x27;s a &#x27;shit rolls downhill&#x27; dynamic to the popularity of mockery content on Reddit.<p>Reddit&#x27;s demographics skew very young, which means it&#x27;s mostly used by people who have very little socioeconomic standing. People at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder are subject to significant arbitrary humiliation at the hands of others (all entry-level jobs suck; so does being a student) and have no tools with which to fight back. People who are in this situation are likely to find catharsis in finding ways to see themselves--no matter how bad their personal situation is--as at least one step above someone else (hence the popularity of subs like &#x2F;r&#x2F;insanepeoplefacebook) and seeing abusive people being given their just rewards in ways the average Reddit reader cannot get away with (hence, the popularity of subs like &#x2F;r&#x2F;instantkarma).<p>I also wonder if there&#x27;s a correlation between preferences for mockery content and the rigidity of social hierarchies in different countries. Japan, for instance, has a very rigid social hierarchy (meaning most people are subject to arbitrary abuse) and they had an entire genre of mainstream humiliation TV[0]. I&#x27;d be surprised if this kind of content is as popular in countries with flatter social hierarchies where sociopathic behavior directed at subordinates is less acceptable.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.ca&#x2F;entry&#x2F;japanese-game-shows_n_4569474?ri18n=true" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.ca&#x2F;entry&#x2F;japanese-game-shows_n_45...</a><p>(As an aside, I haven&#x27;t looked at Reddit&#x27;s default subs for many years and it&#x27;s <i>shocking</i> that they&#x27;ve crawled that far down into the clickbait gutter.)')
