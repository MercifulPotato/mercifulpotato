I think that&#x27;s bunk. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re welcome to try to prove it. But don&#x27;t prove it to me. Prove it to the many academics who study this topic. If you convince them, I&#x27;ll definitely read your book.<p>Is that related to a broad human tendency to xenophobia? Sure. But that xenophobia is channeled through and reinforced by cultural elements. Many societies demonstrate racism, but none of them demonstrate it exactly equally to everybody else. Like it or not, there&#x27;s a history and a structure here, and I think it&#x27;s worth studying.<p>I understand that a lot of people have the hobby of pretending racism is a much smaller problem, or perhaps no problem at all. But since those people have been consistently wrong in the US for the last couple hundred years, I don&#x27;t aim to devote a lot of energy to taking them seriously.')
