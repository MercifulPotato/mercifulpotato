Item(by='orf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603748570, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900220, text='&gt; but a woke white person might sic a Twitter mob on me for the sin of cultural appropriation.<p>Who cares. Wasn’t the point of the article you’re commenting on that a tiny minority is responsible for outsized impact in discussions like this?<p>So who cares what a “Twitter mob” says about you practicing yoga? Does this really have any bearing on current social justice issues like <i>real</i> cultural appropriation, anymore than a right-wing figure posting a video of someone yelling about the patriarchy has any bearing on feminism?<p>It’s a distraction that boils down the issues to figures you can hate: Cultural appropriation is stupid because someone got angry on Twitter because of yoga. Feminism is stupid because Ben shapiro filmed himself winning a debate against a feminist.')
