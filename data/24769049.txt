That&#x27;s because iron makes up 6% of the earth&#x27;s crust.<p>A kilogram of nickel costs ~13$. And nickel makes up a mere 0.0009% of the earth&#x27;s crust.<p>It&#x27;s completely pointless to mine them, with the hope of returning them to Earth. It&#x27;s also completely pointless to mine them, with the hope of using them in space, for many, many reasons.<p>1. A spacecraft factory employs thousands of people, and requires hundreds of millions of cubic feet of space.<p>2. The supply chains that feed a spacecraft factory employ hundreds of thousands of people, and require billions of cubic feet of space.<p>3. They also require a long tail end of chemical inputs that are not iron and nickel.<p>The difference between &#x27;We have a space factory that is fed by an asteroid miner and builds more spacecraft&#x2F;space factories&#x27; and &#x27;We have a proof of concept where we spent a billion dollars to mine and refine 20 grams of iron, which we fed to a 3d-metal printer (Never mind all the other consumable inputs into it), to print a little figurine of a rocket&#x27; is rather large... And only the latter is achievable in my lifetime.')
