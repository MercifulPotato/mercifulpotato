Were going to have a lot of leverage over poor countries that depend on the US directly or indirectly for humanitarian aid, trade or military protection.<p>Just take a look at what has happened to Cuba since we tried to change them. Still Communist, but now they also have tons of humanitarian issues because they lack access to a close first world trading partner. The regimes also don&#x27;t seem any less brutal.<p>I also hate that the USG leaning on a country usually makes the citizens miserable, not the government. Just as an example, dictator in Blahland says Facebook has to ban these 15 journalists. Facebook refuses, dictator blocks Facebook. USG steps in and demands that they unblock Facebook, or we withold humanitarian aid. The dictator says fine, it&#x27;s not like he&#x2F;she is going to starve. We withold aid, causing famine and instability in the region.  At the end of that, are we really the good guys? The journalists still have no access, Facebook is still blocked, and now there&#x27;s an escalating humanitarian crisis.<p>I&#x27;m not well versed in politics though, perhaps there are more surgical means to apply pressure.')
