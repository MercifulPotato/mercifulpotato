Item(by='FoundersCoffee', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1607961369, title='How to meet entrepreneurs during the pandemic?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hey everyone,<p>This January, I’m launching a membership service and community for founders of tech-driven businesses that brokers connections between entrepreneurs based on the expertise they need most. Your first match is free, so read on to learn more!<p>In my experience, common networking solutions fail to meet founders’ need for connection and high quality, relevant insight. Social media can help, but contributors are often unknown or unqualified. You can rely on your existing network, but current ties rarely have all the answers. Virtual masterminds or meetups can add value, but you only get minutes of feedback about big decisions that require more time, depth, and consideration.<p>By putting founder networking on auto-pilot, and curating connections based on your needs - you can get the benefits of networking without all of the work involved. This in-depth consultation format is designed to help founders identify blindspots in their thought process, collaboratively solve problems, discover new technologies&#x2F;vendors&#x2F;solutions, and to build confidence around hard decisions.<p>How it works is pretty simple. Every member must both give and take an hour each month. I will pair you with a mentee who you are uniquely positioned to help, along with a mentor with expertise in areas you need to learn. I do all the matching, so you just need to show up for virtual calls where you can ask your most pressing questions, and support founders like you.<p>The first month is free, and it’s $30 per month afterwards. I would love any feedback you have to share, and if you’re interested in joining - please fill out this application and I will be in touch: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.surveymonkey.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;KWFP3JX<p>I look forward to hearing any feedback you can share, and to connect you with someone who can hopefully become a long-term partner, mentor, or friend.')
