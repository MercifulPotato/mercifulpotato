The infrastructure is simply not there. Also I don&#x27;t think there are aviation rated fuel cells available yet. And storing lots of hydrogen under high pressure is also a bit of a weight issue for planes given it requires extreme pressures and heavy duty tanks. Also, there&#x27;s the cost of fuel. Hydrogen is not cheap. Electricity is.<p>And that&#x27;s before you consider the infrastructure. A battery can be plugged in anywhere you can get electricity. Which is pretty much everywhere. Hydrogen requires (currently) non existent supply chains, transport, storage, pumping, etc. infrastructure.<p>There are some decent batteries on the market and better ones are on the way. Also, there&#x27;s a difference between shoving a tonne of battery into an existing plane and using e.g. structural batteries to strengthen the fuselage of a purposely designed plane. So, yes, you should expect some improvements in range with the coming few years as technology, designs, and thinking evolves. I think 2-3X range improvement is basically a given in the next 15 years or so. Current electric planes actually flying use technology that was certified years ago (it&#x27;s a slow process) that are hardly state of the art at this point.')
