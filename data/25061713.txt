Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=[25063074], score=None, time=1605121821, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25061458, text='Depending on the age of your house, and how future proof they were; most houses have a phone jack in most of the rooms. If they were run since the mid-90s, it&#x27;s probably 4-pair cat3 or cat5, and if you&#x27;re lucky it&#x27;s run to a central point that&#x27;s accessible. Reterminate with rj45 instead of rj11 and boom. If it&#x27;s 4-pair daisy chained, you&#x27;ll need to put in two ports at each faceplate and jumpers in rooms you don&#x27;t use and switches in rooms you do use.<p>Cat3 doesn&#x27;t meet the spec for GigE, but in short runs without a lot of crosstalk from dense wiring, it&#x27;s likely to work and worth a try.<p>If you only have 2-pair wires in the wall, you can still likely run 100BaseTX, which is OK if not very exciting. At least you&#x27;d remove most of the jitter of wifi.<p>If you&#x27;re in a rental, I dunno how the landlord would feel about you messing with the jacks, but it&#x27;s undoable. If you were considering pulling new wire, you likely own.')
