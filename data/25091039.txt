I like to cook large portions and save leftovers in the freezer.  It takes only 4 mins to prepare a good meal from the freezer.  This is a lot less effort than getting dressed, going outside, increasing my covid exposure risk, paying money, and getting unhealthy food.<p>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different freezer containers.  Nowadays, I use Rubbermaid Take-Along Food Storage Containers in 0.5 cup and 1.2 cup &quot;twist &amp; seal&quot; styles.  They&#x27;re cheap and super durable.  I clean them in a dishwasher.  They are brittle when frozen so heat them a bit before opening.<p>A happy discovery: Make brown rice taste amazing by cooking it with some sticky rice.  I cook 300g brown rice, 100g sticky rice, and 600mL water in an Instant Pot pressure cooker.  This makes about 10 0.5-cup servings.  The rice tastes great with Japanese curry, stir-fried veggies &amp; tofu, veggies with chorizo and sausage, etc.<p>Another happy discovery: Cut meal prep time in half by cooking veggies separately in the microwave.  You can ensure each one is cooked just enough.  And you&#x27;ll make less indoor air pollution.  Use a large glass bowl with a wide lip to avoid burning your fingers.  Use frozen ingredients to eliminate even the washing &amp; cutting work.  If you&#x27;re making food to freeze, undercook the veggies since they will get cooked again during reheating.<p>I want to buy a squat round 1.2-cup food container, with a hole in the middle, and not brittle when frozen.  The non-brittle material lets me eliminate the initial heating before opening the container.  The hole in the frozen food block allows even heating in the microwave, letting me eliminate the step of separating the food.  Does this product exist?')
