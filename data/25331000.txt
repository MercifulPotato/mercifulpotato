Please read at least some of it before posting harsh comments.<p>I think it would have been much better launched in EU. I can totally see this is as a platform for energy efficiency accountability and energy efficiency investment tracking for tax break purposes.<p>My problem with it is that (1) the whitepaper is too thin on  tech details and (2) it seems to have a fixed energy project model connected to those EFFORCE tokens preventing it from being used on a national level where a country has its own legally mandated reward scheme different from EFFORCE vision.')
