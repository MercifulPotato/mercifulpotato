This is very easy to see visually.<p>A matrix times matrix multiplication (eg 3x3 times 3x3) is just projecting the axis of one matrix onto the other: expressing the coordinate system in terms of a different coordinate system.<p>The 4x3 (or 4x4) matrix is needed for translation and 3d projection for a 3d triangle onto a 2d plane (screen pixels).<p>For translation: it&#x27;s just a hack since if you write it out it&#x27;s a nice and a fast hack to simulate &quot;movement&quot;.<p>Then for projection you just hack the numbers in the matrix in such a way that you shrink things further apart from the origin.<p>TLDR: for 3d graphics matrices are used because you can hack them to represent any kind of a transformation.\nThe reason they are used is because graphics cards are fast at performing dot products. Plus matrix multiplication doesn&#x27;t require trigonometry or division so it doesn&#x27;t require the slower transcendental GPU instructions (sin, cos,...).<p>For other uses their interpretations is different.<p>I always hated the dull mathematic definition of &quot;a matrix represents a linear map&quot; because what the matrix actually represents is completely context dependent.')
