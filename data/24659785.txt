Is this simply a function of the available capital or do you take future capital requirements of the companies you want to invest in into account?<p>Let&#x27;s say you only pick the top 0.25%, do you do any statistical analysis afterwards to see if this percentage gave the best ROI? Because I would assume that the top 1% at least gets funded by other VCs so it should be possible to do this? Although at the same time I wonder if outsized returns can really be made if there is a VC consensus of the top 1%, my understanding is that the best returns are made in firms that people disagree on.')
