The novels clearly set up a universe where the logic of the Dark Forest implies that the universe itself is doomed to destruction, and this doom will come irrespective of the conflict between Earth and the Trisolarians.  She is the one character who always rejects the logic of the Dark Forest, and is willing to hope for the best from aliens.  This doesn&#x27;t particularly work out, but neither does the alternative.')
