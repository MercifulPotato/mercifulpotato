The fact the iPhone had the battery life it did was amazing.<p>2) the software on the iphone destroyed anything RIM had ever put forward.<p>3) the iPhone was a much better piece of hardware aesthetically and performance-wise than anything RIM had ever put out. Their closest competitor was the Pearl and it was garbage compared to the iPhone.<p>4) Lastly, RIM had 10 year development cycles. Pivoting to attack the iPhone meant ripping apart 10 years of planned development much of which was already executed. Pivoting that hard is just not something companies at the scale or RIM are designed to do.<p>RIM should&#x27;ve seen the writing on the wall, shred their hardware business, and gone all in on supporting BES on iPhone. I digress...')
