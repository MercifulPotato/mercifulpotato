Yes, they have amazing IPC, but they have 4 cores and a low TDP. I didn&#x27;t dispute that. It&#x27;s really incredible. But I&#x27;ll repeat that it&#x27;s not a foregone conclusion that they can translate that into higher core, higher performance and outright win&#x2F;embarrass AMD. Maybe they will - we are just putting forth conjecture. Extracting all that performance with low power usage is certainly winning half the battle, and making bigger chips with more cores will get Apple a long way. Remains to be seen but it&#x27;s far too soon to say &quot;the rest catch up...&quot; when it comes to those markets.<p>And I mentioned gamers and dedicated graphics - you countered with a comparison with the 2018 Mini at 768p resolution and a Radeon Pro 560? Meanwhile gamers are playing 2k and 4k games with RTX 3000 series and RX 6000 series cards (if they can get their hands on them.) And many games simply cannot be played on macOS.<p>Neither the M1 nor the above crazy expensive power-hungry graphics cards are a one-size-fits-all solution. And it may come to pass that Apple starts to compete in those areas and really does embarrass all competitors. But it hasn&#x27;t happened yet, so I think such proclamations are premature.')
