Even if you approach 90% usage, that would probably be very optimistic. AWS has probably millions of physical servers by now (they had ca. 1,4 million servers by December 2014 it seems) each with probably hundreds of services each needing an IP. Yes, you can stretch 10.0.0.0&#x2F;8 with NATs all over the place but at some point, you need the public IP. With that kind of appetite you need multiple &#x2F;8s of IPv4 space just to keep things running. I don&#x27;t think they are crazy buying that much address space and concurrently improving IPv6 support - they most likely really need it.')
