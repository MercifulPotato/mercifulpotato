The Western empire split and East empire kept going. Things that seemed collapse-related happened; the Vandals lived by looting civilization for quite a while, population and cities shrank, and Vikings also plundered for hundreds of years. But agricultural society and a number of social&#x2F;technological innovations continued and in ways made progress. And Eastern Roman&#x2F;Byzantium continued until conquered by a more advanced society. Mentioning this &#x27;cause the classical collapses of the Maya, precolumbian-society or bronze age societies apparently didn&#x27;t do this. People left, died, went back to hunting and gathering. Those could be called &quot;true&quot; collapses.<p>Which is to say that even Roman may have been at the point that a classical Tainter collapse couldn&#x27;t quite happen. And today, while our create multiple disasters, we seem be well past a point where you could talk about a rise and fall of civilization. What we&#x27;re looking at is the direction of the explosive expansion of market&#x2F;technological&#x2F;social progress. Even a disaster wiping out, say 90% of the human population on earth would see a rebound in a terrifying short period of time, historically speaking.<p>But anyway, I agree with the rest of what the parent says.')
