There are material tradeoffs being made that are not even acknowledged as a consequence. Several failure modes have simply been placed outside the system by definition to make the problem seem easier.<p>I am sympathetic to the idea of UBI but there is no trivial engineering argument for it. It is a system with many poor characteristics from an engineering perspective that would need to be addressed in any design that makes a claim of robustness.')
