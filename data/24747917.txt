These are separated from the value&#x27;s identifier by a colon. An example of a format specifier is `b`, which prints the value in binary: `format!(&quot;{foo:b}&quot;, foo=42)`<p>As before, you can leave out the name to refer to the value positionally: `format!(&quot;{:b}&quot;, 42)`<p>Other format specifiers are `?`, which tells the formatter to print the &quot;debug&quot; output (i.e. autogenerated output useful for debugging by programmers), `#` which tells the formatter to insert line breaks and indentation for easier reading, and `x` which tells the formatter to print numbers as hex.')
