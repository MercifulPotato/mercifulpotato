I spent some time on it in the blog post, and a lot more time that I didn&#x27;t write about hacking on little bits of gVisor while researching that post. My take is, no, I don&#x27;t think gVisor is as secure as Firecracker; it&#x27;s <i>way</i> more ambitious and has a larger attack surface. But I buy that it is substantially better than OS-sandboxed container runtimes, and I would probably trust it for multitenant workloads.<p>(Kata, as I understand it, is mostly about microvm containers; I like Firecracker almost as much for its implementation, which I think is pretty gorgeous, as for the microvm design choice, but I like &#x27;em both fine I guess. Also, there&#x27;s a Firecracker-based Kata that people use, right?)')
