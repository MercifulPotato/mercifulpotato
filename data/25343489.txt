Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607420528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25339820, text='&quot;that there would be any hostility facing the officers&quot;<p>From [1]: &quot;Plessinger said Jones refused to answer the door for 20 minutes and hung up on agents. Jones eventually let the agents into the home, she said.<p>Her family was upstairs when agents entered, Plessinger said.<p>The 31-second video Jones posted on Twitter shows agents entering her home with their guns drawn. Jones tells the officers that her husband and two children are upstairs as they direct her outside of the house.<p>One of the agents points his gun toward the stairwell. An officer shouts, “Police, come down now.”<p>As the video ends, Jones yells, “He just pointed a gun at my children.” The video does not show any children, or agents pointing guns at any children. FDLE said agents didn’t point guns at anyone.&quot;<p>...<p>There&#x27;s a couple things missing from your comment:<p>1) The person refused to answer the door for 20 minutes, which is definitely a form of resistance and an indicator of possible problems, at which frankly, SOP probably kicks in and &#x27;guns are drawn&#x27; at the point of entry.<p>2) The cops deny pointing guns at anyone, including children.<p>So frankly, that seems very reasonable.<p>While all of the journalists seem to want to recount only one side of the story, and only even part of it - is frankly deeply troubling, and it&#x27;s misinformation of a serious kind. Right now we are getting really spooked about &#x27;someone&#x27; misinforming American about election results, and attacking the integrity of the press, so I&#x27;m perennially amazed that journos want to avoid the important details that provide context.<p>Finally, remember there&#x27;s SOP (standard operating procedure). There are a lot of guns in America, and people are pretty violent in general in terms of trying to get away, or to assail cops in the process. Most warrants served are probably not for &#x27;hacking&#x27; rather more violent actions, and there may very well be established SOP about when to draw and not.<p>If the incident basically amounted to:\n1) No answer at door\n2) Cops enter with guns draw, point only upstairs urging people to come down.<p>Then it&#x27;s completely reasonable.<p>Obviously, nobody should be pointing guns at regular people for white collar crimes, but as usual, all this might have been avoided if the individual  answered the door and &#x27;used her words&#x27;.<p>Also, the &#x27;big story&#x27; here is the possibility of someone being harassed for whistle-blowing, which is disconcerting, but that&#x27;s not so much relevant when worrying about the specific facts of an altercation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sun-sentinel.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;fl-ne-whistleblower-search-warrant-20201207-rapzkgm7fnbujlhwzadunciigu-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sun-sentinel.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;fl-ne-whistleblower...</a>')
