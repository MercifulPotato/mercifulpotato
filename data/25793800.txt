Item(by='alexellisuk', descendants=None, kids=[25793911], score=None, time=1610733384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25793536, text='Hi Mark, this book is based upon faasd - probably the easiest and cheapest way to self-host functions whilst still being able to get the usual things like metrics, queueing (async) and most of the features of OpenFaaS.<p>I wrote this guide because the audience for faasd isn&#x27;t the same person that builds their own Kubernetes clusters at work, and runs them with a team of 10 SREs. It&#x27;s for folks who want to stand up a few endpoints quickly and integrate and automate their workflows.<p>Scrape webpages, generate social banners, filter Tweets using code instead of the crappy rules on IFTTT. Build an Alexa skill or home assistant in their home network on a Raspberry Pi. Scraping with faasd is much faster than Lambda - I wrote a blog post on that, and also much easier to deploy. It&#x27;s worth trying both to compare.<p>I&#x27;ve used Gumroad in the past to sell OpenFaaS merchandise, and I have to say print-on-demand integrates much better with Shopify. Gumroad does excel at collecting the right amount of taxes on eBooks - which Shopify cannot do, so this is one of the reasons for picking them.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot of Indie Hacker types who have had success self-publishing on Gumroad, so I thought I&#x27;d put my first ebook up there.<p>With this first edition there&#x27;s 44-pages of labs, advice and experience that you cannot get in the openfaas&#x2F;faasd docs, and I want to see if I can generate value for users that way. It&#x27;s a bit of a test for market fit.<p>Alex')
