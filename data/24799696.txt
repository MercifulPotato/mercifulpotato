Item(by='marttt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602847698, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24799155, text='True, I haven&#x27;t filled a report yet; will look into this next time, probably when ROS 0.4.14 is released.<p>Pro Tools, at least in its early versions, tends to show its moods even on a well-tuned Windows system. So I was almost sure that it won&#x27;t run in ROS out of the box. I was actually surprised to see it installing so smoothly. My guess is that the driver for the audio interface (Mbox 2) needs some attention.')
