Even though I wasn&#x27;t actively in the field and offered to prove through a number of pieces of documentation, they considered it to be &quot;attacking competitors&quot;.<p>Per this, that means they only allow non-professional reviews on their platform. So if one professional sees flaws&#x2F;someone getting duped, they&#x27;re helpless to point it out.')
