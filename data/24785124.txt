You have to have faith that mock behavior is actually a reasonable emulation of the real system, without ever checking. The weakness is that your tests of the system under test don&#x27;t help you find flaws in how the system under test uses the lower level dependency, because you are simply forcing the lower level dependency to behave the way you wish it would.')
