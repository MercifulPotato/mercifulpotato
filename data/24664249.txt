What makes journalism different is that it comes with middlemen (publishers) taking almost all the profits. Other content creators are starting to find ways to reach their audience in a more direct way. E.g. novelist self publish via the Amazon Store. Vloggers self publish on Youtube. Agents&#x2F;publishers still get involved but only after proven success and at that point for fair compensation.<p>There are plenty of independent writers and journalists getting next to nothing because they have no way to monetize other than via these middlemen who pay them pennies per word. Google came along a long time ago and made them a lot less valuable than they used to be by basically becoming the primary distribution channel for stuff that was originally exclusive to their channel.<p>So, publishers have been slowly losing cash for years and basically most remaining newspapers are shadows of their former self in terms of editorial staffing, in house (i.e. employed) writers producing good content, etc. If you are not e.g. the New York times or one of a handful of other publishers, the value add is diminishing rapidly.<p>What journalists need is new channels. The smart thing for Google to do would be to compete directly and start paying content creators. That would of course piss everybody off which is why they don&#x27;t. But it does mean that there is a business model waiting to happen out there for somebody to step up. Google of course did this successfully on Youtube already and it has helped that platform grow without having to license a lot of external content like e.g. Netflix and Amazon Prime have to do.<p>Some kind of Netflix&#x2F;Spotify&#x2F;whatever for news is what is needed. I&#x27;d pay for it even. I pay for these things as well but I haven&#x27;t bought a news paper in more than a decade.')
