Item(by='jb775', descendants=None, kids=[25103267, 25102868], score=None, time=1605457393, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099992, text='&gt;<i>It&#x27;s still a good way to follow current events</i><p>This is where the major problem lies and you don&#x27;t even realize you&#x27;re complicit in it. The &quot;current events&quot; blasted out on Twitter are curated by Twitter admins to only show what they want to show. They place heavy over-weighting on events and discussion that they want everyone to see. They hide hashtags they don&#x27;t want trending. They don&#x27;t show a pure list of what&#x27;s actually trending. They shadow-ban users that talk about topics they don&#x27;t want talked about. They give priority to media outlets that are also involved in heavy censorship, therefore adding extra fake credibility to false narratives. And the latest is the whole &quot;Fact check&quot; thing, where they only fact check the discussion that they want discredited (even if it&#x27;s 100% true).<p>You are an example how censorship is so powerful. When people believe they&#x27;ve found a &quot;good way to follow current events&quot;, and refuse to question the accuracy of the medium, they quickly become prone to believing false narratives. Currently, the elites who own the media are doing everything in their power to further the left&#x27;s agenda. (The active campaign is their attempt to cover up and discredit any discussion of election fraud. Also, you probably didn&#x27;t hear that Zuckerberg donated half a billion dollars towards democrat vote-counting strategies) Many people want to bury their head in the sand because it aligns with their political beliefs. Hopefully this is a wake up call to some.')
