At the February &#x27;95 budget meeting (which determines budget for the next fiscal year (July 1)) they agreed that FY94 was the last year First Person would be funded so by 7&#x2F;1&#x2F;95 it was up to us to find new jobs either inside of Sun or elsewhere.<p>But to be fair you are looking at it from the future backwards. At the time Sun considered &quot;the web&quot; to be a feature not a product (many were bemoaning that because SGI was making it so central to their identity) and a &quot;browser plug-in&quot; (which in itself was kind of a weird concept, originally we thought all applets would be java:&#x2F;&#x2F;applet-host) was hardly something to interest a big enterprise player like Sun. We literally went overnight from other parts of the company saying &quot;I knew they were never going to make it.&quot; to &quot;really this project has been ours all along it only seems fair that we should continue to direct it.&quot;, Sun Labs, SunSoft, and Sun hardware all claimed to be the reason we were even existing.<p>It stands today, for me, as a classic &quot;accidental&quot; disruption.')
