And as it is pointed out elsewhere don&#x27;t try throwing your LaTex paper at it, that isn&#x27;t what it is.<p>What it is, is a package that one can write such a paper in, and then &quot;publish&quot; it to the web. Which, as a special purpose CMS, has uses. Papers are a reasonably large body of work.<p>What I keep hoping for is a &#x27;journal&#x27; that publishes papers in their mark up language that look good on the web, or when printed on paper, and retain meta data for good reference chasing. Further, the amount of typographic artifacts that should be thrown around with the paper would ideally be minimal and widely distributed&#x2F;standardized.<p>This is a hard problem, and one of the first inspirations for creating the world wide web. So any efforts that so progress are to be lauded and this is one such effort.')
