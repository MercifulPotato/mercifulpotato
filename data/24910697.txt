I used to always forget my keys when walking out the front door, which was a big problem since it locks automatically. to solve the problem, I made my back right pocket be the designated &quot;key pocket&quot;. I now slap my right butt cheek whenever I leave a building. it might look weird to observers, but I have not once forgotten my keys since I implemented this system.')
