If BLM or an Islamic American group had done the same thing yesterday. How many deaths would there have been? I&#x27;m guessing we&#x27;d be counting in percentages not fingers...something like 75% dead, 25% captured&#x2F;in prison.<p>For doing the SAME thing in the SAME location.<p>I know, it&#x27;s hard to prove, here say, but you know it&#x27;s true. Snipers would&#x27;ve been out in force. Cops were high fiving and letting these people in. National Guard was told to stand down. Police were taking selfies with confederates holding flags in the People&#x27;s building.<p>This was a desecration of democracy and the rule of law in America. Everyone responsible needs at least 20 years in prison. No exceptions. Trying to disrupt our republic should have some consequences, no?')
