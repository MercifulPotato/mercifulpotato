There are other cheap ways to get a web presence. Facebook is not even a web presence, as it is a walled garden.<p>Also, how would you even break it up? A separate &quot;events platform&quot; would be pretty useless without the Facebook social graph. What would be the point? Just plain disallow Facebook to have useful features, making things more difficult for people?')
