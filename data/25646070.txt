These bastards could care less about you&#x2F;us.<p>Now I feel fortunate I still have my service business, none of my 2 or 3 major competitors even use Adwords at all, I tried it for like 2 years, did not see any gain in customers, always paid with prepaid credit cards no more than $200 each, finally Google sent me a message they were no longer accepted prepaids - - I said &quot;See ya later Google&quot;. I still get the same amount of business without wasting money on Adwords.<p>Anyone has to be a fool to give any of these FANG sites a REAL credit card with wide open ability to charge you what they want and screw you. Plus all the stories I read lately about fraudulent clicks on ads and such - - the rest of the world can HAVE all that crap. I am still earning over $100K gross annually from my service business, now mostly word of mouth from my reputation - - old school style.')
