It&#x27;s been around for years, and this is this first major release since 2013.<p>The community is still quite active, and there&#x27;s been a particular hubbub of activity preparing for this new release. It&#x27;s a super fun game if you&#x27;re into arena FPS with lots of opportunities for tinkering, modding, and freeform content creation through its fairly unique online map editor.<p>I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions, and there&#x27;s also the community discord server: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;j3kyxtj" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;j3kyxtj</a>')
