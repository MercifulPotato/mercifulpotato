People take over parts of your company and do everything to make employees feel bad about the company.  They then do everything to make your employees feel good about something&#x2F;anything else to keep them distracted.<p>You start seeing really strange things like a severly overweight coworker suddenly having a trophy gf who starts talking poorly about everyone.  People suddenly start becoming lazy out of nowhere because someone outside of the company has made them believe they are guaranteed millionaires when they haven&#x27;t even IPO&#x27;d.  People who used to be focused on their jobs suddenly start slending money wildly on ridiculous garbage.<p>While everyone is distracted in different ways people who had nothing to do with the success of the company silently takeover key parts of the company and start firing people that figure out what is happening.')
