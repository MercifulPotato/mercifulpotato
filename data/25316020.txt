Maybe there&#x27;s a dynamic law we haven&#x27;t figured out that could make it work without initial fine tuning.<p>Fair enough I guess, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s a good answer to say &quot;I think a theory with property X is the answer, and you can&#x27;t criticize it because I have no actual theory with property X.&quot; I think it makes more sense to give little credence to superdeterminism until someone comes up with a plausible superdeterministic theory.')
