And relegating SQL to something that just an &quot;analyst&quot; does is an even bigger mistake.<p>Several times over my career I&#x27;ve been brought in on a project where the team was considering replacing their RDBMS entirely with a no-SQL data store (a huge undertaking!) because they were having &quot;performance problems&quot;.
