YOU.<p>Still not true. YOU have rest mass ant therefore the faster you go, the more of the energy used for momentum transfer will be converted to relativistic mass, thus preventing you from ever approaching the speed of light in any frame of reference.<p>Local time has nothing do with that. Sure, you once you exceed ~70.7% c time in your local frame of reference will tick so slow that you perceive less time than an observer on Earth would see light take to get to your destination.<p>But in any frame of reference that&#x27;s more or less &quot;at rest&quot; relative to you, time will tick faster so any message you send once you get to say Alpha Cen, will only be received about ~8.74 years after you left Earth.<p>An FTL vessel, however, would allow you to go to Alpha Cen, take a picture, send it to Earth, return and arrive back on Earth before the message containing the picture arrives. THAT&#x27;s the difference.<p>&gt; you can travel any distance in any subjective amount of time<p>Even that doesn&#x27;t seem to be true [1] as the CMB seems to  slow relativistic spacecraft down even in intergalactic space.<p>&gt; &quot;a couple Jupiters worth of hydrogen that you fuse at perfect e=mc^2 efficiency&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t fuse hydrogen to get that kind of efficiency. Only matter-antimatter reactions are capable of coming close to that. While antimatter is hard to come by, it&#x27;s the ultimate rocket fuel.<p>Ultimately, even a reactionless drive would be limited by the human physique - it takes about 3Â½ months to accelerate to 30% light speed at 1g constant acceleration. So unless inertia negation devices are invented, that sets the practical lower limit for any interstellar travel time.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1503.05845v1.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1503.05845v1.pdf</a>')
