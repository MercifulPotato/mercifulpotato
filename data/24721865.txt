How much money has been proven to be laundered through the traditional banking systems, with the support of the banks.  This argument against crypto currencies is equivalent to the pedo arguments about cryptography.  It&#x27;s simply BS.<p>The market cap of all crypto currencies combined is insignificant compared to the cap of fiat currencies used in illicit activities.  There is little to no threat from crypto that we don&#x27;t already have with fiat.  The &quot;threat&quot; is a red herring.')
