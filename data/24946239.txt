Rewarding honest voting means that people have perfect information and act rationally (meaning they understand how to maximize their voting power). The other way to frame things is how systems handle strategic voting. One of the reasons I&#x27;m a big fan of STAR is because it both prefers honest voting (you maximize your power her) AND it handles strategic voting well[0]. That is, the difference between VSE_best and VSE_worst is small. Where we see that the gap in Condorcet methods (like RP and Schulze) is quite large (&gt;10%). I think people get caught up in Condorcet methods because they look at RP&#x27;s VSE being the max. But STAR0-10 only has a 0.5% VSE difference on max but a 4% difference in worse case (not to mention that STAR is <i>substantially</i> simpler and scales better). You can&#x27;t compare voting systems just by looking at VSE. It is an important factor, but there are many other factors that matter (e.g. handle of strategy, transparency, handling spoilers, scalability, and more mathematical factors).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electionscience.github.io&#x2F;vse-sim&#x2F;vse.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electionscience.github.io&#x2F;vse-sim&#x2F;vse.html</a>')
