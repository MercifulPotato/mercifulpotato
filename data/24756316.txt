My SO doesn&#x27;t WFH, and hers is more comfortable so we use that when we go most places.  My car is 17 years old, but only has 100K on it. Runs great. Low maintenance, so I keep it knowing that if I need it it is there. But, I can afford that luxury partly because there&#x27;s no care payment and the insurance isn&#x27;t tremendous.')
