If these violations are true, then Twitter &amp; the Big Media is complicit in obfuscating evidence of collusion &amp; hidden business partnerships between the Vice President via his family &amp; the CCP.<p>If these allegations are not true, then the public conversation has been censored &amp; the story of censorship overshadows investigation which would absolve the innocent parties.<p>Either way, the public deserves to have direct access the truth.')
