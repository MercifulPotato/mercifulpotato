Say financial assistance worth $12,000 is available for people who make &lt;$20,000.<p>* If you make $20,000 then your effective income is $32,000.<p>* If you make $32,000 then your effective income is $32,000.<p>* If you make $25,000 then you&#x27;re effective income is $25,000.<p>This creates a terrible incentive structure where you actually don&#x27;t want to make more then $20,000 unless you&#x27;re sure you can make more than $32,000. Well actually more because there&#x27;s really no incentive to move up to $32,000 exactly.<p>You have to make sure that when a person makes more money they are always better off for having done so. Having a hard cutoff for benefits doesn&#x27;t work and neither does a back-off system that matches income (e.g. at $25,000 you get $7,000)')
