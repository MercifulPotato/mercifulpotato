Item(by='colechristensen', descendants=None, kids=[25383471], score=None, time=1607673212, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383242, text='That seems reasonable enough.  Look at your logs, find an IP that did the unauthorized thing, do a WHOIS, then call the ISP and ask who had that IP at the time.<p>Is it possible to fabricate all of this evidence? Sure, but finding the lady&#x27;s IP in order to have it confirmed by Comcast seems pretty sophisticated without a pretty advanced conspiracy.  One would assume a lot of that would come out at trial, if the defense could convince a jury of those doubts.<p>But this is a search warrant, that&#x27;s all some pretty convoluted fraud of the justice system to smear this woman.  Criminals are pretty stupid usually, intimidation would take a lazier form.  Keeping with the &quot;criminals are stupid&quot; line, a person with an axe to grind posting on a work network after being fired from their home? That seems about right.<p>Lots of downvotes are going on around here that make it evident that people only really care about their political alignment and their ideas of justice depend on whether or not a person is on their side.  I thought people were generally above that here.')
