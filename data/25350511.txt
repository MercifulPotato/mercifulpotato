Whether it&#x27;s avoiding justifying the things they claim they get from Apple (&quot;seamless device interop&quot;) or ignoring the way Apple actively treats their customers like hot garbage (see Louis Rossman&#x27;s youtube channel, or the asinine arguments companies like Apple lead against right to repair and all the poor board layout and non-interchangeable parts), instead of saying a reasonable answer like &quot;I&#x27;m willing to be ripped off because I like the shiny buttons&quot; or &quot;I have one specific app I use on MacOS that I haven&#x27;t had the time to replicate elsewhere&quot;, it&#x27;s always some kind of indignation.<p>If someone tells me my bargan-tier Samsung phone is slower than molasses, I&#x27;m not gonna say &quot;yeah but I like the blue color&quot;. I&#x27;m gonna agree.')
