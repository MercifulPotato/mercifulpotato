I have been writing SQL for 20 years.<p>I currently use dotNet Core and Entity Framework + Dapper.<p>It has these benefits:\n- Strong types!\n- My schema+migrations are part of the source code and I never have to worry about if my schema is in sync - with migrations it just is\n- Simple, straightforward tasks as super easy (insert, update, delete, simple select)\n- I can fall back to Dapper (straight SQL) when I need to do something that doesnt fit well with Entity Framework.<p>I recently worked on a project where EF was not allowed - and we spent so much time doing all the simple stuff, especially when the data model was still not completely locked down.')
