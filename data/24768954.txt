You&#x27;ve essentially just redefined &quot;money&quot; to include U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, and then stated that it&#x27;s just an asset swap and not money printing.<p>You can use whatever terminology you want, but at the end of the day, the Federal Reserve is creating money out of thin air and using it to buy real assets. You can argue that the effect of this is not as dramatic as printing money to buy a bunch of luxury condos or sports cars, but at that point we&#x27;re just debating the degree of influence. The whole point of Fed money printing is to influence the economy, so if it didn&#x27;t anticipate any difference, it wouldn&#x27;t be doing it.')
