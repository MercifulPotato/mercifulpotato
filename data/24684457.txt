Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[24684858], score=None, time=1601870671, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24683996, text='&quot;then pivot from hiring engineers to hiring lawyers.&quot;<p>MS keeps it&#x27;s monopoly via market power, generally not IP protections (though partly).<p>MS is large enough vis-a-vis fragmented hardware vendors and distribution networks that it can do play all sorts of hardball. It has deeply entrenched sales channels in to the corporate world. Most significantly, it&#x27;s a platform which means huge switching costs - and - it can use that platform as leverage into other spaces i.e. desktop software.<p>Take a moment to contemplate out how Coke and Pepsi (ostensibly commodities) can dominate their channels in a supposedly free market - it&#x27;s a little bit similar.<p>Google&#x27;s monopoly in search can be leveraged into all sorts of other areas.<p>IP laws are beneficial for &#x27;either side&#x27; and of course they are abused willy nilly, but by and large, they are beneficial to a lot of small companies.<p>Weirdly, even Open Source is helped by IP laws - by &#x27;turning them upside down&#x27; using &#x27;copyleft&#x27;, they wrestle the IP laws into their favour, as the means to &#x27;protect&#x27; Open Source, if you will.<p>We are so wrapped up in software - consider physical things. Often, they have very long development cycles, very expensive. Also - huge operating capital requirements and capex as well. (Why do you think there are so few YC hardware companies?). Also - distribution networks are locked up and very different from software where it&#x27;s almost direct.<p>It would be almost impossible to make a hardware company without IP protections, because those with market power would instantly commoditize the competition.<p>Many other businesses are a little bit similar: as soon as it&#x27;s not &#x27;pure software&#x27; then you realize how fragile new companies are.<p>For &#x27;very new domains&#x27; (i.e. &#x27;blue oceans&#x27;) it&#x27;s one thing, but most markets are not that.<p>Once you put your &#x27;anything but software&#x27; hat on for a bit, and see how those companies sit in the value chain, IP looks a little different. That understanding can map to software.<p>If anything, we need better, more nuanced IP laws, not to get rid of them.')
