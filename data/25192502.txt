Even for the man and the year, it seems odd if we interpret this as racially &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot;; for one thing, few of his villians were black. Does he mean something else, like &quot;black and white&quot; suggesting good and evil without shades of grey (moral complications)?')
