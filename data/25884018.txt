I created a private fork called &quot;Material for MkDocs Insiders [2]&quot; where all new features landed since then and tied those features to funding goals at $ 500, $ 1,000 etc. The promise is that the moment a funding goal is hit, the features are merged back into the original repo and released for general availability. It works reasonably well so far, better that I would have thought.<p>My Twitter following is rather small (700), but I&#x27;m posting a lot about Material for MkDocs and new features and try to engage the community. I guess if you have a large following like Caleb, you could up the amount in a few months, given that you have something on your hands that users want and solves a problem.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;squidfunk.github.io&#x2F;mkdocs-material&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;squidfunk.github.io&#x2F;mkdocs-material&#x2F;</a>  \n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;squidfunk.github.io&#x2F;mkdocs-material&#x2F;insiders&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;squidfunk.github.io&#x2F;mkdocs-material&#x2F;insiders&#x2F;</a>')
