Perhaps tucked away at the bottom or have it hidden until some event trigger. I&#x27;m extremely hesitant of believe information at face value.<p>For sources, I would recommend scholarly articles and research published in peer-reviewed journals, since the people who care enough to check the sources will probably also want them to have academic standards and not just be a random blog post or news article.')
