For the sake of the argument let&#x27;s say for example 5 VMs. My current laptop struggles because it&#x27;s old, and I&#x27;m wondering if I can just get a cheap one next time and do everything on the cloud. Also there are issues with storage etc. if I want it accessible from anywhere.<p>I tried Amazon Workspaces with Amazon linux, it was just ok to work in, and got a bit expensive once the trial period wore off. Also just dealing with the AWS interface stuff was too complicated for my simple needs.<p>Suggestions? Ideas? Comments?')
