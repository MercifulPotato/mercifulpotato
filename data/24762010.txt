Basically they are auxiliary units that source outside fresh air or exhaust stale air when there is a heat differential between a specific heating&#x2F;cooling zone and the outside temps. So if you are in a basement that is cold and the outside is hot it will just bring in outside air instead of turning on the heater.<p>Radiant floor heating and radiant cooling zones are also in. And run water through Your floors to heat or cool zones. It is one of the most efficient ways to heat a structure and feels good as well.<p>Geothermal is also pretty in for high-end residences but there is a high first cost to evaluate geothermal potential.<p>Most of these new technologies are usually coupled with standard split-systems or VRF systems and add additional efficiency (life cycle cost value) over the span of occupancy but have higher first costs .<p>Lastlyâ€” always consider passive heating and cooling strategies they are highest value options (insulation , shading, glazing specs , solar orientation , landscaping , etc.)')
