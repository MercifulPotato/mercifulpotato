Is the problem only with the GUI (same as liking or not Gnome Shell or having it crash) or is the problem with the &quot;real&quot; OS under the GUI?<p>Example 1 for the GUI: it drives me crazy that I can&#x27;t resize the dialogs to edit the properties of a scheduled task. They were probably designed for 800x600 screens and they were a bad design back then (a text area please and join the lines.)<p>Example 2 for the core: a process keeps track of its parent but if the patent exits the process doesn&#x27;t update the reference so you can end up with a reused process id in the child process data table. I run into that a couple of weeks ago.')
