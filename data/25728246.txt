It&#x27;s like drawing the line somewhere arbitrary and then asking the side whose beliefs are on the other side &quot;why can&#x27;t you discuss this without resorting to hate speech&quot;, and &quot;stop complaining because your side is hateful&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s okay for companies to refuse you service because your ideas are hate speech and X-ist&quot;.<p>Few examples of acceptable &quot;hate-speech&quot; that falls within that acceptable line: Anti-white Racism.
