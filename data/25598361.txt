Facing inflation, money will aggregate first in the assets most likely to maintain + outpace an increase in monetary supply. Once they start appearing too overpriced, the overflow will affect other industries.<p>I&#x27;d invoke Occam&#x27;s Razor to state that inflation due to increase in monetary supply is more likely to manifest as &quot;overpricing&quot; of one or two asset classes first. As opposed to a crash, where one asset class bottoms out and takes the other with it, stimulus and inflation, in theory, would cause the opposite -- would they not?<p>I haven&#x27;t studied hyperinflation. So consider me inquisitive on the subject. But it&#x27;s certainly happened before, and the dynamics seem like they have the potential to create a positive feedback loop similar to a crash.')
