Removing rubbish, culling invasive species, restoring top soil, planting saplings, etc.<p>It was real work. I couldn&#x27;t believe how small the targeted area was. Less than an acre.<p>Doing restoration, biomediation at scale would give a lot of people a lot of jobs. At this point in my life, I&#x27;d definitely do it for minimum wage and health insurance. My neighbor &quot;retired&quot; a few years ago, now does landscaping. He claims he&#x27;s never been happier, more fit. He certainly looks it.')
