In my experience (line manager), when a new C-level is hired, within two years, they&#x27;ve usually replaced 50% of the VP&#x2F;directors that sit below them in the org. That&#x27;s far too much churn for it to be because those particular VP&#x2F;directors are brilliant - by extension, that would mean the outgoing VP&#x2F;directors were not - except many of them went to work for the recently departed C-level!  They can&#x27;t all be brilliant and they can&#x27;t all be useless, so we&#x27;re largely left with cronyism.')
