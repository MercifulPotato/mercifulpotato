In a jointly owned family business logic and Excel aren&#x27;t the only way the business gets evaluated. Depending on the structure a sale may even be blocked by a minority owner member so all parties have to agree it is a fair sale price to sell.<p>If this &quot;family business&quot; has built up $5-10M in investment assets and the operating business runs at a break even while the investments generate $1-3M a year in gains is it a small &quot;family office&quot; or a struggling family business with an excellent treasury team managing the investment assets?')
