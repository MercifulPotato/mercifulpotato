I&#x27;ve occasionally seen these suggestions within niche tech communities, but I&#x27;ve never heard a layperson suggest something remotely similar to this. I&#x27;m also unsure how useful it would be. How detailed would such disclosures be? Even if they list &quot;We use this machine learning algorithm&quot;, that algorithm description seems like it would be largely meaningless without the training data (which I don&#x27;t think you could convince them to publish at all).<p>&gt; Do you believe your products are addictive?<p>What company CEO _wouldn&#x27;t_ say yes to this? It feels, to me at least, like a fluff question that you already know the answer to and won&#x27;t yield any interesting insight into the company or how the CEO thinks about the product.<p>&gt; What does it mean to you for something to be true? Could you give an example of something that you find to be uncontroversially true?<p>I think this is a much better question, although I worry that it might yield itself to some &quot;gotcha&quot; moments from Senators. For example, if one of the CEOs were to say &quot;The sky is blue&quot;, I think you might get a lot of Senators saying &quot;Well what if it&#x27;s raining&quot;. That might not be the best example, but just something off the top of my head.<p>I agree that it might be hard to come up with a unequivocal definition of what is and is not true, as that&#x27;s ultimately a complicated philosophical question, but I think we can approximate truth by relying on a variety of sources who we know will do their due-diligence on research and are examining the full context of issues.')
