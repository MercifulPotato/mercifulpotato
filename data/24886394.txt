Nothing fancy, just did a port scan of their IP range. I found that they had dozens of their psychology department&#x27;s printers accessible over the internet.<p>So, I contacted their office, telling them that PII was likely accessible through these printers (through exploits), and asked that they look into why so many internal machines were accessible over the internet, and to at least remove the printers from the internet.<p>They responded by telling me that there were no internet-accesible printers and that their scans would have detected something like that.. and then asked that I send them any PII. I didn&#x27;t, but... it truly felt like they were trying to set me up for throwing the blame my way.<p>It&#x27;s really bad out there.')
