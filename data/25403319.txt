Those people get paid whether or not you focus their attention on a perimeter-exposed RCE bug. By tipping them off, all you&#x27;ve done is make them more effective for a time.<p>The bug is there whether a bounty hunter finds it or not. The other &quot;leverage&quot; you have, if you don&#x27;t like $7K bounties for auth bypass on random backend thingies, is just not do hunt for bounties at all. Facebook knows that; their desire to attract bounty hunters is priced in to the bounties they pay.<p>It&#x27;s for this reason that people who want to make serious money and who start in bounty hunting break basically two ways:<p>* Either they get really good at mopping up <i>lots</i> of 4-figure bounties (hitting the occasional blackjack on something that pays into low-mid 5 figures), often with a fair bit of automation, <i>or</i><p>* They graduate into consulting, where the weekly rate for this kind of work is substantially higher, you&#x27;re given a briefing by the target about where to look, and where you get paid whether or not you find a marquee bug.<p>(A good person to ask about this stuff is &#x27;daeken).')
