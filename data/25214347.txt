That is information highly relevant to security.<p>I think you missed the context of this comment thread. The &quot;Does it matter&quot; and &quot;Would anyone care?&quot; questions were directed at the question of what happens (presumably from a security point of view), if OSCP requests were being blocked. It&#x27;s not related to the discussion about whether OSCP queries violate privacy or not.')
