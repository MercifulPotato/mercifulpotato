Probably best just to block reviews for that restaurant, no? Because that’s what the feature is.<p>Regardless, CNN doesn’t often cover these stories. Local news does. And local news doesn’t suck.<p>Btw, please forgive the snark, but a complete lack of faith in local journalism (I.e. a conflation of CNN and the Altoona Mirror) is a big reason cable news has a lot of power.<p>TLDR - support local journalists!')
