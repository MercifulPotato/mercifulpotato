Or <i>at least as effective as manipulative techniques</i>?<p>Either way, I can&#x27;t answer that.  I&#x27;m not an advertising&#x2F;mass communication&#x2F;PR person.  All I can tell you is what works and doesn&#x27;t work for me, and manipulation really rubs me the wrong way.  But then, I&#x27;m probably not the typical voter.<p>Or, more cynically, manipulation rubs me the wrong way <i>when I detect it</i>.  What they may be doing is doing manipulation that the average voter doesn&#x27;t detect strongly.')
