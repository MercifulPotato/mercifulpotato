Item(by='UncleMeat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603803510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24904512, text='&gt; If you read what I wrote you will not find the word extremist anywhere.<p>I missed that you were a different poster than the one I responded to.<p>&gt;  I didnâ€™t say you you intend to sabotage quality education. I said you were against excellence. Turning a gifted school into a normal one will in practice be the end of academic acceleration.<p>But it isn&#x27;t turning a gifted school into a normal one. The proposal still requires accelerated math background, high test scores, and recommendations from administrators. The teachers will remain strong. The proposal isn&#x27;t a raw lottery among all FCPS students. The proposal isn&#x27;t cutting funding for the astronomy lab. The option for the gifted won&#x27;t vanish. The same population of people will be able to apply to TJ.<p>I am not &quot;against excellence&quot;. I do value other things in different ratios, perhaps. If somebody told me that the average AP scores at TJ would go down by 0.2 points and the school would have a population of free-and-reduced-lunch kids that matched the general population of FCPS, I&#x27;d say that was a good trade. I may value &quot;excellence&quot; less than you (for some definition of excellence) but I don&#x27;t oppose it.<p>I also believe that TJ&#x27;s test focus (and AP focus) leads to  a suboptimal pedagogy. Look at how 8th period has changed over the last several decades. Gone are the opportunities for wild experimentation and creativity outside of the norm. I believe that students are being forced into boxes at TJ and that eliminating the test will make it more clear that TJ can better serve its students with a wider set of opportunities for its kids.<p>I know a fair number of alumni who wouldn&#x27;t encourage their kids to attend TJ because the &quot;excellence&quot; it provides is so limited in scope. Students can feasibly be exposed to better curricula in IB and to wider ranges of human experiences at accelerated programs within base schools. I don&#x27;t know if I fully agree, but the fact that very smart, successful, and educate people can look at TJ and say &quot;I do not agree that this is a pinnacle of excellence&quot; should make us all step back and understand that we don&#x27;t agree on what excellence means.<p>You did also use the phrase &quot;support destroying...&quot; when describing me and my beliefs. I think that &quot;sabotage&quot; is a reasonable match to that.')
