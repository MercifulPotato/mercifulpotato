I even remember Bezos bragging about this being a core part of the company culture.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d be really interested in this quote and its context. At AWS, things are always iterated upon and tested. But there&#x27;s an incredible emphasis on two-way door decisions. Basically, don&#x27;t make big decisions that can&#x27;t be reversed if things go poorly.

CloudHSM v2 was released in 2017. And CloudHSM v1 hasn&#x27;t been available since at least 2019.<p>There are still EC2 instances running in EC2 classic--that is, EC2 before VPC was introduced.')
