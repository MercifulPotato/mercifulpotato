But the fact still remains that the vast majority of the RAM sits idle while the CPU processes through relatively small chunks of it at a time, which is what cache is for. If anything I&#x27;d rather see more cache RAM on the CPU itself than having to pay for a CPU + RAM on the same SOC. The performance gain from combining CPU + RAM on the same &quot;SOC&quot; is not <i>that</i> great enough to warrant doing that as an approach for all computers - Apple is doing this mostly because it saves them money. There&#x27;s a lot of push back from power users about expandability not even being an option anymore. But 99% of Apple&#x27;s customer base doesn&#x27;t have any need for expandability or power-user features, or having the fastest silicon available because they only use it for facebook, facetime, or a few other basic applications. And that&#x27;s fine. I won&#x27;t be buying one though.')
