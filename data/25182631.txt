Item(by='Aachen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606093983, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25180767, text='Medium has some well known issues, I don&#x27;t know substack. A personal blog is an option, perhaps mixed with Twitter where you tweet the first summary tweet and then link to the relevant post? And have an index somewhere? That might allow people to easily follow&#x2F;subscribe without the requirement to use Twitter.<p>Vague: it&#x27;s hard to give a better example when I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s actually in a given chapter, but e.g. this one doesn&#x27;t really tell me much:<p>&gt; 3: Happy career: two-factor theory of what makes us tick: motivators (challenging work, responsibility, growth) and hygiene (income, ego). Best way to help the world is being a great manager.<p>The meaning of hygiene here doesn&#x27;t become clear to me really, and why is it best for the world to be a great manager? As opposed to a bad manager or as opposed to not a manager?<p>Another one might be:<p>&gt; Ship of Theseus: kids are always your kids even if they&#x27;ve learn from others.<p>Erm, sure they remain my kids if they&#x27;re mine? Can&#x27;t tell what this means.<p>Finally, I definitely like a one-tweet summary up front (stretching the question about one-sentence summary since imo it doesn&#x27;t have to be one sentence).<p>Hope this answered your questions somewhat :)')
