But on the way there, the likely pathway is larger and larger federated network authentication. Most of the world&#x27;s higher education students&#x2F; staff are enrolled into EduROAM, so that it doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re in a classroom in Tokyo or London, the federated system concludes they are a legitimate user <i>somewhere</i> and so they can connect here. In these federated systems there&#x27;s no use for a &quot;Captive portal&quot; since it could not safely achieve federated authentication, so there isn&#x27;t one.')
