But I don&#x27;t even necessarily mean amazing clever type tricks like you might see in Haskell or something, I mean that something as simple as &quot;I&#x27;ve changed the definition of what a &#x27;Customer&#x27; is in some fundamental manner, so I&#x27;m going to rename that class to &#x27;CustomerNew&#x27;, use the compiler to point me at every single place that breaks, audit it, change the local name to CustomerNew, and then, once everything is fixed, use my IDE&#x27;s rename feature to rename CustomerNew back to Customer before my final commit&quot;. Many times you can get by just by renaming a field or something to similar effect, but in the worst case you may need to audit everything.<p>It&#x27;s one of the more tedious bits of the job sometimes, but net-net this can still be a timesaver, if you account for the full cost of the trickle of bugs this sort of thing can prevent.')
