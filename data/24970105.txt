I&#x27;ve had 2 corrupt SD card failures so far.  It&#x27;s hard to know for certain what the cause is.  We have spare SD cards to swap in for this application.  For my application, having a spare SD image isn&#x27;t a problem and I don&#x27;t need five 9&#x27;s of uptime, but the SD cards seem to be a point of fragility.  Ultimately we&#x27;re very happy with the system, but the SD cards are a point of failure that just need to be mitigated.')
