Gradle isn&#x27;t pretty though. `gradle init` for a simple Kotlin hello-world application generates 20+ files and folders, which to me is an incredible amount of bloat. Not exactly Unix-y. Agreed about Kotlin being made by JetBrains being a negative. It&#x27;s a great language, but only working with one IDE, JetBrains&#x27;, is a trap I&#x27;d rather not be in. They seem to be on the wrong side of history with the Language Server Protocol becoming more popular every day.')
