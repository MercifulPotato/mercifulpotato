Item(by='sciurus', descendants=None, kids=[25340651], score=None, time=1607390002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25338983, text='The situation with Travis CI is confusing, has not been communicated well by them, and is definitely not getting enough coverage for the amount of disruption it might cause. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been able to piece together:<p>? 2018: Travis CI announces they are starting the process of merging travis-ci.org, which provided free builds for OSS projects, into travis-ci.com, which until then was only for paying customers. They promise OSS builds will continue to be free.<p>? 2020: Travis CI announces they are shutting down travis-ci.org at the end of the year and all projects have to move to travis-ci.com. They promise OSS builds will continue to be free.<p>Early November 2020: travis-ci.com switches from providing unlimited builds for OSS to only providing 10k one-time credits by default. Projects that meet certain guidelines (e.g. no one paid to work on them) can apply for recurring credits.<p>Later in November 2020: CI for many OSS projects that had migrated to travis-ci.com starts to fail, as they&#x27;ve exhausted their 10K credits.<p>Dec 2020: If what is reported here is accurate, Travis CI stop providing any recurring OSS credits. CI breaks for the remaining OSS projects on travis-ci.com.<p>Jan 2021: travis-ci.org shuts down. CI will be broken for all projects using it. They&#x27;ll have the option of migrating to travis-ci.com, but will soon break again as they exhaust their 10k credits.<p>I suspect that many, many projects haven&#x27;t migrated from .org to .com and are going to be surprised when their CI breaks on January 1st. It looks like their only option is to start paying Travis CI or move to an alternate provider (like CircleCI or Github Actions, both of which have free tiers for OSS).<p>If Travis CI&#x27;s new owners are no longer willing to provide free CI services to OSS projects, that&#x27;s understandable. I just wish they&#x27;d communicate that clearly in ways that their users won&#x27;t miss.<p>(BTW, if anyone from Travis CI is reading this, I reached out to your support team last week for help on a problem that is blocking us from potentially paying you. I haven&#x27;t gotten an answer yet on ticket 23831. Any help is appreciated.)')
