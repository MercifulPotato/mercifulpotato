Basically censure, and forced speech.<p>I think a stronger version of this argument, which can appeal more broadly, would be: an automated system that is constantly being trained on data from social media can more quickly pick up new trends in human speech than a manually-programmed expert system. Furthermore, even if humans are constantly updating an expert system, the biases inherent in the composition of the company-hired set of experts will limit the representation of minority trends in the data. On the other hand, a model examining the entire data set can pick these up automatically. For example, I can easily get AI Dungeon (powered by GPT-3) to communicate using language and concepts that are only present in a minority community that I’m part of that I’ve rarely seen represented in literature.<p>When arguing against Timnit Gebru or their ilk, you don’t need to just <i>give</i> them the support of liberals. We actually make up the majority of techies, so it’s a bad position to put yourself in if you want your cause to succeed.')
