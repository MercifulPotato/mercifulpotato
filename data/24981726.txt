Many tried. But they wound up 100% black&#x2F;0% white anyway.<p>No, I think when put to the test most liberal people would not do this. If they &quot;tried&quot;, why did those neighborhoods wind up 100% black?<p>Where I grew up, for instance, the second best school in the city (by test scores, at least) was 99% black (mostly the children of alums of a nearby HBCU). White parents would send their kids to worse performing schools with more white kids over sending their kids to that school.')
