I&#x27;ve never worked with FAANG however I&#x27;ve been through 5-6 interviews. The way I see it, it&#x27;s material that can be studied&#x2F;recalled but you can make much more difference in your life with that amount of energy, unless you&#x27;re a new graduate OR your job is interviewing other people. I understand the side effects that study can bring on to help ease the pain, though it won&#x27;t work if you only rely on knowledge alone. That&#x27;s where experience&#x2F;context helps. Just be aware that fangs are not a measure of what a best software engineering can be, they&#x27;re the ones make use of their branding well as a high entry wall. So please do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t take the harsh to your heart, keep enjoying what you do.')
