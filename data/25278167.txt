One, Google&#x27;s culture and managerial system is pretty poor, in such a way that it rewards starting things and not finishing them. That hurts consumers.

Or should it give profits back to shareholders who can then go do these things themselves while Google just tries to be come a really efficient, and insanely profitable search provider?<p>I&#x27;d advocate for the latter as a healthier way to run society with fewer tech giants of lovecraftian size slipping their tentacles into every cranny that one can stuff a million dollars into.')
