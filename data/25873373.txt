Item(by='Loughla', descendants=None, kids=[25874169], score=None, time=1611334574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25873303, text='We priced out pickup trucks recently for shits and giggles (because we live in rural america and really have a decently often use for one).<p>They&#x27;re so expensive. And the dealer pushes the 84+ month loan to bring the payment down. Like, I get that it&#x27;s a $450&#x2F;month payment, and that&#x27;s supposed to sound reasonable (it isn&#x27;t reasonable, at 3&#x2F;4 the cost of our mortgage). But it&#x27;s for 8 years! There&#x27;s no way this truck is going to last that long. Who does this? Why?')
