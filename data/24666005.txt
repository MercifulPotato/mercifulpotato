You&#x27;d probably hire a drop out if you could pay much less in wages, but I see a lot of people avoiding that apprenticeship path.<p>They didn&#x27;t have this issue in the early 90 cause inflation had so quickly outpaced minimum wage there really wasn&#x27;t one. So in 1979-1985 when he was paid somewhere near 7-11 a hour I&#x27;d guess and paying $270 a month. I&#x27;m guessing it was worth it to his teach him.
