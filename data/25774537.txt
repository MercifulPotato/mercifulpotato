Honestly I think you&#x27;re a bit out of touch with how people use the internet today.<p>I&#x27;ve got two monitors.<p>I&#x27;ve played an MMORPG before where I have a YouTube video playing on the other monitor.<p>This has been possible for probably 10 years.<p>Also yes. People live in homes with other people either as a family or house&#x2F;flat sharing.<p>Who all use the internet at the same time.<p>What if they all want to watch 4k video in their room? Whilst their consoles (Nintendo Switch, PS5 or Xbox Series X) are downloading games&#x2F;updates.<p>If they want to maintain 4k streaming, they&#x27;re going to need a fast download speed.<p>Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, Nvidia GeforceNow are game streaming applications, they require good throughput in addition to low latency.<p>Low latency requires an uncongested connection.<p>What if they work on photos and videos in the cloud? They can load them up faster to work on. Rather than requiring a signifant local storage.<p>Especially if they have symmetric upload speeds.<p>100Mbps+ is clearly beneficial.<p>You&#x27;re conflating your lack of need for fast internet with everyone else not needing it.')
