I wouldn&#x27;t assume that a few months of lockdown will cause a suicide spike as to compare to most new diseases. Isolation will affect social life which will affect mental health which will affect social life etc. E.g. I&#x27;d assume consequences to recursively culmulate even after lockdowns have ended. Which arguably would increase suicides and decrease general happiness for a time longer than the lockdowns.<p>Lockdowns also reduce other causes of death which may participate in that (reportedly) high correlation between excess death and covid deaths.')
