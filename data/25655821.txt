Or you write code snippets for code to run in a distributed dag.<p>This exists with e.g. shared file systems (how hpc works, how hadoop works) and Python can pickle code and send it over a socket (be aware that this is a security risk). WASM seems like a nice and direct solution for moving code to data.')
