We launch our services in these docker containers and do some integration &#x2F; e2e tests, and this very much requires Gitlab CI to launch docker containers while inside a Docker container.<p>After using dind for some time we chose to just mount &#x2F;var&#x2F;run&#x2F;docker.sock and keep using the host machine’s docker instance (mostly for the cache), but all in all dind was working fairly well.<p>To be honest, to say “you shouldn’t be doing that” is missing the point; one should be able to do anything they want. In my opinion, the root cause here is docker’s client&#x2F;server model, which is fixed by other container runtimes such as podman and rkt (which unfortunately is deprecated). One should be able to just launch containers as if they were just another process.')
