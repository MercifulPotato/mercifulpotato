At worst, this is GitHub violating the rules.<p>MacStadium is renting those macs to a single customer for longer than 24 hours. MacStadium <i>is</i> following the rules. MacStadium is just providing a platform.<p>You&#x27;re not really expecting MacStadium to snoop on each customer&#x27;s usage and business model to enforce Apple&#x27;s rules? AWS <i>certainly</i> won&#x27;t be doing that.<p>If Apple told MacStadium or AWS to stop offering Macs to a customer such as GitHub due to some EULA violation committed by GitHub, they would probably do that.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why your comment is trying <i>so hard</i> to frame MacStadium as hypocrites.')
