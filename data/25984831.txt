A lot of people stopped just to use the restroom.<p>We also had homeless people use restrooms to bathe, and drug addicts use the bathroom as a place to quickly take a hit. Also had people defecate on the floor, write messages on the wall with feces, etc. Because of this, multiple places I worked didn&#x27;t provide restroom access to the public. It sucks for people who simply and respectfully use the restroom. But at the same time (in one specific location at least), it was a matter of having to clean up fecal matter or drug paraphernalia or not letting the public use the restroom. My sub-living-wage job simply didn&#x27;t pay me enough to put up with that crap.<p>That being said, if you let &#x27;customers&#x27; use your restroom, you should let gig workers do the same. They aren&#x27;t your direct customer, but show them a modicum of respect and dignity.')
