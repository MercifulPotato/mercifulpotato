Since then Markdown has become the standard for text. Dokuwiki also updates a lot and is difficult to move from one server to another.<p>I&#x27;m always on the hunt because I haven&#x27;t found the perfect solution to replace it yet. I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s either plain text (including Markdown) or plain html, but I am not sure I&#x27;ve found the perfect solution.<p>Today I&#x27;m using Markdown hosted on GitHub, but who knows how long I&#x27;ll use GitHub or if GitLab or BitBucket will work as replacements in the same way.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say, &quot;stick with it&quot;, but technology changes a lot as the decades begin to pass by.')
