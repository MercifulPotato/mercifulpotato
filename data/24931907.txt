I think you&#x27;re confusing your personal friend network with your larger professionally relevant network.  All you need to get a job lead from someone in your professional network is for them to have a positive impression of you, even from years or decades ago. That impression can be built up from years of working closely together on projects including building up a close friendship, or from talking to someone for 15 minutes if you really stand out positively to them. Don&#x27;t undersell the value of the connections that you have.  Most people would rather hire someone that the know than someone randomly selected from a stack of resumes.')
