I&#x27;ve had another 2 or 3 kg of prints that were novelties or that failed to perform the desired function.<p>On the other hand, last week I printed a replacement keyboard case for my portable keyboard, which saved me buying another one (I use it constantly). A couple of months ago I designed and printed a new fan duct for my fridge. Had I not been able to do that, I would have had to buy a $300 part and thrown the old one out. The impact of manufacturing and shipping that one part likely outweighs the lifetime waste of my printer, and that&#x27;s just one example.')
