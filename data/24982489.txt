Item(by='ghastmaster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604428326, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24981857, text='&gt; That definition of inflation makes no sense in the current monetary arrangements, it&#x27;s, simply, not how it works anymore. There is not an &quot;amount of precious metal that constituted a nationâ€™s money.&quot; If some people don&#x27;t understand that, we should aim to educate them.<p>To be clear, what you are referring to is a quote from the FED article I linked to and quoted. Before the Keynesian revolution, inflation meant increased money supply and was assumed to increase prices as well, because money was backed by or was gold&#x2F;silver. Many people as you opined have a misunderstanding that money is still backed by gold and you are correct that they lack the education. The &quot;change&quot; in the definition was by the Keynesians. It is not accepted by everyone. The monetary theory change should not change the definition.<p>Why does my definition make sense to me? A price is a number, not a physical thing so it increases. Take the balloon analogy. Money supply is the balloon, inflated with dollars. Price is the balloon, inflated with numbers? Does not make sense to me. The term &quot;price inflation&quot; is a misnomer. It should be &quot;price increase&quot;.<p>FYI: On this site we use &quot;&gt; &quot; for block quotes. You used quotes and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; and included my &quot;&gt;&quot;. It was a little confusing.')
