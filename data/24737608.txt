If you share a copy of data with the world (or any one person unless in a special situation (lawyer, doctor)), you no longer own it. That has nothing to do with privacy.<p>2) Data ownership: see above. If you share your data with FB, you own your copy, they own full rights to use their copy. That&#x27;s what all web sites ask you to agree to, and you can&#x27;t use the platform unless you agree to that.<p>If you want to hang onto your data, don&#x27;t share it. All reasonable privacy expectations are still very much alive.')
