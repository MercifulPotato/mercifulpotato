They&#x27;re fine but I&#x27;m not a fan of the shape and design and they are less comfortable than my Airpods Pro (corroborated by multiple reviews). They&#x27;re also less convenient to use, even when I connect my Airpods to Android&#x2F;non-Apple devices. I don&#x27;t hold loyalty to any brand but it&#x27;s just as eye roll inducing when people suggest X product is bad because they&#x27;re made by Y company.')
