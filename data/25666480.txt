The registry doesn&#x27;t really care about much beyond the package.json.<p>I&#x27;ve done something similar to the author at a previous company, distributing an internal development CLI written in Go, though in our case we published to the GitHub Packages NPM registry rather than private npmjs.com, so we could authenticate our developers via their GitHub accounts.<p>Including multiple binaries inside the published package, one for macOS and one for Linux (we had no Windows devs), did increase the package size, but the whole gzipped .tar.gz was around 20-30mb, so not terrible from a registry storage standpoint.<p>Publishing to an NPM registry, vs just hosting a binary for our devs to download, was convenient since we could use the registry API to check for updates and notify the user that an update was available. Users could then update via a subcommand, which just pulled the new package from the registry.')
