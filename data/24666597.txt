I... think you&#x27;ve just filled in a missing piece of my college CompSci education.<p>Previously, I never <i>really</i> understand why we measured algorithms this way, beyond &quot;it&#x27;s a rough classification and nothing is perfect.&quot; What I didn&#x27;t quite realize until just now is, this classification <i>assumes</i> N is a variable that could be any value in the universe—and so you have to optimize for that eventuality.<p>If N is known, the iterations don&#x27;t matter—because of course they don&#x27;t.<p>(Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve been out of college for a while and I don&#x27;t use algorithms in my daily life, it&#x27;s possible I just forgot this. Or that I&#x27;m making a fool of myself right now!)')
