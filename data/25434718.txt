I just use the recorder app on my phone as a &quot;rubber duck&quot;. I say something out loud, and it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s been cleared out. I didn&#x27;t need to address another person. Then when I <i>do</i> have the conversation, I&#x27;m in control of myself: the topics I bring up are more deliberate and purposeful, because I don&#x27;t have a backlog to clear, and I often have my ideas prepared in articulated form, so I am a more engaging conversation partner.')
