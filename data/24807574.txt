Item(by='patio11', descendants=None, kids=[24807749], score=None, time=1602910953, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24807502, text='There&#x27;s a Foreign Earned Income Exemption which will eliminate the tax payment requirement for most people on wage income, but you&#x27;ll be taxed on investments&#x2F;interest from the first dollar. People with income higher than the FEIE who pay taxes to a high-tax high-service jurisdiction (like Japan) will generally use the foreign tax credit to take care of most of their liability; folks who live in a low-personal-income jurisdiction like Hong Kong <i>and</i> are high-paid get smacked pretty hard.<p>There exists a plethora of compliance problems which are worse than the actual taxation, for example the PFIC regulations which make it non-economic to do standard middle class investment abroad for e.g. a child&#x27;s education. Advocates for Americans overseas are trying to get the PFIC and FATCA regulations overturned or get safe harbors expanded dramatically, but there exists a feeling in Washington that the only Americans who&#x27;d have bank accounts or mutual funds outside the US are &quot;fat cats&quot; (get it?) trying to abuse the tax system rather than pretty typical taxpayers with pretty typical life choices.')
