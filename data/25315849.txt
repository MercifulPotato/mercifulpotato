Bell&#x27;s theorem makes three assumptions. One of which has no basis other than &quot;I like it&quot;.<p>EDIT: Also, as Gerard &#x27;t Hooft points out[1], if you have a deterministic theory and you don&#x27;t know the initial state, that is, you feed it probabilities, then you get probabilities on the other end. In this light there is nothing special about the quantum randomness. It&#x27;s just that you don&#x27;t know the initial state of the system.<p>[1]-<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;YglT09Korr0?t=2476" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;YglT09Korr0?t=2476</a>')
