Item(by='uberman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604853213, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25023050, text='A summary of the changes follows:<p><i>&quot;H1B applicants will need to be earning a salary equivalent to the 45th percentile of their profession&#x27;s salary if they&#x27;re an entry-level worker, rising to 95th percentile for higher-skilled workers. In the past, the boundaries were set at the 17th and 67th percentiles respectively.&quot;</i><p>I work in the Higher Ed space and it is a common practice to use cheap student labor (particularly captive international student labor) J1&#x2F;F1 holders who are then transferred into OPT for a year and then onto H1 status for an additional six years of servitude&#x2F;captivity.<p>I want to be clear that I am not opposed to immigration or foreign labor. Rather, I oppose treating these employees as a cheap source of labor. It is unfair to them and deflates pay for all employees. I actually like programs like OPT that provide a path for international students to begin to repay what is often huge debt, particularly when compared to wages in their home countries. They should however be paid fairly.<p>I would like to conclude with this.<p>I have a friend who recently applied for a senior position at a private university (one with a name you would recognize). The positional called for a data scientist with ML and AI experience. I know because they asked me for a reference. They were offered the position but told that the absolute maximum the university would pay was $65k per year as that was what the former employee (a graduate who they transitioned to an H1 visa) was paid.<p>I suspect the Yale case is basically this as well. A university that wants to avoid paying the prevailing wage and has been able to avoid that by exploiting former international graduates. If they feel that either their employee is not a level 4 or that the prevailing wage estimates are wrong they can appeal.')
