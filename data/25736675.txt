A group of people literally organized on Facebook and brought guns to overtake the capitol. It&#x27;s pretty cut and dry. Again, nobody would&#x27;ve expected Microsoft to support ISIS&#x27; tech. Businesses have always pulled away from extremist groups like this, as is their right to do.<p>The &quot;whataboutism&quot; on DoD contracts isn&#x27;t relevant. If your stance is &quot;Our own government is a terror cell&quot;, well obviously then our entire society is gone anyway, so why even bother discussing the ethics of tech in america at all? But obviously this stance is just hyperbole in an attempt to dismiss the validity of claiming the rioters as legitimate terrorists.<p>And even by your own example, when has the DoD ever stormed the capitol? Or attempted to overthrow the US government? Spoiler: they haven&#x27;t. And these insanely silly attempts at implying that legitimate businesses are under the same category as fascist extremists is a joke. This tech precedent pearl clutching is such an insanely bad look it&#x27;s difficult to even fathom. My assertion is simple: when you try to overthrow a country&#x27;s government, companies in that country don&#x27;t want to work with you. The waters are muddier with respect to overthrowing other people&#x27;s governments, but the DoD has never once attempted to overthrow the US government. There has never been an AWS-supported US coup (before last week). SO the &quot;whatabouts&quot; aren&#x27;t even relevant.')
