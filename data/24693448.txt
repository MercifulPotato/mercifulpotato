But you restrict and replace some of their previous usage.<p>Same for functional programming: you take OOP but remove all the sideeffects. You still have objects which encapsulate data which can only be accessed in a certain way and can behave polymorphic. Mind that inheritance was never really part of OOP in general.<p>Now about DOP - not sure what exactly it adds on top of FP or if it is even an established and well defined term.
