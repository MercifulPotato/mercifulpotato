It may have left enough on the shelf for the would-be customers of scalpers to meet their needs. On the other hand, that leftover stock may have been obtained by panic buyers.<p>On a hunch I&#x27;d say a scalper would purchase more off the shelf than a panic buyer, because with the goal they have in mind they a) want a large quantity to resell to a large number of people and b) want to drain shelf stock to increase their odds of success.')
