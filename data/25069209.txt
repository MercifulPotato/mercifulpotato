I&#x27;ve had the need of something like this for a long long time now. A decade ago I was lucky to have my own desktop computer (before it was a shared one with my brother, before that I had just my parent&#x27;s from time to time). Nowadays, between the smarphone, the work laptop, my desktop and my laptop I cannot possibly have all my music available all the time. And I don&#x27;t like using spotify where I don&#x27;t feel I own the songs and they get dropped from my lists. I used to be a fan of grooveshark, but that went down. Now I can have my pod and share it with my friends? On my own server? Accessible everywhere? I&#x27;m in.<p>Where can I donate some money?')
