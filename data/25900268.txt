It is not a wish for anyone to experience death, let alone a painful one.<p>People rarely have to confront the extent of the results of their actions and as a result don&#x27;t really think on those terms. Personal experience is an effective, often painful teacher.<p>I can&#x27;t claim to know your entire perspective, but from the outside, refusing to accept a <i>temporary</i>, minor inconvenience to one&#x27;s life so we can reduce how many people have to die an agonizing death seems ... selfish, at best.<p>I myself am a person who suffers from depression issues that have only been magnified by isolation. And yet here I am, following the guidelines as best I can. I&#x27;m not at much of a risk of dying from COVID, but if I got it and infected someone who ended up dying from it - I&#x27;d never forgive myself.')
