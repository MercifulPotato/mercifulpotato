And therein lies the philosophical divide that clearly separates us: free association and trade between free individuals is the moral ideal of any economic system (yes, also the freedom to speculate and to get scammed); by contrast a system of power management and control for the sake of &quot;preventing fraud and crime&quot; (by the way, you might want to do some research about the efficacy of prevention of the systemic tools you exalt) is a system of masters and slaves.
