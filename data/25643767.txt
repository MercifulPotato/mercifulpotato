No clue if my points are mentioned in the comments already.<p># Scale down face images<p>If you decide keeping the face images please scale them down to a thumbnail size. You make my browser load a 400x400 pixel image for than displaying it as 24x24 pixel. You can safe quite some bandwidth on your (and my) side.<p>Another option would to completely remove the images in favor of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blurha.sh&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blurha.sh&#x2F;</a> as the images are so small, that detail are not seen anyways.<p># Server side rendering for SEO<p>Please render the site on the server, so it can be used without javascript, can be crawled by google and is a lot faster as well.<p>You could leverage a service like: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seo4ajax.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seo4ajax.com&#x2F;</a> so you don&#x27;t have to actually build a server side rendering pipeline.<p># Check for web accessibility<p>I would enjoy having my CV being accessible to a wide array of humans.  Some of the contrast and the font size seems to not be optimal for that (and also some screenreaders have problems with the javascript stuff =&gt; see server side rendering)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wave.webaim.org&#x2F;report#&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;read.cv&#x2F;andy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wave.webaim.org&#x2F;report#&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;read.cv&#x2F;andy</a><p># Email + password login<p>I am privacy aware and delete my cookies quite often. The process of waiting for the email and than opening the link (which is broke btw if it is not opened in the same context as the login window) is annoying. Please let me use a username+password to login. (Which can be auto filled by my browser)<p># Export as PDF<p>Here in Germany quite some companies still want printed out CVs or at least PDFs. Would be greate to be able to send them a link to an autogenerated PDF e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;read.cv&#x2F;andy&#x2F;pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;read.cv&#x2F;andy&#x2F;pdf</a><p>Keep up the work.')
