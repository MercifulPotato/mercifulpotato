Other people are talking about the wider Israeli-Arab conflict, which has been closer to a cold war in the last couple of decades (modulo various training&#x2F;funding for proxy operations), but just as real as the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union.  And worth defusing just like that one, though obviously it didn&#x27;t have the &quot;possible nuclear holocaust&quot; issue going on.')
