Some graphics and performance losses are expected and excusable, depending on whether it&#x27;s still worth it to you.<p>Every trailer labeled &quot;Nintendo Switch&quot; shows footage taken from an actual Switch; you can at least gauge how well it runs or whether visuals are good or not. (And there&#x27;s tech reviewers like Digital Foundry)<p>Comparably, Cyberpunk&#x27;s most recent gameplay demo was purely next-gen (and &quot;mid-gen&quot; like PS4 Pro), and reviewers were playing on PC and not allowed to show footage. You couldn&#x27;t know about X1&#x2F;PS4 experience until it was too late.<p>&gt; Anyone who&#x27;s read up on Cyberpunk knows that it&#x27;s going to strain even the best gaming PCs, so it should be no surprise that it barely runs on last gen consoles.<p>This game was announced when PS4&#x2F;X1 <i>just</i> came out, even if you account for development starting years later that&#x27;s <i>still</i> within the peak of their cycle. If it weren&#x27;t for the last 3 delays (only 7 months combined), Cyberpunk would be releasing on those same consoles before PS5 was even announced. 15-24FPS, 540p gameplay would not be acceptable then and it should not be acceptable now.')
