Item(by='cycloptic', descendants=None, kids=[25704721], score=None, time=1610221511, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25703437, text='&gt;Any portable build system, that already requires EVERY user to have that build system installed, is DoA for being a viable portable build system.<p>Why? I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s different from requiring a user to install a compiler to build a particular language. Operating systems don&#x27;t have every compiler installed by default. To fulfill your requirements, one would have to re-implement every build system and compiler in POSIX shell. Honestly the &quot;better way&quot; that I see a lot of projects going with is to just support multiple options for build systems, because there is no one perfect solution that is going to work on all platforms.<p>The elephant in the room here is windows, and at this current point in time, CMake is about as portable there as autotools because Visual Studio has built in support for it.')
