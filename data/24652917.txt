However, there is a sentiment of sympathy afforded to murderers (that they&#x27;re somehow deserving of rehabilitation) which is not always extended to those who have tweeted racist things.<p>Perhaps this comes because a murder can be seen as a sad result of circumstances. Perhaps the criminal only had to murder because they had a bad upbringing and needed the cash and it was a horrible mistake. On the other hand, people perceived as racist are permanently marked as being ideologically dangerous. Mainly, I think this comes because racist tweeters can be seen as more directly responsible for their actions than a murderer.<p>Of course, this line of reasoning is nonsense, but it appears to be quite common.<p>Jon Ronson has a great TED talk about this, titled &quot;How one tweet can ruin your life&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wAIP6fI0NAI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wAIP6fI0NAI</a>.
