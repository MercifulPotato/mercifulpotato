And I don&#x27;t think there is actually anything wrong with that. You can buy a house for cheaper in the rust belt, and probably other things are cheaper too, hence a lower COL location.<p>Let&#x27;s say I paid you 100k in the rust belt, and you&#x27;re happy with that, you might not be happy with that in NYC because of the higher cost of living. The inverse is true too. If you&#x27;re happy with 100k in NYC, you&#x27;ll be more happy with it in a lower COL location. Which means I can pay you (and more importantly others) less and they&#x27;ll still be happy. This changes the supply and demand equation.')
