It&#x27;s far from competing with Wordpress, but I&#x27;ve build out a templating system for publishing, and made a fairly robust admin for setting variables and managing posts etc.<p>Written in PHP, MySQL, Javascript (leaning on Jquery) and CSS.<p>I was a web dev 10 years ago, since then I&#x27;ve been working on marketing and barely coding as a hobby.<p>Later this month I&#x27;m going to embark on a rewrite of a webapp I wrote for me and my friends that administrates an MLS (soccer) Pick&#x27;Em.<p>My other project is a soccer match recommender. It pulls in matches, and based on a few variables. I definitely want to improve this at some point, but largely it&#x27;s again just a side hobby to tinker with. If I find a framework I&#x27;m happy with I&#x27;d love to make it a small money side project and expand it to other sports so people who are just generic sports fans not sure what to watch, can get recommendations of matches expected to be good ones.')
