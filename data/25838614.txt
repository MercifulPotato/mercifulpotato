I think my mental model is something like:<p>- Dozens of severely bad actors - many of which actually did intend abduction or murder. These people are terrifying.<p>- Hundreds of bad actors. People attempting to subvert democracy which, despite sounding alarmist or cheesy without proper context (You need to see the videos to understand, I think) is also very scary. These people will hurt you for their political cause.<p>- Thousands of people convinced that their political system, their democracy, isn&#x27;t serving them. This is alright with me - I think they were convinced by the bad&#x2F;severely bad actors, and I believe this happens on all political spectrums. I know many &quot;left leaning&quot; folks with arguably insane ideas about politics and society in general, so this isn&#x27;t a republican disorder. I don&#x27;t resent them or even myself for coming to unreasonable conclusions and I believe they&#x27;re actually trying to improve their situation in the way they know how. Being wrong in and of itself isn&#x27;t a crime, I suppose. Protesting on bad information is unfortunate, but not criminal.<p>I have sympathy for all of these people. Things seem pretty awful for them right now, whether it should or not. It all seems very self-inflicted. Regardless, it seems a lot of manipulation has been involved. It&#x27;s very cult-like. Power hungry folks have recruited disenfranchised individuals to serve their agendas. It&#x27;s really sad.<p>The rest of the republican voters will be a mix of these groups, but I suspect they&#x27;ve come to terms with the election despite disappointment. They don&#x27;t want to zip tie anyone in congress or illegally overturn the election.<p>The bad actors really should experience consequences. They are a rot that contaminates the people around them. Whether they intend that or not, have good intentions or not, they have become so unreasonable and dangerous that they need to be contained at the least. I believe that includes Donald Trump most of all.')
