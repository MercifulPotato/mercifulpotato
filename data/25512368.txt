You don&#x27;t need 500 fulfillment centres across the US.\n4) UPS and FedEx are afraid and strategic partnerships there may help solve the last mile problem.<p>Shopify is well positioned to do this, and possibly working on something like this, but it will be a test of them because it may not be in their cultural DNA. &#x27;Physicality&#x27; is really a hard thing for software companies to deal with, even the best ones.')
