This was the early days of the public Internet, and they didn&#x27;t want to have to trust that their SMTP MTA was secure, so they just made sure nothing but mail could ever get through their mail pipeline.<p>It&#x27;s awkward and a bit of a pain to set up and manage, but enterprise companies have the resources to do things like that.  And it did actually provide state-of-the-art email security for its time.<p>(FWIW, I didn&#x27;t work with Compaq, but compared notes with their network architect on an occasional basis...)')
