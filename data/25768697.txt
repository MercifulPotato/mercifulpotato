What&#x27;s being talked about here, really, is fast &amp; HA coordination over a (relatively) small amount of shared state by multiple actors within a distributed system. This is literally Etcd&#x27;s raison d&#x27;etre, it excels at this use case.<p>There are many operational differences between Etcd and a traditional RDBMs, but the biggest ones are that broadcasting updates (so that actors may react) is a core operation, and the MVCC log is &quot;exposed&quot; (via ModRevision) so that actors can resolve state disagreements (am I out of date, or are you?).')
