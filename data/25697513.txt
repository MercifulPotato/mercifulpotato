What we might be seeing is what happens when those cultures compete for the same space.<p>Much like living organisms, both cultures&#x2F;memeplexes produce their versions of antibodies and immunities.<p>Both living memeplexes have developed a sense of &quot;self&quot; vs &quot;defective self&quot;&#x2F;&quot;harmful other&quot; vs &quot;harmless other&quot;, just like an immune system.  Both &quot;believe&quot; themselves to be the &quot;true&quot; organism, and that the other is defective.  Both have diverged enough that mutual symbiosis is no longer working.  Both claim the same space as their own.<p><i>Both</i> have failed to process the metaphorical signaling molecules of the other.  Driven by their respective fitness functions, both are evolving and diverging.<p>Ultimately, the two organisms will have to relearn how to communicate and merge back into a symbiotic whole, establish a clear boundary between the two, or failing those, each will continue to seek to destroy the other until perhaps nothing is left of either.')
