Split brain experiments prove a hemisphere will simply make something up, lacking some key information provided only to the other hemisphere, and you will honestly believe the made-up explanation is correct.<p>Your entire identity, hobbies, likes and relationships are a construct of your environment, genes and randomness. I personally feel that &quot;Being who you are&quot;, &quot;Staying true to yourself&quot; etc, are very negative things to tell someone, that we tell each other like crabs in a bucket. You absolutely can and should shape your identity around what type of person you want to become in the future. You can objectively look at your likes and behaviors and decide to replace them. If you&#x27;re on the spectrum, like I suspect a lot of HN readers are, in some ways it&#x27;s even easier to take this kind of detached view of yourself. Personally, I used to really like X, it was a core part of my identity. One day I simply decided to not do X anymore, I didn&#x27;t like the people doing X and I didn&#x27;t see any successful people in my orbit, and I replaced it with Y &amp; Z. It changed the type of people I was around, it changed my career path, and my core personality. Just like you can choose to work on your computer, house, you car, etc. you can choose to work on your identity, personality and likes. There is no one true yourself, just many different versions and possibilities.')
