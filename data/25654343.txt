I&#x27;ve walked away after months of negotiations when suppliers renege of this key part of any distribution agreement. You cannot be in a position to build up someone else&#x27;s product or brand, and have them take it away from you at their own discretion, with zero compensation to you. You should not also be diluting your marketing efforts for said product if the supplier is handing out distribution rights like candy.<p>Get exclusive agreements always. You&#x27;ll likely need to pay some sort of minimum guarantee, but you can negotiate a rolling start, and if the product is not present in the market, you have leverage to get terms in your favour (ie, exclusive to you, but no sales guarantee for the first 6 months, to &quot;test out the market&quot;). This should still be outlined in writing and signed by both parties.')
