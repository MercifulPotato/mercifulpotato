The Saudi Arabian government has already admitted to murdering Khashoggi (but denied that MBS had anything to do with it)[0]. There was plenty of reviewed evidence, including CCTV footage, audio recordings, etc, not just &quot;everybody knows&quot;.</i><p>Have you seen the footage and listened to the audio recordings? I&#x27;ve followed the events, and read the articles as they came out. One after the other talked about details, bone saws, audio recordings of phone calls, of the deed itself, video footage. The ones I may have watched were not of that event.<p>The link points to the Wikipedia page of the &quot;Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi&quot;. Do you have a link to the Saudi Arabian government admitting to murdering Khashoggi?')
