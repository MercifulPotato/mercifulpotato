I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t fully understand the methods these researchers use, so it&#x27;s possible that they address the common problems, but historically conclusions from trying to establish causal relationships through data mining have not had a great track record. The bits I did understand seem solid enough (vitamin D and obesity levels 10-15 years ago, when the participants were enrolled, and now <i>should</i> be pretty highly correlated, and the sample size is pretty large) but there are a lot of non-obvious pitfalls when trying to establish causality with purely observational methods.')
