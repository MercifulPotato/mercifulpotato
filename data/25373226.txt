People historically had lots of kids for 2 reasons: a lot of them died before reaching reproductive age, and they needed more hands to produce food because most people lived in a subsistence agriculture environment.<p>The population boom over the last 100 years is not due to people reproducing too much, it is due to a decrease in child mortality, that and development from agricultural to industrial economies meant a cultural lag time in reducing the number of kids a woman has.<p>Once you have an industrial economy, the pressure then becomes to have <i>less</i> kids. You don&#x27;t need to be told in a classroom to do that, it happens naturally. If you need proof, these education programs didn&#x27;t exist in the west during development into industrial economies and yet the fertility rate decreased simply due to economic pressures.<p>A fertility rate of 2.3 (the .3 accounting for child death and people who don&#x27;t ever have kids) is replacement rate. At that rate population does not increase.<p>Long story short, at least in cities (where the water shortage we are talking about is happening) you won&#x27;t see a doubling of the population due to sustained fertility. So the shortages you see of water and other resources can be entirely attributed to inefficient resource allocation, and once capacity is increased to match population you won&#x27;t have to worry about it again and again.')
