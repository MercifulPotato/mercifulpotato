Is there a balance to be struck between the difficulty the apologizer will undoubtedly face from rage mobs and the consolation some members of the wronged group may feel from the apologizer acknowledging wrongdoing and committing to do better in the future? \nI don&#x27;t know that I could blame someone for avoiding a public apology, with the current nature of online harassment, but I think that&#x27;s a question anyone who finds themselves in such a position should at least ask themselves. And of course, if everyone also adhered to the &quot;What should I do when I see someone else is making a mistake?&quot; section, then the world would be perfect and conflicts would be much more easily resolved.')
