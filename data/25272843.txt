Item(by='busterarm', descendants=None, kids=[25273285], score=None, time=1606878582, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25272349, text='&gt; If you are working with AWS your application and your whole organization is at the whims of Amazon.<p>Part of freedom is the freedom to do stupid things.<p>&gt; You will not even be able to migrate if you are tied into those API&#x27;s and services because they are not same across cloud providers.<p>VPCs, Instances, Load Balancers and Storage are roughly-equivalent everywhere and the differences between are mostly-trivial. For the rest of the &quot;shinies&quot; they offer, well, see above.<p>&gt; You don&#x27;t even own the data or compute resource hosted on such cloud services because just by a single notice from a government agency your account will be blocked without access to your own data or compute resources.<p>If you think this doesn&#x27;t also apply to your physical racks in datacenters, you&#x27;ve got another thing coming.  Ask Lavabit.<p>Design for this in your strategy. You can still &quot;own&quot; your data and have it hosted in the cloud too. There&#x27;s no reason to have to be exclusive.<p>&gt; In terms of technical freedom you will have less of it and will be tied into proprietary extensions, API and services offered by those cloud providers.<p>As mentioned before, stick to running in instances and you&#x27;re no differently off than anywhere else you can operate.<p>&gt; On the other hand for self-hosted infrastructure government notice will not block access to resources owned by you and data in those resources. You can respond to notice and continue using those resources until court rules.<p>Absolutely not. With a warrant, the authorities will come and take your shit. They have guns. You don&#x27;t. Ask Lavabit. Ask The Pirate Bay. Ask any blockchain drug pusher.')
