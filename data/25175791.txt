At very high market rates, I don&#x27;t doubt tenancy lengths aren&#x27;t that long; everyone is looking for the next best deal.<p>But a dramatic drop in rent will result in someone locking in that rate and literally never leaving. Taking that apt off the market essentially forever.<p>I know a few people with rent controlled apartments in SF who have held them for decades so their rent is impossibly low. They&#x27;ll never leave. At least one hasn&#x27;t even lived in SF for many years now but the rent is so low it&#x27;s worth it to them to keep it as an occasional weekend crash pad even though they live elsewhere.')
