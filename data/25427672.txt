It’s not like California was a wasteland before ‘new comers’ arrived. ‘New comers’ have always been entering California.<p>The new comers came because California already had an ecosystem and infrastructure in place built ready made for them to thrive.<p>New comers are not subsidizing existing property owners. They ..and their children use the infrastructure already in place that is subsidized for them.<p>People with children older than 18 or with no kids have no use for public schools. Since property taxes are being used to fund public education, it’s essentially everyone subsidizing public education. For all. And this includes renters, undocumented immigrants, legal immigrants, those who pay taxes and those who don’t. Everyone. That’s what’s free public education means. For everyone in CA as public school fund budget is redistributed to all counties in California and not just the zip code it’s collected from...<p>Tweaking Prop 13 won’t miraculously get us better roads or infrastructure. Or affordable housing. It will only go to fix the gap of the unfunded pension liabilities of unionized teachers[1]. Wages account for 60-80% of school budgets.
