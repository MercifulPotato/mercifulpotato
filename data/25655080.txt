Try riding a bus from Bellevue to the International District on a game night before covid. There is simply not room for more people on the busses, nor is there room for more busses on the Third. Seattle needed this extra rail like 20 years ago.<p>But I think you are wrong about the focus here. They just opened the downtown tunnel recently, and they are opting to fix the West Seattle bridge even though they wonâ€™t be able to fit a train to it. They are also fixing the 520 bridge to Kirkland without a train line. And all the roro ferries have significantly more frequency then the walk on ferries (except for West Seattle). So cars definitely still weigh heavily for the city planners')
