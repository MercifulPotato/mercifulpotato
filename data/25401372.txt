It provides <i>zero</i> evidence (even anecdotal) that it has anything to do with &quot;Keystone&quot; specifically. It provides zero evidence for the idea that &quot;Keystone&quot; is able to &quot;nefariously hide itself from Activity Monitor&quot;. And it also completely contradicts the normal user experience of Chrome, which is that most people&#x27;s computers <i>don&#x27;t</i> slow down after a Chrome install. (WindowServer on my MBP usually uses &lt;10% CPU and I&#x27;ve used Chrome for many, many years.)<p>Why is this nonsense being upvoted? I get people dislike Google and Chrome, but wouldn&#x27;t it be better to stick to things backed by real evidence?')
