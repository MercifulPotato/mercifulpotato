Item(by='jd3', descendants=None, kids=[25754803, 25756006], score=None, time=1610487760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25753590, text='(not the OP of that site, but here are my 2Â¢)<p>I started really getting into computers and open source software around 2010&#x2F;2011 and cat-v (I was first introduced to golang through uriel pereira&#x27;s[0] proselytization) and suckless were both a pretty big inspiration to me at the time.<p>I used dwm&#x2F;st for years, but have since transitioned back to using ctwm&#x2F;xterm as I find them more approachable and easier to use&#x2F;extend. xterm may be &quot;bloated and unmaintainable&quot; according to the suckless community[1], but it has low latency, a pretty simple config, solid UTF-8 support, and is installed by default in most X11 environments that I use (I need to bounce around Windows&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;*bsd a lot).<p>Personally, I think the biggest problem is that there is definitely a bit of ego involved in these respective communities. When I tried participating back in ~2011, rather than realizing I was an impressionable high schooler&#x2F;teenage kid who could use a solid mentor to guide them through the fundamentals of X11&#x2F;C&#x2F;go&#x2F;etc, I was instead basically laughed out of the irc channel which led me to never participate in their community again and instead just learn&#x2F;work on projects on my own.<p>I am still aesthetically interested in a lot of the cat-v&#x2F;suckless software, but the politics&#x2F;drama&#x2F;exclusivity&#x2F;negativity of it all (particularly in the early 2010s) steered me away from ever really participating in their respective communities.<p>I am also less interested in tooling&#x2F;ui&#x2F;customization than I was back then, so I basically just tend to use whatever program gets the job done rather than obsessing over theory&#x2F;purity&#x2F;minimalism. I don&#x27;t have a problem with those who do care about these things (I am not trying to criticize suckless as they do do a lot of great work), it&#x27;s just no longer something I think about as much.<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uriel.cat-v.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uriel.cat-v.org&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;st.suckless.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;st.suckless.org&#x2F;</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.gettysburg.edu&#x2F;~duncjo01&#x2F;sites&#x2F;berlinblue&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.gettysburg.edu&#x2F;~duncjo01&#x2F;sites&#x2F;berlinblue&#x2F;</a>')
