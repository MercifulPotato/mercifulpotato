This is partially why they aren&#x27;t considered that useful in many contexts vs a fact table.<p>From memory this is because there is no natural binary encoding, you could use the int number of the member in the enum but then you would need to communicate the enum members to the client in some way. PostgreSQL network protocol currently doesn&#x27;t have such out of band information&#x2F;metadata support.')
