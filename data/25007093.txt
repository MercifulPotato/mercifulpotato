Are proficient with another germanic language \n2). Have lots of interaction with English even if they don&#x27;t speak it  (lots of folks read subtitles for English media)\n3). Have learned a non-germanic language and have an affinity for picking up on language\n4.) Have lots of time. \n5.) Their conversational skills are limited to a few shallow subjects, and much variance on these cause them to trip up. \n6.) You don&#x27;t see deficits (can they spell? How is their grammar outside of simple conversation? Can they read as well as speak?)<p>On the whole, no one should expect to have easy conversations in 60 days, regardless of language. These are always exceptions, and are most often small talk instead of including a wide variety of subjects: Simply talking about your own interests in any depth takes some dedication, but hearing about other&#x27;s interests takes more.<p>Years isn&#x27;t on the high end: I took classes. 15-18 hours a week, with a transition to speaking practice in a nursing home (while performing some basic CNA-type work). 2 years of classes. For me, this landed me technically intermediate, but it still didn&#x27;t take much to get out of my depth of knowledge. This is a pretty normal course. Some folks are faster, sure: But some are slower.')
