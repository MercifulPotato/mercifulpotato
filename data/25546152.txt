It&#x27;s so upsetting that the narrative has been so misplaced that most folk don&#x27;t even understand that it&#x27;s not the manufacturer that intentionally makes the device unusable, but the website operators, and those who support and advise such operators.  The biggest problem is that folks like Mozilla tell everyone to disable TLSv1.0, whilst themselves still supporting it; which shows the biggest case of hypocrisy there could ever be.<p>Are you aware of any groups working against such planned device obsolescence?  My biggest gripe right now is Wikipedia -- it&#x27;s beyond absurd that anonymous users can make changes to the contents of pretty much any of the millions of pages, but getting said pages over secure networks is conditional on TLSv1.2 support, limiting older devices from even read-only access to Wikipedia for absolutely no good reason.')
