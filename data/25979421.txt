Humans won&#x27;t have to type &quot;secret-token:&quot; but they will have to read it and it looks ugly :-)<p>I would probably have voted for &quot;secret:[..]&quot;.<p>But maybe ugly is good.<p>Secret tokens shouldn&#x27;t survive for long in source code or files you read, or .bash_history files, or your editor&#x27;s buffers.  They should be in secret config files that you don&#x27;t read often or even open in an editor.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s better that they are annoying to see, as a reminder to move them somewhere you don&#x27;t look at.')
