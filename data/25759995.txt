I mean, the same people who were &quot;chattering&quot; about the 6th have said in no uncertain terms that they WILL once again stage an armed protest (good luck to that) starting on the 16th and culminating on the 17th at the capitol and the capitols of each and every state. With the threat of violence not just between the lines, but as an explicit threat to anyone who doesn&#x27;t agree with their agenda and has the temerity to fight back. It&#x27;s full-on terrorist level manifesto stuff.<p>Should we hope the clock is still broken? Because I for one, am going to be watching from a safe distance away (not in person) and fearing for the lives of many people and our democracy on that day.')
