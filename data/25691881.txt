I mean even the union expert they interviewed for this article calls it &quot;groundbreaking&quot; in that it looks nothing like a union, since it has no economic goals or worker protections in mind and it&#x27;s all about social issues.<p>So it&#x27;s a charity that you donate 1% of your salary to, with the goal of impacting Google&#x27;s policies. That&#x27;s interesting in its own right, and it&#x27;s not out of the question that this could end up being a good use of donations from an effective altruism perspective depending on what they can accomplish. But this is not unionization in tech.')
