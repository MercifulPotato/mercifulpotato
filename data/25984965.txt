It&#x27;s not trying to do anything more than that.<p>Ideally the contrast wouldn&#x27;t be Bedrock _or_ NixOS, but rather NixOS alone or Bedrock with NixOS.  Bedrock&#x27;s goal of getting features from other distros includes distros like NixOS.  Sadly, there&#x27;s still R&amp;D work to be done there: while Bedrock supports a large number of distros, NixOS isn&#x27;t yet one of them.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know if I would enjoy crossing distro boundaries constantly just for a small handful of desired packages, and I&#x27;m not sure what other use cases this might have.<p>I think trying to find use cases other than getting features from multiple distros is driving you in the wrong direction for modelling Bedrock.  Most Linux users - quite likely including yourself - are happy with what one distro provides them.  Others, however, find it limiting.  Bedrock targets the latter group.  Try thinking of scenarios where a user has competing pressures for different distros:<p>- A user may require RHEL for work, but miss the large package selection offered by Debian.<p>- A user may like Void Linux&#x27;s init, but miss Arch&#x27;s AUR.<p>- A user may like Gentoo&#x27;s ability to customize packages, but only want to compile about half the system.<p>&gt; Does anybody have experience deploying Bedrock in production? What are some pros and cons?<p>You might be looking for these FAQ entries [0] [1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;faq.html#why-use-bedrock" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;faq.html#why-use-bedrock</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;faq.html#why-not-use-bedrock" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;faq.html#why-not-use-bedrock</a>')
