We both agree that there&#x27;s a split second where you realize something&#x27;s gone wrong but after that your training kicks in and you take your hands off the wheel&#x2F;push in the brake&#x2F;clutch. The spin itself doesn&#x27;t exactly happen instantaneously, but it feels like it&#x27;s over pretty quick. Once the car stops it can take a second or two to get your bearings, figure out which way the car is facing, etc.')
