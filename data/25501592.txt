Item(by='herbstein', descendants=None, kids=[25502343], score=None, time=1608597774, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25499013, text='&gt; If jaywalking was legal, the sacrifice is that we&#x27;d have to drive slower to watch for pedestrians<p>I&#x27;m not too well-versed on the various American speed limits. But I can tell you the Danish ones. Here there&#x27;s no concept of &quot;jaywalking&quot;. There&#x27;s simply &quot;crossing the street&quot;, and that&#x27;s functionally never illegal.<p>We drive 50 kph in cities, towns, and villages. That&#x27;s 31 mph. On wider roads that speed is 60 kph, or 37 mph. Those are still legal to cross as you please as a pedestrian.<p>Our normal country roads are driven at 80 kph, or 50 mph. These have a single lane in each direction and shared with pedestrians, bicycles, scooters, and every other road-going transportation method.<p>The next levels of road speeds (90 kph [55 mph], 110 kph [68 mph], and 130 kph [80 mph]) are only found on roads that don&#x27;t connect directly to anything used by pedestrians. Specifically, on two-lane expressways and motorways. These can only be used by cars and motorcycles.<p>As I said initially, I&#x27;m not too well versed in US speed limits, but it&#x27;s my understanding that these speeds at least match, if not are higher, than those. In other words, there is no inherent need to slow cars down in the US to make &quot;jaywalking&quot; legal.')
