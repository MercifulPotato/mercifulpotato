People have a shifting baseline of expectation around software that isn&#x27;t present in &quot;traditional&quot; tools.  The hammer you inherited from your grandfather still does what it did the day it was made, and so do ls and grep.  It absolutely does not hammer nails at 10000x the speed while talking to every new kind of hammer made around the world, but somehow software is expected to gain that ability without any additional effort.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a solution for this, I think tech consumers&#x2F;clients are just always going to want what they want and not care so much about what it takes to make it happen.  Thus they will always be surprised and grumble about the price.  That just seems like human nature to me.')
