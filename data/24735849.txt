Lots of exams, programs, etc. All written out by hand.<p>Now what&#x27;s nice about paper as a medium is you&#x27;re not restricted to just text you can mix in drawings and pretty much anything else to attack your thinking from different angles. You could do this on a computer, but it&#x27;s just so much slower to draw out diagrams and doesn&#x27;t have the same feeling.')
