While a nuisance for the repo owner, those commits could likely be undone and re-implemented.<p>That leaves it up to a handful of more active participants to take any action (likely DCMA related).<p>I would be shocked if anyone (other than with support from the FSF) takes actual legal action other than a cease and desist letter.<p>Even then, finding an interested prosecutor&#x2F;attorney is going to be a challenge. By some estimates only 1 in 100k software crimes are ever prosecuted and some guy who stole 100 commits by changing an open source license is not one of them.')
