I suspect I have celiac&#x27;s disease because anytime I consume gluten I have all of the unpleasant symptoms. I asked my GP whether I should get tested so that I could treat it and he said that if I&#x27;ve already solved it by removing gluten from my diet to just do that, because that&#x27;s all the testing is going to tell me anyway.<p>However, there is one condition under which I can eat bread et al: when I&#x27;ve been riding bikes all day. I&#x27;ve never been quite sure what to make of it, figuring it could just be because I&#x27;m more dehydrated than usual, or higher metabolic rate somehow allows me to absorb nutrients that I would have a harder time handling while sedentary. Now I&#x27;m wondering if being flooded with endorphins just prevents or masks the inflammation associated with celiac&#x27;s.<p>I wish there was more treatment available than a strict GF diet, because I really love all things stretchy and glutenous.')
