The code is never going to change, because it&#x27;s a polyfill for old browsers, and only needed for legacy environments that won&#x27;t change. So if the tests pass once, they&#x27;ll pass forever. There is literally no point in adding those tests to my test suite - there is no combination of changes that will ever make this fail if it passes once.')
