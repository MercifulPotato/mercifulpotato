This entire article boils down to someone discovering they wish the entire internet was Twitter and YouTube because then people with the same ideology as him would control everything.<p>Well, the web (which is already decentralised) isn&#x27;t like that.<p>Ironically, his blog is not hosted by these social media firms he praises so effusively. It&#x27;s self-hosted on OVH and uses a privacy guard on WhoIs data. Apparently he wants to benefit from the web&#x27;s decentralisation whilst preaching against it. This type of hypocrisy seems very common amongst those who rail against imaginary dog-whistle enemies like &quot;Nazis&quot; (of whom there are virtually none in today&#x27;s world).')
