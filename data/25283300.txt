It&#x27;s an issue of corporate accountability.<p>You had corners cut to deliver a product that ended up killing people. There is no real room for doubt in that just from the material we have available.<p>So, what? What happens? What <i>should</i> happen? Everything go back to &quot;normal&quot;? Let the same people who ran things continue to profit off their wrongdoing? Accept that as long as you&#x27;re one of only two rides in town that you have the security to deliver and recover from delivering a lethal product?<p>That&#x27;s the issue. That&#x27;s the reality we&#x27;re taking out of this. It isn&#x27;t even self-regulating anymore. There is no bankruptcy, no hammer, no reallocation of assets to those that can wield them more responsibly, no reset. Just a token gesture. The same Goliath just shrugs and moves on.<p>While I get that might be tenable or desirable to some, I&#x27;m not one of them. Realistic risk of falling flat on your face, being held to account, and not being able to just shrug it off and keep going keeps you honest.<p>Once you lose that, &quot;What&#x27;s a life here and there? Doesn&#x27;t bother me. Can&#x27;t make an onelette without cracking a few eggs.&quot;<p>The economy is not an omelette, and people are not eggs. Either we serve it, or it serves us. I know which side of that assertion I&#x27;m on.')
