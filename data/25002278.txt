I&#x27;d wager most people that are using IntelliJ (or any IDE) also don&#x27;t often have much of a choice in libraries they&#x27;re using.<p>IDEs never seemed to appeal to me when I was writing 100% of my own code.  When I migrated to using more and more OPC (other peoples&#x27; code), whether project legacy stuff, or third party libraries, the ability to more quickly scan&#x2F;jump&#x2F;drill into that OPC, the more value I realized from various IDEs.  Mostly JetBrains these days (interested in pairing with folks with their newish &#x27;code with me&#x27; plugin&#x2F;service), but vscode and eclipse make their way in to my life for small periods now and then.')
