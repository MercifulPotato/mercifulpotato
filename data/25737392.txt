It is a dishonest and misleading definition.<p>There are several mechanisms of trust that exist, authorities are just one of them. Reputation is another, so are proofs, and so is consensus (which is the most interesting one for the case at hand). Blockchains are essentially &quot;Paxos, but for a massive peer count, and with some mechanisms that allow it to operate in an adversarial networks&quot;, but it is fundamentally still just a consensus algorithm (in Bitcoin&#x27;s case, one where people &quot;agree&quot; that John Doe has X amount of money).<p>Shifting to P2P essentially just means that:<p>- You will trust a bunch of random people instead of a centralized authority;<p>- You will trust that these random people don&#x27;t have enough &quot;power&quot; to subvert the protocol;<p>- In this context &quot;power&quot; refers to computational power in the case of PoW and Sybil Attacks, or access to backdoors;<p>- You will trust that the protocol is sound, as well as the implementation of it;<p>There&#x27;s plenty of trust going around in there, claiming to &quot;do away with trust&quot; is dishonest at best, and fraudulent at worst. To add insult to injury: PoW based peer networks that haven&#x27;t achieved significant scale can likely be trivially overtaken by an adversarial actors, and making a system P2P tends to open it up to all kinds of forensic network analysis.<p>---<p>For the long version of the argument I&#x27;d recommend this post from Bruce Schneier:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;blockchain_and_.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;blockchain_an...</a><p>&gt; Most blockchain enthusiasts have a unnaturally narrow definition of trust. They’re fond of catchphrases like “in code we trust,” “in math we trust,” and “in crypto we trust.” This is trust as verification. But verification isn’t the same as trust.<p>&gt; What blockchain does is shift some of the trust in people and institutions to trust in technology. You need to trust the cryptography, the protocols, the software, the computers and the network. And you need to trust them absolutely, because they’re often single points of failure.')
