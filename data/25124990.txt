If Microsoft team up with another ARM vendor and make similarly closed-off, proprietary glue sandwiches as a response, where does that leave Linux? I doubt PC-compatible, x86 laptops are going to disappear off the face of the Earth anytime soon, but... if there&#x27;s basically two types of machines, and ours have worse performance and half the battery life at twice the thickness (plus a fan, as a free bonus), a Linux machine is a tough sell to someone who hasn&#x27;t already bought in. For the Linux workstation experience to keep up, we need more people coming in, and if new people can&#x27;t dip their toes on hardware they already own, that raises the bar significantly.')
