Even a perceived threat is a threat. It&#x27;s as if talking about taxation is a form of <i>lese majeste.</i><p>There&#x27;s something I noticed some time ago, brought into relief by the COVID crisis: We can apparently talk about any means of dealing with the crisis <i>except</i> dipping into private wealth. When it comes to paying for the crisis, working people can choose to pay for it with their livelihoods or their lives.<p>We can apparently ask people to sacrifice their <i>lives</i> for the sake of &quot;the economy,&quot; but suggesting that people sacrifice their <i>wealth</i> is seen as too absurd or reckless to even consider.')
