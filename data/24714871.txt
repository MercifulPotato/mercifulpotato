I&#x27;ve learned several. In my current job I&#x27;m exposed to a lot of Russian. I can read Cyrillic and recognize parts of conversations. It&#x27;s frustrating not to be able to fill in the gaps to understand fully, but I just don&#x27;t have the time because of my job. Plus if I did try to switch over, it would leave out other people who only speak English, which is a consideration in group environments.<p>As a consolation I switched my phone to Russian. :)')
