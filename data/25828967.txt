We&#x27;re talking about a bunch of delusional LARPers. If some foreign intelligence unit tries and fails to overthrow your country&#x27;s government, that&#x27;s insurrection. If it&#x27;s the doofus who stole the podium or the guy with face paint and a horned fur hat, not so much.<p>What are you basing the obviousness of the failure on?  The mob was seemingly a few dozen feet away from numerous politicians with the only thigs between them being a barricaded door and seemingly less than a half dozen security people.<p>&gt;There were murderers and arsonists at BLM riots as well; that doesn&#x27;t impugn the legitimate protesters. Similarly, these few actual insurrectionists don&#x27;t make the MAGA trespassers, rioters, even murderers into insurrectionists.<p>How many murders were committed by the millions of BLM protester in the dozens of cities they protested in over the months they protested?  Because these thousands of people in DC were able to murder one and get multiple of their own killed?  The violence rate of the two isn&#x27;t comparable.<p>&gt;There is a danger to our democracy in that a sitting president undermining democracy by spreading lies about election fraud. More generally, the media and tech companies are deliberately cultivating division and mistrust among the American people. These are real, credible dangers to democracy. The MAGA LARPers were not a credible threat to our democracy.<p>What happened on 1&#x2F;6 was a direct result of those first two.  This is part of the danger to democracy manifesting itself.')
