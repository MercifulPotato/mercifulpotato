Specifically portion controlled so that drug does not destroy person&#x27;s life. I have experimented meth and many other drugs. Mind that if you haven&#x27;t done meth and you try to compare it to some other drug like alcohol then you are just ignorant. I have to say that it&#x27;s easy to get lost in meth and a lot of people don&#x27;t have mental will(or maybe capacity) to get out of the drug and hence I have to say that this type of thing does need to be controlled in some manner.')
