Egress heavy components are on Cloudflare, Scaleway, and Digital Ocean.<p>&gt; <i>...did you build your software with this in mind?</i><p>Yep, we designed the system keeping egress costs in-mind, and that meant some of things were a bit more time-consuming (build vs buy) than they normally would have been.<p>That said, we aren&#x27;t what you&#x27;d call an uber sophisticated  upstart using cutting edge tech. Right now, whatever systems we have are all mostly boringly simple and probably won&#x27;t scale.')
