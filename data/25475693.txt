The further optimization of MacOS to leverage all that helps as well.<p>AMD already has a lot of experience with high-speed interconnects. They already have a lot of experience with APUs. I wonder if it&#x27;d be possible for Microsoft and AMD to enter some sort of partnership whereby the optimize Windows in the same way MacOS has been optimized.<p>I really fucking hate Apple. I hate their walled garden approach. I hate their &quot;trendiness&quot;. So I have a small bit of self-loathing that I own the base model new Mac Mini, but I can&#x27;t allow my seething hatred for the company to cloud my judgment when it comes to using the fastest and most productive platform for my work, and, I&#x27;m sorry to say, this little $699 machine outperforms my Ryzen 9 3900X w&#x2F; 32 GB of RAM and an RX 5700XT for most tasks. I still game on this machine, but most productivity work has been relegated to the Mac Mini now.<p>Learning MacOS has been frustrating, but also kinda fun.')
