Then you can&#x27;t use them to sign up on some sites.<p>Still, it mostly works. I&#x27;ve got 383 aliases, plus 93 disabled aliases.<p>Most email providers will let you create aliases, but aliases are an upsell for business plans. Tutanota lets you get more aliases, but they charge you, not kidding, 5 euros a month for 100 aliases. 10 GB of extra storage costs 2.5 euros.<p>Some of them advertise using address+alias@domain, but that&#x27;s basically useless.<p>Fastmail is pretty decent with 600 aliases. That&#x27;s a definite maybe.<p>The only one I&#x27;ve found with unlimited aliases is TheXYZ, and they&#x27;ve been around a while.')
