And that war includes viruses, which do a lot of altering at the fundamental genetic level. You could call it balance - I&#x27;d call it stalemate. And of course we don&#x27;t understand the consequences- thats the point of the research. Ideally its done in a controlled, ethical way. And questions are raised. But the point of the research is to understand the connections and the consequences, and the only way we do that is by experimenting which involves making low level changes and observing the results. And as we understand these consequences, were able to apply our new knowledge to practical purposes like treating disease. Not understanding is the <i>reason</i> that research matters - the point is to find out.')
