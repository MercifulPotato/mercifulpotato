Our purpose is to make programming relevant to children of all backgrounds. We&#x27;re currently in the prototyping and research phase for our first product: a novel, interactive learning environment for programming, rooted in functional programming principles, with a particular focus on structure editing and the visualization of program execution.<p>We&#x27;re currently hiring for 2 full time roles. These roles are on-site in London, though we&#x27;re indefinitely in work-from-home mode due to the COVID-19 pandemic. You must be eligible to work in the UK, as unfortunately, we can&#x27;t sponsor visas to work in the UK at this time.<p>* UX designer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hackworthltd.uk&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;20200901&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hackworthltd.uk&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;20200901&#x2F;</a><p>* Front-end web developer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hackworthltd.uk&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;20201001&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hackworthltd.uk&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;20201001&#x2F;</a><p>We hope to hear from you!
