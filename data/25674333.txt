Anonymity was always a choice and we can’t go back to pretending it was... unless we go all China on the internet?<p>The response to crazy fringes  minorities by authoritarian governments has almost always been many times worse than the small fringe groups doing stupid dangerous stuff. This lesson after 9&#x2F;11 in Iraq and what we’ve seen in many other authoritarian governments has been downright counterproductive and equally worse.<p>It was always naive and overrated thinking banning hate groups or extremists on Facebook and Reddit was sufficient to make them go away. That was already the default before Trump, lets not forget.<p>And we’ve already gone way further than just banning legitimate hate groups to banning even more stuff so everything is moderated and politically appropriate by some unelected representatives, with no recourse, as many tech companies have tried. Mostly just flailing about. And has only fueled distrust in media companies and authority systems we used to look to.<p>Hate Inc talks about <i>general outrage</i> being the danger, not specific politically acceptable outrage. Which is something that is quite obvious to anyone non-partisan watching.')
