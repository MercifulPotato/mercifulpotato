The decision should still lie with the user. Bypassing firewalls by privileging some traffic is not okay.<p>Looks like for now, the only real option is an external device you always connect through running pfsense or another firewall, which is not too big a deal for use on a home network, but requires carrying around another device when on other networks.')
