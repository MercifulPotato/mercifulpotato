The reason I&#x27;ve spent the last year and a half developing an open source solution to support Apple devices is because it is a challenge and is profitable. I view myself as a sort of technological mercenary. I go where my skills are needed.<p>I don&#x27;t own a personal mac laptop, nor do I use an iPhone. If Apple gave me a macbook pro and an iPhone I wouldn&#x27;t use either. ( other than to develop software that requires those )<p>I do though believe in making required technical things easier for others. It is a good feeling making something possible with IOS devices that hasn&#x27;t been done as open source previously.<p>Creating and testing IOS apps isn&#x27;t something that will cease to be just because hardcore developers dislike the closed Apple ecosystem. The people who fund Apple, in my opinion, aren&#x27;t hardcore geeks. They are the normal folk in the world.<p>My only request to Apple is to please listen to what the developers want and provide some of the information I need so that I can in turn improve the development experience for the developers that are already paying into their ecosystem.<p>Sitting on your high horse saying &quot;I don&#x27;t like the way big companies function&quot; doesn&#x27;t pay the bills or convince anyone you are a good engineer who will stay professional regardless of your personal feelings.')
