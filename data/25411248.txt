They&#x27;re obviously thinking of their existing language (we know from the GC comment) and not of whatever point the OP is trying to make about composability or whatever.<p>To some degree, examples are to blame. They often aren&#x27;t good and don&#x27;t show, to the actual audience, what the author intended. In my FP example, you need something that can&#x27;t get stuck in a syntax-level debate and is complex enough for the benefits to show through. Like doing something that would take a 50-level deep stack of for loops in an unnested fashion.<p>It gives you more respect for great teachers who can pull examples out of the air that both illustrate and refuse to misdirect.<p>Can you (because I certainly can&#x27;t) write a good post or blog about the minimum useful deep learning project that can&#x27;t be done equivalently via any other methods?')
