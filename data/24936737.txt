And then the matter of legal responsibility <i>was</i> brought up; one person even posed the question, &quot;Does the project owe its contributors anything?&quot;, and gave a direct and unequivocal response: &quot;Legally, no.&quot;  (Side note: that person was you.)  And to say that is to say something that is simply not trueâ€”as untrue as any statement now about my being confused about whether legal responsibility was being discussed.<p>You can&#x27;t rewrite history.
