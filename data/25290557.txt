Just the fact that there&#x27;s SOME base of exponentiation such that cos is the even component of exponentiation with this base and i * sin is the odd component of exponentiation with this base is enough for all these trig laws.<p>Incidentally, we can derive [cos(x)]^2 + [sin(x)]^2 = 1 from the fact that cos and i * sin are even and odd components of exponentiation with some base, like so: 1 = exp(ix) * exp(-ix) = (cos(x) + i * sin(x)) * (cos(x) - i * sin(x)) = [cos(x)]^2 + [sin(x)]^2.')
