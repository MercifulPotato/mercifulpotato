Even when it seemed as if &quot;midi-payments&quot; might be getting some traction in music and apps, they&#x27;ve now mostly turned into either subscriptions, ad-supported, or &quot;free to play.&quot; And arguably a bunch of midi-subscriptions (e.g. $1&#x2F;month) is even worse because enough of those and they add up to a real money leak. For subscriptions, I&#x27;d much rather have a $5-15&#x2F;month that is a sufficient line item that I&#x27;ll spend the time to consider whether I really want this or not.')
