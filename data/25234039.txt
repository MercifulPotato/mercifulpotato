When I set back to 100% DPI than strange lines doesn&#x27;t show. But I want to keep 125% DPI and the point is that Dr Racket should respect that.\nBut, Dr Racket is the only program that display strange artifacts on 125% DPI. Neither VS Code nor Sublime nor Notepad++ do that. As I already mentioned, I reported this bug many times during past few years to the Racket group, but the damn lines are still there, and that made the editor totally unusable. What should I say? Strange community, they don&#x27;t care for this serious bug, they are preocupied with the wrong stuff of &quot;speeding&quot; the language with Chez Scheme. The result is crappy, unusable tool and angry users.')
