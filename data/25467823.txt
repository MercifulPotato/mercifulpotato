I&#x27;ve always been one to fill the gaps on the team. You need someone to learn this new tech&#x2F;process&#x2F;etc - sure, I&#x27;ll do it. It&#x27;s hurt my career.  Now I&#x27;m 9 years in and I&#x27;m not an expert in anything (anything that matters - they outsourced the tech&#x2F;system I was an expert at), just average&#x2F;passable at a bunch of stuff. I&#x27;ll be an intermediate developer permanently.')
