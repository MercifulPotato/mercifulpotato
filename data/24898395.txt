The whole point of the character is to see what it takes for some Americans to stop and say “are you kidding me?”<p>Our own political correctness keeps people from asking if he’s a joke - instead “kindly” following along into the madness. The racism comes from the average persons ability to believe the he is a real person - a crazy foreigner - rather than a parody. Taking him seriously requires that you believe people like him exists. People who absolutely would have never looked Kazakhstan up to see if it actually existed or not. Borat is a projection of racism in order to mock the worldview of Americans - and it works fantastically. The fact that he mostly focuses on otherwise kind&#x2F;quiet people “going along with it” is the entire message.')
