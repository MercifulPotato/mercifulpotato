In IT this often translates, for managers, to LoC, # of files touched, # of commits and tasks closed. Especially the first one is ofcourse a horrible metric but still quite prevalent IME. # of commits depends on the person; I commit <i>a lot</i>; I think because I remember too much lost work in the past, not because someone is counting commits (it would be silly). I see clearly in some cultures of partners we work with that people are deemed ‘extremely good’ if some combination of LoC x #files x commits x #tasks x timespan is as high as possible, even if the end result is far far worse than the people who have a far lower rate. Also in those cultures there are more design patterns in use; with some design patterns from OO in java&#x2F;c# (which now creeped in Typescript at those places too) you change code in 10+ files and have to write 100s of lines of plumbing even for basic things; this really helps with getting the metrics up; it is copy&#x2F;paste&#x2F;change (so fast) while ‘delivering a lot’.<p>I always sigh when I hear ‘mate, you only committed X lines and you ask $xxxx for that?’; yes and yes because they are the same lines as your ‘star programmer’ (the working to the above metrics) would distill after making far more hours because wanting to look more productive. Luckily I am just a consultant as I would not survive in those places.')
