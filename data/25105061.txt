Eg &quot;conspiracy to commit murder&quot; (or election fraud or something, more topically) doesn&#x27;t require secrecy at all (except in order to be <i>successful</i>, maybe) while &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; (when it&#x27;s not being abused to the point of meaninglessness to dismiss legitimate accusations) is specifically based on the implausability of many thousands of people not just keeping a secret, but concealing any evidence that there even <i>is</i> a secret.<p>Plenty of things are conspiracies in the &quot;conspiracy to commit murder&quot; sense, without being conspiracies in the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; sense.')
