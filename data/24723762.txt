A goal should be to find a healthy &quot;medium&quot; where &quot;Surveillance FOIA 2.0&quot; still allows for transparency&#x2F;oversight&#x2F;review without hobbling the process, and FOIA was just one example of an existing transparency tool to model from, it&#x27;s not the only tool&#x2F;model it was the first example to mind, but you would hopefully expand to a larger suite of transparency&#x2F;sousveillance (&quot;watch the watchers&quot;) tools.<p>I&#x27;m also not claiming that we shouldn&#x27;t fight surveillance attempts, simply that where surveillance seems inevitable&#x2F;a foregone conclusion&#x2F;rough to fight that we also need to devote resources to fighting for increased sousveillance&#x2F;transparency, because power will always abuse surveillance.')
