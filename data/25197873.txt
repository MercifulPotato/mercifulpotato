The media did not &quot;ignore the case&quot;, sorry. There are plenty of articles about Epstein and Maxwell, and Prince Andrew didn&#x27;t get away either.<p>But that&#x27;s about it, isn&#x27;t it? Everyone else who hung out with them just has to say &quot;whoops, I totally didn&#x27;t know about their pedo side&quot;, and that&#x27;s the end of the story. Which is amazing when even low-level socialites like Ellen Pao were apparently aware of Maxwell&#x27;s side business. Where was the pressure from journalists on law enforcement, and from law enforcement on those involved? Too late now anyway, I guess?<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, my own pessimism is mostly based on the disastrous Dutroux case over here in Europe. If 27 witnesses can get killed over what is presumably a much lower-profile pedophile ring, then what chance do we have to ever know about the depth of Epstein&#x27;s connections, or even just his death? (I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong!)<p>I&#x27;m not saying that this validates any particular conspiracy theory (I agree with [1]), but that it highlighted an immense imbalance of power and transparency between the 0.001% and the rest of us. Epstein was a comic-book villain walking free. I believe that if the media can make it clear that they&#x27;re fighting _for us_, people won&#x27;t look to QAnon for salvation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;does-the-jeffrey-epstein-indictment-qanon.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;does-the-jeffrey-eps...</a>')
