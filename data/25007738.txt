No amount of money or learning Finnish can address that. Oh and there&#x27;s yet another downside to an ethnically homogenous society like Finland - you&#x27;ll never be more than a tolerated person if you are a visible minority. Someone who&#x27;s visibly different will never be a fully equal member of society.<p>Personally, this is why i much prefer life in the US or Canada despite all their downsides.')
