So I can&#x27;t tell you that you&#x27;re wrong or the definition you&#x27;re using is untrue.<p>It&#x27;s not obvious to me that a definition of &quot;politics&quot; which groups together party politics, funding startups, and screaming kids coming home from soccer practice provides much useful insight into the world. At best, it&#x27;s an imprecise statement of the same sentiment as &quot;everything is physics&quot;, that party politics has a large influence on how the world looks. At worst, and I&#x27;ve seen it used quite frequently in this way, it&#x27;s a sleight of hand maneuver used to slip party politics into contexts where it&#x27;d otherwise be excluded.')
