At 40 hours per week (which many jobs won’t reliably get), that’s ~$824&#x2F;month BEFORE taxes, food, and so on. Even in the rural south where I used to live, where the cost of living is very low, many one person apartments would be $400–$500&#x2F;month. That leaves maybe $400 for everything else BEFORE taxes on a GOOD month. Combine this with the fact that employers aren’t required to, and pretty much never do, provide medical benefits to this sort of employee.<p>Maybe you can squeak by if you’re lucky… but you have to be <i>consistently</i> lucky. One bad month and the whole thing can fall apart. It’s basically impossible to build wealth or savings in this situation (not to mention care for your own fucking health).')
