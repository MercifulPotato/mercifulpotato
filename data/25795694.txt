Rarely do you get to pick a union to join when you work at a company; if the company workers are represented, it is often exclusively by a single union.<p>The result is that unions have the exact same leverage over employees as the companies themselves do, and do not often have sufficient accountability. It is not as simple as voting a union out once it has gotten in, and it takes on a life of its own.<p>Also, stories like SEIU collaborating with the DFL in Minnesota to get family members of disabled adults declared &quot;in home caretaker employees&quot; of the state so that the union gets a cut of the disability benefits is terrible. There are surely good things that unions can do, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they are an intrinsic good, or that they are appropriately structured in the US.<p>Edit: reference: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecentersquare.com&#x2F;minnesota&#x2F;after-trump-rule-change-minnesota-home-care-workers-can-decide-for-themselves-whether-to-pay&#x2F;article_04803098-701b-11e9-9087-a3bc73e9c907.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecentersquare.com&#x2F;minnesota&#x2F;after-trump-rule-c...</a>')
