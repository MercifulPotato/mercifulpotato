If the closest properties where sold at X$&#x2F; acre that’s a solid suggestion of the actual value of that land.<p>The goal is essentially to separate the value of land based on local infrastructure like subway systems from the amount of effort put into improving the property.  An empty lot that’s worth 10,000$ per acre may physically look the same as an empty lot worth 10,000,000$ per acre, but it’s clear society not the property owner generated that value is.<p>That said, there are a lot of edge cases like beach front property vs having another house in front.')
