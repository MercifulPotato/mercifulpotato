My day-to-day tends to get bogged down in meetings, navigating tech debt, researching stuff we&#x27;re not ready for yet but planning on doing sometime in the future, and talking about business goals and career moves. I just want to spend most of my time (I repeat, MOST, no job is perfect) writing chunks of Node&#x2F;React code, testing them, and watching them work. Was I naive in hoping for this idealized version of software development? Can anyone recommend an organization that lives up to this ideal?')
