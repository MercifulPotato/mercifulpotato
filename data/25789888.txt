Windows is not Unix and it uses PATH variable too. On most Linux distros you can simply run the equivalent to `sudo apt-get install nodejs` (or use a graphical front-end, if that&#x27;s too hard for you) and everything will just work.<p>Just as an aside, GUI installers are an absolute cancer. I don&#x27;t mind if there is an option to do that, but I just wish I could make a simple script for installing all the necessary programs on Windows, just like I can on Linux. But no, I have to spend two days doing nothing but manually clicking through the installers, because that&#x27;s fun.')
