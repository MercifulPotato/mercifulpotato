It&#x27;s like general relativity, left vs right only exist in relation to something else.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;forces people to recognize the extreme rightward shift in politics&quot;</i><p>This is just strange. Politics change all the time in every dimension, just like people&#x27;s values and opinions. Clinton was a Democrat who wanted strong borders and now the modern left wants open borders. Isn&#x27;t that a shift to the left?<p>Everyone is aware that politics change over time. Nobody needs to recognize anything other than the policies and parties they identify with and want to have. If you can&#x27;t discuss the policies and must use a party definition from decades ago then I don&#x27;t see how this is anything but &quot;painting [yourselves] as victims&quot;.')
