If I want to know the VAT of a price I just divide by 5 (the price is 125% of the untaxed price so I need to divide by 5 to determine how much 25% is). By law you always have to provide the price including VAT to consumers so people are aware of the actual cost.<p>This VAT has not changed for a very long time but if it were to increase (perhaps for good reasons) there would be an outrage. This tax is not being increased without people noticing.<p>On the other hand decreasing VAT is also not going to happen (even if it might be beneficial). A single point decrease would create a huge budget deficit that would be really hard to cover by other means.')
