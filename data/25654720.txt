This would track project information, dates, monies, contacts, and so on, and gradually we can add service providers and other members of the industry to create accounts and build workflows, micro tools and tech enabled services to create a sticky ecosystem which makes day-to-day functioning of the industry, which is currently run a bit ad-hoc, more streamlined, organised and systemised.<p>With the help of a technical advisor friend and an intern, I have managed to get built an influencer search engine as that’s what developed traction over covid, however, now that the industry is getting back to its feet, we’re expanding to allow for submissions of talent enquiries across other talent types as well (actors &amp; models).<p>Please write to me at raaghavvchanana@starcast.com, and we can schedule a time to zoom.')
