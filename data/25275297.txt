The Phase 3 trials are efficacy trials to show that the vaccine gives immunity. Certainly we learned more about the safety of the vaccines from Phase 3 data, but we already knew that adverse immediate reactions would be very rare.<p>What&#x27;s ridiculous about this situation is that the regulatory authorities are not willing to weigh against the benefit which would come from an early emergency-use authorization (which could have happened as early as August). It&#x27;s like CPU branch prediction: approve the vaccine for early distribution as fast as it can be made--which would only have been a few hundred million doses globally so far--while the phase 3 studies are going on. The early distribution would be watched as observational studies, of course. If it fails Phase 3, stop distribution and move on to the next vaccine.<p>If the vaccine works, this strategy would have directly saved tens or hundreds of thousands of lives, and potentially millions from getting sick and whatever long-term complications come from COVID-19. Indirectly, early vaccination of essential workers would work to decrease R0 and therefore cause fewer people to get sick through normal means.<p>If the vaccine doesn&#x27;t work, there isn&#x27;t much money wasted since the manufacturing is already being done pre-approval anyway.<p>In the worst case if the vaccine primes and adverse immune reaction, that is bad and an argument against early approval. However you have to weigh the added risk (that early vaccinated people have a higher CFR) vs the probability of that happening, which is low.<p>High likelihood of highly beneficial outcome if it works. Lower possibility of a relatively moderate bad outcome to a smaller population if it doesn&#x27;t. Certainty of many added deaths if you wait. I don&#x27;t have the data the regulators have that is necessary to quantify this and make the call.<p>But for dumb political reasons, this option is off the table. Only Russia and China went ahead with early vaccination; all the other national agencies decided not to even think about early distribution. It was not even an option on the table.')
