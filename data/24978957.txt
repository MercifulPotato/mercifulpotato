Are self-employed people really busy setting up as a business in Estonia or lobbying their national representatives?<p>If you&#x27;re taxed on your profits, it&#x27;s always better to double your profits than to avoid tax on your current profits.<p>This tax avoidance strategy only becomes important where there are no other efficiencies remaining to find: or, when you don&#x27;t have other competitors to worry about.<p>It&#x27;s a monopolist strategy.
