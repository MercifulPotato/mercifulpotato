Those things are low impact if they don&#x27;t work properly, and they do stop working with alarming regularity. I have spent less than Â£80 on the set up.<p>The Home mini has trouble with my regional British accent. The Chromecasts are within 2m of my router, and still manage to get disconnected randomly.<p>I&#x27;m not anti-smart home, but the stuff has to be 99.9% reliable for me to consider going forward with it. I&#x27;ve never had a light switch fail on me...')
