ZFS is very flexible, and can serve a variety of workloads. It also assumes you know what you&#x27;re doing, and the tradeoffs are not always apparent up-front.<p>If you want to become comfortable-enough with ZFS to make your own choices, I recommend standing up your ZFS box well before you need it, and <i>play with it</i>. Set up configs you&#x27;d never use in production, just to see what happens. Yank a disk, figure out how to recover. If you have time, fill it up with garbage and look for yourself how fragmentation effects resilver times.  If you&#x27;re a serious user, join the mailing lists - it is high-signal.<p>And value random articles on the interwebs telling you the Real Way at what they cost you.<p>I&#x27;m convinced articles like this are a big part of what gives ZFS a bad name. People follow authoritative-sounding bad advice and blame their results on the file system.')
