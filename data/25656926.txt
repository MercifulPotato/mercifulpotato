There&#x27;s not much extra surveillance fruit in them knowing where you are when you get a vaccine that is going to be given to a third of the population anyway.<p>If you&#x27;re a user of their apps, Uber and Lyft have already been trusted with your payment information, name, address, work address, home address, friends&#x27; addresses, weekend destinations, mobile phone location data, etc.<p>I guess this is what I mean: there&#x27;s a huge additional burden that results from the gut reaction to treat all government-endorsed information sharing as a nonstarter. I could put some freezers in a van and spend the day driving nurses from house to house, vaccinating the citizenry, but all these perfect-world objections force the plan back into its hole instead of getting the job done.')
