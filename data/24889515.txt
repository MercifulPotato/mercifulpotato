By that I mean that the results would be accepted as equally valid for people, non-human animals, and machines.<p>If DeepMind developed a system that could ace Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices questions, I don&#x27;t think that we would say &quot;machines are now as smart as human geniuses.&quot; Turing&#x27;s Imitation Game still seems like a valid challenge to me but is perhaps <i>too</i> stringent. Someone who is not literate in English would fail to convince the questioner even if otherwise intelligent.<p>&quot;General&quot; human intelligence appears to have a very complicated and particular shape. If there is such a thing as universal intelligence (in the sense that there are universal constants), the boundaries of human intelligence in this space look like a gerrymandered voting district more than a symmetrical geometric object.')
