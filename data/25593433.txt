Item(by='Hedja', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609428130, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25586781, text='HTTPS ensures the data isn&#x27;t tampered during transport, but it doesn&#x27;t ensure the integrity of the data itself. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s things like Subresource Integrity (which doesn&#x27;t apply to top-level resources like HTML).<p>However, there&#x27;s no way to ensure the files we download are created by who they say they are. A domain for example can change hands and existing links say on HN can be loaded with unexpected, potentially malicious, content. Same for hacked servers.<p>IMO we need some form standard page signing to enforce actual integrity of information, not just transport. I made a proof-of-concept Web Extension to show how that might be possible using PGP [1]. Of course PGP has its own issues but it&#x27;s just an experiment.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webverify.jahed.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webverify.jahed.dev&#x2F;</a>')
