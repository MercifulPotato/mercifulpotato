Item(by='Sargos', descendants=None, kids=[25265387, 25265156], score=None, time=1606830320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25264980, text='BTC (2%) and ETH (4.5%) are both inflationary right now and have never been deflationary. BTC will be inflationary until about 100 years from now. ETH is a bit more complex but in about a year when it switches from proof of work to proof of stake the inflation will drop to &lt;1%. When EIP-1559 is implemented next year then most of the transaction fees are burned which will likely drop the inflation rate into the negatives which will turn Ethereum into a deflationary asset.')
