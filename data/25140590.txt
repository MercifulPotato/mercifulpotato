I&#x27;ve read every review I can find, seen the benchmarking runs, and -- in light of the fact that my new device won&#x27;t ship until mid December -- I could still cancel&#x2F;return my order, buy an M1-powered MBP13, and save some cash.<p>That is to say, I have skin in the game.<p>Say what you will about my igneous domicile, but buying a new-to-market processor architecture is not something that I am willing to do just because some guy at The Verge or Tom&#x27;s Hardware or AnandTech made some bar graphs or felt it necessary to treat hype as fact. I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re dishonest or anything, just that the information is thin because the typical user isn&#x27;t an instance of Geekbench.<p>My advice to them: Use the device for a couple of weeks, install all of your work software on it, put it through its paces, and then tell me about what you observed. That&#x27;s the kind of review that would satisfy my curiosity. I do a lot of financial stuff on my machine, and the software (or software-based services) in that world is often proprietary, poorly developed, and&#x2F;or expensive. Compatibility and performance of those programs are more important to me than battery life while browsing YouTube or render time in Final Cut Pro.')
