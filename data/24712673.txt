But they might have to upgrade their software, insist that their vendors implement standards correctly, or maybe change the way they do some things.  As you point out, these companies make more money than anyone else.  That means change shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for them.  But of course they would prefer to externalize their costs onto less-resourced companies and individuals.  It&#x27;s everyone else&#x27;s job to make sure they can&#x27;t get away with that.')
