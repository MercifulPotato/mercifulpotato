If someone wrote a sort algorithm in a normal job I would expect that not to be used and a library to be used. This is also knowledge that people who studied and aced their tests in Uni forget, because no one in their right mind writes a quicksort.</i><p>Typically these questions are asked to entry-level software engineers and not ones with some experience.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t believe asking people to write quicksort provides any signal but I was arguing that there isn&#x27;t any difference between asking a candidate to write a &quot;basic sort&quot; vs &quot;quick sort&quot; in an interview.<p>I also mentioned this is not a good question to ask if all you are hiring for is some MEAN stack app - but is an appropriate question if you do any development where some optimization is required.<p>&gt; <i>People actually sign contracts like that on a daily basis. That is literally what you sign up for. Here is the actual process: CV screening -&gt; Tech Test -&gt; Phone Screening -&gt; Interview -&gt; Trial or &quot;probation&quot;.</i><p>Yes, typically for roles where it is difficult to vet a candidate&#x27;s skills appropriately during the interview. It is also not an improvement for Software Engineering, imo. If you ask Software Engineers if they might prefer this process over the current process, I think, most would not.')
