I was bummed.  Their lease was up for renewal, and it didn&#x27;t make sense for the owner to renew it as all of the office worker traffic was gone.<p>Two months later, there is a new coffee place at that spot. The guys (different owners) just got a great deal on the lease for the first two years, and they will just need to make employee expenses. One of the baristas, was actually the same barista from the previous coffee place.<p>so, many places will close, and new restaurants will eventually open, hopefully with better&#x2F;cheaper leases, which in Manhattan is a major expense, and kinda crazy compared to other cities.<p>I think a lot of the businesses that depended on office workers are going to close.  While the ones that are in more residential areas, with available outdoor seating, will fare a bit better.')
