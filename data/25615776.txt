I tried the Flir C2 but the thermal data was extremely low resolution, and returned it. I also tried a Flir Lepton 2 module since I could use an RPi and some gadgetry to do the panorama scanning and stitching automatically, but it too was low resolution (80x60).<p>The Lepton 3 seems to be decent at 160x120 though, which is probably good enough for a project like this, so if I were doing this again I&#x27;d probably use a Lepton 3 and a 2-axis servo scanner with a RPi, and maybe even combine it with an RPi HQ camera to automate the entire process into a single push button.<p>The Seek RevealPro is slightly annoying in that it doesn&#x27;t have programmatic access so I had to press a button to take every piece of the panorama. It&#x27;s a great general-use device though. I use it when camping or doing astrophotography in remote locations for some peace of mind since I can spot any potential wildlife and people threats from a distance, and I can easily identify whether a parked or seemingly abandoned car has been recently occupied. (My fears may be unfounded, but either way I&#x27;m much more at ease when I can see in the dark.)')
