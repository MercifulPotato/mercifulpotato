This is why there is no cold vaccine (and why the flu vaccine changes each year, and is usually only 60-80% effective).<p>So, to answer your questions: (1) It is not any more worrisome than the news we had back in March.  (2) It certainly has already and will continue to mutate in other animals.  Should we be concerned?  I guess.  I made peace with this inevitable outcome months ago.<p>I feel sorry for the minks.  I hope they don’t start testing other types of mammals and then decide to pursue wholesale eradication of local ecosystems and livestock.<p>Doing that is clearly a non-starter (the food chain would collapse).  However, it is necessary-but-not-sufficient to prevent new coronavirus strains from popping up.')
