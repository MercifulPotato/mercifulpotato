This is why in California one of the most important recent state law changes was 2017&#x27;s SB35, which mandates that local authorities must approve certain types of projects in 90 days or less. But the types of projects which benefit from this are fairly few.<p>On top of the carrying costs there are impact fees. These vary by city but you can see how crazy they are. In Fremont you will pay $160k per dwelling, that&#x27;s just cash out of your pocket.
