You live alone. In-laws in another house, parents a mile away.<p>Living with family means sharing the actual facilities of the house not just technically being on the same property, or in a house where you never have to cross paths. Having parents in another house on the same property doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;living together&quot; more than a neighbor on the other side of a 30cm wall is living with you.')
