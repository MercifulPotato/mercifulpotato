While big companies have their own Security Teams and are able to afford a normal security audit, for a small company that means 1. much higher cost in relation and also binding of personal they might not have.<p>I have worked in a very small company which basically couldn&#x27;t spell security. And i&#x27;m now working in a very big company. There are plenty of people who also can&#x27;t do that but there are teams only for security.<p>I don&#x27;t have to justify now that i&#x27;m doing things securely. Thats how it is. My manager will not sign the risk away; He actually can&#x27;t and people are not keen of asking upper upper management for that.')
