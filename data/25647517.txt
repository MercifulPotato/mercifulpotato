Even with massive government incentives, even with their massive war chests, even with their massive production capacity, even with their access to capital markets for big investments, even <i>then</i>, they didn&#x27;t make the smart move and had to be shown the path by an annoying megalomaniac who gets way too much attention.<p>So yes, I regret giving money to Tesla, but it is the least bad option out there as far as giving money to these car companies. The only winning move is to not play the game, but unfortunately that same government that is paying for the EV transition is the system that, by law, is denying my ability to live a car-free daily life.<p>There are no heroes here, nobody is doing exactly the right thing, but Tesla and the government are doing things partially right.')
