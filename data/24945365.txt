Mostly it was SQL queries wrapped up with a Perl script executed by cron that output excel workbooks or csvs and emailed or dumped to a file server.<p>Most of the pivots and reporting tables were actually generated in Perl because it was just nicer to work with than Excel.<p>It was wonderful, I learned so much, mostly how to love Perl and CPAN.<p>We merged our telco billing system with our new parent company with some Perl, cron, a couple SQL queries and an FTP server.<p>I  have said it for years and I will continue to repeat.  If you could snap your fingers and delete all the Perl code in the world your lights would turn off.')
