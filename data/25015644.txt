Item(by='BlueTemplar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604763435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998305, text='&gt; The U.S. Government&#x27;s assertion that Microsoft has a monopoly in the OS market might be the most patently absurd claim ever advanced by the legal mind. Linux, a technically superior operating system, is being given away for free, and BeOS is available at a nominal price. This is simply a fact, which has to be accepted whether or not you like Microsoft.<p>AFAIK this is a very common misunderstanding. The term &#x27;monopoly&#x27; is being (ab)used by a lot of people as meaning 100% market share, which is NOT how the courts define it. (They just tend to agree that less than 50% market share is not a monopoly.)<p>And while market share is an easy to prove (ok, not <i>that</i> easy, the hard part is to figure out what actual market is being talked about) and useful warning sign, the courts tend to take more interest in the actual anti-competitive practices.<p>&gt; The old robber-baron monopolies were monopolies because they physically controlled means of production and&#x2F;or distribution. But in the software business, the means of production is hackers typing code, and the means of distribution is the Internet, and no one is claiming that Microsoft controls those.<p>Hmmmâ€¦ did anyone say &#x27;Github&#x27; ?')
