Because, as a rule, if you are a researcher in academia you won&#x27;t be asked to retract your research because it makes someone look bad.<p>If your results go against current dogma, or if they reveal an uncomfortable truth, your paper will be rejected for spurious reasons every time you submit it. A recent example from Glenn Geher[1]:<p>&gt; I have published more than 100 academic pieces in my career to date. I&#x27;ve pretty much been through it all.<p>&gt; From this context, I will say that the most difficult paper that my team (the New Paltz Evolutionary Psychology Lab) and I have ever tried to publish was a paper on the topic of political motivations that underlie academic values of academics.<p>That&#x27;s the pushback you get for researching political motivations in academia. It&#x27;s much worse if your ideas directly connect to social policies. If your ideas are particularly heretical (or you engage in good faith with heretics), you&#x27;ll have your life threatened by violent mobs. This has happened to Allison Stanger, Bret Weinstein, Jordan Peterson, and many others.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;darwins-subterranean-world&#x2F;202011&#x2F;politics-in-academia-case-study" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;darwins-subterranean...</a>')
