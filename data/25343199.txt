Gray 23-inch racks as far as the eye can see!<p>Depending on how old that part of the office was, they were likely either 14&#x27; or 11&#x27;6&quot; tall with rolling ladders in the aisles, or 7&#x27; tall and the only place they&#x27;d have laddertrack was in front of the main distributing frame.<p>As for magnetic core, if you could see it mounted in a frame, what you probably saw was a remreed switching grid, which is a sort of magnetic core with reed-relay contacts at each bit, so writing a bit pattern into it establishes a connection path through a crosspoint matrix. It&#x27;s not used as storage but as a switching peripheral that requires no power to hold up its connections. (Contrast with crossbar, which relaxes as soon as the solenoids de-energize.)<p>Remreed was used in the #1 ESS (and the #1A, I believe), and is extensively documented in BSTJ volume 55: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;bstj-archives?&amp;and[]=year%3A%221976%22" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;bstj-archives?&amp;and[]=year%3A%221...</a>')
