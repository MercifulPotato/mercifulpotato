Laptops are a dime a dozen in just about any spec and things like SSD&#x27;s can be upgraded, but a laptop with a 4K OLED screen are rare.  There is not a lot of choice.<p>My previous laptop was 4K.  Sadly I discovered after I had it for a year or so 4K is addictive.  It&#x27;s hard to give up the screen real estate once your used to it.  When it comes to 4K on Lenovo it&#x27;s the X1 or nothing, and Dell&#x27;s keyboards have pissed me off for the last time.  I didn&#x27;t look beyond Dell and Lenovo.<p>The OLED was a first and only available on the X1.  It&#x27;s lovely and all, the contrast ratio and max brightness are extraordinary.  So extraordinary if I take the brightness beyond 10% or so in an office I can&#x27;t look at it for long periods.  It&#x27;s also twice the price, and heaver on the battery.  No huge regrets, as it is a truly beautiful screen, but I won&#x27;t be doing it again.<p>All that said, those key marks on the beautiful OLED screen are really starting to piss me off.')
