In the year 2030 I am expecting to still see more rounds of posts comparing string libraries for C.  With more than 4 decades of development, we still don&#x27;t have a great solution to string handling in C.<p>Every library like this is incompatible and most make slightly odd choices like in this library ownership of the string is denoted by a bit in the info&#x2F;size field. Not that that is a bad choice or anything, but it is one reason someone might decline to use it and decide to write their own.<p>The lack of namespacing in C doesn&#x27;t help, this library chooses str_ as its prefix, which is a bit likely to collide with other libraries.  It also makes it harder to try to write libraries that allow for the string library to be switched out.')
