Item(by='6gvONxR4sf7o', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611596512, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903576, text='I can&#x27;t put the article better than it puts itself. I&#x27;d recommend everyone read it top to bottom. tl;dr If everyone&#x27;s  playing tug of war, everyone has to spend all this effort pulling just to stay where we are.<p>What I&#x27;ll add is how this seems to show up in HN discussions. A frequent trope here is an article about someone or some company doing something that pisses people off, then the comments debating whether it&#x27;s the incentive-maker&#x27;s fault and it&#x27;s not wrong for people to maximize according to the incentives provided. The whole thing is a microcosm of this lack of trust.<p>It&#x27;s like the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. What&#x27;s lost isn&#x27;t the decision to trust, it&#x27;s the whole framing. In a perfect trust society, taking the compete option in a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma would be seen as immoral. In a zero trust society, the whole choice reduces to analyzing the payoff matrix. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s lost. It&#x27;s the change from a framing around &#x27;cooperation is the moral action&#x27; towards a framing around payoff matrices.<p>I&#x27;d argue that on HN, the general sentiment is on the payoff matrix end of the spectrum.')
