After the lockdown orders will lifted it still takes a while for businesses to reopen and for people to change their behavior. There are delays in state level data reporting.<p>So I would say that if we don&#x27;t see a sustained rise in death rates in about three more weeks from today then that would confirm the &quot;null hypothesis&quot; of lockdowns being ineffective. Or if they have a major spike in deaths then that would indicate that lockdowns are effective.')
