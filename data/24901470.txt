This information stays with me and my accountant.<p>I then (always) ask them to email me detailed (usually 2-3 pages) job specs. Sometimes they call something &quot;Manager&quot; and it could be a +2 or -2 ranks. It&#x27;s nomenclature. Different companies go crazy on the titles. After I read the specs, I ask them the range. If they absolutely want to know how much I make, or how much I want, I just bid them farewell. It&#x27;s probably a shitty company, or it has a shitty HR. Either way, I can always (hope) to find a job in a better place.<p>The asymmetry of information can really f... up your chances to maximize your income. Never give them a number because you enter a negotiation blindfolded.<p>Edit: This has always worked for me.')
