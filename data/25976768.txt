There&#x27;s a group of younger companies that grew up around the Healthcare.gov rescue and work in conjunction with USDS, trying to build cultures of better software development practices in government. Check out the companies in the Digital Services Coalition (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalservicescoalition.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalservicescoalition.org&#x2F;</a>) and you&#x27;ll see a lot of companies doing the kind of work you talk about.<p>I work for Ad Hoc (one of these companies) on software projects at the VA, and I&#x27;m happy to chat with anyone who&#x27;s interested to hear more about this kind of work. I left a cushy Google job to work on important and needed systems, and it <i>does</i> feel so much better!')
