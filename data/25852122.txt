Hypothetically, turning off your webcam reduces overall network traffic and would reduce the resources required to deliver adequate connection speeds. But in reality, modest reductions in internet traffic won&#x27;t impact the datacenters and network infrastructures that have already been built. A more likely outcome is that network traffic is used for other applications.<p>Similar situations exist when pointing to the environmental impact of meat production, for example. Not consuming meat would reduce transportation of feed, and transportation accounts for almost all of the carbon emissions from meat production. But that only actually reduces emissions if we assume that the total amount of transportation would go down, rather than the same transportation capacity being used for other goods.')
