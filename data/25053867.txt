The first time, I was laid off with severance--a small mercy.<p>The second time, I was run into the ground repeatedly as I tried to manage it. That time, I was dropkicked by my manager far over the line, and exited myself.<p>This last job, I left the moment I felt it happening.<p>My struggle now is to not make it a reflex, and a huge amount of my personal and life work has gone into improving communication (aka yowling techniques), and drawing lines in work&#x2F;life&#x2F;etc balance to sustain myself.<p>Currently, I&#x27;m just avoiding the washing machine entirely.')
