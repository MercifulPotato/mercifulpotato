Python has a crazy amount inertia and excellent projects still in the pipeline.<p>I think Julia will eventually win because writing your code in one language which isn’t C or FORTRAN is extremely productive and leads to much more composable libraries. The progress that’s been made on, for example, deep learning frameworks is impressive given the lack of massive investment from FAANG. I hope this leads to it dethroning Python, but it might not. If anything will, I think it has the best chance.<p>I’d suggest you give it a try anyway because its really not a hard language to learn. The ecosystem itself is quite good. The fact that you can write fast code without C extensions leaves you less dependent on the ecosystem, too.')
