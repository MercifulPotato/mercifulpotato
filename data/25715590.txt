Perhaps if taken literally what you said <i>may</i> be correct - the problem with this kind of imagery is not its advocacy of a specific technique, but allowing people to more clearly imagine it and normalizing it in their minds.<p>In any case, I stand by my claim that to say you can know the full effect on all minds of a certain image is a poor argument to make, since it&#x27;s literally impossible to know. I hope you&#x27;ll at least recognize that kind of claim is worth avoiding, if for no other reason that it inadvertently undermines any other point you are trying to make.')
