Specially if those base stations are right on the roof or next to the datacenters of the major companies. SpaceX base stations will likely be colocated with exchanges and that is also where many caches are (Netflix, Google and so on).<p>Even if you use inter satellite links, Starlink has many links and can schedule the path depending on demand on the network.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you are even arguing, its very likely possible to get 1Gb, if SpaceX will over this, or only over it for limited time for extra price is clearly jet unknown. But saying &#x27;current GEO satellites don&#x27;t offer it so Starlink will not&#x27; simply doesn&#x27;t work as an argument.<p>&gt; harder meaning never been done at those rates<p>So nobody has done it so its not possible? That the worst argument ever. Laser link technology is at the very beginning. I think SpaceX had enough of &#x27;experts&#x27; claiming things aren&#x27;t possible even when physics doesn&#x27;t at all show this to be the case.')
