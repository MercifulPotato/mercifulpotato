Item(by='taylodl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601915553, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24687629, text='Jimmy Carter requested Americans to turn down their thermostats for the Winter and Americans balked (I was alive at that time - he asked to turn it down from 72F to 68F). I can&#x27;t imagine Americans balking at turning down their thermostats being happy to give up the constant delivery of electricity to their homes. If you&#x27;re going to ask people to make significant lifestyle changes then you should ask them to make those changes where it would provide the biggest benefit - and that&#x27;s not the utility sector, it&#x27;s the transportation sector. Not only is transportation the 2nd largest producer of CO2 (not too far behind electricity) but it also leads to poor local air quality and tens of thousands of vehicle-related deaths. Moreover, I think more Americans would be amenable to a change in transportation over a change in their electric supply.')
