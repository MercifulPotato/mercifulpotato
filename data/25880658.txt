AC motors are usually zero maintenance because they don&#x27;t have brushes to wear out, and it&#x27;s a lot easier to support regen (which I&#x27;ve heard actually makes a big difference to driving experience; people expect the car to slow down when they take their foot off the gas, and it&#x27;s disconcerting for it to just keep rolling forward like a freewheeling bicycle).<p>AC motors and motor controllers are generally more expensive than, say, a Warp9 and a Zilla, but the price difference is gradually dropping. Probably the price difference between AC and DC for a major manufacturer is even smaller than what&#x27;s available retail to hobbyists doing conversions.  And I think more and more conversions are being done with repurposed Tesla and Leaf drive units.<p>A small, cheap AC motor attached to a 2 or 3 speed transmission would be a lot of fun to drive, I think.  No need for a reverse gear even.  Maybe not even a clutch or flywheel, if you can match the motor speed with the transmission electronically.<p>My batteries are about 450 pounds of lithium iron phosphate cells.  That&#x27;s generally what&#x27;s recommended for conversions.  Used Tesla packs have much better energy density, but they&#x27;re more dangerous and need liquid cooling and are awkwardly shaped. I couldn&#x27;t think of a good place to put them in the RX-8 where they&#x27;d be safe.')
