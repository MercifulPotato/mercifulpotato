It&#x27;s better in some areas, and worse in others, but it&#x27;s definitely competitive.<p>Even if you want to throw Firefox out the window and start a new browser from scratch, the existence of Web DRM is one of the biggest issues that&#x27;s keeping you from building a new browser on top of V8 or Servo. If you want to license Widevine from Google, they&#x27;re not going to approve it for a highly experimental browser. There isn&#x27;t a technical solution to that problem at all -- it&#x27;s entirely a legal problem.')
