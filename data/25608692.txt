I want to be able to have a Presenta File player, so I can play the Presenta slideshow files and video files from my local folder using the html page.  That&#x27;s generally it.  Upwork couldn&#x27;t deliver.<p>This job was step one, in a very few number towards an MVP.<p>Nobody on Upwork seems to be able to do this.<p>I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with UpWork.\nI have a call with TopTal next week\nI have a call with Iron Forge next week, as well<p>If anyone here has reviewed this, is able to do this, and want to get paid doing it, leave me a message.<p>Thx')
