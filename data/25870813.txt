But we don&#x27;t know and cannot really explain it.<p>Let&#x27;s make similar conjecture.<p>Because entangled pair interacts with each other at distance instantly this is a proof that you can interact at light speed at arbitrary distances. So there must be some kind of dimension that they stay connected through. We should be able to use this dimension to wormhole travel across arbitrary distances.<p>Therefore &#x27;entangled wormholes&#x27; are possible.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong the delayed choice experiment is quite disturbing. It really looks like there is some kind of intelligence at play. But thats not a proof of god (if it was not so hard to explain this experiment to common no &#x27;science interested&#x27; person it would be 100% used by all preachers as sign of god at work).')
