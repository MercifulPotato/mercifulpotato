A high fidelity modern AAA game full of thousands of 4k+ textures, super-high-poly models, detailed animations, and hours of high quality audio is going to take up a lot of space. There are certainly optimizations to be had, but there&#x27;s no way a 60GB+ game today would ever fit on, say, a DVD, <i>at the same level of fidelity while maintaining the same player experience</i>.<p>Higher compression means longer load times, so there&#x27;s incentive to not compress more than absolutely necessary, and the biggest games tend to have huge worlds, which means you can&#x27;t hold the whole world in memory at once. So you have to stream it in.<p>It&#x27;s a constant balancing act between your nominal hardware target, the space the game will take up, up-front load times, and the amount of stuff that can be in a scene before the hardware can&#x27;t keep up and you get model&#x2F;texture streaming pop-in, stuttering, or an otherwise degraded player experience.<p>Perhaps in the next few years we&#x27;ll see games leveraging super-resolution AI to quickly produce usably high-res textures from lower-res installed ones in storage faster than a directly compressed equivalent could be.... or games will leverage the same to take what they already ship and make it even higher detail...')
