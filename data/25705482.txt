Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610230534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25701706, text='&gt; That is the exact crux. I created the content, but EVERY one of these sites is clear they own it. Once I wrote it and hit send, I gave it to them and assumed ownership, they are clear about this. So they ARE publishing THEIR content.<p>This isn&#x27;t the distinction the law makes though. The distinction is about the provider, not the owner. If I write a book, and you post an excerpt from that book on my website, I&#x27;m not liable under 230, even though I&#x27;m the original author of the content! The distinction the law makes is between a first party provider and a third party provider.<p>That is, imagine I got a license to an image in my book, but not for distribution on the internet. You then post the page from the book as a comment on my website. I didn&#x27;t violate my license, even though the book posted on my site was <i>mine</i>.')
