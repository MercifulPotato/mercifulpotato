Item(by='nly', descendants=None, kids=[25332072, 25332075, 25332275], score=None, time=1607348017, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25331442, text='I suspect PC&#x27;s containing AMD, and maybe even Intel, chips will be crushing Apple in terms of performance a few years from now, even with the legacy that is the x86 ISA.<p>Just because Apple currently have a (for the sake of argument) 20 watt part, that can outperform an Intel 45 watt part, it doesn&#x27;t mean this advantage is inherent to ARM or sustainable once the tech cycle evens out.<p>The bottleneck right now for essentially all chip performance in mobile devices is heat. If you bypass the power throttling and fan control on my 10th gen 6 core Dell XPS 9500 and let it slurp 80-90 watts (and it will), and sit at 100 degrees centigrade (and it will) it will handily beat an M1 multithreaded score in Cinebench.')
