Imagine if the safety testing for these vaccines were already done in January. Imagine if major transport hubs like airports had generic testing equipment that could check for a wide range of diseases. Imagine if we had a system in place for food distribution so at risk and sick people didn&#x27;t have to go to the grocery stores. It would be an insult to the memory of everyone lost this year if we didn&#x27;t gain some 2020 hindsight.')
