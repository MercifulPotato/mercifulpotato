Went like this:<p>1. Suddenly my Google Home would only use YouTube Music when playing to the Chromecast on my TV.<p>2. YouTube Music, among a bunch of other terrible UX issues around how it considers music to be organized&#x2F;related, has the extremely annoying quality of always playing videos of the music instead of just the music.<p>3. Turns out there&#x27;s an option in your account settings to tell it to only play audio, no videos.<p>4. Also, turns out this setting has zero effect when playing through a Chromecast, and thus the damnable videos persist.<p>5. So, I said, &quot;Eff it!&quot; and signed up for a Hi-Fi Tidal account (the audio quality improvement is immediately apparent, BTW) to replace my Google Play Music... er, YouTube Music instigated brewing household clusterf*ck (the chance was screwing with my wife &amp; two little kids&#x27; ability to listen to music with the ease and predictability they had with Google Play Music).<p>6. I can cast Tidal to the Chromecast from my phone, so I figured I could link it in my Google Home device, and our household music situation would be basically back to normal. Nope...NOPE!<p>7. You can&#x27;t set Tidal as a music service for your Google Home, which turned me into the family&#x27;s sporadic impromptu disc jockey throughout the day, and entirely broke the kids&#x27; ability to manage their own music enjoyment.<p>8. Turns out Amazon&#x27;s device ecosystem doesn&#x27;t have this problem, so the Chromecast got replaced with a Fire TV stick and an Alexa pod.<p>In one felled swoop, via the most utterly existentially dubious product rollout and migration, Google managed to motivate me to eat the switching cost of replacing 100% of their hardware and 100% of their media services from my family&#x27;s life. Truly a spectacular &quot;own goal&quot; on Google&#x27;s behalf... and for what? What is even the point of YouTube Music?')
