Americans need to buy and hold equities. Period. When Google cuts costs or makes more money, I benefit as a shareholder (or you can hold total market indexes and the like).<p>Yes, but it is not good that your &quot;compensation&quot; will be coming from something that isn&#x27;t tied to your job performance.
