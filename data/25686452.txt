It&#x27;s a really cool display, but everything I&#x27;ve heard and experienced with BMW&#x2F;Mercedes warns me this is a terrible idea unless you are looking to buy an endless money pit. Accidentally kick this thing or hit a bump wrong and you are going to need a $10,000 loan just to fix one part.')
