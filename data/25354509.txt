Certificates change; probably yearly, knowing Apple.<p>2. The OCSP check get cached; the certificate lookup doesn&#x27;t happen every time you launch an app.<p>3. You can block the OCSP lookup if you&#x27;re all bent out of shape about it or strip the developer&#x27;s signature and sign it using a different certificate.<p>4. The new protocol for checking will be encrypted and there will be UI for opting out of these checks.')
