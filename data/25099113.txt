Whether that&#x27;s a useful description, depends on context. Virtual particles are sort of like this decomposition.<p>I think that a lot of confusion arises because of the innocuous seeming equal sign. Explicitly replace the equals by approprate (algebraic) maps, and at least for me, the relationship becomes a lot clearer.<p>Maybe more familiar to HN, maybe it helps to do &quot;typed&quot; math? E.g. counting numbers have a different type than equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences. From a set theory perspective, it makes sense to ask the question whether the number 3 (as a set) equals the collection of triangles in R^3 (as a set). Of course, the two aren&#x27;t equal, but it seems weird to even ask this question.<p>Maybe it should be just as incongruous to say that some vacuum state equals it&#x27;s decomposition into virtual particles. The two things are just differently-typed. You need some computation to convert between them.')
