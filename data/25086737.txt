Almost <i>immediately</i> after restaurants were allowed to have dine-in customers, I started to see them packed any time I came to pick up food. Obviously there still aren&#x27;t as many people dining out as before the pandemic, but most people I know couldn&#x27;t wait to start going out on a regular basis again.<p>With that said, I do think food delivery and pickup will be more popular in general after the pandemic, but I highly doubt it will ever be as commonly done as it is now.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m in the US; I can&#x27;t speak for other countries. Notably, I was in London about a year and a half ago, takeaway and delivery already seemed to be extremely commons way to dine.')
