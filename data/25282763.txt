I imagine breaking user actions down to intent, if possible, would help quite a bit with that.<p>For a product that is supposed to be simpler and save people time compared to the alternative, increasing time using the service might mean people like it and are getting more done so using it more... or it might just mean that it&#x27;s getting harder to use.  Then again, maybe they&#x27;ve graduated from doing simple things with it to complex things, and even though interactions take longer, they&#x27;re still saving more time and effort overall compared to the alternative and are happy.<p>I guess the bottom line is I think you have to slice and dice the data a lot of ways and think about what it actually means for your product to be using that data effectively.')
