Is it necessary?</i><p>Depends how you look at it. In the wild, humans evolved to be watchful and suspicious of threats to their tribes, mainly other tribes trying to take what&#x27;s theirs. So they&#x27;d make weapons to defend themselves.<p>Modern humans have huge tribes (countries) and the weapons they create are also huge (nuclear, armies, drones)... but the threat remains the same... other tribes they don&#x27;t trust<p>There&#x27;s also natural selection at play here. Tribes which don&#x27;t&#x2F;can&#x27;t defend themselves are taken over by those who can... it&#x27;s a sad truth that won&#x27;t be changing anytime soon')
