What did you actually expect from the discussion? Were there not enough comments against Coinbase? Were there not enough comments outraged about the perceived racist behavior of it? Do you think none of those commenters &quot;imagine the possibility that racism is a problem in America in 2020&quot;?<p>Let&#x27;s assume that I am 100% certain of all the accusations. How many types of comments do you expect to see about this? Condemn the company, point out systemic racism doesn&#x27;t just affect Coinbase but everything, offer condolences and sympathy, support efforts to reduce racism. All of these comments exist in the thread.<p>What if I don&#x27;t believe all the accusations are true? There are multitudes of reasons why that could be the case, which reflects in the number of possibilities being commented on. By your own contention, racism is a problem in America, so you would expect at least some of the comments to be racist, or at least controversial. You seem to have focused only on the worst ones, ignoring the discussions that followed them, whether positive or negative. You&#x27;ve ignored all the nuanced positions or straw-manned them. You&#x27;re dismissive of people&#x27;s comments or concerns while simultaneously asking people to not be dismissive of your concerns. I really don&#x27;t get it.')
