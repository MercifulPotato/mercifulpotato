No way they will get into the ARM team, the instant what they build starts being powerful they will get scared of it too and kill it.<p>A good part of why they take such a beating in x86 too, Intel has no backup plan because they&#x27;re scared of their own backup up, while being oblivious to the fact that it was their backup plan that saved them during the post-P4 era.<p>At least AMD is not scared of throwing away their arch every few years and restart, they&#x27;ve pretty much been doing that like clockwork every five years for the past two decades.')
