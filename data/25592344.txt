Item(by='genghizkhan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609420584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25592261, text='systemd the init system does not open network connections. systemd PID1 does not talk to the network. `networkd` is a separate binary.<p>Second, systemd does not mandate using any of these components apart from `journald` and `logind`. You can pipe journald into any syslog daemon of your choice, there&#x27;s a config option to do so. If you&#x27;ve got issues with logind I can&#x27;t help you there. I don&#x27;t know what it was intended to replace (consolekit, I think?) but I do remember it was badly maintained.<p>Third, a vast majority of deployments do _not_ accept defaults. I know that both Red Hat and Debian go for third party network managers (networkmanager and Debian&#x27;s ifup&#x2F;ifdown stuff) and rsyslogd was there on a default install of both Debian Buster and CentOS 8 iirc.<p>Finally, I repeat, systemd is a monorepo which contains many programs. Sure, you can argue about how they&#x27;re tightly bound, but I can point you towards FreeBSD&#x2F;OpenBSD if you&#x27;d want them to be broken up into separate repos to be more &quot;unix-y&quot;, and if you look at systemd PID1 it&#x27;s a fairly small binary which doesn&#x27;t seem to offer many security holes.')
