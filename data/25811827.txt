I say it’s close enough, so she didn’t expose diddly squat. What she did do is access a state computer system without authorization. That’s a crime, and her guilt or innocence will play out in court... like with other crimes.<p>There’s no story here, except about a hysterical, attention-seeking woman who poked the wrong bear. Good luck to her. If nothing else, I hope she learns a lesson.')
