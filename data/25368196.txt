I&#x27;m using Rails 6 for my own projects and in these side projects, I&#x27;ve been having a huge hell of a time trying to grok &quot;right ways&quot; to do things with webpacker&#x2F;webpack. I seem to encounter issues every single time with deploys to Heroku because of precompilation issues, or imports not running right. But tutorials get out of date so fast and I&#x27;m constantly trying to just remove stuff just to get my builds to work. Are there any Rails focused chatrooms or places where I can get into the nitty gritty of these things without needing to post GitHub issues and piss off maintainers all the time?<p>I just don&#x27;t really grok how to use modern Javascript I guess, but also integrating with Rails webpacker has been a source of constant frustration. I can&#x27;t even figure out how to properly package JS libs without just giving up and using jsdelivr instead. Would love any kind of pointers!')
