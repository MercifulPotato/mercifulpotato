The largest coin you&#x27;re ever likely to encounter in circulation is the Kennedy half dollar.  Since 1971, they are made of a copper core with a copper&#x2F;nickel cladding layer, just like current dimes and quarters are.  It&#x27;s current melt value is approximately $0.09.<p>But, when yo speak about &quot;true value,&quot; consider that anything you&#x27;re trying to attach a dollar value to, you&#x27;re measuring its value in terms of dollars.  A dollar today really is little more than a bit that&#x27;s set in a computer somewhere.  Why do we give that any value at all?<p>The answer is that the USD, along with most, if not all, current world currencies, is essentially an &quot;economy token.&quot;  By that I mean the USD is literally just a way to keep score, <i>i.e.</i> to tell how much you&#x27;re winning at the game of capitalism.<p>This seems like neither a good thing nor a bad thing.  It just is what it is.<p>Interestingly, according to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sdbullion.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-much-silver-gold-is-there" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sdbullion.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-much-silver-gold-is-there</a> there are about 6e9 ozt gold and 5e10 ozt silver above ground right now.  At today&#x27;s current spot prices of $1789.55 for gold per ozt and $22.78 per ozt, that works out to about 1.2e13 USD worth, which, if we made all money either out of or backed by gold and silver in a 1:1 ratio, would literally be all the money in the world.')
