Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605381916, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093563, text='Ok, we&#x27;ve regoogled it above.<p>Edit: now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to read the article, I don&#x27;t agree with that change, and have restored the title back to how a moderator had correctly edited it before.<p>The reason is that the article doesn&#x27;t say anything specific to Google. The sole point it does make is common to all the services, and indeed the article seems &quot;conscious&quot; of this, since 3 times it says &quot;google&quot; it immediately qualifies that with a phrase like &quot;or any service&quot;.<p>Nor does the parent comment make the case that this is specific to Google; in fact it makes the opposite case.')
