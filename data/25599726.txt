This year, it was in fact the buy side which got rich, but there&#x27;s no inherent moral superiority of one side over the other (Have you ever considered that the market participant which by definition sold more Tesla stock than any other, overall, isâ€¦ Tesla?)<p>I really don&#x27;t understand the moral outrage directed at people shorting a stock. Personally, I reserve my opprobrium for stuff like getting people to pre-pay thousands of dollars for features that keep getting pushed back year after year, or shipping software in a twilight zone of autonomy that works fine 99.9% of the time and accelerates into a wall at 90mph the rest of the time.<p>And &quot;gaming the market&quot;? As in announcing an inexistent bid to take the company public?<p>But YMMV.')
