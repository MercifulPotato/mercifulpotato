I don&#x27;t think the similarities to Chrome (which were not really so great for a long time) were the main driver.<p>I tried to hold onto FF for as long as possible for ideological reasons, and then for some years when I couldn&#x27;t justify it because of just terrible performance, I used Chromium. They had a much, much better plugin market &#x2F; platform for a long time and that too was a larger part of the draw that differentiated them. I switched back to FF as soon as I heard they had dealt with most of their speed issues in an update but, extremely reluctantly, I have been considering whether they are any better than Chromium at this point with the privacy &#x2F; ad shenanigans that really seem to insist on reappearing in different ways with great consistency lately. The recent monetization debacle has frankly been disheartening.<p>So the main points for me are that they failed on speed (which drove most people I know who switched to Chrome) and now on culture&#x2F;honesty.')
