If you&#x27;re extremely lucky, you might be able to copy a single word or even multiple, but line breaks, inline equations and basically anything else breaks it entirely, which is not only incredibly annoying for citing things, but makes it entirely unusable for visually-impaired people.<p>Additionally, if equations are the the main appeal of it, how have we not made anything better? Why can&#x27;t I plug the same code that renders my paper into a solver or convert it into Julia and run it? Like, properly, not just by guessing. I get that *tex is a typesetting language, but we&#x27;re not typesetters!')
