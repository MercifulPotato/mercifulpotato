You can look at individual passwords and estimate their &quot;entropy&quot;, such as zxcvbn does, and in fact you need to. Because the distribution that matters is not the one you used to pick the password, but the one that the attacker uses.<p>You could pick from the universe of arbitrary UTF-8 strings of up to 1000 characters (huge entropy), and pull &quot;password&quot; - but that would be a bad password, despite the distribution.<p>Or you could pick randomly from {&quot;password&quot;, &quot;09854yngbmoujcr08twnvgje8w6g7bkv,cmxm5^&amp;*9NMF&quot;}, and pick the latter, and it would be a reasonable password, despite carrying only 1 bit of information in the given distribution.<p>&gt; Research should go to making more memorable generated passwords, looking for the best tradeoff between that and entropy.<p>Agreed on that.')
