For that itself, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it; because serverless is pretty much all event driven (which many things might be, but might not be able to fit on serverless; even it does, it might just be easier to plop it on a simple instance).<p>I do see a big potential for small and simple projects though. No need to setup instances and worry about networking: just deploy it and go.')
