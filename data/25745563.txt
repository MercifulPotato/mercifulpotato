However there will be significant diminishing returns on the perceptual quality at this bitrate - 20Mbps to 40Mbps for example will only increase perceptual quality by a couple of percentage points. Much of this &quot;Up to 80Mbps&quot; will be wasted perceptually speaking.<p>It&#x27;s also worth keeping in mind that the encoding on BluRays is often lazy because there&#x27;s lot of space available, where as a huge amount of work goes into encoding content for streaming delivery in the lowest bandwidth possible for a given target quality, using technologies like per-title and per-scene encoding.
