Item(by='nix23', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607468661, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25351520, text='Hehe no :) you have a central ignition away from the street (hidden in a bush under bridge etc) and it looks often like a sewer cover, if you uncover it you have 8-16 holes, on top of them you have to place your correctly encoded metal-plate then you place the igniter in the metal-plate-hole, that igniter fires another igniter and the whole bridge&#x2F;street goes boom, if its the wrong hole (or wrong encoded metal-plate) you just destroy the main igniter and nothing will and can ever happen.<p>EDIT: The first ignition (the one in the plate) is manually fired often hundreds of meters away thru a fuse-cord, but you can &quot;in theory&quot; automatize it (trip wire or other technique&#x27;s) witch is absolutely illegal, same with claymore&#x27;s...they just have holes in the splinter to safe some weight ;)<p>BTW: DON&#x27;T try to open those sewer covers, you WILL have big problems in a matter of minutes.')
