(This would not apply if Twitter&#x27;s marketing was &#x27;Fuck you! we do whatever we want&#x27;, instead they promote themselves as a fair platform)<p>Moreover the entire exemption does not apply when the `provider` is not a provider but is actually a publisher using editorial discretion.\n(for example if twitter decided to ban false statements in tweets this would clearly put them outside of section 230 immunity)')
