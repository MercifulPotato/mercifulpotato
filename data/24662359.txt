Once compliance is achieved they are liable for the commercial licensing fees for the period up until that time. It isn&#x27;t a fine, it isn&#x27;t damages, it is just the normal cost of doing business.<p>May the standard licensing costs quite high (but not exorbitant) and state that other terms are available if negotiated <i>before</i> using the software.<p>If they refuse to pay and the amount is large enough, sell the dept to a collections agency and at least cause some inconvenience (though that last part probably won&#x27;t work across international borders).<p>Of course if you don&#x27;t want financial recompense, and open-source-ness is your only concern, then compliance it the only matter to be concerned about. But some people and commercial entities simply won&#x27;t respect that up-front (so you&#x27;ll have to fight for compliance) unless non-compliance has an associated cost.')
