When the market is moving up and down you will realize some amount of PnL regardless of what you paid for it. But you have to pay something for it, and that&#x27;s the appraisal of the market for whatever period in the future your option covers. It&#x27;s like pricing a swap, that floating leg will be some number that you&#x27;ll receive, but you pay some guess about what it&#x27;s going to be over the period. The thing about that is you probably have more certainty in the near term than the long term, and there&#x27;s a term structure coming out of that.<p>About quoting in vol terms, I found people mostly do that in FX and fixed income. In equities it seemed to be prices. There&#x27;s calculators for everything anyway, so you can easily swap between them.')
