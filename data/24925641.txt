This seems unlikely, though, as such a mechanism would probably be disclosed as a feature, and the existence of any such associated signatures in the metadata would be obvious.<p>It could still be the case for instance, as an undisclosed feature, if there is a steganographic method to surreptitiously sign photos for this purpose. This seems unlikely, but is a fun topic to consider, particularly as we move towards indistinguishable convergence between fake and authentic content. And, any such mechanism would be quite difficult to protect from eventual extraction&#x2F;cloning of associated signing mechanisms for inclusion in a sophisticated deep fake pipeline.<p>There are potential upsides to reducing the self servicability of these supercomputers, yet it is an unknown whether Apple has any such agenda to help consumers increase information assurance as a result of such couplings noted in the video.')
