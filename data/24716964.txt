And it wasn&#x27;t just a short nick-name based on their name that they use generally: their friends from the region would call them something different. Likewise a polish fellow in one of my current circles does the same (though I don&#x27;t know any of his wider social network so don&#x27;t know if this simpler name is used more generally).<p>It may be a regional thing (partly because some languages use sounds like &quot;clicks&quot; that we don&#x27;t, so have difficulty replicating): I&#x27;ve encountered numerous people from the middle &amp; far East and they haven&#x27;t done this.')
