And hopefully users have a mechanism to note the revocation in time.<p>This is the key issue. For a long time there was no working revocation mechanism. With a combination of OCSP, OCSP stapling and the muststaple extension you can get there, but this isn&#x27;t in widespread use yet. Revocation is a difficult problem.')
