Hanlons razor!  Its just a few bad actors not systemic to the org. At least it stopped after the Church committee, because its impossible to keep a secret conspiracy secret. Its just a bunch of coincidences that aligned by chance. Did everyone here forget their tinfoil hat? We should censor such conspiracy craziness for the greater good, because the platforms are private and have every right to do so, also people who believe in conspiracy theories are mentally ill.  Talk like this is just illogical people trying to put meaning to events that happen where there is none. Its not like there is cordination among rich and powerful groups of people to conspire against the people, thats just a cliched trope.')
