I don&#x27;t know of any liberal western country where you see the kind of racism routinely displayed on the front page of mainstream&#x2F;popular UK newspapers.  Perhaps xenophobia rather than direct racism would be a better description but it&#x27;s not easy to tell the difference in many cases.  It&#x27;s all a bit weird as the UK is generally a tolerant society but somebody must be buying all those newspapers.<p>About the only UK newspaper I can read these days without getting upset is the Financial Times - there&#x27;s pockets of good journalism in the Guardian also but it&#x27;s almost too much of a struggle to find them in the swamp of opinion pieces.  I guess the Times isn&#x27;t too bad or at least tries to represent some sort of centrist view but it feels fairly shallow.<p>For me the Brexit issue is the UK&#x27;s version of the culture war in the US.  I&#x27;ve talked to people who say they can barely talk to members of their family any more because of Brexit stance differences.  And I don&#x27;t see this division healing very soon - I fear it&#x27;s going to fester for years.')
