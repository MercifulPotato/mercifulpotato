That&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re dealing with. The worst kinds of propaganda make their point with emotion, repetition, and invective. Most people can&#x27;t tell the difference between that and real information.<p>Thus, sources that seek to manipulate people will win against those that are fair and honest.
