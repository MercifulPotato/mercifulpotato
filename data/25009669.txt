Item(by='mdifrgechd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604685678, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25004476, text='For most low value sites e.g. inc.com type random news that ask me to sign up to continue, I just dont use them, because the value they provide is lower than how I value creating an account.<p>The same is true for recaptcha, I usually just don&#x27;t use a site if they make me use it. I have stopped donating to charities because they use recaptcha and would never buy from an online store that uses it. The same as I would never go to a bar where you are searched on the way in, or buy a pizza from a place with a central call center that makes me wait to make an order. If a business wants to treat me like shit, I just wont use it.')
