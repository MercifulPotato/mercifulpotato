I support laying down old grievances, but going back on old agreements is usually undesirable, especially after having no objections all this time. Half the international treaties are older than that, which ones are &#x27;safe&#x27;?<p>&gt;&gt; &quot;How many of those are the result of Iranian involvement?&quot;\n&gt;They didn&#x27;t invade the country.. plunging the country into chaos<p>Iran sure tried to between 1982 and 1988. And quite a lot of the Iraqi chaos is their doing. They need a weak Iraqi government so their militia can create a state within the state.<p>&gt;That&#x27;s blood money, not an apology.<p>Iran agreed to it. When Iran shot down its own citizens, it lied about the event until footage leaked out making the lie unsustainable.<p>&gt;Maybe they wanted the Americans out so that the region could achieve some stability?<p>Right. The guys building substate militias everywhere, undermining half the states in ME really care about stability.<p>&gt;the US has their [SA] back\nWhich is why the US really helped them after Iran attacked their oil facilities. Not.<p>&gt;they&#x27;re probably looking for the security of a nuclear deterrent.<p>They are the one openly calling for the elimination of one ME state, and the overthrow of a half dozen regimes on the other. If they want security they should look at their own actions. Or perhaps the &#x27;security&#x27; the Iranian regime is looking for is being able to attack others without fear of interference from the West.')
