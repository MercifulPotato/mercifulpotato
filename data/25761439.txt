Heck, you can even take some proper notes that you will actually understand!<p>For labs it&#x27;s not like you get any help either. You just have to follow some instructions point by point and if you do not understand something, tough luck, the professor has already moved to the next exercise.<p>The worst part is that you have to spend 6-8 hours a day, 5 days a week like this and then you still need to find online materials to actually learn the thing. Some people have to work too.<p>Did I mention 2 hours of commute time every day?')
