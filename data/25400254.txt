Drop the stringly typing and add actual types (hence eliminating 80% of bothersome awksedgrep magic; yes, no need to tell me it&#x27;s a real tall order), add proper error handling...<p>I truly value simplicity where possible, but I think that the primary interface that I use to communicate with my computer should be as powerful as possible. Numerous times I&#x27;ve built up a shell pipeline only to realize near the end that I need to do something that shell is horrible at, and had to redo the whole thing in Python from scratch. I cannot really see a reason to limit it.<p>&gt;Some of the most commonly used utils like awk &#x27;{ print $2}&#x27;, sed, grep, sort, ... should be included out of the box to improve performance and to provide consistency across distributions.<p>UNIX &quot;philosophy&quot; got a lot of things wrong, but not this one. These common utilities you mention are good especially when they&#x27;re separate, because it&#x27;s not the shell&#x27;s job to improve performance, provide consistency, etc... of a dozen and a half different utilities, a number sure only to grow in time as people discover what commonly used thing they want in their shell. Though I&#x27;ll give you that `awk &#x27;{ print $2 }&#x27;` should <i>definitely</i> be its own utility or a built-in.')
