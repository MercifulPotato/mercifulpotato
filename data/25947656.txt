Although, I don&#x27;t think the contracts with exchanges are very tight; I don&#x27;t know about the contracts with brokerages. IIRC, Nasdaq had (has?) a special order type for market makers who didn&#x27;t want to actually make a market that would put in bid and ask at exactly the maximum contractually allowed spread away from last trade, and withdraw and replace them when any trades did occur; making it much harder to actually trade with the market maker.')
