Going into presentation mode in Keynote&#x2F;Powerpoint&#x2F;Google Slides doesn&#x27;t also go into the slack client and disable them, nor does it for other programs that pop up notifications (eg skype, windows update&#x2F;app store updater), and why should it? Keeping slack confined to the web browser sets this boundary neatly, so long as you don&#x27;t also allow the web page to display notifications (which chrome will do if you let it).')
