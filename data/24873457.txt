It&#x27;s based on the fan-made patch &#x27;insecticide&#x27;, by kyrub. Insecticide is very conservative about gameplay changes. I don&#x27;t know about CoM (I didn&#x27;t try it because I didn&#x27;t like the change list), but kyrub actually scaled down some artificial AI bonuses because smarter behavior makes up for that.<p>Overall, I think the author of the article didn&#x27;t research the unofficial patches very well.')
