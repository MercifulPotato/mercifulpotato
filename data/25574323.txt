Abstracting compute behind an IaaS offering would let them do exactly that while providing an alternate sink for binned chips.<p>Furthermore, they&#x27;ve got decent HW&#x2F;SW integration talent in-house, and they could offer a key feature other clouds couldn&#x27;t: vendor agnosticism. Building {PaaS product} on an Intel cloud seems strategically smarter than building on one of the continually-vertically-integrating clouds.')
