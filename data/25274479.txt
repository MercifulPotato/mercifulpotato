The ARC reactor, for example, doesn&#x27;t use a solid sandwich style blanket, it uses a volumetric blanket of FLiBe, a liquid that acts as the moderator that absorbs neutrons, the breeder, the magnetic shield, and the heat exchanger -- and has proven to work in molten salt reactor prototypes. And unlike the designs he claims that are &quot;essentially unchanged&quot;, this significantly reduces the cost and mass of the reactor, reduces the so-called &quot;danger&quot; of lithium, and <i>leverages</i> the fact that high energy fusion neutrons travel further, as it increases the efficacy of the liquid blanket.<p>The claim that neutrons will damage the metal structure is also handled by many aspects of the design: easy reparability thanks to modular, segmented magnets, being completely submerged in the liquid blanket, low activation steel for structure, and the pulse design which runs the reactor in a way that reduces overall temperature of the walls.<p>Plus, he brings up the ole aneutronic fusion dream, except that creating a confined Boron-11 plasma is much more difficult, outside the realm of tokamaks, and typically proposes using laser internal confinement fusion at the Petawatt scale.<p>More than 20 papers were published on ARC, heavily vetted in journals like Nature, and pretty much all of the peer review concluded the design will work, and if it does work, then it will be much cheaper than ITER, simpler than ITER, and thus refute your paper.<p>We&#x27;ll know in about 4 years.')
