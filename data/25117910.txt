But dump&#x2F;restore should definitely NOT be the mechanism for upgrades. Postgres has support for in place upgrades with pg_upgrade for some time now. This is the mechanism used on RDS, and the same mechanism we&#x27;ll use on Crunchy Bridge, and what Heroku Postgres uses as well. I&#x27;m not sure that Azure supports in place upgrade yet, and GCP does not per their docs.<p>A dump and restore is simply not viable for a database of any size. 100GB datababase which is not at all in the &quot;large&quot; territory would be down for at least an hour if not longer.<p>Pg_upgrade is generally the right shape of thing for this problem. One could debate whether replication is a better approach for even reducing that down time. (Pg_upgrade is on the order of minutes, it is not a size of data operation but rather a size of catalog operation). But that dump&#x2F;restore is acceptable and the best option isn&#x27;t really the case these days.')
