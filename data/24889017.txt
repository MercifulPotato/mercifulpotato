Another much lighter-weight solution is to simply add a static name&#x2F;ip association in your local &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts file. It&#x27;s a bit brittle, but honestly for a lot of websites its a lot less brittle than you think (and it&#x27;s even <i>more</i> efficient than a Pi-hole). The biggest drawback is that you&#x27;ll have another thing to trouble-shoot if something goes wrong. But that&#x27;s true for any privacy-preserving DNS solution.')
