Item(by='Rabidgremlin', descendants=11, kids=[25502632, 25502564, 25502456], score=2, time=1608605257, title='Ask HN: Help me hack my 30 year old shareware game', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='So I recently found the binaries for a shareware game I released almost 30 years ago. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have the source code so cannot generate the &quot;key&quot; to unlock all the levels of the game. I&#x27;d like to put the unlocked game up on the web.<p>You can play the game here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.rabidgremlin.com&#x2F;gridlok&#x2F; (I&#x27;m pretty amazed you can play an old DOS game in a web browser) and download the game&#x27;s files here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.rabidgremlin.com&#x2F;gridlok&#x2F;gridlok.zip<p>The .zip file has GRIDREG.EXE which was used to create the unlock key. Also I guess it would also be possible to patch GRIDLOK.EXE so that it thinks it&#x27;s registered.<p>Figured it might be a fun challenge for someone out there!')
