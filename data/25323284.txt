Item(by='asamarin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607260314, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322878, text='&gt; and they&#x27;re not screenshots<p>That over there blew my mind, and I had to go back to the page to double-check that. And indeed, it&#x27;s all clever CSS trickery. Digging further into the source, I found that this was generated using the ansi2html [1] library which I had never heard about before. Thanks for the TIL!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pycontribs&#x2F;ansi2html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pycontribs&#x2F;ansi2html</a>')
