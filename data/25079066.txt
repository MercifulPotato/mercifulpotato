IIRC, I was supplementing at 5000IU a day and after a few months wound up with a higher blood level than I was comfortable with, based on the ranges that came with the tests.  After that, I reduced down to 2000IU a day or less.<p>I&#x27;ve been much less into supplements in general, but I only take 2000IU irregularly now.')
