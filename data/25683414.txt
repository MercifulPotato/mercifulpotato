You&#x27;re entitled to your opinion, of course, but your comment reads like someone jumping into an enthusiastic conversation among Star Wars fans to tell everyone how much you dislike Star Wars. I&#x27;m sure you didn&#x27;t intend it that way (based on your later comments), but that&#x27;s how it comes across.')
