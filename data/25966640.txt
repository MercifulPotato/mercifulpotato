But almost universally you will be driving everywhere, so don&#x27;t worry <i>too</i> much about it. Florida is one giant concrete strip mall on top of a swamp. So in general, figure out where you will hang out the most or with whom, and be near there. But also plan to drive a lot. Do you want there to be sidewalks connecting you to the beach &#x2F; grocery store &#x2F; etc? Again you&#x27;ll have to search for those, as it&#x27;s weird not to drive everywhere. And people on bicycles are seen more as target practice than pedestrians.<p>Large metros like Tampa are full of crime and traffic. If you want a &quot;nice&quot; walk to the beach, or you don&#x27;t want your car broken into, you are much better off in a less dense area like Sarasota, Fort Myers, etc. But if you want to hit a few bars&#x2F;clubs, get a little drunk, and have a short cab ride home, you&#x27;ll want to be closer to a metro area. Otherwise you may have a 50 minute drive home after hitting a bar with some friends.<p>Florida is famous for attracting just a few kinds of people, so if you aren&#x27;t in a part of the state full of your kind of people, you may bump up against culture clash. Research neighborhoods in each area to see which one you might fit in with. But also remember that the &quot;Florida Man&quot; isn&#x27;t just a meme, it&#x27;s one of your neighbors.<p>I grew up in Florida, and I really hate it. I don&#x27;t understand why anyone but a retiree would move there. There&#x27;s nothing to do other than sit in your sterile air conditioned house, go to the beach, go to a bar, or get high. And the people are terrible. I still go back for vacation though. It&#x27;s like a bad ex I keep texting just to remember why I left. <i>Oh, right... you&#x27;re dead inside.</i>')
