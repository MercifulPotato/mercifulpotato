For anything I&#x2F;O-heavy, it&#x27;s a mess. You have zero control over how large your I&#x2F;Os are (you&#x27;re very much at the mercy of heuristics that are optimized for loading executables), readahead is spotty at best (practical madvise implementation is a mess), async I&#x2F;O doesn&#x27;t exist, you can&#x27;t interleave compression in the page cache, there&#x27;s no way of handling errors (I&#x2F;O error = SIGBUS&#x2F;SIGSEGV), and write ordering is largely inaccessible. Also, you get issues such as page table overhead for very large files, and address space limitations for 32-bit systems.<p>In short, it&#x27;s a solution that looks so enticing at first, but rapidly costs much more than it&#x27;s worth. As systems grow more complex, they almost inevitably have to throw out mmap.')
