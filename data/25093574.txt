For example (from the wiki page):<p>&gt;  the word evlerinizden, or &quot;from your houses&quot;, consists of the morphemes ev-ler-iniz-den, literally translated morpheme-by-morpheme as house-plural-your-from.<p>It also has a simple subject-object verb structure without a grammatical gender.<p>I find it quite simple to wrap your head around, in the same way python is the go-to language to learn programming, I think it&#x27;s pretty easy for beginners :).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Agglutination" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Agglutination</a>')
