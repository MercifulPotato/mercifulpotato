I noticed the meeting score stuff and made a joke about how the meeting room was watching us. One of the MS people responded with &quot;Yes, it is.&quot; And then they showed us the &quot;telemetry&quot; the room was taking.. IDing us with facial recognition, guessing at our moods, etc. I definitely felt uncomfortable for the rest of the meeting.')
