They&#x27;re both insanely biased echo chambers. It&#x27;s so blatantly obvious too. After finding some propaganda to bash Trump with every single day for the past five years, they&#x27;ll never once in the next four years ever report a negative story about Biden or his administration. Please, go ahead and count how many times it happens. This is something you can verify yourself! Of course the bias rabbit hole goes so much deeper than just that, but they&#x27;re so blatantly, demonstrably, biased that the fact that anyone considers them relatively impartial journalism, any better than Fox News, makes me lose so much hope.')
