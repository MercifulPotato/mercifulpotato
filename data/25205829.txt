It&#x27;s meant to be used on essentially infinite streams of data, such as a live dashboard of latencies of a running server. In that context, providing a 5 element, or any finite list as an example seems like a non sequitur.<p>Your examples do relate to problems the algorithm actually has in this application, but they manifest as things like &quot;extremely large warmup time&quot; and &quot;adjusting to a regime change in the distribution taking time proportional to the change&quot;. For instance if your data is [1000, 1001, 1000, 1001...] then it takes 1000 steps to converge, which may be longer than the user has patience for.<p>However, the algorithm does always converge eventually, as long as the stream is not something pathological like an infinite sequence of consecutive numbers (for which the median is undefined anyhow).')
