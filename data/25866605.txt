Coming from a patchwork self-taught software background it opened my eyes to just how much more there was to CS than &quot;writing code&quot;. So, so much more. I still have a copy in my desk! I had dropped out of the U of U&#x27;s CS program, and this was the first thing that really made me question my decision.<p>I&#x27;ve also admired your work in with Bertrand and I&#x27;m hopeful at the legacy it will leave, and at the future of precision medicine.<p>Thanks!<p>Caleb')
