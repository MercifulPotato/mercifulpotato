They can&#x27;t match parentheses, can&#x27;t make code that runs at all, don&#x27;t know the difference between a string and an int, can&#x27;t distinguish function return from printing. They definitely aren&#x27;t people who have skills in JavaScript, C#, know the basics of Big-O notation and have worked with Python for several years.<p>I&#x27;ll accept his word that he doesn&#x27;t know the details of Python module imports, that he isn&#x27;t an expert, but surely there&#x27;s a difference between &quot;not expert at X&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t know X&quot;?')
