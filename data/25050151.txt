The only hope for escape is a power failure and mercy of someone who is aware you are inside.<p>Stuck in a job completely burned out, there is nothing worse than the realization of the futility in any struggle to either escape or improve. The knowledge that your output has dropped, the feeling that it&#x27;s your fault combined with nobody interested in helping you because they are annoyed about your lack of output. There are no doorhandles on the inside of this washing machine.<p>My only advice is to meow as loud as you can.')
