Reminds me of Milton Friedman&#x27;s &quot;Nobody knows how to make a pencil&quot; essay.<p>A lot of human progress is result of human actions but not planning. Centralized planning around &quot;climate change&quot; would 100% be a recipe for disaster and a monumental failure about which future generations will write for 100s of years just the way we talk about slavery today.<p>Your use of carbon makes my existence on the planet a bit risky and hence you should pay me some compensation. But how much ? That is an impossible task for anyone and not just for the centralized government systems but even for highly efficient private players looking at very small problems. This is something that even outright climate change deniers like me admit.')
