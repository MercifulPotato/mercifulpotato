Specifically, I&#x27;m trusting the person producing the product to do something that e.g. Debian has a proven track record of doing quite well: maintaining dependencies so that I have a secure (and consistent) system altogether...so well that I&#x27;d rather trust them to do it over any existing flatpak vendor, and definitely more than trusting n vendors for the n flatpaks I have installed.<p><i>&gt; The distro approach is great, but it doesn&#x27;t scale well for obvious reasons</i><p>Regarding what aspect doesn&#x27;t it achieve the scale necessary? It&#x27;s not obvious to me what you mean at all.<p><i>&gt; and it makes software development harder due to downstream issues often going reported as upstream issues.</i><p>A cost of system-scale software maintenance, for sure.<p><i>&gt; I appreciate and enjoy the distro approach for what it gives me, but there should always be a way for developers to provide packaging that works everywhere and then distro maintainers can feel free to recompile&#x2F;repackage as they please.</i><p>I don&#x27;t fundamentally disagree. My point is that I think it&#x27;s a security risk to leave it to every developer to maintain their dependencies as they see fit, and that this is a problem that flatpaks create that a well maintained distro software repo doesn&#x27;t have. It&#x27;s better to acknowledge this risk and consider it to grow as you install more flatpaks than to ignore it, expecting that every flatpak vendor will respond in a timely manner to dependency CVEs; the trust I place in Debian—by necessity very high—now has to be multiplied for each individual flatpak.')
