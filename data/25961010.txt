Item(by='edbob', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611947172, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25960219, text='&gt; My company had a zoom conference with a very well respected British doctor, he won something more or less equivalent to a nobel prize in mediciine, and he told my company, on May 4th, that masks are not necessary. This was already a bit head scratching, but what I feel he probably meant, but certainly did not explicitly say- is that its not a priority for an individual to wear a mask when there are shortages for front line workers.<p>This comes off as blatantly lying to us for our harm, not &quot;they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about&quot;. If someone lies to you <i>and knowingly puts your life at risk through the lie</i>, it&#x27;s very rational not to believe anything they say in the future. This is not mere mixed messages.<p>If government and&#x2F;or experts want to have non-negative credibility, they are going to have to start consistently telling the whole truth.')
