My Linux machine is a 2015 Asus UX305 laptop.  Suspend&#x2F;resume works under Ubuntu&#x27;s desktop, but I use i3wm, which requires the user to enable features like that themselves.  I never did get auto-suspend to work, but I was able to get suspend to work when I attached to a hotkey.  So instead of closing lid (or having auto-suspend after, say, 30 minutes inactivity), I just press the hotkey to have the machine suspend.  I grew to prefer this to lid-closing. (Auto-resume always worked fine under i3wm, just press any key and it started up).')
