Item(by='lamename', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604321366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24965154, text='I think a common misunderstanding in this thread, and something not explained in the article, is the difference between internal accounting of animals and publication-level. Labs track animal usage internally in the way you mention, and typically share that information with the university vet, IACUC, etc. but that is simply not useful information to publish.<p>Despite the possibility of differing opinions in this thread, I think the article has not done a good job of explaining the realities of the process, so anyone here who is not familiar with how animal work gets done is coming in with a purist misunderstanding. Everything is reported (in the US), but not in publications.<p>Looking at publications alone for animal accounting would be like if I looked at the checking accounts for everyone in a country and wondered where all the money went. Of course it&#x27;s in savings, investments, cash under the bed... but I only looked in one place. I cannot conclude money is unaccounted for when my search was incomplete by design.')
