If it&#x27;s that tablets and phones are harder to service, it&#x27;s a fairly well known fact. Although some non-apple laptops are fairly hard to service, too. I&#x27;m thinking of some HP Elitebook models we have at work (not sure about the model number).<p>However, my point was that the issue wasn&#x27;t related to the devices being plugged in all day long but to the overheating. I don&#x27;t think a device used as a display would be particularly taxing on the CPU to have it heat up. For example, I&#x27;ve used both the tablet and phone to watch videos for extended periods (&gt;2h) and they got barely warm.')
