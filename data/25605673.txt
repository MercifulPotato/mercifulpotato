Most people have never heard of either instrument, but many would instantly recognize that something is off in that example. Probably the same if you replace a stratacaster, vocoder, etc., in a track they&#x27;re familiar with, especially if you substitute it with something from a different historical period.<p>Other than that, I&#x27;m afraid all that&#x27;s being measured is the effect of lack of funding on basic music education in the U.S. :)')
