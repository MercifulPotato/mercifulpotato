Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=[25431900], score=None, time=1608049565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25429501, text='It&#x27;s impossible to download free apps on iOS (via the App Store) without giving Apple an email address, phone number, and street address.<p>Additionally, opening the App Store app on iOS sends your IP (coarse location) and device serial number to Apple.  Logging in to download associates that serial with your email, street address, and phone number.<p>Every iOS device, and now every mac, connects to the Apple push server with a certificate tied to its serial number, and of course sends the client IP (and thus coarse device location).<p>Apple has your travel history, and the travel history of every iOS device by serial number. As of Big Sur, they have it for each and every mac, too.<p>On the mac, you can&#x27;t install a VPN app without providing your identification to Apple, because the NetworkExtension app entitlements to do that are only given out for App Store apps. This is why windows users can download wireguard from the wireguard website, but mac users cannot. App Store only!<p>I am not really that convinced that Apple cares that much about protecting consumer privacy.')
