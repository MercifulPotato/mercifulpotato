It looks like it does a ton of code generation, and then on the other side you have an extremely clunky way of getting your data in a usable format.<p>I don’t really have a horse in this race (in Clojure there’s no need to map between results and idiomatic data structures in your domain, and you can add as much or as little schema&#x2F;type checking as you want) but in previous lives doing OOP I have never lamented them 5% of problematic SQL queries to the point I’d throw away the rest that an ORM gives me. Just break out into a more powerful query language, hide it behind an interface and you still get to return meaningful objects in your domain.')
