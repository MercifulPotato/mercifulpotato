Several scenes were reported to have caused epileptic seizures&quot;<p>This is why we can&#x27;t have nice things. Stuck up snides, sub-par hardware and a small subset of people with a terrible disability.<p>I&#x27;m not blaming epileptics, but is it really fair that _EVERYONE ALWAYS_ must adapt? Sure, an option to turn off those effects would be nice, but I&#x27;m sure we will just all have to do without them.<p>I am blaming last-gen support, and probably current-gen too, actually, I&#x27;m blaming CDPR for trying to support it in the first place. Just concentrate on making an awesome game on PC, and no, it does not have to run on a 2 year old potato, be cutting edge, set system requirements for tomorrows most high-end gear, if that&#x27;s what it takes to realize the vision, hardware will catch up.<p>Back in the day, DOS games were released that didn&#x27;t run well on anything when they came out, but they turned out to be among the absolute best games of their time! (Carmageddon as an example, came out in 1997, but you needed a computer from 2000 before you could run it smoothly in high-res mode at a good framerate).<p>Now we got this 1.05 update, which is clearly meant for the consoles, sure, there were some story-progression edge-cases fixed, but they also seem to have included the console performance fixes, so now the game looks like crap. View-distance is short, everything fades in and pops up.. Distant car traffic is now clearly 2d sprites, and if you go there, there is not even car.. It seems they introduced the road-population algorithm from &quot;sim city 2000&quot;, so you will now have a section of road fully backed up, and the cars just dissapear when driving into the next section.. You have npc characters that look so much worse now.\nThey basically sacrificed the good game to make it run on the bad hardware.<p>I&#x27;d really like a &quot;Not running on a potato&quot; option, even with every setting at its max, the game looks worse with this patch than before.')
