Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=[25848344], score=None, time=1611123905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25841083, text='&gt; When you connect to a site over HTTPS<p>Right, but if DNS is spoofed then you haven&#x27;t yet connected to the site, you&#x27;ve connected to another site, so none of the security your described is relevant.<p>How does https prevent DNS spoofing? As far as I know, it doesn&#x27;t. You need DNS CAA records. Which your ISP can spoof just like it can intercept your unencrypted sessions.<p>&gt; DNS CAA records (which restrict which certificate authorities can issue certificates for a given domain name) further make this type of mis-issuance harder to carry out and easier to detect.<p>Earlier you talked about people who couldn&#x27;t detect that ads were being injected into their browser. When you say &quot;easier to detect&quot;, are you meaning easier to detect by people who don&#x27;t recognize that their ISP injects ads?<p>Is my readership able to recognize that their ISP is spoofing DNS for a MITM attack?<p>How do <i>I</i>, <i>right now</i> check if my ISP is spoofing my DNS to MITM my access to my https site? &#x27;Cause I have no clue.<p>&gt; However, that scenario is outside of the scope of HTTPS.<p>Which was my point - what is the security threat I should care about?<p>Look, I don&#x27;t disagree that https has its place, and I&#x27;m fine with https on new systems. But again I ask <i>what are the negatives</i>? If I switch my site to https-only, how many people or devices will be negatively impacted?<p>Can you answer that question?<p>&gt; The point of HTTPS is to increase the cost of doing such a thing from near 0 to significantly greater than 0.<p>Which doesn&#x27;t require https-everywhere, only https on most&#x2F;significant number of places.<p>&gt; to sell that data to advertisers<p>I&#x27;ve mentioned that that isn&#x27;t a threat model that I or (I believe) my readership cares about. But let&#x27;s examine it.<p>I can ad a tracking pixel to each of my pages, right? And my readership won&#x27;t notice it? And I could sell that information to advertisers? And I could put Facebook likes and other tracking methods in my pages?<p>And you&#x27;re fine with that at a technical level, since https doesn&#x27;t prevent it.<p>While it&#x27;s touching that you what to ensure that I am part of the profit stream from any monetization of the contents of my site, I don&#x27;t think my readership cares - I certainly don&#x27;t - so it&#x27;s not part of my threat model.<p>&gt; that the FTC asked<p>This is the same government that allows cable monopolies and doesn&#x27;t enact laws to prevent the ISPs from injecting ads into their downloads? Call my a crazy leftist, but I can&#x27;t help but notice that this also strengthens the power of the big advertising companies like Google and Facebook by reducing the amount of competition, and that the FTC is looking at ISP rather than Google and Facebook abuses because the ISPs are relatively weak, making this a politically cheap action on their part.')
