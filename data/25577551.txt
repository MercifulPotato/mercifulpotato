In case your unfamiliar there’s a specific variant of Starship being proposed (and built?) for landing on the lunar surface it’s designed to avoid problems like having those big raptor engines blast tons of lunar dust around. So using starship to loft the payload into orbit on a reusable launcher, and lunar starship to land it re-usably on the moon is probably one of the only near term practical methods to large scale lunar construction, everyone else keeps throwing away expensive hardware.')
