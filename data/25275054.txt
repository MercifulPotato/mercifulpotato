Item(by='Zhyl', descendants=None, kids=[25275734, 25275946], score=None, time=1606903908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25253498, text='I think it&#x27;s worth linking to the &#x27;Notation as a tool of thought&#x27; thread from the other day, as it gave me quite a lot to read, watch and think about [0].<p>It also reminds me of Graphical Linear Algebra [1] which I occasionally see mentioned here. And, as included in my comment in that thread, the notion of using Tau as the circle constant in equations [2].<p>Notation is a weird topic to tackle. Like with new technologies or languages on HN, there seem to be those who get [a new notation when it is proposed] and evangelise it, and those who see it as pointless and vocally dismiss it. Posts like the article where you&#x27;re weighing up and exploring benefits and limitations of notation seem rare - and even those that do exist seem to be pitching for their new notation to be a global replacement rather than as a pedagogical or epistemological tool.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25249563" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25249563</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graphicallinearalgebra.net&#x2F;about&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graphicallinearalgebra.net&#x2F;about&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tauday.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tauday.com</a>')
