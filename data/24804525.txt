What a well-written, beautifully-worded article. This is what makes HN special: this piece of writing wouldn&#x27;t show up anywhere else.<p>Speaking of HN and Silicon Valley, I see parallels. There are people who worked at creating the site and using it as a source of bright, idealistic young minds whom they could profit off of. They continue to work on keeping the site a good place to &#x27;live in&#x27;. Did HN grow by happenstance and &#x27;nature&#x27;? You bet. But you can&#x27;t deny the unseen hands of the many people who keep HN habitable.<p>Likewise, Silicon Valley is also no accident, although it has benefited greatly from happenstance and nature. Before SV, there was Lockheed Martin, and NASA, and further down south, Douglas Aircraft. Even today, the benefactors of Lockheed and co. indirectly fund Stanford, Berkeley, and many other places that continue to draw people from all over the world.<p>But I strongly feel that if it takes hold, the current trend of (some) technology workers&#x27; activism will be the coup de grace that finishes SV off for good.')
