I&#x27;m not very familiar with how these things work, but I wonder why plugins written for a given engine (say webkit) wouldn&#x27;t work on all browsers using that engine. In the case of qutebrowser it uses chromium under the hood, so I would expect extensions that work on chromium to work on qutebrowser, just as most chromium limitations also apply to qutebrowser.')
