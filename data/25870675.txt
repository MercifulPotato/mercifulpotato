How do they pay? The owner gets government contracts in other industries or the government buys ads or issues as public service.<p>In lest corrupt countries but still with corrupt journalistic ethics the news becomes the ads.<p>The entire tech journalism business revolve around this. Give me good reviews and I will send you demo units, I will take you to a camp and will give you real good accommodation and slap a paid promotion video order as an extra.<p>extra governmental political journalism is also not any better. You become a mouthpiece for a political group and the funnel money to sustain your publication.<p>You can tap ads business for the stuff that is not allowed to be openly advertised. For example, in some places where doctors are not allowed to advertise the news channels will offer an interview about certain illness in exchange of payment from the interviewer.  The news sites get their content and get paid for it, the doctors get their name on news articles that looks legit journalistic work.<p>It&#x27;s really unfortunate.')
