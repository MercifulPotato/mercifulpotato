It can cause surprising problems if you don&#x27;t check the dev board manual&#x27;s pin table, or don&#x27;t know how to interpret it. Additionally, you need to plug the jumpers into the bottom of the board; it looks like you can use the top, but the jumpers tend to fall out!<p>The nucelo ones are even weirder. The pins aren&#x27;t labeled on the board, and they&#x27;re in a weird layout, with some male and others female.')
