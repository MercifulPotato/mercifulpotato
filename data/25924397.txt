Of course military requirements are factored in, but design responsibilities and final authority for use are in civilian hands, by law. That&#x27;s why the Department of Energy is a separate entity from the Department of Defense.<p>Obviously the military could make mistakes when the weapons are in their custody, but civilian designs make sure those mistakes don&#x27;t cause an unplanned detonation. Nor can a rogue military unit arbitrarily decide to start WW III. If they tried, the weapons would turn into bricks.')
