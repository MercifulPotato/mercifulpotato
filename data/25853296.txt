GitHub could refuse to take it down and in doing so accept liability for any copyright infringement that exists. If the repository is not infringing (which in this case there&#x27;s a solid chance it&#x27;s not), then GitHub is doing nothing wrong. Of course, since the penalties for copyright infringement are so high and defending suits would not be worth it for GitHub, they are effectively required to take it down.')
