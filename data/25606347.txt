As a developer (non game), work from home works well, you save yourself a commute but lose out on launch with your co-workers. The rest is pretty much the same.<p>As a manager, director or exec though, where your role is to review the work of developers, and plan their next move, you feel an added challenge from work from home. The distance makes it harder to have a grasp on what work is being done and how well&#x2F;fast, and what impact. You can&#x27;t as easily come in and check-in when you need too, you need to formally setup meetings or reviews. And it&#x27;s not as engaging or easy for you to understand and ask questions in those meetings either. Also it&#x27;s unpleasant to be on Zoom all day long, and since your job is just meetings all day, that&#x27;s your new reality.<p>This becomes truer and truer the higher up the chain. So a dev manager might still enjoy the freedom of work from home, less commute time, able to do home chors while they work and all. But a VP will feel less benefits, since they already have a lot of luxuries, maybe they have a Nani, a nice home closer to work, etc. And a CEO will feel even less, maybe they have a helicopter, a chef, and they already chose where the office was based on where they want to live.')
