It&#x27;s the cheapest possible intervention. If wearing a mask helps, it actually sucks the wind out of the sails of people who want draconian lockdowns. People with a libertarian bent should be even more pro-masks, since it&#x27;s very nearly the only thing that everyone can do in their personal lives to try stave off massive government interventions.<p>If people can&#x27;t mentally separate masks from the other interventions then that seems like a problem in itself.')
