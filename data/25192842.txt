It&#x27;s my first tech job though, and we use C# at work to the extent that matters.<p>The kind of Python I write off the clock probably isn&#x27;t a good example of waiting on the DB though. It&#x27;s usually a thin wrapper around C or assembly (or calling into such a library via numpy, networkx, etc) to do something horrendously expensive that I absolutely would not want to run in vanilla cpython. That said, when I do ordinaryish web-related stuff in Python I&#x27;m looking at well under 20ms total elapsed time per call, which is why your ~200ms html rendering time stuck out to me.')
