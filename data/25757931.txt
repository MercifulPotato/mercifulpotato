Item(by='tachyonbeam', descendants=None, kids=[25758360, 25758025], score=None, time=1610510561, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25746131, text='TL;DR: data about us being collected, saved and published by social media makes us all more risk-averse when it comes to expressing our opinions online.<p>I tend to agree. I have a twitter account and I try to never get into political discussions there, because I know that expressing the &quot;wrong&quot; opinion could cost me my job, as it has others. Even expressing something that I view as positive and encouraging could be misinterpreted. I feel like around 2000-2005, there wasn&#x27;t so much pressure to be politically correct. People could discuss ideas more freely. That being said, I was younger too, and less risk-averse.<p>That being said, I also remember that in the early YouTube days, comment threads were completely filled with hate. There were people posting messages like &quot;you&#x27;re ugly, you should kill yourself&quot; constantly. You&#x27;d look at these people&#x27;s accounts and you saw all the comments they posted. There were trolls who would just run around and post hate comments, particularly on LGBT videos. I really wished that someone would delete these accounts and all their associated comments, but YouTube did absolutely nothing about it for years. It was pretty depressing.')
