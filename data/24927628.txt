Item(by='Jemaclus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603950144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24927193, text='I think my boss is a VP with 5 people, including myself, under him. I do covet his role. I&#x27;m not sure what the &quot;something different&quot; you are referring to might be, but I&#x27;m going to assume it&#x27;s <i>his</i> role.<p>To answer the top-line question: my boss is one of the smartest people I know. I disagree with some of his decisions. He&#x27;s made some mistakes, including what I think was a huge one today. But he&#x27;s super super smart.<p>Your title question and the question in your description are conflating intelligence with title. You don&#x27;t need a super intelligent person to be VP. You just need someone with, to quote Liam Neeson, a particular set of skills. You can be the smartest person in the world, but with no experience, you probably won&#x27;t be a good VP. There&#x27;s a set of skills good VPs have that aren&#x27;t borne of intellect but of experience and the passage of time.<p>Is my boss smarter than I? I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;d probably say yes; he&#x27;d probably disagree.<p>Do I think I can do my boss&#x27;s job? Absolutely. I can certainly take his job, and if something were to happen to him, I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;d be a top contender for his position. But even as I think my boss and I are probably on an even playing field when it comes to intelligence, he has experience and time on his side... so while I could certainly see myself doing his job, it would be quite some time before I&#x27;d be able to do it as well as he.')
