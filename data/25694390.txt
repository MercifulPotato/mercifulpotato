I just don&#x27;t get why a bunch of different features makes websites any different. It really just sound like a marketing buzzword too me, not backed by any meaningful technical paradigm change. What makes them &#x27;progressive&#x27;?<p>To me the problem with webapps in general or (rich internet applications) is that the developer has very little control over caching or storage since it&#x27;s very dependent on the whims of browser engine.')
