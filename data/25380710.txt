I&#x27;ve been using Vue for 3 years, and laravel since 2013. My depression and anxiety over current events, turning forty mixed with some burnout has led to a very rough six months. We had to use gofund me for the rent for the past two months. We had to get on SNAP.<p>An old friend wanted help with wordpress (I hate wordpress), but had to take it. I jumped at $30&#x2F;hour for 5 hours of work, just so we could put gas in the car, and get a few gifts for our toddler&#x27;s for Christmas.<p>Not everybody on HN is doing great making 6-7 figure incomes. My best year, I maybe did 70k. My hourly is $40, generally as a freelance dev, even though others get $100, I&#x27;ve not once been able to secure that kind of pay. At 41, I&#x27;m getting a bit frustrated with the life, I had dreams of building a SaaS but just getting out of bed is so hard lately.<p>Or I just want to spend every waking minute w&#x2F; my kids, cause I have this dread that Covid will take me, and I&#x27;ll miss out on valuable moments with them. My wife&#x27;s never had a depressed day in her life, until this year, she&#x27;s on anti-depressants now, her mom died in August from cancer. Usually she&#x27;d keep me out of my depression, now I have to find a way to pull her out of hers.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more people in this thread who are in the demographic, than you think are. Lots of people go to HN and Reddit startup threads to get ideas to break out of poverty. (That&#x27;s why I learned to code in the first place).')
