That said, Jake&#x27;s not being completely truthful about the risks here. The office he worked in (TAO and Specifically the ROC), was a volunteer office, and it was made clear what your actions could lead to. Future travel restrictions and concerns were brought up for this exact reason, just as anyone working field work is given the explanation. In a more basic awareness, simply working a position that is cleared, has you go through plenty of discussions &#x2F; classes &#x2F; onboarding videos, that discuss the risks.<p>At the end of the day, he has to accept that he is accountable for his action as should others, it comes with the job.<p>I&#x27;m more concerned with how candid Jake is (as are most of is former co-workers), but that&#x27;s another story for another day and not really related here...')
