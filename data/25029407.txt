That naturally leads to government having right to demand a detailed explanation to any speech and actions to the full understanding&#x2F;satisfaction by the government. I mean that belly dance moves may be an encrypted sequence carrying an secret message. Now, try to prove (to the full satisfaction of that polite government bureaucrat) that is isn&#x27;t.<p>Conspiracy theory - wise : how about an idea that the authorities let the terrorist act to happen (as they had been warned in advance about the guy) in order to have pretext to make further push for tightening of the screws ( Belarus has just again shown the power of social media communication channels and that couldn&#x27;t have been missed by the powers-to-be). I mean it is kind of curious how immediately after the terrorist act where AK-47 was used there is an attack on encryption instead of say on AK-47 sales.')
