Seriously, I can&#x27;t fucking find my playlists. I can&#x27;t organize them. I can&#x27;t search for them. I can&#x27;t even easily create new ones by dragging multiple songs into them. And the icing on the cake is they get polluted with my decade old playlists from YouTube.<p>I absolutely detest YouTube music. It&#x27;s <i>only</i> redeeming feature is a halfway decent radio and it&#x27;s library ripped from YouTube proper. Everything else about is a worse user experience by almost every metric.')
