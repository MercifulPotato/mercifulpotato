For example references vs. values and how this affects closures. Why have a lexical scopes? All this stuff which confuses the fuck out of new programmers, might be simpler if they learned C first.<p>I think this can trip newbies up. Especially from bootcamps, who don&#x27;t understand why their code is working, and I feel like replying with &quot;well think about how the object is stored in memory&quot; because none of the stuff that&#x27;s built on that will make sense without it. I&#x27;d like to understand more myself. It would be useful to have some idea of what the compiler is doing with things like lexical scopes. I think that&#x27;s the only way to really understand them as the abstractions are too leaky.')
