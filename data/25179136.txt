I already use my own domain for my main personal and business email addresses and I&#x27;ve also set up email addresses for several family members on that domain. So, if I moved to a paid plan, I&#x27;d not just be paying for one email address but about 8 or 9 --either that or face the unpleasant task of explaining to family members that they now needed to pay to continue using the email addresses they&#x27;ve had for years.<p>I also have a few other domains that only I have email addresses on and I run the email for those through Gmail and Yandex Mail&#x27;s servers.<p>I&#x27;ve also got a few other email addresses @gmail.com and @yandex.com which I use for less important stuff like signing up for forums &#x2F; websites and the like.  So, I wouldn&#x27;t want to be replacing them with a paid plan either --given they&#x27;re not used for anything important.<p>So in essence, &quot;free&quot; [and reliable] is more important than &quot;secure&quot;. I&#x27;m not majorly unhappy with my current setup, but I&#x27;m always open for giving rival services a try out, just to chip away at the stranglehold the big boys have on the market.')
