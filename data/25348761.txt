Some platforms have an outdated library and no reasonable update method. Some platforms have nasty bugs in their libraries. Some platforms have very inconsistent libraries depending on version. You might want to send extensions the platform library doesn&#x27;t support (SNI used to be pretty hard to use), or to manage the acceptable CA roots (which I understand you dislike). You might want more control over ciphers, so as not to offer ciphers that are outdated. Having one buggy library you ship with your code is better than dealing with a different buggy platform library for each platform.')
