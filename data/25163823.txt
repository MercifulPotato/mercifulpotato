There are tests we&#x27;ve run and the results are promising, but the true large scale inoculations haven&#x27;t happened.<p>All things point to these as being safe, but until it&#x27;s more widely dispersed I don&#x27;t think you can assert it as having the same safety as most modern inoculations.<p>Cautious optimism isn&#x27;t a bad thing, nor is hesitance to taking the vaccine. Its not really your place to convince them it is safe, that&#x27;s for them to decide with the facts on hand. Provide them info on the tests, share whatever you have, but it&#x27;s ok to not trust the speed at which these vaccines were made.')
