Talk about carbon taxes is hinting at this in a very basic and limited way.  But for starters, information about what money is used for should be integrated with transactions.<p>And actually money distribution largely embodies power distribution.  This should also be explicitly tracked and integrated into the information system in regards to things like real ability to move resources or military assets etc.<p>You just are not going to get real security or any degree of equality between nation states or sustainability without resolving the core cultural, political, and technical problems.  But at least an emphasis on high technology gives a hint of hope of starting to address these things in a sane manner.')
