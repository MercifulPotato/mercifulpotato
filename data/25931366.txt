I&#x27;m old enough that I only had internet at home when I turned 18, in hindsight I feel like I dodged a bullet.<p>I grew up with uneducated parents who are susceptible to believing bullshit peddled by cult leaders.  I lived in their business, without access to other people since we lived in a business area with no other residents.<p>Access to the internet was the only way I was able to interact with educated adults, and I attribute it to as the main reason for my economic and social success as an adult.<p>There was also lots of gore&#x2F;pornography&#x2F;other explicit stuff, although social media was more limited to instant messengers and photo&#x2F;video content of yourself was not a thing yet. But the upside was almost limitless with the access to all the information, experts, and ability to interact with someone you can learn something from.')
