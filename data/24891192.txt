(Presuming no limitations like affordability, literally can&#x27;t fit a desk in their bedsit, etc.)<p>Anyone who consciously thought desktops were a good idea to move away from in the above case made an initial, much bigger mistake. (Again presuming it was a general lifestyle choice and not some necessity.)<p>It&#x27;s as simple as answering the following question:<p>Would you rather have a) a tiny monitor with a bunch of expensive fragile dying-to-have-coffee-spilled-on-it shit jutting way out at you in the horizontal, always at a weird angle or too low or b) a couple of big beautiful monitors and loads of desk space? If you think you can have both, you&#x27;re probably wrong. Even a nice dock setup requires you to do things like install brackets under the desk to shove your laptop in to, and disable its monitor lest it become a weird bastard screen full of junk you have no intention of looking at.<p>All the docks and laptop stands and extra monitors in the world can&#x27;t solve the problem that laptops are broadly speaking, unpleasant to use. I think the only times I&#x27;ve actually been grateful to have my expensive and pretty laptop, are during power outs - watching netflix in bed. Though the whole setup is reliant on a well practiced construction of pillows and an external bluetooth speaker because no laptop has ever been made with speakers worth the power they draw.<p>If you can even remotely get away with not using one, don&#x27;t use one.')
