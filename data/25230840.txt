So I can access the app on &quot;localhost:3000&quot; as usual? (OAuth setups make the app URL a pain to change)<p>- Is there a way to &quot;mount&quot; local volumes on the docker instance? (Reaction Commerce mounts the code folder as a volume. Altough that project has other issues, that&#x27;s the main thing that kept me from using it).')
