OO is bad because it promotes writing logic with free variables and context. Logic that relies on free variables and context is inherently less modular. Lack of modularity is the root of all structural technical debt.<p>While FP doesn’t force someone to eliminate context or free variables it certainly does not promote writing logic that includes it by default. This generally leads to more modular code. Hence the reason why FP just &quot;feels&quot; better to practitioners and leads to people promoting it without clear reasoning. This in turn makes the promotion of FP seem &quot;ideological.&quot;<p>Maximizing modularity in code requires greater restrictions then the ones FP provides, but FP in general is heading in the right direction.')
