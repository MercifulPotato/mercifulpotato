The study that arguably kicked off the whole debated from Didier Raoult does not meet your criteria. It does include azithromycin, but it is on already hospizalized patients and doesn&#x27;t include zinc.<p>There are also quite a lot of other HCQ studies, many with azithromycin and some also given very early before significant symptoms appeared (see one example here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2016638" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2016638</a>). They also didn&#x27;t find any benefit to HCQ.<p>The insistence on these very specific criteria is just blatantly moving the goalposts. There simply isn&#x27;t enough indications that HCQ works, and plenty of evidence that it doesn&#x27;t to justify even more large studies than it already got. This is arguably a huge misallocation of resources based on very flimsy initial evidence.')
