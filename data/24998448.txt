In this case, JSON.NET pulls the XML reader, DataSets, and many huge libraries that are generally not needed. In Uno, we generally don&#x27;t AOT those libraries and use the interpreter for that (otherwise the payload would explode).<p>Such libraries need to be changed to be configurable, and dynamically enable dependencies as per the user&#x27;s needs.<p>Conversely, many pieces of code are excluded by configuration because of reflection uses, but the .NET team is improving that scenario (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;performance-improvements-in-net-5&#x2F;#trimming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;performance-improvemen...</a>) with attributes to tag dependencies and hint the linker.')
