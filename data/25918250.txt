My first real fear of &quot;ghosts&quot; as a child was from a sleep paralysis episode where I had the usual hallucinations that go with it.<p>Every morning when I &quot;wake&quot; into sleep paralysis, I&#x27;m lucky if I&#x27;m shaken awake because I can signal it with my breathing. Either way, I will wake up after some struggle... and it is so exhausting that I will sometimes fall back asleep, only have sleep paralysis again. It means I wake up stressed!<p>A bonus is that I also &quot;fall&quot; into sleep paralysis when going to bed. Having to make up to 4 attempts to fall asleep can be frustrating...<p>Here is the combo! I can barely breathe through my nose, so if I experience sleep paralysis whilst I&#x27;m on my side, front, or somehow under the covers, I will feel like I&#x27;m suffocating... when I pull out of it, my eyes will feel strained and on rare occasions bloodshot.<p>&quot;you look terrible you should get some sleep&quot;')
