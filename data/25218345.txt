Being a part of product teams, I&#x27;ve noticed &quot;platform&quot; teams struggle and the reasons have mostly been not doing what you&#x27;ve pointed out above. As in, instead of working with their customers (i.e., other product teams) to identify <i>their</i> problems and fix them, they would  push down their generic platforms down the throat. It invariably didn&#x27;t end well.<p>I tend to think that platform&#x2F;framework teams within a large orgs should be run as a B2B SAAS, at least with that mindset.<p>Also, if a platform team isn&#x27;t run well, it ends up being the first one on the chopping block during layoffs. Uber laid off an entire developer-platform team earlier this year. One casualty was the Screenflow team, a promising product that didn&#x27;t gain wider adoption due to terrible marketing&#x2F;evangelism.')
