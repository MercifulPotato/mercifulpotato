For a while it seemed like the v2 was expensive and&#x2F;or hard to get with the cable.  Also have an early Intel RealSense camera around somewhere but I don&#x27;t know how well supported it would be.  I know OBS has specific Kinect functionality built in so that sounds like it would be interesting to mess with.')
