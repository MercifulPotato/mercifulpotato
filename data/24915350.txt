Often about stresses that are not necessarily obvious but also obvious.<p>Travel and living in a foreign country is stressful. (Havana syndrome)<p>Working in a factory on a low wage is stressful (mass fainting)<p>Sex Stuff (Penises stealing)<p>But while you ignore the real reason and blame something else, that&#x27;s not good.
