But sure, say we did.<p>Assuming more or less linear increases, instead of 1-2% you get 10-20%. Let&#x27;s also ignore the large temporary decrease in supply and price stickiness of rent.<p>You &quot;paused&quot; rent increases by 1.5-3.5 years. For something that will likely take more than ten years to accomplish. And then there&#x27;s not much more that can be done.<p>If instead you increased supply by 30% in affordable housing (which is much more reasonable, and of course you could do more or add some market rate housing on the top), build very strong public transit systems and allowed construction of high density private housing away from the city centre, and implement rent control, you will do much, much more than stopping 1.5-3 years of rent increases and then not being able to do much. You will actually have a durable solution.')
