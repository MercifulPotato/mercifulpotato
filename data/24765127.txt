There are things in the middle. Even Java lets you avoid many silly typing errors and if you use something like Kotlin (and you use it well, not just as a slightly more modern Java), you can IMHO get quite far in terms of correctness for typical web backends.<p>Now the power of languages like Haskell may be warranted in more complex scenarios and I don&#x27;t want to claim there are no benefits to it, but there are degrees in between the madness that is JS and something like Haskell.')
