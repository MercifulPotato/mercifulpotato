Apple TV is a good example of that, it&#x27;s highly curated.<p>Books are really bad though. Amazon is no better, neither have any modicum of curation or taste when it comes to their bestsellers lists. The New York Times doesn&#x27;t put salacious romance novels at the top no matter how many copies sell, yet Amazon and Apple Books would lead you to believe there&#x27;s nothing else being published.<p>The same goes for the App Store. It doesn&#x27;t need moderation by way of censorship, it just needs tasteful, manual curation.')
