Often if you just try to treat symptoms the disease gets worse.  We have a large fraction of the U.S. population that is disenfranchised&#x2F;unhappy with things.  It is various things.  It might be things like gay marriage becoming federally enforced allowed.  It might be higher taxes.  It might be mainstream media&#x2F;big-tech political asymmetry.  It might be big govt vs not.  It might be being priced out of your hometown because of people moving in.  I&#x27;m not saying any of these things are bad or good - just saying that what are we going to do to actually heal?  Voting your people in power and ignoring a very large demographic is not going to heal anything.  It will make things worse.  We have to engage with each other - not disengage.')
