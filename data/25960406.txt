In fact, in the last 4 months or so I&#x27;ve only had one compositor crash, which also wrecked the framebuffer until I restarted so I assume it was an amdgpu bug.<p>I do not use Firefox so I cannot comment on that, I&#x27;m using Brave (which is based on Chromium 88) and the ozone backend is working fine after a rocky start. The only application that gives me trouble is Zoom where it likes to crash on start and I need to fake being in GNOME through envs in order to enable desktop sharing (and even then, I have to do it through the webcam interface).')
