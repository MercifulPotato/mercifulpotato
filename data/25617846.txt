No, you will not make the same money here as in Seattle, it&#x27;s often something like a 1&#x2F;3rd pay cut. That is not a bad income however, it is easily enough to rent and whilst real estate in Vancouver proper may be expensive there is reliable transit and property in the other cities such as Burnaby, Richmond, Coquitlam etc is significantly less expensive.<p>I&#x27;m also not quite sure what you mean with your point about healthcare. MSP premiums were eliminated last year [0], there is now no charge to access medical care. Prescriptions, dental and eye care are all still chargeable, though prescriptions at least are essentially capped through BC Fair Pharmacare [1].<p>Compared to the US, Canada is much easier for immigration as a tech worker. One can get PR (equivalent of a green card) before landing if they have a sufficient points score, in BC that&#x27;s fairly easy through the tech PNP [2] and a willing employer.<p>Additionally Vancouver consistently ranks among the top 10 most liveable cities [3].<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.gov.bc.ca&#x2F;gov&#x2F;content&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-drug-coverage&#x2F;msp&#x2F;bc-residents&#x2F;premiums" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.gov.bc.ca&#x2F;gov&#x2F;content&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-drug-covera...</a><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.gov.bc.ca&#x2F;gov&#x2F;content&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-drug-coverage&#x2F;pharmacare-for-bc-residents&#x2F;who-we-cover&#x2F;fair-pharmacare-plan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.gov.bc.ca&#x2F;gov&#x2F;content&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-drug-covera...</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.welcomebc.ca&#x2F;Immigrate-to-B-C&#x2F;B-C-Provincial-Nominee-Program&#x2F;BC-PNP-Tech-Pilot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.welcomebc.ca&#x2F;Immigrate-to-B-C&#x2F;B-C-Provincial-Nom...</a><p>[3] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Global_Liveability_Ranking" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Global_Liveability_Ranking</a>')
