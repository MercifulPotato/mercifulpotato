Item(by='ojnabieoot', descendants=None, kids=[25321973, 25318559], score=None, time=1607202928, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25318040, text='&gt; It&#x27;s unconstitutional for the government to close down businesses without due process, even if it&#x27;s done with good intentions.<p>No it isn’t. That’s just not true. The government can do it in an emergency like pandemic, after a failed sanitation inspection, after a crime, etc. You can’t just say<p>&gt; It&#x27;s unconstitutional for the executive branch to make arbitrary decisions without representative input,<p>No it isn’t. This just isn’t true. For starters the decision is obviously not arbitrary. And “representative input” - Jesus. You can’t just make up stuff that isn’t in the constitution and claim that something you don’t like is therefore unconstitutional.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not legal to confine the majority of people in a state to their homes, whether they&#x27;ve been diagnosed with a transmissible disease or not.<p>Again this just isn’t true and has never been true.<p>One of the most frustrating things of this year is dealing with dangerous ignorant bullshit from people like yourself.')
