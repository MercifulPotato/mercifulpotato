Item(by='0xcde4c3db', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605575791, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25114259, text='It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve read about it, and I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but my recollection is that geohot said he deliberately kept his PS3 offline once it was compromised, and Sony&#x27;s counterargument was (in effect, via some truly mind-bending equivocation) that geohot compromised <i>the PS3</i> (the abstract computer for which authorization presumably proceeds from Sony) as opposed to <i>his PS3</i> (the specific computer for which authorization presumably proceeds from geohot). Since <i>the PS3</i> interacts with PSN, geohot had thereby gained unauthorized access to a computer used in interstate and foreign commerce.<p>It&#x27;s one of those arguments for which I have a hard time deciding whether it&#x27;s fiendishly clever, gratuitously obfuscated, or jaw-droppingly stupid.')
