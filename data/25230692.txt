I think people should combine tools more. E.g. I use GUI tools to edit cells in a data frame e.g. But I do the processing in a programming language. Sometimes I may use Apple Numbers to create the visualization. When doing something visual such as creating plots, deciding colors, labels etc then a GUI tool is often more practical.<p>But the actual data processing seems a lot more practical with a programming language, as you got version control. Keep processing steps separate from data. Can modularize it etc.')
