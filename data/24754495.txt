Those that do report it get &quot;Works for me (TM)!&quot; --or perhaps &quot;Try a different distro (TM)!&quot;-- in response instead of anything helpful, so why bother?<p>Even someone like me has long since stopped reporting bugs to Linux Desktop projects because of the above, and the fact that a lot of times the bug has been in the issue tracker for years so clearly no one gives a damn anyway.')
