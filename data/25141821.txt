These frameworks have made me lazy. I think CSS design is pretty much exactly the same as any craftsmanship job - there is so much pleasure from building it from the ground up. No, I still get the knots in the wood out by using reset.css.<p>Also, I try to not use class selectors as much as possible. HTML looks sterile and spartan with only a handful of span tags or id tags for very specialized targetted changes.<p>I can see why people use frameworks - its fast and quick. But you lose personality in the outcome.')
