I don&#x27;t want to spend my life making music playlists - I just want to play music. I don&#x27;t always want to play an entire album either. What I&#x27;m saying is - if I&#x27;ve &quot;added to my library&quot; or I&#x27;ve &quot;loved&quot; a bunch of stuff, it would be so great if there were a <i>convenient</i> way for these services to auto-build playlists or just let me shuffle my whole library.')
