A full Linux desktop is a combination of software from many different people, targeting the hardware of companies that really couldn&#x27;t care less about Linux. Yeah there will be hiccups. Most can be avoided by picking the right hardware and consulting good online sources. And once you solve them they&#x27;ll be gone for good.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Linux is for everyone, just that it absolutely is usable, and in my opinion it&#x27;s absolutely worth the trade-offs.')
