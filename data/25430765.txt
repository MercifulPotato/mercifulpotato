Kate was amazing for simple editing of multiple documents for small projects where a full IDE was overkill.<p>With KDE 4, Kate became &quot;literally unusable&quot; for me, because it no longer re-uses a word you searched for in other editor tabs.<p>So you search for &quot;size_t&quot; in one open document and press F3 to go to the next ones. Then you open a different document and press F3, and it doesn&#x27;t search for &quot;size_t&quot; anymore! In the KDE 3.5 version of Kate, that worked correctly. Also other things made search worse like integrating it in a tiny thing at the bottom rather than a proper dialog.<p>I discovered and switched to Geany then, which is similar to Kate but better in almost all aspects and more configurable.')
