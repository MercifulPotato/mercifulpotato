There have certainly been some horrifying cases. But, how common is it? How fast is it being taken down? And how long ago are the incidents being referenced? PornHub has done a lot in the past year to crack-down on problematic content, even before the purge.<p>He focuses a lot on &quot;things promoted towards pedophiles&quot;. But, he admits on many occasions, that the vast majority of the content (even in the problematic keywords) isn&#x27;t problematic, and therefore, might just be simulated.<p>He hasn&#x27;t said how common the child porn is. He assumes there is a lot of it, although all indicators show it is low (there may be a lot more which hasn&#x27;t been detected, but he seems to have dug really deep into the site).<p>This isn&#x27;t to excuse someone posting child porn or running a site which is likely to get such content with insufficient moderation. However, how big is the problem on there? Is there anyone who has quantified it? I am very curious to know.<p>* I am not familiar with PornHub or those keywords. I am just going by what other people have said about this issue.')
