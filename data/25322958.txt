I try to post some updates and insights on @flockingbird@fosstodon.org as well.<p>Not sure if this is an appropriate thread to drop this, but since you asked:<p>The idea is simple, though: you have a profile on which you put contact details, a list of aspirations and competences. Each such data can be kept private, shared public, or within your network. You add people to your contact list, tag them, keep notes on them or add rich oneway relations (Foo has worked for Bar, from datex to datey at Acmeinc.). Basic crm features. Again, each such data has several privacy levels.<p>You can search through your contacts and search through the contacts of your contacts. E.g. if you need to find a translater, but don&#x27;t know any yourself, one of your contacts might know one, and might have shared some data, notes, tags and relations with that translator.<p>A &#x27;network&#x27; is basically a server, instance, in fediverse-speak. An instance would be hosted by your startup-hub, coworking-space, university, etc. You register with one (or more) such instance, and become part of that community, but can add anyone from any other instance, as long as they have a public profile.')
