Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[24686095], score=None, time=1601890819, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24685986, text='Because once a thread is done with all available work, it has to sleep&#x2F;wait, the only other alternative is busy waiting(awful idea). So if you see ok, there is no more available work, and call sleep(1), and some more work comes in 2ms later, that work might not be picked up for a whole next 14ms. That is the core of the problem.<p>Like, you are focusing on the sleep(1) part too much - what I want to do is &quot;wait until there is more work available to process, and then wake up and start processing as soon as physically possible&quot;. On Windows the &quot;as soon as physically possible&quot; part is unfortunately 16ms in most cases, and that&#x27;s just not acceptable for something as precise as audio work.')
