The requirements mostly were:<p>- We needed the raw pixels as output. This was SDL, and the game was purely pixel based. Should also support alpha channel &#x2F; transparency if possible. Also we would need to be in full control of all input events (keyboard inputs, mouse clicks), and have some easy way to handle some events like button clicks etc.<p>- Cross-platform (at least Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android, and potentially more). Should also be easy to build, and not have much dependencies.<p>- It should be a small dependency (WebKit was way overkill; or maybe you can build a stripped down version?).<p>We gave up. Although we didn&#x27;t really needed all the modern HTML features, and also no JS. I guess for a projects like yours, you have somewhat different requirements.<p>I wonder if it is worth it to fork an existing browser (Chromium, Firefox) for your purpose. But this is probably impossible to maintain and keep in sync with upstream.<p>I wonder whether there are other simple ways to hook into the browser. After all, you are in control of the OS, and you can inject some code. On MacOSX, there was actually some nice way to script things like this. But I think they restricted that very much now.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;albertz&#x2F;Pyjector" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;albertz&#x2F;Pyjector</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;albertz&#x2F;chromehacking&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;chromehacking.py" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;albertz&#x2F;chromehacking&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;chromeh...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;src.chromium.org&#x2F;viewvc&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;branches&#x2F;874&#x2F;src&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;common&#x2F;mac&#x2F;cfbundle_blocker.mm?pathrev=105568" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;src.chromium.org&#x2F;viewvc&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;branches&#x2F;874&#x2F;src&#x2F;chro...</a>')
