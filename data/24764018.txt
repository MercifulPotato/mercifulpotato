The main reason it is like that, is because if I limit anything on the personal license I would have to take care of existing customers and provide them with new business licenses, provide a way to distribute different userTrack versions and make sure the auto-updater always updates to the correct version. It is something that I have considered, but I preferred to focus on improving the product as I am a techincal personal and I am still struggling to improve my sales&#x2F;business skills without feeling that I over-charge people or force them to pay more than they can afford.<p>&gt; Also, monthly pricing for self-hosted is sort of strange. Really consider switching to annual license pricing ONLY<p>This is a really good suggestion and I will do it really soon. Initially I wanted to also provide an annual option, but there were too many options to choose from (Monthly, Annual, Lifetime).<p>&gt; Really consider switching to annual license pricing ONLY<p>Are you also suggesting to drop the lifetime plan? The main reason why the lifetime plan exists is that previously userTrack was sold on CodeCanyon, where the lifetime plan is the only option. After that I kept it as, personally, I hate paying recurrent fees for a product (eg. I preferred Photoshop CS6 a lot more than CC with its subscription, just let me &quot;buy&quot; the product). I understand that by having only a lifetime plan it is a lot harder to keep maintaining it and have consistent revenue: what if sales suddenly stop, do I stop working on the product?<p>I am still experiment with pricing, and I will try the annual pricing only. Thanks a lot for the suggestion!')
