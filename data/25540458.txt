Are the bindings for other languages usable? Is it possible to have my frontend emit LLVM IR in a text format, similarly to how you can feed assembly language source code to an asssembler? Or should one really just bite the bullet and use C++ to generate the IR? I noticed that the compiler in this tutorial has a frontend in Ocaml and a backend in C++, with the communication between them being done via protobufs.')
