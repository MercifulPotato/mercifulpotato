If the cops were arresting people for filming, not for violating dispersal orders, why were so many other people in the area who <i>weren&#x27;t filming</i> being arrested? Why do you insist on claiming that they were arrested for filming, when CNN&#x27;s own article doesn&#x27;t make this claim?<p>There was no causal link between filming and this man&#x27;s arrest. The police ordered a crowd to disperse, and the crowd didn&#x27;t. Members of the crowd did not disperse, and were arrested. A journalist was among said members that did not disperse and were arrested. He would have been arrested whether or not he was filming.')
