Isn&#x27;t &quot;the only important moral imperative is unrestricted free speech above all else&quot; <i>itself</i> an extremist position?  Very few people agree with what you&#x27;re espousing, so, just practically speaking, there&#x27;s always going to be extremist views considered so far beyond the pale that they are always &quot;censored&quot; by society (pro-pedophilia would be a good example of one in the west).<p>If you live your life by moral imperatives such as utilitarianism&#x2F;the veil of ignorance, then you will in fact be compelled <i>by</i> moral imperative to denounce people whose views do not lead to doing the most good for all (as e.g. is true of anti-vaxxers).')
