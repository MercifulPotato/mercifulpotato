As mentioned above, the question was about dollars, cents, and optics. Parler costs nothing to cut &amp; there&#x27;s little PR hit (probably a benefit), Cutting Facebook would cost the platforms money.<p>The &quot;terms of use violations&quot; or whatever BS they&#x27;re referencing for booting Parler doesn&#x27;t even enter into it, the action is based at least 99% on cost&#x2F;benefit to the platform, not some sanitary inflexible set of rules.<p>Dorsey showed Twitter&#x27;s rules mean nothing. Trump violates rules: &quot;oh well he&#x27;s an <i>exception</i> because he&#x27;s a head of state [and he&#x27;s the best thing that ever happened to engagement!].&quot; Trump is losing power &amp; allies are fleeing him: &quot;sure he&#x27;s still a head of state but this is the exception to the exception, so we&#x27;re booting him [plus the tides just turned against him and dumping him is more palatable].&quot; Soon we&#x27;ll have the exception to the exception to the exception.<p>So let&#x27;s not play dumb and assert that this is about some fixed set of rules, the tech chiefs are clearly making the rules up as they go along based on &quot;who is in power at the moment, what speech is unpopular at the moment&quot; and above all &quot;what will this cost us in dollars.&quot;<p>And the minute <i>your</i> speech is unpopular (I&#x27;m looking at <i>you</i>, anarchists, communists, and libertarians), out the door you go.')
