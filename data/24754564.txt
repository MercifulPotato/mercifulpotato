It&#x27;s decision-making task, which is practically the opposite of production support.<p>Why should the exploratory and production teams be using completely different tools? That seems like it would cause frictions in productivity and make there be gaps that introduce translation errors. I would venture to say that just having the exploratory and production teams working using the same code base is a very strong productivity gain, and we&#x27;ve seen this is true in many companies.')
