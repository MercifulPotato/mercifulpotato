Who gets to decide what&#x27;s stupid and what&#x27;s not?<p>I understand removing illegal content. I understand providing guidelines around content that may not be acceptable for minors. I understand removing (or compartmentalizing) content that is &quot;off topic&quot; (such as a platform dedicated to eSports not wanting traditional sports content). But every attempt that can be made to &#x27;reign in stupidity&#x27; means censorship of one form or another and will inevitably be abused.')
