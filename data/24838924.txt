Item(by='bccdee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603209594, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836721, text='&gt; There are over 3,000 emojis defined in unicode, which is a very large vocabulary in which to become expert.<p>Most of those emoji aren&#x27;t commonly used. There&#x27;s a falafel emoji; no one&#x27;s going around adding a falafel to the end of their messages trying to impart some hidden meaning.<p>&gt; There is no well-defined meaning for any of the emojis, even the &quot;simple&quot; common ones.<p>There&#x27;s also no well-defined meaning to a shrug or an eye-roll, but it&#x27;s still a useful way of communicating emotion. Semantically, an emoji isn&#x27;t used like a word. It&#x27;s used like a gesture or facial expression. In practice, the message is usually quite clear — clearer, in fact, than if an emoji hadn&#x27;t been used, since in the absence of tone-of-voice and body language text can itself create ambiguity.<p>&gt; They mean different things to different subgroups, and act as an &quot;in-group&quot; credential in many cases.<p>Do you have an example of an emoji meaning different things to different groups? In my experience they have a pretty consistent meaning across our culture — even the more abstract ones, like an upside-down smile. The only barrier is &quot;whether or not you&#x27;re familiar with the typical meaning,&quot; and that&#x27;s the case for any expression or colloquialism. If I say &quot;they&#x27;re like two peas in a pod&quot; and you have no idea what that means, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s an in-group signifier. Granted, familiarity with emojis correlates with age, but that&#x27;s the same with any linguistic shift.<p>&gt; They are visually very indistinct, and can be difficult to distinguish one from another for people who have less than perfect vision, or color-blindness.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are accessibility options which people can configure on their phones to minimize this. Large-text mode, for instance, or a high-contrast emoji font. Text itself is a medium which isn&#x27;t very accessible to vision-impaired people, and we have developed solutions for that.<p>&gt; For people with autism or other non-neurotypical processing they can be completely unintelligible, rendering the communication even less successful than &quot;traditional&quot; language.<p>Autistic people also have trouble understanding the meaning of facial expressions and of metaphors sometimes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that those shouldn&#x27;t be used in conversation. It just means that everyone should know their audience.<p>---<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve raised any serious practical issues — they seem to be all special cases, such as &quot;what if you&#x27;re talking to an autistic person or a blind person or an older person.&quot; Under those circumstances I would communicate differently, same as if I were speaking to a deaf person, or emailing a blind person, or talking to someone with poor English skills. There is no universally-viable way of communicating, but emoji typically reduce ambiguity and add layers of expression to a message, so in most cases they&#x27;re a good choice.')
