Mainly, esure raid monitoring can be scripted, and you really need not depend upon the manufacturer&#x27;s horrid software (which I agree is just that).  A bit of IPMI for failed power supplies, or what not.  If a box dies, it dies, that&#x27;s what failover is for.<p>I don&#x27;t your logging complain, you need it no matter what you do.  Just use an rsyslog server, logcheck or other app, monitor for important events, done.  I&#x27;ve never used anything off the shelf, and yet all I hear are complaints from those that do.<p>I get how people might want to eschew the above for simple stuff, but once you start needing heavy monitoring, it&#x27;s all the same ball of wax.')
