Like I said, they should fix the README.  However, I still consider it rotten that they would forcibly take down a project as big as youtube-dl because of something so innocuous.<p>A simple &quot;cease and desist&quot; against the youtube-dl project regarding their README examples almost certainly would have been sufficient.  Instead, the RIAA took needlessly drastic measures with a DMCA takedown that paints RIAA as a poor defenseless victim from start to finish.  This was not an attempt to right a minor copyright infringement, this was a public declaration from RIAA that they are aware of and object to the youtube-dl project.<p>This part of the DMCA takedown document is particularly rotten:<p>&gt; The clear purpose of this source code is to (i) circumvent the technological protection measures used by authorized streaming services such as YouTube, and (ii) reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization for such use.')
