If you want ultrafresh local food in a climate which doesn&#x27;t support it, with precise control over the growing conditions.. well that&#x27;s precisely what greenhouses provide.  A &#x27;vertical farm&#x27; is what you get when you make a greenhouse worse by removing the windows for no real reason, then try to compensate for that with futuristic vibes.  Put a greenhouse 15 minutes outside the city and you&#x27;ll save money with cheaper land and free solar power (greenhouses may also have supplemental lighting or heating if needed.)  You get all the freshness advantages of local production, but cheaper.  The only &#x27;downside&#x27; of greenhouses relative to vertical farms that I can think of: greenhouses are old technology that won&#x27;t make yuppies feel like they&#x27;re living in a sci-fi movie.')
