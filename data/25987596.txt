This makes it more or less useless. Additionally, these code paths are not very well tested or optimized.<p>This has been in the works recently though, I&#x27;ve seen PRs for OpenCL 3.0 and OpenCL Image, not sure if they&#x27;re in yet. With both Redhat and Microsoft being interested in working on this area now, I expect to see improvements soon.')
