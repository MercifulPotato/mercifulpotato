Our biggest problem is probably the variance issue (mentioned in other subthreads) -&gt; we can&#x27;t easily tell what is the difference between a slow and a fast load in many cases.<p>Even if we compare things that are available from the metrics like CPU, Mem, and Network speed, those are not very granular metrics (for example, to understand someone with 16 threads was actually at 95% Mem used during that page load), and have little correlation at a wide level with page load speed.')
