If it’s not set to cache everything, the origin server will still need to be contacted, and each edge will need to contact the origin when the cache expires (which is defaulted to 4 hours). This feels like it’s configuration related. CF is very fast in my experience, but I haven’t done similar tests so I can’t know for sure.')
