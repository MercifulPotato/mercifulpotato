I don&#x27;t really mind it and have gotten used to the pin operator when I need it.  I actually use variable re-binding quite a bit but always <i>only</i> in situations where I want a prime.<p><pre><code>  def foo(bar) do\n    bar = decorate(bar)\n\n    {:ok, bar}\n  end\n</code></pre>\nI like that better than calling it something like `new_bar`.  I kind of wish there was prime syntax along the lines of `bar&#x27; = decorate(bar)` but I can deal with re-binding when only used like this (and really, the stakes are low).  More complex cases can generally always be handled with piping.')
