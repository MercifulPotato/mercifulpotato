If that driver accelerates to 40 mph and hits a pedestrian, the victim&#x27;s chance of surviving drops to just 10%.<p>&quot;The act of going above the speed limit or going fast [in unsafe] road conditions...that is an intention,&quot; Brozen said. &quot;When someone is driving in a way that can kill someone, they are creating a risk.&quot;<p>According to John Yi, another &quot;degree of intention&quot; in traffic deaths falls on car-centric society and L.A.&#x27;s leaders, who are &quot;intentional about what we&#x27;re building and what we&#x27;re not building.&quot;<p>City officials have stated clearly that L.A.&#x27;s mission to eliminate traffic deaths is informed by the fact that &quot;underserved communities are disproportionately killed in traffic crashes.&quot; But Yi argues that the historic neglect of those communities can be viewed as intentional.<p>&quot;To take that away, I think, is really not looking at some of the most disinvested communities and what they&#x27;re going through,&quot; he said. &quot;To put it squarely on the shoulders of drivers and say it&#x27;s their fault and they&#x27;re the ones who should be moderating behavior is overlooking the situation altogether.&quot;')
