Item(by='Nasrudith', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604595031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998827, text='Yeah - to be frank whenever I hear complexity cited I can&#x27;t help but think the whole meme-thesis is really a proud and intellectually lazy freak out - the world is too complex for them to understand without effort so rather than try to improve their understanding insist that because they personally don&#x27;t understand it that it has to be fundamentally bad or wrong in some way. That sort of anti-intellectualism can be seen in marketing quite a bit with &quot;natural&quot; products, &quot;localism&quot; as a fear of logistics. Not the sole factor of course but certainly plays a role (someone may just like freshness for instance).<p>Not to mention complexity is peripheral to stability even in something relatively simple compared to a nation like electrical grids. They both gain resilence from interconnection and be taken down by them in chain reactions and there is a difference in complexity from say adding in a distributed series for reserve power, redundant power lines and say playing Enron with their &quot;death star&quot; fraud. It is kind of a silly metric to try to play oracle with as a proxy.')
