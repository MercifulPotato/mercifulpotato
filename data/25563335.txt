Recruiters also aren&#x27;t doing it for fun, they&#x27;re on commission. If they don&#x27;t make a placement, they don&#x27;t put food on the table for their families.<p>Ghosting is impolite, but people do it all the time, including to their dates, friends, etc. The best thing to do is don&#x27;t take it personally and move on.')
