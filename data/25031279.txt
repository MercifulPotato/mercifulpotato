First, you want sufficient range so that overflows are less likely, especially for multiplying two smaller format numbers and accidentally overflowing the range of your largest format. Second, you want range and precision that captures the smallest widely used physical constant (Plank constant) and range for the largest (Avogradrosâ€™s number). When you combine those two constraints with common word sizes you get format ratios very similar to each other.')
