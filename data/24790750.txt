Item(by='Nitramp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602780758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24790444, text='&gt; Such a world never existed, does not exist, and will never exist. Politics are a center of power. You can ban money all you want, but all you&#x27;ll accomplish is create a &#x27;black market&#x27;. I posit that you do not want to live in such a world.<p>The same is true of many areas of society. Medical doctors, company executives, the police, etc. all have power and there&#x27;s good money involved. Still we have laws against fraud, insider trading, bribery, abuse of power, and so forth. While there are transgressions, by and large things seem to work, and when we find new kinds of transgressions, the reaction is not to throw our hands up and say &quot;it&#x27;ll always be like this!&quot; but to fix the laws.<p>Which is to say: I don&#x27;t get the defeatism about regulation here. Laws work. Making actions illegal and threatening a hefty prison term is an effective way of reducing their occurrence.<p>Now it may be hard to get such laws passed, but that&#x27;s another story.')
