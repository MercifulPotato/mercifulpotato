Item(by='notacoward', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609686865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620629, text='&gt; the year currently being 2021 but the &#x27;week-year&#x27; still being 2020<p>Strava seems to have a similar problem. When I pull up leaderboard data for a segment I&#x27;ve just done, &quot;this month&quot; and &quot;this year&quot; and &quot;all time&quot; show my result but &quot;this week&quot; doesn&#x27;t. Checking now for three segments, each &quot;this week&quot; only includes the part of the week that was in December.<p>BTW, for any other Strava users here, be aware that it&#x27;s also pretty stupid about years in which you go from one age group to another (in my case from 45-54 to 55-64). AFAICT only your annual CR gets considered for leaderboards, and if that&#x27;s before your birthday then it&#x27;ll act as though you&#x27;ve never even done that segment in your new age group.')
