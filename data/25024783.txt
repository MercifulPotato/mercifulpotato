I&#x27;m ok with placating the fears people have of election fraud and investigating, given the studies done, it&#x27;s quite certain voter fraud is a prime example of misinformation.<p>2016-2020 has been a time of seeing just how dangerous misinformation is in the world of mass social media. All it takes is the spreading of false rumors through various means of the internet and social media for people to lose their minds and question their own democracy. I think both social media, advertising agencies, and the modern media is largely responsible for this. Also, us in the tech industry, who have over these last 4 years began to see the truly ugly side of what we&#x27;re building. In our constant need to hit KPIs, drive up SEO rank, drive virility, we&#x27;ve slowly fed a monster that is now making itself known, and disrupting the very fabric of democracy.')
