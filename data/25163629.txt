No, that&#x27;s not what truth is. Just invent a new word for it.<p>Similarly, one can easily say that today&#x27;s Western secular societies hold many values dear that arguably arose in Christianity (see, I just did!), without then adding that those secular societies are not, in fact, secular, but religious.')
