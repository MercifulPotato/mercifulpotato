Everything is baked in to be slow. There is no way around it, I don&#x27;t think you can write super fast interpreters like with Javascript - I might be wrong, but so far it hasn&#x27;t happened.<p>For general use cases the performance is fine, but only thanks to the hard work of C&#x2F;CPython&#x2F;Cython programmers who give up Python&#x27;s rich expressibility to gain this performance. It seems like you simply have to use another language to get anything running fast.<p>Having said all that, Pyc seems interesting as it apparently compiles Python. Has anyone had any experience of this?')
