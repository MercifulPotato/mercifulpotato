It is great that you work on a tool that respects peoples privacy. I suppose I failed to put an emphasis on trust. With server side logs, less trust is required because there is less that can be done. Paired with VPN, I can have reasonable belief that server side logging is not logging anything unreasonable and it does not require trust that they are not fingerprinting me.
