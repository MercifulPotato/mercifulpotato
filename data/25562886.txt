They pay well because they&#x27;re niche jobs that most people don&#x27;t have the qualifications for, but how do the people who <i>do</i> have those qualifications get there in the first place? You can say &quot;I&#x27;m gonna be a car mechanic&quot; and go out and learn to do that, but if you say &quot;I&#x27;m gonna be a diesel electric mechanic&quot;... where do you even start? I guess you still start as the broader job (a car mechanic), and hope that you eventually get a good opportunity to specialize further?')
