Still: by focusing on the use of the term, you&#x27;re driving the conversation away from the substance of what the other person is saying and toward a linguistic discussion.<p>In other words, if you recognize that someone is using a term incorrectly, first take the time to understand what they&#x27;re trying to communicate. Maybe start talking about that concept using words you think are a better fit, but <i>stay on the territory</i>. Responding that &quot;powerful&quot; isn&#x27;t the right word doesn&#x27;t address their claim that Haskell is more &lt;whatever they <i>mean</i> by powerful&gt;.<p>This charitable approach shifts the conversation away from scoring points (as would leaving out asides like &quot;(if you reply at all)&quot;) and toward collaborating on developing each other&#x27;s understanding, which is more valuable for everyone involved.')
