When I was making HTTP requests there was no Close() method on the response so it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t needed. But later I found out that there is a Close() method on the response&#x27;s Body member that needs to be called (only one code sample in the docs even showed that).<p>RAII is the best for ensuring that things get cleaned up even if it does lead to more boilerplate to add the pattern to things. But even .NET&#x27;s IDisposable feels better than defer. It&#x27;s established practice to implement it if your class contains something that must be disposed. And it&#x27;s easy for tools to check if you haven&#x27;t disposed of something that implements IDisposable.<p>All that said, I find defer to be better than nothing. In C, the best I can do for cleanup is having all the cleanup functions called at the end with labels at the various points I need to jump to.')
