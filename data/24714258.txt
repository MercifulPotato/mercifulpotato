I took a large amount of neuroscience, psych, and philosophy. Discussing consciousness was the part I loved the most, and I had plenty of patience for plenty of writers.<p>My dismissal of his work on consciousness was based on those grounds. I think my &quot;caricature&quot; was fairly accurate, but if you think different that&#x27;s fine, if you can elaborate.<p>The part I forgot above was that I also dismissed it on the basis of math, which is surprising given that Penrose is a greater mathematician than I&#x27;ll ever be, but his whole reason to evoke &quot;quantum&quot; was that a Newtonian-based brain could not know that a &quot;GÃ¶del sentence&quot; was true, so our brains must be non-Newtonian. It was absurd on the face of it (our brain&#x27;s belief about statements don&#x27;t constitute a formal logic), and was also well-criticized by other mathematicians, whose names I&#x27;d have to dredge out of my 20-year old essays.')
