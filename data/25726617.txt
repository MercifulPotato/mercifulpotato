A debate that will never end, right?</i><p>You&#x27;re responding to your (understandable, but still mistaken) reading of the headline, not the actual content of the post.<p>&#x27;Global&#x27; in this case means <i>&quot;across all or most of an engineering organization&#x27;s teams&quot;</i>, rather than <i>&quot;worldwide, across national boundaries&quot;</i>.<p>A &#x27;campaign&#x27; in this context should be understood as a  peer concept of an Agile &#x27;Theme&#x27;,  &#x27;Epic&#x27;, or &#x27;Story&#x27;, that incorporates aspects of each (though this isn&#x27;t made explicit in the post).<p>Like a Theme, Campaigns represent a coordinating goal for an entire organization.<p>Like an Epic, a Campaign is tied to a particular timeframe, and can be used to group Stories.<p>Like a Story, a Campaign has a concrete measurable outcome.<p>Overall, a useful addition to the Agile toolbox, I think.')
