I follow AI, VR, Philosophy, Zen, Mindfulness, Twertzog, etc... all high quality. Same with Facebook. I&#x27;m very happy with my feed. I follow vintage photography, various art focused groups, philosophy groups, hacker and tech groups and I&#x27;ve unfollowed friends who post toxic shit. I enjoy looking at Twitter and Facebook in the morning. Twitter and Facebook AI&#x27;s are constantly surprising me with cool stuff they surface for me, even ads. Twitter and Facebook don&#x27;t have to suck.')
