Taxes in the US are NOT low. Income tax is only one of many taxes in the US. In some states&#x2F;cities, your property tax can exceed income tax. My state has extremely high taxes on cars too. It all adds up to a lot of money and a relatively high total tax rate. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised it a significant number of people in the US have a higher total tax rate than the Finnish average. Of course you can choose low-tax states, but the US as a whole certainly isn&#x27;t some sort of tax haven.')
