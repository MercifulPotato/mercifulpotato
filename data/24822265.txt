Item(by='ncallaway', descendants=None, kids=[24822515, 24822316], score=None, time=1603066742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24822166, text='Newton&#x27;s first law provides a guide: &quot;Every object persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it.&quot;<p>So, the definition of a force as something that causes an object to change its movement from a &quot;straight line&quot; comes to us from Newton&#x27;s laws.<p>&gt; Why does the existence of a transformation that makes movement under a supposed force actually follow a straight line mean it&#x27;s not really a force?<p>It&#x27;s not just the fact that the transformation <i>exists</i> that means we don&#x27;t really consider gravity to be a force. It&#x27;s that the transformation exists, <i>and provides useful predictions about the universe that turn out to be backed by experiment</i>.<p>Under the theory of general relativity gravity isn&#x27;t a force, because the fundamental premises of general relativity assume that gravity is actually a distortion of spacetime caused by mass.<p>We say that &quot;gravity&quot; isn&#x27;t a force simply because the  predictions made by general relativity have been validated by a number of experimental observationsâ€”at least on the macro scale.<p>&gt; For the other forces (e.g. electromagnetism) can we say that there&#x27;s _no way_ to exhibit a transformation that causes charged particles travel on &quot;straight&quot; lines?<p>I&#x27;m certainly not an expert, so I can&#x27;t really comment on this. My best guess is that there doesn&#x27;t exist any such transformation that causes charged particles to travel on &quot;straight&quot; lines that makes experimental predictions as well as our current scientific theories.')
