Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[25180319], score=None, time=1606068125, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25178015, text='&gt; It makes me think the solution to today&#x27;s anti science bias isn&#x27;t just &quot;educate more&quot;.<p>&quot;Anti-science&quot; is just a propaganda term extremists accuse each other of being. It&#x27;s a very easy tell.<p>Nobody is against science. What people fight about is politics. &quot;Man can be a woman&quot;, &quot;climate science&quot;, &quot;masks vs no masks&quot;, &quot;lockdowns&quot;, etc are not scientific issues, it&#x27;s political issues.<p>&quot;Educate more&quot; wouldn&#x27;t help because it&#x27;s not a matter of science, but politics. And there are plenty of educated people on both sides.<p>Also, when a political group tries to use science to push their agenda, people should be wary. Pretty much all the genocides and horrors of the past 200 years have been a result of politicized science. People forget that modern white supremacy, nazism, communism, etc are all a result of politicized science. People who use terms like anti-science today are the same people who accused supporters of racial equality as being anti-science 100 years ago.<p>And it&#x27;s been my experience that people who accuse other people of being &quot;anti-science&quot; have no background in science or understand the history of science. They are just political extremists who undeservedly wrap themselves around the good name of science as if it were a flag to attack their political opponents.')
