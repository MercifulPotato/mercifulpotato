Not justifiable from a pure numbers standpoint.<p>But - other tech stocks? Arguably justifiable. Since the risk free rate (treasuries) has cratered, this has altered the DCF calculation that analysts use to value a company (the outcome is essentially this: the company is worth more, because this risk free rate is used in discounting the PV vs FV of the companyâ€™s cash flows).<p>Thus, it makes sense to have companies worth more (compared to historical price-to- earnings comparisons).<p>Then on top of this, there is a somewhat deflationary force of tech companies providing more efficient means and processes to things - which further perpetuates the cycle of these companies being worth more (their inputs cost less and are less labile, and their outputs are greater than say, a mining or oil company)')
