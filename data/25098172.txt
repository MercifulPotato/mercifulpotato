(I have a partial source of work lined up for once I can focus again, but it&#x27;s fraught in its own ways.)<p>My most native domain is oldish&#x2F;systemsish&#x2F;Unixish (Go, C, shell scripting, Perl…) but I can be fairly polyvalent in environments overall. Have done some previous work on things like Tor and OpenVPN. Ideal is something like “this bug&#x2F;feature-request has been nagging at us and could use a fresh set of eyes”. Specific strengths historically include informal-methods precision of modeling and ability to haul The Good Stuff out of semantic mud. Specific weak areas include PHP being too psychologically taxing, Node.js likely being the same (which, ah, er, <i>ouch</i> given current SV culture), and flakiness from the depression itself (expected to improve with medication, but not 100% and exact curve unknown).<p>Posting this as a separate comment so it&#x27;s easier to delete on its own if it turns out to be inappropriate. Also, to avoid surprise: I don&#x27;t make my legal name <i>too</i> immediately visible from profiles etc. presently, but anyone who&#x27;s transacting with me will get a confirmation of it privately.')
