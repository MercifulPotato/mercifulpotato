Our core activity is engineering and industrial production. For the area it&#x27;s not a shitty company, the conditions are good and they have no trouble attracting employees.<p>In the engineering department those who don&#x27;t do 3d CAD get a single 20&quot; screen, and a laptop with 8Gb RAM. Those who use CAD get a single 24&quot; screen and bigger laptop with a 3d card. Everyone gets the $5 keyboard and mouse that comes with the corporate HP laptops. Basically all offices (except for managers) are the noisy open-office type.<p>I&#x27;ve been to quite a few suppliers, all industrial&#x2F;engineering companies of different sizes, and it&#x27;s a pretty standard setup. It&#x27;s not some shitty companies, it&#x27;s just that all companies (at least not specialized in software) just take the basic material that they rent from their corporate suppliers. You can&#x27;t show a positive ROI&#x2F;business case for buying a $50 Logitech mouse to 50k office employees, so they all get the free included HP mouse. Same for the rest.<p>I&#x27;m not even getting into the locked-down version of Windows that everyone gets to use. Even launching portable executables is technically against the rules, not that it stops anyone. Until a few years ago most websites were blocked, so it&#x27;s getting better at least.<p>In general I think it&#x27;s pretty ok, it&#x27;s not really a big issue. That&#x27;s how the industry is. But very few companies give a very good environment and good computer devices to their knowledge workers. You just need to adapt. Bringing your own devices help. You can choose not to, many do, and accept to spend 8 hours&#x2F;day using what they give you.')
