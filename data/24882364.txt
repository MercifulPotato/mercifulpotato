In both scenarios, you have no proof of when the photo was taken. It could&#x27;ve been two hours or ten minutes ago. There is no way to digitally verify it.<p>So it sounds like all you&#x27;re doing it creating a public, verifiable record of something that you have no incentive to alter and something that doesn&#x27;t actually verify the state of the vehicle at any point in time.<p>From personal experience, the most common types of fraud in this space are (1) just posting an old photo as though it were taken right now, and (2) posting a photo of a different vehicle. I don&#x27;t see how either of these are prevented.<p>What am I missing?<p>(Full disclosure: I built software that does something similar for different types of clients, so I&#x27;ve worked on the problem of &quot;verifying vehicle state&quot; for ~10 years.)')
