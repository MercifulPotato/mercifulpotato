They won&#x27;t let you use sophisticated products like options, etc., but simple <i>buying and selling</i>? Absolutely. What&#x27;s happening here is simple. The wrong people are getting rich. The wrong people are losing money. That cannot be allowed.<p>There <i>is</i> something called the &quot;pattern day trading rule&quot; wherein someone buys and sells the same security several times and their ability to buy and sell gets restricted, but that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening here. People wanting to buy $GME are wanting to buy and <i>hold</i>. Not sell.')
