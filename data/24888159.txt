Simplicity really is where Go stands out against languages like Java. Yes, you may write more boilerplate and break DRY, but your code will be readable and wonâ€™t contain any hidden magic.<p>We spend most of our work day reading and trying to understanding code. What you see is what you get with Go!<p>Side note: Go also runs fabulously on Kubernetes and is great for building micro-services :)')
