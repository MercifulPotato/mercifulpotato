But yeah that&#x27;s been surprising to me too.<p>I still think I&#x27;d rank it behind Go and Python for a typical website backend - but it depends on the project and the team.<p>The more people involved, the more things the type system will save you from, and the more you benefit from being able to build powerful abstractions - which offsets the relatively higher &quot;tax&quot; on productivity with it.<p>Rust is one of the better choices for backend web development today, a sentence I also find surprising just to write.<p>Honestly, probably the biggest thing holding it back for that use case is not the language itself but lack of adoption. It&#x27;s tougher to hire for, and has a less mature ecosystem. I feel the momentum is there and that will change over the next 5 years or so.')
