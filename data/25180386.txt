I&#x27;d imagine that Reverb.com has hurt GC&#x27;s sales much more than Amazon has: especially since it gives both new and used options for anything GC might be selling at any given time. And although I don&#x27;t know a lot about sellers&#x27; relations with reverb, it makes it much easier for me to buy from non-chain music stores from around the country.')
