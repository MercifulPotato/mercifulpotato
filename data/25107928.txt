Item(by='jhanschoo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605500029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25105891, text='I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re referencing something in the article linked, but taking your statement alone, it&#x27;s not that this cannot be shown, but that nobody has shown it, and nobody expects it to ever be shown.<p>There already exists at least one mapping of integers into integers, the identity mapping. Hence a correct proof that there exists no mapping of integers into integers (proving the opposite claim) would also tell us that FOL+ZFC (first order logic with the standard axioms of set theory) is inconsistent, regardless of whether Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument features in that proof.<p>In the other direction, if FOL+ZFC is inconsistent, it&#x27;s trivial to write a proof that shows that integers cannot be mapped to integers that features Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument in it.<p>So the existence of a proof that shows that no mapping of the integers to the integers exists is equivalent to FOL+ZFC being inconsistent, and no-one has yet found FOL+ZFC to be inconsistent, or expects this to be the case.')
