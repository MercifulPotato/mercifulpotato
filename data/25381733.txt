From my perspective, this is gaslighting.<p>I will paraphrase what I think you said (and the straightforward context&#x2F;implication). Please tell me where my understanding goes awry.<p>&gt; <i>But there are probably thousands of things that cost only peanuts and aren&#x27;t a priority.</i><p>There are many other items that similarly need fixing (across all federal agencies). Each may not cost a lot individually.<p>&gt; <i>If you fix them all they add up to not peanuts</i><p>But if they were all fixed (applying a universal standard), the total cost would end up being a lot (spending a lot is bad, regardless of how much has been fixed)<p>&gt; *and then you don&#x27;t have any money left and you didn&#x27;t even fix any priority tasks!<p>The total budget should not be increased, so a policy of fixing small things would take away significant spending from other things that are more important.')
