When I read &quot;GOP with Fox&quot; I heard &quot;DNC with MSNBC&quot; as an echo. (My father watches MSNBC so I see more of it than Fox, just by mistake.) Just like the latter (to be more correct, the <i>same</i>) machine, however, it isn&#x27;t magical. There are a set of buttons and pressing them has a set of effects. Some choices make others impossible. Trump could have made mask-wearing a conservative thing in January. In December that&#x27;s not an option. Everyone, even his fans, would just laugh at him. No other Republican has any power to change red-staters&#x27; minds about anything. Eventually there might be a different Republican with influence, but until then many Americans must be reached in other ways.')
