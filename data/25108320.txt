Those that do can of course use libraries, but many (say, backend servers) don&#x27;t really need to process Unicode strings<p>I can&#x27;t speak for actual Ocaml users, but I&#x27;ve personally rejected Ocaml for my user-facing webapps because of things like this. Treating unicode as something optional was fine for early 2000s, but it&#x27;s really not fine today. Most user facing applications need first class support for internationalized strings much more than other stuff like Big_int that&#x27;s actually implemented in Ocaml stdlib.<p>I&#x27;m guessing the status quo works fine for existing Ocaml users, but that&#x27;s kinda circular, and would explain Ocaml&#x27;s limited adoption outside of its traditional niches.')
