Consider, for instance, the following...<p>An operating system is useful to avoid boiler plate code, but it seems made for people who don’t have knowledge about how hardware works, and don’t plan on learning. That being the case, how useful with this operating system be? Using it means your code will only be as efficient as the operating system. You’d also be relying on the OS developer to fix any issues you have, be it with the OS or your own implementation.<p>We can go up and down the stack from transistors to programming languages to full applications with the same argument. And at each step it misses the point that abstraction layers are probably the most powerful and successful concept we’ve applied in hardware and computer science, and there’s no reason that concurrency would be any different.')
