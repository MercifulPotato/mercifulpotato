Also could be too much complexity, as opposed to capacity. Could have been timing didn&#x27;t help, sometimes you take calculated risks or have to deal with additional complexity during migrations, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve even seen where playing it safe while planning to back out of a manual fix used during a weird outage (circuit went down in one direction or something, just needed to be manually shutdown to re-route everything) brought down the entire network when another outage happened before that evening, i.e. most redundancy plans protect against single failures, not all combination of two failures. They wanted to do all planned changes after business hours, like manually swinging traffic back to the primary hub site. They didn&#x27;t check the weather on the other side of the country, and the power at their new super-duper data center went down that afternoon during a thunderstorm...<p>I wonder what percentage of fiber cuts don&#x27;t cause noticeable outages. We&#x27;ll never know, unless they let us root around in their ticket system.<p>As a customer it is fair to judge them on what you see, though. Some telcos screw up more than others.
