It isn&#x27;t that much effort in my opinion. If the engineers see someone doing that or, to ensure it works, are asked to think about how to improve this and invited to do that with candidates, that will be the way it&#x27;s done.<p>This is what we do for each other as colleagues, and it would take more effort to be less hospitable than it would take just to do what we usually do.<p>We do the same for guests of the company, whether they be partners who visit us, people who came to install our telephone lines, etc. Candidates are also our guests.')
