My living room speakers, which I use for my hi-fi and home cinema setup, were manufactured in 1972. My amplifier was manufactured some time in the 90s. Things break eventually and some won&#x27;t last as long as my speakers. That&#x27;s fine. But we should reject things intentionally designed to break after only a few years. Reject convenience. Aim to reduce your footprint. This is especially important if you plan to reproduce.')
