That’s about 1.3 infections over two weeks in a school of 1,000 kids, or 2.2 infections over two weeks in a group of 1,000 staff.<p>If they genuinely aren’t acting as Petri dishes then yay. But I don’t understand how looking at a two-week window for a disease with a known incubation as long as two weeks can paint an effective picture. Surely you would need to look at least twice the incubation period to be able to render a realistic interpretation of the data?')
