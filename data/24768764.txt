This isn&#x27;t actually new, and there&#x27;s a reason that the white house and senate have been packing the courts with justices from the Federalist Society. The ideological disagreement between federalists and democrats is as old as the country. The &quot;weird&quot; thing is that the country has been quite focused on installing democracies elsewhere, but that rather makes sense because we maintain influence over those countries and often &quot;observe&quot; their elections.<p>Just a nitpick, but the federalists of early American history have little to do with the Federalist Society.  I&#x27;d say the modern-day Democrats are probably closer to the Federalists and the Republicans are closer to the Democratic-Republicans.')
