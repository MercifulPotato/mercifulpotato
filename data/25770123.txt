The former accounts for the vast majority of miner revenues at the beginning of the system, but it is expected to transition to the latter as the block rewards dwindle. There  has  been  an  implicit  belief  that  whether miners  are  paid  by  block  rewards  or  transaction  fees  does not affect the security of the block chain.<p>&gt; We show that this is not the case.  Our key insight is that with only transaction fees, the variance of the block reward is very high due to the exponentially distributed block arrival time,  and  it  becomes  attractive  to  fork  a “wealthy” block to “steal” the  rewards  therein.   We  show  that  this  results in an equilibrium with undesirable properties for Bitcoin’s security and performance, and even non-equilibria in some circumstances.')
