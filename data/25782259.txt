I can tell you&#x27;re not a native English speaker, and you may want to revisit some of the copy.<p>- As @ourcat mentioned, there are way too many pricing options, not to mention the tiny tabs at the top (which yield even <i>more</i> pricing options). It&#x27;s just confusing&#x2F;overwhelming.<p>- You really need to make a case here for why someone would choose you over Firebase. I&#x27;d personally never use you because Firebase is free while I&#x27;m building out the MVP (usually a side project). It always irks me when passion projects or pre-MVP &quot;startups&quot; are hemorrhaging money (even if it&#x27;s just 10 bucks a month).<p>- I don&#x27;t think &quot;vendor lock-in&quot; is a pain point for these kinds of products. A pain point I <i>do</i> know about is migrating to a more robust data layer if the project takes off (post-MVP phase). I don&#x27;t really see how this very real pain point is easier to mitigate on your SaaS rather than Firebase.')
