Item(by='Balgair', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612024998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25970329, text='&gt; The best way to do this is to increase selectivity&#x2F;restrict supply, raise prices, lower difficulty (grade inflation), and increase the time required to get the credential, while providing alternate activities for those who are inclined to do something other than receiving an education.<p>A mission that the Ivies are well on their way with. The average grade at Harvard is a 3.67 (as of a 2013 source) and the prices have never been higher (though that&#x27;s an individual thing, what with scholarships). They only need to make it a 5 year program with a MA&#x2F;MS tagged in to get really going; degree-inflation hopped onto grade-inflation and dollar-inflation.<p>Somehow, you then have to work Ultimate Frisbee or chess in there too, an athletics-inflation and club-inflation (?), so to speak. Kinda like Laurie Laughlin&#x27;s daughter did with the varsity-blues scandal for admissions. I&#x27;d guess that&#x27;s already happened then.<p>What do you end up with besides an empty savings account? A 22 years old with a <i>very</i> good resume and a very bad taste in beer and jazz.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecrimson.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;9&#x2F;stats-grade-inflation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecrimson.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;9&#x2F;stats-grade-inf...</a>')
