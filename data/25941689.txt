This just seems so outrageous that there must be some sane rationale that I&#x27;m not seeing.<p>Why do Robinhood, Reddit, Discord, etc feel like they have to respond to this?  Whether the investments being made are responsible or not, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it should be their place to intervene.<p>If the hedge funds over-shorted GME and WSB recognized that and traded against that bad analysis, then that&#x27;s great!  If the pendulum swung the other direction and WSB is trading into some momentum, how is that any different than the hedge funds doing the same with shorts?  Why should Robinhood pick a winner (siding <i>against</i> their own customers)?')
