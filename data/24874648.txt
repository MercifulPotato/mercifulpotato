As somebody who went to music school for 10 years I&#x27;ve been around literally thousands of musicians and have never once met somebody who developed perfect pitch as an adult.<p>On the other hand, if you do have perfect pitch, you can lose it over time! I&#x27;ve had perfect pitch all my life, and now that I&#x27;m going on 40 I surprise myself by sometimes hearing a song a half-step off (i.e. I&#x27;ll assume a song is in F but it&#x27;s really in E). This has never happened to me until the past few years. Not sure how much is due to my ears aging, and how much due to I&#x27;m not a practicing musician anymore.')
