It cannot even recognize that when I’m behind the computer, I’m not interested in watching documentaries and when I’m behind my Apple TV, I’m not interested in listening to music videos. It’s such basic stuff, let alone the actual recommendations; it just keeps rehashing the same channels. “Oh you watched a video about the US elections, let’s bombard you with US election videos for the next 3 weeks”.<p>If I compare the music recommendations of YouTube versus Spotify, the latter is miles ahead. YouTube always seems to either descend into obscurity, or you’ll end up with the same old stuff, where Spotify seems to balance things out fairly nicely.<p>In all honesty, for all the AI expertise and “intellectual excellence” Google possesses in this area, I am surprised how bad they are doing here.')
