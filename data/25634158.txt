I&#x27;ve heard many times that tether is what underlies a lot of the infrastructure of bitcoin trading on exchanges and that the company responsible for backing them is particularly unclear about what&#x27;s going on and likely engaging in fraud.<p>As someone who is an amateur looking in, could you help fill in the holes in this picture? Why do we need tether? Why does it matter if tether is not backed 1:1 by USD? If the fraud really is so obvious and impactful, why 1) isn&#x27;t BTC tanking and 2) why aren&#x27;t there charges filed against the company?')
