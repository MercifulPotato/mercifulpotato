Item(by='hyperdimension', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610945352, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25814282, text='&quot;Google Signals,&quot; huh.<p>That sure doesn&#x27;t sound insidious...kind of like a large Internet ad company trying to make sure that they&#x27;re the only one who can track your activity online.<p>Don&#x27;t worry, though. If you were using any of the now-dead competing advertiser networks, you can target using this information for a small fee! They sure know how to benevolently push forward the wheel of progress to fight to ensure <i>your absolute privacy</i> from everyone but them.<p>Not that I&#x27;m a fan of these &#x27;Signals&#x27;--or even cookies for that matter.')
