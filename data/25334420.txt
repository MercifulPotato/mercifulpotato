It&#x27;s still outstanding to find things like that on your own, and a lot of work goes into it. Sorry if I gave the wrong impression.<p>I have analyzed foreign code bases of similar dimensions in the past myself and found critical bugs. The size doesn&#x27;t say much, it comes down to identifying the &quot;interesting&quot; bits (like the electronSafeRpc in this case), which can be hard and tedious, but greatly reduces the code you have to look at in detail. My assertion is that if your name is e.g. China then you will not be turned off by that.')
