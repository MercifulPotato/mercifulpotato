We&#x27;ve elected politicians that look like characters from an absurdist satire, loony conspiracy theories are going mainstream, climate change isn&#x27;t real, the pandemic is a lie, a significant percentage of the US population thinks the presidental election was completely fraudulent... and so on.<p>Misinformation is a problem that genuinely threatens society. I&#x27;d love to think that if you let people figure things out for themselves they&#x27;ll eventually manage it. That they&#x27;ll eventually stop believing wild claims based on no evidence.<p>But we don&#x27;t have time to test that theory.<p>Should the big platforms have the power over the digital public square that they do? Definitely not. But they <i>do</i> have it. Pressuring them to deal with misinformation is something I completely support.<p>The alternative is tech illiterate legislation because the misinformation problem isn&#x27;t going to go away on it&#x27;s own.')
