Best time to plant a tree.<p>The C API is what prevents PyPy or other Python runtimes from being able to compete and interop. The community could do this, rebase Python modules with native code to cffi so that they can run in all Pythons. The C API is neither good, nor necessary and only serves to gate keep CPython&#x27;s access to the rest of the Python user community.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pypy.org&#x2F;compat.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pypy.org&#x2F;compat.html</a>')
