Are you talking about very low-wage factory jobs, such that people in China may be paid a few dollars an hour where the same in the US would be many dollars an hour? Or are you talking about IT outsourcing, which happens at values much higher than minimum wage?<p>If I have to guess your arguments and make them for you, then I don&#x27;t really need you in this conversation at all, I suppose.')
