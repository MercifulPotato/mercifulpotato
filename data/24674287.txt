Item(by='jbay808', descendants=None, kids=[24674405], score=None, time=1601755041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24672463, text='This article was a fascinating and informative read for me.<p>The author (who I assume is male, I don&#x27;t remember if he said so outright) kept repeating how colour is perceived based on the difference between receptor signals. I had learned that already so I kept thinking, &quot;yeah yeah, I know&quot;...<p>... Then he got to the point about edge detection, and suddenly I understood! I never thought before about how the difference is calculated between receptors <i>that are not precisely co-located on the retina</i>. Of course! Seems obvious in retrospect but I never thought about it. That also makes many colour-optical illusions make more sense.<p>If the author comes across these comments -- I have full colour vision and unusually good eyesight. Even for me, without magnification the stars are not colourful. Mars is slightly red, Betelgeuse is <i>very</i> slightly red, the milky way has a slightly bluish tinge, but for the most part, the stars are just white points. They do sometimes shimmer &#x2F; twinkle briefly between different colours in a way that can make it really hard to say what exact colour they are, even if I stare at them. You probably notice that too, though. So I don&#x27;t think your experience of the stars is likely to be that different, and you shouldn&#x27;t feel sad!')
