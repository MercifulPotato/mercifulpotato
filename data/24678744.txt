I will not tell you this again if you still dot get that.<p>&gt; To argue that child pornography is a form of speech is rather ridiculous<p>To lawyers it is not. Again this is about the video, not the act itself. You repeatedly dont get that difference.<p>&gt;  but there are limits on forms of expression. I cannot choose to stab people as a form of free expression, nor torch a building.<p>Great! you get it! We cannot allow all expression. Now on stabbing we agree. On abuse videos as well. But on inciting hate&#x2F;violence we dont.<p>May I ask why you want to defend inciting hate&#x2F;violence -speech?')
