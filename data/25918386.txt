They do have a profitable business model (in fact they have multiple), they have just not scaled it up enough while at the same time are pumping massive amounts of money into new projects &#x2F; R&amp;D, so they are not a profitable business. There is a difference between the two things. Space launch and satellite internet are both proven profitable business models where SpaceX is actively growing their marketshare. In fact I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if in 2 years time SpaceX <i>is</i> the satellite internet market. No one will want the subpar internet experience provided by geosync satellites when Starlink is fully operational.<p>Also worth noting that the article is about data from 2015, which was the first year they had ever landed an orbital-class booster (Falcon 9), and only the one time (in December 2015). The first time they ever re-used a booster for a customer payload was in 2017 (after the WSJ article you cite was published). Since then they&#x27;ve re-used boosters many times, with their recent launch actually being the 8th launch+recovery of the same booster. So what was iffy&#x2F;nascent in 2015&#x2F;2017 is now proven&#x2F;consistent in 2021. They are doing much, much better from when that article as published.')
