Item(by='rconti', descendants=None, kids=[25488616], score=None, time=1608490113, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25485966, text='Comcast has never charged me for bringing my own modem.<p>More frustratingly, though, they <i>charge you more</i> for internet-only service than they do for TV+Internet. Every time you try to go Internet-only, they offer you a &#x27;deal&#x27; where they  throw in cable TV service for -$5. And then they ship you a cable TV box that you store in a box in your attic under penalty of hundreds of dollars if you lose it and can&#x27;t return it at the end of your service.<p>I&#x27;ve returned the cable TV box before, and they just ship you a new one. (&quot;We&#x27;ve noticed you have TV service but do not have a cable TV box, here is the equipment you need! Aren&#x27;t we nice?!&quot;)<p>Thankfully I&#x27;ve got FTTH now. Slightly-less-thankfully I&#x27;m on ATT so I&#x27;ve got to pay the rental fee, but it&#x27;s still a much better deal than Comcast ever offered. When Sonic finally serves my house directly Real Soon Like Now, the bill will be cut in half again. But still, mandatory rental fee.')
