Large seats that are forwards&#x2F;backwards switchable so they last a few years.\nThe seats are tethered to the safety latches, which although they are an &quot;easy click&quot; (two) can be quite tricky depending on the car and the tolerances involved. If the seat is facing forwards, it is also tethered to the sash belt, which I believe is the cause of &quot;skinned knuckles&quot; reference.<p>I 100% empathize with the person you replied to, and found your comment to be a bit dismissive in the &quot;well <i>I</i> don&#x27;t have a problem&quot; fashion.')
