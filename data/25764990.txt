This means that a file syncing (and by extension file sharing) feature is absolutely required to be fluid and desirable as a consumer product.<p>Firewire was created in part because of this desire for the file sharing to be seamless - now Dropbox had a real-world tested wireless and continuous implementation running on Apple hardware, of course it&#x27;s an acquisition target (I&#x27;m just surprised he didn&#x27;t go higher knowing how much trouble MobileMe &#x2F; iCloud accounts were at the time).')
