That’d stop those nazis in their tracks.<p>So to this day, I find the UK a difficult country to navigate by signs alone as they are often absent at important local junctions.<p>In many other parts of the world, you can trace your way from a major destination by signs at forks&#x2F;exits. In the UK, this often only works on ‘M’otorway routes. With satnav now ubiquitous, much local signposting tends to deplete over time, unless it is to control traffic flow.')
