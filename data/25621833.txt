The top rated company, the only one with a better rating than Apple, is Librem.<p>In terms of ethics, even Librem advise in their own literature that they cannot vouch for their upstream suppliers, the vast majority of which are in China. Presumably they don&#x27;t have the resources to conduct the level of supplier auditing Apple carry out, there&#x27;s no shame in that few companies do, I&#x27;m not knocking Librem they&#x27;re fighting the good fight. Apple have ditched suppliers when they&#x27;ve found compliance violations though. Those are violations most other companies would never have even known about. Can you name another company that has actually done more on this issue than Apple?<p>The bottom line is the issue here is not Apple or Librem, or  Amazon or any of the other companies doing business in China. They are all exposed to these risks. The problem is the Chinese government. Those are the people we need to be holding accountable.')
