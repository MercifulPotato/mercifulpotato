I can understand why the 5 wealthiest nations that all want to be the one with a world reserve fiat global enslavement system would oppose such a thing..  but the bottom 190 nations with no chance of theirs being the world reserve currency should all get together and agree to use, contribute to, and defend Bitcoin. These allied nations could agree to contribute at least some minimum, and not exceed 25% of the mining power, with each nation limited to 1&#x2F;195th of that total. Any attempt at corrupting should be seen as a crime, and act of war, against humanity.')
