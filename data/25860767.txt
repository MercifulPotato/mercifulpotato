They simply chose not to.<p>RISC-V would have made this product an instant buy in my books, but there are numerous Cortex-M0+-based microcontrollers and microcontroller boards out there already.<p>The Pi Pico is appealing because of all the documentation and the ecosystem that is sure to develop around it, so I&#x27;m not here to claim that this product <i>won&#x27;t</i> be wildly succesful, but the M0+ is just not the choice I would have expected them to make. RISC-V seems like it would have aligned much better with the Raspberry Pi Foundation&#x27;s mission.<p>In fact, if they had chosen to integrate the ESP32-C3 into this product instead of their custom silicon, people would be receiving RISC-V, WiFi, and Bluetooth -- and you can imagine how beneficial that would be. The ESP32-C3 is supposed to cost around $1, so it&#x27;s not like it would have been outrageously expensive or something.')
