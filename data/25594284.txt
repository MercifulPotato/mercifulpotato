It&#x27;s a simple job queue with a UI. You request jobs from it, and then run them for minutes or hours, so it shouldn&#x27;t normally be a bottleneck and it makes sense to use a language that&#x27;s quick and easy to write.<p>It&#x27;s written in Python and works fine to process thousands of jobs per day. Once you start having tens of thousands of jobs in the queue, it gets slow enough that it can back things up. This compounds the problem, eventually resulting in the whole thing crashing.<p>By switching the interpreter to PyPy, I was able to keep the data pipeline running at that scale without having to rewrite anything.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;spotify&#x2F;luigi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;spotify&#x2F;luigi</a>')
