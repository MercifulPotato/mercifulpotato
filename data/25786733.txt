For the most part this is to be expected, but in the rare cases that other country&#x27;s politics enter HN (particularly new laws that affect tech), there seems to be a heavy bias toward comparison to the US&#x27;s laws, so much so, that I think I understand more of the US laws than I do my own! Again, this is probably to be expected with the big tech companies largely residing in SV...<p>But it sure does stand out when HN comments are made with the assumption that the fellow HN readership is US. Any time I&#x27;ve tried to highlight how this looks from the outside it&#x27;s generally met with downvotes, to the point that I self censor comments that I otherwise feel could have enriched this global community.<p>So, maybe there is the chance in your comments @dang to make a reminder that it serves a global community? It might help soften feelings of any comments that are heavily partisan.')
