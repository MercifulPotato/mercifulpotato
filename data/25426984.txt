I can reply to all of your snarky comments with, &quot;Why wouldn&#x27;t what I said apply?&quot;<p>&gt; surely you&#x27;re not arguing it was worth nothing?<p>So how much was it worth? Where is your calculation?<p>The south fell behind the north because of using manual labor over industrialization, so it may well have been worth nothing.<p>People fail to distinguish that the south was involved in slavery, not the north. The north literally owes nothing, and that means the US federally owes nothing.<p>&gt; This is unhelpful.<p>No, your virtue signalling is completely unhelpful. We know where you stand - all talk and no action. You&#x27;ve suggested no solutions, and offered nothing but snarky rhetoric.')
