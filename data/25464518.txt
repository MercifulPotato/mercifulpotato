I actually haven&#x27;t used offline download.<p>My biggest pain point was that the downloader portion of the updater is so low quality. It corrupts downloads or restarts with tiny network blips, can&#x27;t resume most of the time and often much slower to download than available bandwidth (that might a bad routing issue on my country). Overall it&#x27;s often a painful experience.')
