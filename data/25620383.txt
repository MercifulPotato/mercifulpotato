Item(by='bayindirh', descendants=None, kids=[25621000], score=None, time=1609661131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25617519, text='&gt; That does nothing for the fact that SysV init was a pile of shell scripts inconsistent across distros and even individual packages.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen the inconsistencies, sorry. All the service files I&#x27;ve written were greatly portable around what I&#x27;ve used so far.<p>&gt; SysV init did not take care of consolekit being an unmaintained mess either. systemd did.<p>No other service should hide the shortcomings of other services. This sounds like WoW&#x27;s extreme tricks or Kubernetes&#x27; dockershim layer to keep compatibility. Now, doing this is wrong.<p>&gt; Besides, systemd can recognize that I had plugged in a specific kind of device that needs this sort of setup and do that for me automatically. Hence the &#x27;manager&#x27; part. None of its supposed &#x27;competitors&#x27; can do that themselves.<p>That&#x27;s the point. If that task can be handed over to another daemon (like udev) for setting it up, why systemd assumes that setting it up is its job? I&#x27;m not trying to say that doing this is <i>flat out wrong</i> but, when asked about why, getting &quot;<i>we&#x27;re doing it , because why not?</i>&quot; as an answer leaves a bad taste in the mouth.<p>&gt; systemd does not do that, sounds like you&#x27;re blaming bad distro defaults (optional components being enabled by default) on systemd.<p>I think I failed to convey what I tried to say there. I wanted to say that there&#x27;s no easy way to see whether a feature is managed by systemd or not and hence systemd tries to &quot;self-heal&quot; things sometimes, system management becomes a tug-of-war until one understands that systemd is managing that. If there was an easy way to understand that, it&#x27;d be an easier path.<p>All in all, I personally don&#x27;t oppose what systemd brings to a table and see the inspiration from macOS&#x27; launchd. However, the main thing I strongly oppose and criticize is the blind egg-throwing to other init systems, the overzealous\nprotection of systemd and avoiding discussing its potential shortcomings and problems altogether.<p>I want to reiterate that I&#x27;m not against change and evolution, I&#x27;m against forcing it with a stance of &quot;we, only we know the best. now shut-up and use it!&quot;.')
