Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603334423, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24853355, text='You are reading it correctly. This is a draft, and I presume Facebook&#x27;s engineering team are confident that they have the resources (time&#x2F; money&#x2F; whatever) to stay reasonably up to date on any subsequent changes.<p>Generally the way this work goes, at first things change pretty violently, maybe it goes from let&#x27;s have a 1 byte version number, ASN.1 OIDs for everything and some JSON, to actually it&#x27;s always the five bytes &#x27;QUICK&#x27; then a four byte version number, we&#x27;re doing CORS instead of JSON, and no OIDs now it&#x27;s all URNs, in like two weeks of git pulls and mailing list posts.<p>But after a while the drafts start to settle down. On some topics everybody is satisfied that there&#x27;s a good argument for why we do this and not that, on others it&#x27;s a coin toss and it&#x27;s just easier not to change it than argue constantly. Do I like OIDs? Eh, they&#x27;re better than URNs but I can live with either, so fine, have URNs if you insist.<p>QUIC has largely settled down. Google&#x27;s systems for example will tell you they speak draft 29 of QUIC. Do they? Well, more or less. Maybe it&#x27;s sort of draft 32 really. But drafts 29 and 32 are pretty similar, and draft 32 is going to Last Call now, if nobody raises any issues it&#x27;s done.<p>Is it conceivable that somebody discovers a grave problem in QUIC and it has to be substantially revised? Yes. But it&#x27;s not very likely. So it&#x27;s easily possible that a draft 29 QUIC implementation like Google&#x27;s (or Facebook&#x27;s) will mostly interoperate with an actual QUIC standard next year after just some small tweaks to tell it this isn&#x27;t a draft any more. Why wait?<p>HTTP&#x2F;3 is a <i>bit</i> more than just do HTTP on QUIC, and it&#x27;s slightly less finished than QUIC is, but it&#x27;s also pretty stable and there&#x27;s less that might change anyway.<p>Somebody has to try this stuff out, and at scale if we&#x27;re to learn much more than &quot;It might work&quot; before it finishes that Last Call. Facebook, Google, Cloudflare, Mozilla, Netflix and so on are able to do that.')
