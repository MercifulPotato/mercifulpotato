No one ever asked me if an interviewee &quot;passed&#x2F;failed&quot;. The only boolean was &quot;hire&#x2F;no hire&quot;, which took into account many more dimensions. But I know people that interviewed over 1,000 people, so my knowledge is more anecdotal.<p>I&#x27;d imagine no matter the problem he would breeze through an interview and leave the interviewer with some enlightenment on programming. It wasn&#x27;t necessarily about whether the code was &quot;correct&quot;. I remember once interviewing a ~20-year old for the summer program who when I gave him a problem he started talking about some linear algebra and geometry that I didn&#x27;t even know were relevant but quickly made sense to me. But he was so humble about it, and looking to me like he wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the right approach to take (It was hard to keep a poker face and not give away that he was a &quot;definite hire&quot; after about 5 minutes). His 5-liner to solve it had one bug but he clearly &quot;passed&quot; with flying colors. Unfortunately for us he ended up joining a startup in SV (and now is doing big things there).')
