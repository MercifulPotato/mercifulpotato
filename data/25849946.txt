After moving to Things 3 on reflection I think OF tried to be <i>a little too clever</i> and because of that I didn&#x27;t have as much confidence in the system as I now have in Things 3.<p>I did like that it was heavily opinionated though, including things like enforcing weekly reviews for projects.')
