Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611132740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25843608, text='&gt; The most interesting one to me was President Ford pardoning President Nixon. TIL.<p>Done in the name and hope of &quot;national healing&quot;. There were even talks about Biden pardoning Trump in order to prevent the precedent of a new administration pursuing an outgoing administration by legal overreach... was utter madness IMO even before the attempted putsch by his supporters, but now it&#x27;s untenable.<p>Personally, as a half German and half Croat I can only say one thing when I look at the histories of my home countries: for any form of healing to succeed, criminal actions by <i>any</i> government must be dealt with transparently and impartially by the appropriate institutions in a speedy manner, otherwise the only thing that will breed is resentment.<p>The Nazi regime crimes were dealt with by the Nuremberg trials and the supporters were assessed under de-nazification, the result was that <i>every</i> German could see that high crimes did not go unpunished and that our neighbor countries could trust us again.<p>Contrast this to the post-Independence Wars Balkans, where half the war criminals of all sides were not prosecuted at all as they died and not much research happened into what they did, and of the other half the majority was protected by their respective ethnic&#x27;s governments for sometimes decades. The result? Ugly nationalism and hatred are as alive as ever in the region.')
