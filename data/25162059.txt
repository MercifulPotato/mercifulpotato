The Pi400 looks great except that it doesn&#x27;t support a webcam+microphone(+audio out?) out of the box and attempts to find an HDMI monitor with these things built in and supported by the Pi have thus far been unsuccessful.  Is it odd to be considering a Lunux laptop for a 10-year old?  The open source ethos of both machines, seems ideal for this use case.')
