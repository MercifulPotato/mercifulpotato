That isn&#x27;t the official source code of Turbo Pascal.<p>&quot;Because of my interest in Pascal programming language and compilers I created a Turbo Pascal compiler written in Turbo Pascal - TPC16. This is a compiler compatible with the original Borland Turbo Pascal 7 command line compiler tpc.exe. Later I modified this compiler to compile under Delphi - TPC32. On the foundations of this compiler I later created Turbo51 - Pascal compiler for 8051 microcontrollers. Then I decided to publish the secrets of the first compiler I have created and this website was born. Here you can find the internals, algorithms and data structures of the Turbo Pascal 7 command-line compiler. You can also download the executable file of the TPC16 compiler.<p>I created the compiler from scratch, but credits for the beauty of the language and for the exceptional elegance of the compiler go to Niklaus Wirth, Anders Hejlsberg and Borland.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;direct.turbopascal.org&#x2F;about" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;direct.turbopascal.org&#x2F;about</a>')
