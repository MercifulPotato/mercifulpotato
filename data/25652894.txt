Was always a good experience . . . EXCEPT: trying to get power management dialed-in.  (a package from Apple would be very helpful here).<p>Of course, now with TouchBar, I have no idea if that is even supported on Linux at all. I assume it&#x27;s not, and if it is, it&#x27;s a complete pain in the ass. (but honestly - could possibly be GREAT, if it weren&#x27;t for the loss of the &#x27;esc&#x27; key).<p>I seem to recall getting Debian running on my dual PPC Mac Pro was also difficult; with power management - but on the other hand, I was using it as a server and ran it full-blast 24x7 anyway. Damn that thing was loud.<p>I only see the M1 making power management that much more complicated, (due to custom chipset and lack of support from tools that are standard on x86-based linux distros).  The main thing you&#x27;d stand to gain from the M1 platform is power and heat management.  So I am cautiously optimistic that anyone wanting to port linux there will possibly pay close attention to putting together a package of tools that will work.')
