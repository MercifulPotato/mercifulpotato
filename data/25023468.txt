EdDSA is good and also a perfectly acceptable choice. They have different tradeoffs (some of which are mentioned in the article but not all), so you may want to consider trade offs, but as a user (e.g. choosing ssh or ssl keys), not a designer, everyone should feel free to choose either from the security perspective. You need to choose the right key size for both, and you need to use the correct vetted tools for both. But there really isn&#x27;t much of downsides for using either.<p>As a system designer, there are some trade offs, but once again, in almost all practical system designs, both are acceptable security wise.')
