It shows the accelerated performance vs Metal performance on a generic GPU vs performance on a GPU with dedicated ML units on it. It&#x27;s not a performance improvement &quot;over Intel&quot;, it&#x27;s a performance improvement &quot;over hardware without dedicated ML acceleration in the new version&quot;. There&#x27;s a similar massive performance gain with the Mac Pro example, showing that the new version being tested is able to leverage GPU power much more effectively.<p>Comparing the dedicated ML hardware to the generic just-decode-video-and-animate-windows-at-decent-speeds Intel Iris doesn&#x27;t really prove any performance gain. There&#x27;s no apples to apples comparison to be made here. If Apple and Nvidia would finally get over themselves, you might be able to make a fair comparison between the M1 and Intel + CUDA. The Intel &quot;pro&quot; laptop they&#x27;re comparing against only comes with a 1.7GHz Intel CPU and only Intel&#x27;s mediocre integrated graphics, so I don&#x27;t see why you would use that version for anything professional related to ML anyway; at best you&#x27;d use it to test your pipelines.<p>All you can conclude from this is that the new M1 chips perform better at TensorFlow than the Intel chips + GPUs in the previous models of Macbook after Apple made a Mac-optimised version that better leverages GPU power.')
