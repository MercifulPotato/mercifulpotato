It limits competition (increases prices) raising the cost of living and reducing everyone&#x27;s standard of living.  When it gets so bad that the options for groceries start vanishing (because groceries are low margin) we call that a &quot;food desert&quot;.<p>People shopping locally because the opportunity cost of shopping elsewhere is too high (as opposed to willingly doing it for the convenience factor) is very much not a good thing, regardless of the mode of transportation those people are using.')
