I could maybe see if it was a site that employees were actually using it to perform concerted activities. If the firm was hired by the company, then they can&#x27;t also represent the workers. Thus, what could employees do on that site for concerted activities?<p>I would also guess the plugin only covers prohibited use and does not cover allowed uses (ie does the plugin say you have 1st ammendment rights when visiting Facebook?). I doubt the documentation states that the plugin shall provide users with their rights. It probably says something like the purpose is to provide users with policy or law information related to the site they are visiting so they don&#x27;t break the law&#x2F;policy.')
