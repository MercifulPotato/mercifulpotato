Polyphonic aftertouch sadly died (for the most part) in the 1990s, but MPE is becoming more popular and I expect to see innovation in terms of MPE controllers and synths, with associated improvements in expressive performance capabilities.<p><i>Physical modeling</i> dates back decades but still hasn&#x27;t really hit the mainstream. I expect to see it in more keyboard synthesizers.<p>There are a lot of interesting <i>apps and plugins</i> that feature things like physical modeling, granular synthesis, various kinds of waveshaping and wave folding, etc..<p>There has been a huge <i>modular synthesis revival</i> with Eurorack and digital modular, as well as a commensurate explosion in available modules that go well beyond traditional modulars.<p>One major innovation in the past few years has been the rise of <i>FPGAs and programmable oscillators</i> such as those on the Korg Prologue; DSP synths have existed for a while, but it&#x27;s remarkable to have FPGA hardware oscillators and effects that you can modify by downloading new bitfiles. Companies like Sinevibes have managed to add a variety of new oscillators (e.g. FM, resonator, waveshaping and effects (e.g. granular reverb, random repeater) to the Prologue.')
