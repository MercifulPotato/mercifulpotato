Arguing semantics and confusing map for territory only wastes everyone&#x27;s time and effort. It&#x27;s a trap, and we won&#x27;t progress as society to handle tough political problems until we learn to stop doing it.<p>What the farmer in your example cares about is the legal classification of tomatoes in context of subsidies and taxation. That&#x27;s an entirely different thing that biological, or culinary classification, and needs to be <i>explicitly</i> separated. If it isn&#x27;t it leads to idiocy.<p>Real life examples of such inane reasoning can be seen with some very popular complaints about &quot;stupid EU bureaucracy&quot; - for example, that EU &quot;decided that snails are fish&quot; (they aren&#x27;t, they just get bucketed with fish for some trade deal).
