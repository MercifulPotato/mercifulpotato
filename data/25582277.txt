Waiting around to see if it’s the police could be deadly for you if it’s someone attempting to rob you. For better or for worse, it’s perfectly legal for people in the US to own guns and use them to protect themselves in their home, it’s legal in ALL 50 states.<p>So the police create a situation where the residents inside have no information (at best) or think someone is there to kill them (at worst). The residents inside believe they are being attacked and defend themselves properly and legally. Instead of looking at the new situation (resident is shooting at us) and looking for a way to deescalate they decide that this resident has exercised a right the police don’t like and massacre them instead. This was always the intention, the way they served the warrant was the gaslighting, they were just waiting for a reaction so they could unload their mags.<p>So in short, the cops arrived at someone’s home, and then they <i>created</i> a situation so deadly that they had to murder someone to get out. If they wanted to do this without a murder there were a thousand ways to do it, they chose the most dangerous way intentionally because they did not value the lives of the people inside as human.<p>That is their fault, and the fact that these guys are not locked up for what is essentially an assassination is deeply disturbing.')
