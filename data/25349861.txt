To really get control, you need to do more than locking down. You need a system by which anyone who should get tested can and does get tested, and the results need to be quick. You need to support people who need to isolate so that they can and do isolate. You need to get case counts low enough that contact tracing is useful and then trace contacts for real. You need to actively monitor to find new infections. Once your infection rate is lower than your neighbors, you need to control your borders to manage imported cases.<p>It’s plausible that some subset of this would work.  But certainly just locking down will not work well enough.  And doing random subsets of this like California seems to be doing right now is silly.')
