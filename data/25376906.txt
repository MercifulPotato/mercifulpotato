Because it&#x27;s the only language of the 13+ I&#x27;ve used in production code where the compiler actually helps you.<p>I&#x27;ve written C, C++, C#, Java, JS ES5+, ActionScript, HTML5 and CSS since IE6, many various compile-toJS languages, many different frameworks and more. Elm is the only language where I can jump into a foreign code base or my own months later and feel confident that I can change something, push to production, and not break things.<p>edit: I&#x27;ve also written Perl and Ruby in production too.<p>edit2: How does it help? When you make a change that isn&#x27;t valid, like adding a new argument to a function, the compiler can tell you everywhere you need to make a fix and sometimes even suggest how to fix things. Add on top of that the editor tooling in Intellij or with the elm-langauge-server in VSCode and other editors and it&#x27;s just super smooth. Build times are also crazy fast. There&#x27;s no waiting for the compiler. The whole notion of &quot;If it compiles, it works&quot; I find to be true 99% of the time.')
