The major difference is that while a capital city train station handles around 10-40 trains at a time with short arrival-departure pause (e.g. Prague main station handles around 10-15 concurrent trains), capital city airports are often handling many dozens of concurrent flights (with longer arrival-departure pause and smaller groups per vehicle) -&gt; the airport takes more area but isn&#x27;t technically sophisticated at all; the train station is denser, but railroad switching at a station isn&#x27;t easy. So let&#x27;s just keep stations separate. Of course buildings required by the machines should be included.<p>It most definitely is possible to build an airport without any costs other than construction of the runway and a fuel pump, and a 2-4 km stretch of dirt is more than enough. If you want airliners landing there then simply pour asphalt or concrete over it, smaller planes can handle dirt. You&#x27;ll want to bring fuel - a truck that already often drives nearby (to supply gas stations) will bring it to you, and nothing fancier than the simplest second hand fuel pump and a tank is needed.<p>It is also most definitely possible to add significant capacity to an existing airport with nearly zero costs and it is <i>routinely</i> done - every year from May to September hundreds of tiny airports all around the world start serving (sometimes) more flights than the country&#x27;s capital city, bringing in <i>thousands of people from dozens or even hundreds of different destinations all around the planet</i>, with flights coming in every 30 minutes from 8 to 22. Usually a travel agency finds a place they like (that probably never had a single airliner fly over there before), they call it and make a deal, and it&#x27;s done. They&#x27;ll set up their own ground handling service if they have that many flights daily to improve efficiency - that&#x27;s as easy as parking a few cars next to the airport and placing staff they already employ there, and it&#x27;s not needed if it&#x27;s just a flight per hour or so.<p>The thing that&#x27;s hard about capital city airports is that everyone wants to go to a different destination and be there on time, everyone goes to the airport by their own means, the security theatre, etc. I don&#x27;t know much train stations with numbers of car parking places comparable to airports, and these that do still don&#x27;t like cars being parked for weeks there. The travel agency has it simpler because they&#x27;re moving the whole group either by plane or by bus, and they can do whatever they like with the schedule. Many smaller cities have airports that handle few flights per week and that kind of airport is at most a single building next to the runway, nothing like FRA or the new BER.<p>Maintaining existing capacity - I already talked about the runway pour... That&#x27;s about it. The fuel equipment will need a refresh every 20 years or so.')
