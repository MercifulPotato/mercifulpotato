Item(by='snvzz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604957812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25037237, text='&gt;Whenever I read articles like this I wonder about the economics of behavior like this.<p>These practices are unfortunately widespread among printer makers.<p>They can get away with it because and only because there&#x27;s a huge void in the field of OSHW printers. I imagine a decent effort to make an OSHW laser printer would gather a lot of interest. Even if the first printer were to be slow, expensive and had poor resolution.<p>I&#x27;d easily recommend such a printer to everybody. It&#x27;d be a really easy sell. Everybody hates dealing with printers.<p>If you need a printer now, by all means, avoid the bad brands, and go for a laser, preferably monochrome, with an ethernet port, postscript support and IPP support.')
