I don&#x27;t own a particularly large amount of Apple stock, but if the price dropped even a little bit, and if I knew the drop was due to nothing more than this weird thing where everyone was selling for some reason, I might decide to own more. If aliens sent out a mind control signal that caused every Apple shareholder to start selling, the buyers (whoever they were, maybe the aliens? ;) ) would compete with each other to buy.<p>To give you a concrete example, let&#x27;s say I am the only owner in the world of a flying car. One day, I decide to sell it. 100% of the owners of flying cars have decided to sell, but the price would clearly not drop to zero! The idea that everyone selling implies the price will drop to zero applies to pure Keynesian beauty contests where 100% of the value is in owning something perceived to be valuable. For currencies that is completely true, but for companies that is less true.')
