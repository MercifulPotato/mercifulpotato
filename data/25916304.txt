Most of them certainly had forums to buy and sell. Many had clients with graphical capabilities.<p>They didn&#x27;t exaggerate much there - it was a space with plenty of competition, to the point that for a lot of people the Internet seemed like a boring step down in capabilities for some time, with networks like AOL and Prodigy believing they could stem the tide and keep people walled in.<p>For my part, before I got internet access, I reinvented a bunch of that stuff myself, and worked on a graphical BBS client and capability for federation. And there&#x27;s nothing unique in that - I know many others who also did, unaware of what existed, and without thinking we invented anything new, because they were small, incremental obvious steps from what we did know about.<p>It&#x27;s simply a natural set of things that people wanted, and the limiting factor was not the ideas, but access to time, talent and capital and a willingness to go ahead and do it.<p>That&#x27;s often how these things work. Things get independently reinvented all over the place. Not necessarily well, or fast enough etc.<p>And you&#x27;ll note Cameron is not the only one to invent any of the things she does in the series either.')
