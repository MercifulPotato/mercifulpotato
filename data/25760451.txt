For the storage I&#x27;m using a ZFS pool made of two HDDs in mirror mode (but since I&#x27;m using a Linux distro, if I would have done it today I would have used BTRFS due to it&#x27;s better support on Linux. I&#x27;m still with ZFS because that pool is a leftover of a previous attempt at storing my photo archive). I have yet to configure an offsite backup, which is crucial in this scenario since putting everything on a NAS makes it a single point of failure')
