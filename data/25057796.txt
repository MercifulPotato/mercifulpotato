Item(by='johncolanduoni', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605098093, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25057498, text='&gt; Some OSes (OpenBSD) will do randomization based on object files and sections, which you can do things with like place each function in a different section and relink. This would require an exploit to leak addresses, which is a better situation I guess; the downside is that this adds complexity and is fundamentally incompatible with certain operating systems (Darwin).<p>Doesn’t Darwin’s linking model effectively do this separation (though I don’t know about randomization) unconditionally, with the whole “atom” thing? IME the linker does tree shaking effectively without per-function sections, and I have trouble seeing how that would work otherwise.')
