They are comparing 72 and 64 core processors to single core ones to try to make the claim that &quot;transistors per chip&quot; are doubling in accordance with Moore&#x27;s Law (which they still aren&#x27;t--you can plot a line through and see that we are falling short of linear on a log scale).  Are you really arguing that simply making microprocessors larger, ignoring cost and density, is an improvement in processing power (especially for the average end user, who is on a machine with only a handful of cores)?<p>Look at the actual transistor sizes.  In 2009 we were at 32 nm.  We&#x27;re now in 2021, so if transistor sizes had kept halving every two years we would be at 0.5 nm.  Clearly, we are not anywhere close to that--we&#x27;re off by a factor of 10, and that&#x27;s only with the very latest and greatest manufacturing processes that almost no consumer chips use (not to mention that the 5nm process used by AMD is not the same as a 5nm process used by Intel). As the article itself notes:<p>&gt; Microprocessor architects report that semiconductor advancement has slowed industry-wide since around 2010, below the pace predicted by Moore&#x27;s law.<p>Of course transistor companies are happy to claim that they are secretly keeping pace, but in terms of commercially available microprocessors it is unquestionably false.  Anyone using the &quot;doubling every two years&quot; approximation to decide how much more computing power is available now than 10 years ago, or how much more will be available 10 years in the future,  is not going to arrive at correct figures.')
