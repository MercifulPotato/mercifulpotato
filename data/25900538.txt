The last hard numbers we had were when they issued ~2.5B, and had $800M siezed because they banked with a money launderer (CryptoCapital). If you look at the Bahamian government&#x27;s report on domestic banks with USD on deposit, the total for all banks grew $1B last year while over $20B Tethers were issued.<p>Further, let&#x27;s say they have $10B. If all of those are the proceeds of money laundering (and let&#x27;s face it, they probably are, after all, why would anyone give Tether money when they could give Circle money or Coinbase money) - then they&#x27;d all be forfeit anyways.<p>And even if <i>that&#x27;s</i> not true, they&#x27;re under no obligation to redeem Tether tokens.
