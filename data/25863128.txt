I was very frustrated with how they always would forget to turn on VPN on their devices, and some times install malwares mistakenly thinking it&#x27;s a &quot;free VPN&quot;.<p>So I built &quot;Freedom Routers&quot; a plug &amp; play whole network VPN router to connect all your home devices to a VPN at once with the ability to change VPN location from within the router.<p>- It can be used to connect none supported devices to a VPN (PS4, IPTV, etc)\n- it can be used as an umbrella for all devices to encrypt all traffic via VPN\n- It can be used to bypass ISP restrictions\n- prevent leaks (since the router is also a firewall).\n- It can be operated by someone who has 0 knowledge about VPN &#x2F; tech (pure plug and play)<p>The video is the router&#x27;s control panel interface. \nPlease give me your feedback about the whole project.\nthe idea, the UI, the hardware, etc.<p>tl;dr: a VPN router that pops a new Wi-Fi in your home which automatically connects to a VPN')
