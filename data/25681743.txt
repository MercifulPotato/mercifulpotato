It&#x27;s a slope and not a switch, but even in the case of &quot;regular&quot; crime, I&#x27;m not  entirely convinced someone showing willful, unambiguously intentional disregard for basic social contract&#x2F;others&#x27; negative rights, has full claim to the same rights, i.e. full moral value.<p>In this case we are talking about trying to achieve political means via violence. The kind of people who do that outside of very extreme circumstances definitely renounce their moral value as human beings in my view. It&#x27;s not that  they &#x2F;should&#x2F; be shot as a punishment or something; it&#x27;s more like dealing with malarial mosquito - the evil is on the level where ends justify the means.')
