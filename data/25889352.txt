We had an Apple 8100 sitting in the corner. We needed a machine to FTP all the weather sites every 10 minutes and download current conditions to input into a running near-realtime ocean current model. Kinda like Windy, except this was the mid 1990&#x27;s.<p>The code was a custom Perl script written by a programmer that later died with his family on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon on 9&#x2F;11.<p>It ran very reliably for weeks, except when somebody would login and run X-windows. Then it would die a horrible death within hours.<p>One oddity about the version we had, it had to be installed from MacOS (System 7 I believe). Some of the pathnames in the default install were longer than what was allowed in MacOS (256 characters, I think) so not everything would be installed correctly!')
