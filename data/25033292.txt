In my mind &quot;free speech&quot; is speech that is entirely unrestricted.  Almost all FOSS licenses come with &quot;restrictions&quot;, such as you must leave the copyright notice in place, you must add the &quot;PROVIDED AS IS&quot; spiel somewhere the end user can read it, you must release your derivative work&#x27;s source code under the same license etc., so it is by definition no longer &quot;free&quot;.<p>WTFPL is probably the only <i>real</i> &quot;free&quot; license.')
