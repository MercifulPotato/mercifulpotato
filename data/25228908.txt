This entire thing reads like it was torn from the journal of a clever middle-schooler who thinks he&#x27;s so much more clever then the world.<p>Right now Silicon Valley VC thinking is the dominant ideology, putting blinders on to what is considered convention isn&#x27;t cultivating an independent mind, it&#x27;s an assertion of the status quo.<p>&gt; An essay that told people things they already knew would be boring.<p>I agree, but given how beloved rehashed versions of &quot;aren&#x27;t we the clever independent thinkers!&quot; essays are here I think there is some empirical evidence to the contrary.')
