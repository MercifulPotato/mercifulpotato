But if the newspaper had interactive functions, and had billed itself as an open platform where opinions of any kind could be published (as is the case with YouTube), then yes, censorship would become a thorny legal issue for them.<p>Further, one of the big problems here is that YouTube didn&#x27;t do this of its own accord.  Agents of the government - Democratic Senators in this case, who signed the letter in their official capacity - pressured the company into suppressing free speech that they simply didnâ€™t like.  That is a clear violation of the Constitution.')
