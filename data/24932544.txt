What I would say is small organizations want &#x2F; need a variety of skills.  They also tend to actually know who they are hiring and why, not go through some HR &quot;process&quot; that filters resumes in an automated way.<p>Small organizations can be start ups, successful well established companies that are smaller, or autonomous organizations that are owned by a larger company but that need to run their own business.<p>How would you find these organizations?  Startups are pretty easy to find because they need to promote themselves.  And you are here so you should know how to find them.  For successful smaller organizations that are not start ups, look at what verticals are important (and profitable) in the region of the world you want to live.  In that vertical you will find small, really successful companies that are not well known.  See if they have openings.')
