It&#x27;s solving a non-problem.<p>Tesla is selling all of the cars they can make, and the people simply don&#x27;t find themselves experiencing the range anxiety they imagine they will. The vast majority of them just plug in their cars when they get home and never, ever think about going to a gas station. It&#x27;s not about 30 minutes at a charger vs 5 minutes at a gas station; it&#x27;s about 5 minutes at a gas station vs 0 minutes.<p>That&#x27;s 99% of the trips taken in a Tesla. For 99% of the rest, there are superchargers.<p>So your range extender is a lot of extra machinery in an otherwise mostly solid-state device. To a Tesla owner, it just feels dirty, the way a gas station always feels grimy. It wouldn&#x27;t help them sell any extra cars because the limiting factor on their sales is how fast they can build them.<p>They&#x27;re scaling up, and by the time the gas cars are phased out, the entire system will have shifted. There will be even more superchargers and even more solid options for those 1% of 1% of trips that it won&#x27;t suffice for.<p>Meantime, Tesla owners already spend less time than gas car owners fueling their cars, because it happens while they sleep. They don&#x27;t need a mechanical solution because it&#x27;s already solved.')
