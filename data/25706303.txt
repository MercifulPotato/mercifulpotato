I was completely sedentary, never played a competitive sport, was last place in my high schools &quot;presidential fitness test&quot;.<p>I still do not actually &quot;enjoy&quot; it, but I made it a habit and kept motivation to go because of two things: progress and goals. As a beginning lifter, you make ridiculous progress that seems absurd (adding weight and becoming stronger every other day) which to me was really an amazing sort of &quot;hack&quot;. I plan to write more on how motivating this kind of linear progress is and how to form a habit around it.<p>Now, even though I do not actually enjoy exercise, it has become a habit similar to brushing&#x2F;flossing my teeth. Not particularly enjoyable, but something I just know I have to do.')
