The account was designed to deliver automatic firmware updates to connected access points through FTP.<p>Also translated as:<p>In the name of &quot;improving security&quot; we created a backdoor, which is known throughout the entire industry as &quot;removing all security&quot;. We are very sorry we were caught so easily.<p>It does not take much to understand this was a terrible idea. Or that there are so many better ways to build and deploy automatic updates. You absolutely do not need to be able to control a machine remotely to deploy automatic updates. But counting the ways they went wrong building this update system makes it extremely hard to believe that was the intent.<p>&gt; After a thorough investigation, we’ve identified the vulnerable products that are within their warranty and support period and are releasing firmware patches to address the issue, as shown in the table below.<p>That they went to the effort of identifying their minimal viable liability and all released patches for that, makes it even more disingenuous.<p>This is a company whose business is supposed to be about enhancing security. They should know better.')
