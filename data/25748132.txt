Item(by='Jtsummers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610465549, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25748013, text='&gt; For people that mention software like Ledger, Excel and Google Sheets to do their accounting, what do you do to make sure you don&#x27;t accidentally delete&#x2F;duplicate&#x2F;edit a transaction and how do you import the latest transactions in an automated way?<p>I make sure by reconciling my accounts weekly (verifying them against the actual bank&#x2F;brokerage accounts). I don&#x27;t import automatically, I found that that led to laziness on my part. The value proposition of this style, for me, was better awareness of my money (not a vague, &quot;I have enough&quot; or I have around $xxxx in my checking account and $xxxxx in my brokerage account).<p>However, there are tools to bring in transactions automatically and I did use them for a bit. There are tools that offer support for OFX, CSV, QIF and others listed on the linked page. I found OFX (not just with this, but in general) to be inconsistent across banks, and, when I did things &quot;automatically&quot;, made it semi-automatic. I&#x27;d download the CSV of transactions and import them.')
