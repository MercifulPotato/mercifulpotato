Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=[24756752], score=None, time=1602521723, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756033, text='&gt; recall the Hispanic utility company employee who was terminated for making the &#x27;ok&#x27; sign inadvertently or the data scientist who was terminated for Tweeting a prominent black academic&#x27;s research on the efficacy of nonviolent protests or the journalist who was harassed by coworkers and nearly terminated for interviewing a black man who expressed concern about crime in his neighborhood<p>Which of these are things an employer would reasonably fire an employee over? I don&#x27;t think any reasonable person would believe that these people would have been fired if it weren&#x27;t for the concerted canceling. Otherwise why would people bother petitioning the employer if the employer would have fired them anyway?<p>Moreover, do cancel-culture proponents really want to cement the precedent that employment is just an ordinary association, and that anyone&#x27;s employment (and thus livelihood and health insurance) can be terminated on the whims of their employer? Would they feel comfortable allowing a Trump-voting employer to casually part ways with an employee upon finding out they support Biden? Bear in mind that you and I and those we know are probably much more likely to be in high-demand tech positions than the median American.')
