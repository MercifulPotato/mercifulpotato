If you follow the UK elections, there was a big fall of the &quot;red wall&quot;, which put the Tories in power. That &quot;red wall&quot; are all areas which have been totally abandoned by the UK Government for the last 30+ years.<p>For these people, the &quot;elites&quot; are people in the South East<i>: people in Greater London who have benefited from enormous investment - the investment which should have been spread out more fairly.<p>Because these areas have seen a lack of investment, they are cheap to live in. They also see a lot of Polish&#x2F;Romanian&#x2F;Hungarian immigrants who are doing seasonal &#x2F; tough work (because it&#x27;s cheap).<p>So if you&#x27;re going to get **</i>d anyway, why not take some of those smug **s down with you?<p>* Even TheGuardian are a great example of this horrible LONDON focus.')
