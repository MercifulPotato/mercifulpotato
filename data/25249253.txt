I’m just responding to the claim that ingested proteins can’t be absorbed or have any impact. The gut does break things down but not absolutely 100%. A little does make it into the bloodstream.<p>Prions via GMO plants are unlikely but foreign or altered proteins causing mysterious and really hard to isolate food allergies in fractions of the population is plausible. These could go undiagnosed for a very long time since GMOs are not labeled or tracked the way drugs or food additives are.<p>Most of the credible objections to GMOs revolve around their use in tandem with overuse of herbicides and pesticides (e.g. round up ready crops), the potential to impact pollinators, and gene patents and IP lock-in.')
