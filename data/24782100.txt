I think I would use it too much at first, and the pull it back to using it a reasonable amount :)<p>I can think of a bunch of things over the years where I did exactly that on first discovering it.<p>A small warning though: I write a lot of perl, and while <i>I</i> care a lot about readability for the next developer, plenty of people fail at the &quot;pull it back&quot; phase so it&#x27;s definitely a trade-off.')
