Item(by='npsimons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604339952, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24967432, text='&gt; You&#x27;ll pay more than the price difference for someone to implement all of that from scratch.<p>I also think the &quot;pay someone to set this up&quot; factor is underestimated. Person time cost eclipsed computer time cost a <i>long</i> time ago. If you&#x27;ve got the market demand to <i>need</i> that kind of infrastructure, you&#x27;re almost certainly operating at a scale where you can afford to dish out the extra dough because it will reduce downtime and overhead enough to make the ROI worth it.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert in this (I&#x27;m just a code monkey who works with scientists, and side hustles as a small time sysadmin), but reading books like &quot;Release It!&quot; and reading blogs (especially DevOps, as I&#x27;m looking at getting into that) gives me the impression that if someone could reduce their costs while still getting the value AWS gives, they&#x27;d be doing it. I mean, maybe it&#x27;s a well-kept secret (especially if it gives a market advantage), but if it&#x27;s so easy, I&#x27;d think everyone would be doing it, and AWS would be out of business.<p>Edit: I concede that startups probably don&#x27;t need AWS; what I&#x27;m thinking of above is big, old, established companies that believe &quot;no one was ever fired for buying AWS.&quot; <i>But</i> I do believe that you have to have smart, motivated people in order to grow while staying lean, and just because we hear the survivor stories of startups that do, doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t dozens that die because inexperienced devs though they could do better than AWS, and were proven wrong.')
