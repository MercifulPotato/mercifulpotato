In parallel, serendipity largely died - you could no longer run into a friend or co-worker or interesting new person given social distancing.<p>So, we put together Pluto - built on webRTC with MediaSoup and webGL with THREE.js and many other technologies.<p>Pluto is a browser-only VR space (no headsets needed) for spacial video chats and hangouts. You can move around in using first-person shooter-like controls. Sound decays with distance so different groups can break up and hang out.<p>Just drop in a link, and you can attend an event over video (no headset, no nothing). Create a virtual world in just one click!<p>Everything is represented in 3D which means people can randomly run into each other and serendipity can finally happen again.<p>We have built out a number of worlds using Blender to construct 3D models of :\n-Burning Man\n-The Maldives\n-Admont Abbey Library\n-A room in old Austria.<p>You can go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pluto.video" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pluto.video</a> to try it in your own VR in-browser world. It is best tried out with friends but can also be fun to explore the virtual world solo.<p>Come check it out and let us all know what you think!<p>It is still early &#x2F; janky but we wanted to get it out there and get some feedback :)<p>We will be hanging out at an instance from 11am to 1:30pm PT at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;team.pluto.video" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;team.pluto.video</a>.<p>Pluto was partially inspired in part by new social experiments on the web like Clubhouse, Gatherly, Rally, Rambly, Sonar, Teamflow, Yorb and others....')
