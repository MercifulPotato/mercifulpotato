Item(by='haberman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610754752, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25797888, text='&gt; Essentially, Zig being the &quot;Go&quot; of C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Rust&#x2F;D.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a fair comparison, as Zig features compile-time evaluation (&quot;comptime&quot;) that supports first-class types. Generics falls out of that by letting you create types imperatively at compile time.  It&#x27;s hard to imagine Go ever going in this direction.<p>As a long-time C programmer, I am really excited to try out Zig once it stabilizes a bit more.  Zig&#x27;s take on generics seems like a compelling alternative to C++ templates.')
