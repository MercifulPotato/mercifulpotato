You can split it so that each subgroup of three out of the five can reconstruct the entire phrase.<p>Slight change to the idea above:<p>- wallet with a daily limit for transactions that don&#x27;t need a second confirmation a day apart.<p>- need for a second confirmation one day apart for transactions over said limit.<p>- &quot;social recovery key&quot; able to immediately bypass all limits.<p>So for daily use you can set your limit in such a way that you can perform immediate transactions. Bigger transactions (such as <i>all your money</i>) need to be confirmed a second time after 24 hours. During that time, a transaction request is written on the blockchain and can be observed by your wallet app. If someone steals your private key they can only transfer amounts within the daily limit, or trigger a warning by attempting to transfer more. If your private key is stolen, you can use a &quot;social recovery key&quot; that bypasses all limits and can be used to transfer your entire amount to a new wallet. What do you think?')
