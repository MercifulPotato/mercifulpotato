Item(by='dafoex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602074452, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707417, text='Your original comment discusses the time it takes to go from having no gun to being in a position to fire your gun at wildlife that has bypassed your garden fence.  You make no mention of the time it takes to actually retrieve the children from the garden who are too small and not strong enough to fight their way past the enormous number of hypothetical hogs.  Those children need to be picked up and carried to safety before you can unload into the sea of brown fur that 30 to 50 feral hogs would become if packed into a small garden.  Ideally, if those hogs are violent and armed with tusks that could break an arm, you should be rescuing the small, weak, juvenile humans before taking any other action.')
