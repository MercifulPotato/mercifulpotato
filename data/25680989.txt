Facebook does not optimize for addiction, it optimizes for engagement. The addiction that makes nicotine and other substances so harmful refers to the physiological &amp; psychological dependence these substances create. Repeat engagement is not the same as actual addiction and it&#x27;s misleading to conflate them.<p>Coffee companies do the same, their goal is that you repeatedly come back to consume more of their coffee, decaf or not. The more frequently and voraciously customers consume their coffee, the more money they make from coffee sales. You think they don&#x27;t also market test coffee variations for popularity?<p>Almost every company in the world optimizes for <i>more</i>; more consumption, more usage, more sales. The idea that Facebook is somehow in a league of its own for how it optimizes is clearly not true.')
