IMHO it&#x27;s driven by two key elements in the business: An apprenticeship-like, up-or-out model for developing talent and a vested owner-operator class at the &quot;partner&quot; level.<p>These firms effectively operate as a collective for the benefit of the partner class. New partners must invest capital, ongoing partners get returns, and older partners retire with a terminal payout. Some partners may take on expanded leadership roles and get higher annual payouts.<p>The overarching legal structure is a sort of &quot;modularization&quot; to limit the liability of lawsuits and enable flexible operation. There is a usually a global partnership council that dictates universal operating norms and practices.<p>Again, fundamentally, it operates as a collective and international units support each other for collective benefit.')
