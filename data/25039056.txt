Even keeping the package private in situations where that&#x27;s not appropriate feels like less work than the alternative of manual management.<p>And I&#x27;ve actually found the discoverability of the tricks used in nixpkgs to be pretty amazing. Sure the manual could always do with being more thorough (indeed it&#x27;s always getting better), but again, in comparison, the quantity of stuff understandable from just reading the contents of nixpkgs and knowing basically one language is huge.<p>I compare it to a lot of the other systems I work with where just to decipher relatively simple setups people have created I have to understand cryptic combinations of terraform, Dockerfiles, bash, helm, github workflows, concourse pipelines, puppet&#x2F;chef&#x2F;ansible&#x2F;..., travis.yml, Brewfiles... each of which being weirdly arbitrarily restricted and inevitably needing to call in yet another tool to fill in the gaps in their capabilities.')
