Parameter estimation (which generalizes averages and applies to other distribution features like variance) is a foundational modeling methodology. It&#x27;s useful for both understanding and forecasting data. Measures of central tendency are nearly always good (if obviously imperfect) models of systems.<p>Here is a trivial example: one of the best ways of modeling timeseries data, both in and out of sample, is to naively take the moving average. This is a rolling mean parameter estimate on <i>n</i> lagged values from the current timestep. Not only is this an excellent way of understanding the data (by decomposing it into seasonality, trend and residuals), it&#x27;s a competitive benchmark for future values. The first step in timeseries analysis shouldn&#x27;t be to reach for a neural network or even ARIMA. It should be to naively forecast forward using the mean.<p>You might be surprised at how difficult it is to beat that benchmark with cross-validation and no overfitting or look-ahead bias.')
