Voice can probably be compressed using a lossy algorithm pretty heavily before it becomes useless for keyword matching. Maybe there&#x27;s some sort of de-duping, and unique results are only sent up once per day&#x2F;week, etc. If it&#x27;s encrypted, it might look like random other telemetry.<p>About ten years ago, I discovered that one of the major &quot;rate you shopping experience&quot;-type survey providers had a feature where shoppers would be tagged at the beginning of their session, and if they were randomly selected, everything they did on the website was recorded (including text entered in fields, etc.). When they checked out, they&#x27;d get a pop-up asking if they wanted to complete a survey. If they answered &quot;no&quot;, supposedly that recording was deleted, but who knows? There was certainly no indication that answering &quot;yes&quot; would result in it being saved indefinitely for playback by the marketing department.<p>The only reason I found it was that I was curious about some binary data that would be uploaded every once in awhile. It wasn&#x27;t hard to take apart (zlib, I think), but the standard tools didn&#x27;t catch it at all because it was a custom thing developed by that vendor. I&#x27;ve still never seen anyone discuss it publicly, despite it having been very common on online stores for years.<p>It could also be that no one is doing marketing analytics based on voice recordings, of course. I just wouldn&#x27;t take it for granted that someone would have found it and disclosed it.')
