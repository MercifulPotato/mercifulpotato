Item(by='MaxBarraclough', descendants=None, kids=[24683382], score=None, time=1601850076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679564, text='I sometimes experience something similar with English (my first language, and I&#x27;m monolingual, unless we&#x27;re being extremely charitable). I&#x27;ll ask someone to repeat themselves, then momentarily afterwards, what they said suddenly clicks, before they&#x27;ve gone ahead and repeated the message.<p>I think of it like this: we have an interpretation subsystem to interpret messages carried in sound (in whichever language). It&#x27;s a soft real-time system. Typically it succeeds in interpreting good inputs, making its deadline, and it decisively rejects invalid inputs (on account of mumbling, overwhelming background noise, etc), also within the deadline. Occasionally it succeeds in interpreting a sound signal but misses its deadline.<p>There&#x27;s also a request-repeat subsystem, which may fire any time after the interpretation subsystem has either rejected an input as invalid, or missed a deadline. When it fires, we say something like <i>What was that?</i> to request retransmission of the previous message.<p>When the interpretation subsystem misses a deadline but then succeeds, it races the request-repeat subsystem, so there&#x27;s a chance of a <i>What was that?</i> being uttered immediately before successful interpretation of the previous message.')
