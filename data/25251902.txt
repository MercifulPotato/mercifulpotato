You don&#x27;t have to spend your time coding in a dingy apartment. There are plenty of people that will pay you a descent wage to work and you can do that from a nice cafe in Thailand. Living costs are low enough that you can pay your bills working part time while spending the rest working on your get rich long term side hustle.
