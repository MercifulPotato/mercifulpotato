The audio balance is generally fucked up and there&#x27;s some weird fuzziness to the sound or people suddenly start whispering only to have massive explosions and metal being torn apart 5 seconds later. (Yes, I know people say to adjust audio balance and settings but it doesn&#x27;t fix the problem.) It&#x27;s impossible to follow the dialogue otherwise.<p>I&#x27;m fine with watching TV without subtitles because usually it&#x27;s made with the assumption that people actually want to hear the dialogue.')
