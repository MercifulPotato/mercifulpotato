Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=[25283785, 25283917], score=None, time=1606955056, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25283229, text='&gt; To me, social controls on who can marry and who can breed with who are much less humane than offering experiential gene editing to sick and willing people.<p>The alternative wouldn&#x27;t need to be social controls. A program of free genetic testing simultaneous with typical childhood vaccines might suffice, with only the family given the results. Armed with such knowledge well before they begin developing relationships, many if not most people might voluntarily employ a disassortative mating strategy independent of any sort of state coercion.<p>And that doesn&#x27;t even need to be the alternative. It could just be the primary approach, with gene editing for handling the remaining and, hopefully, dramatically reduced case numbers.')
