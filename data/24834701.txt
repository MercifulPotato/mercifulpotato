Item(by='yetihehe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603178771, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834128, text='Ahh, I&#x27;m from the camp of &quot;the worst&quot;. My girlfriend is from that &quot;the best&quot; camp, but doesn&#x27;t have too much money. So we can&#x27;t use that little more expensive aluminum foil, because it&#x27;s for &quot;special occasions&quot;. She got upset because I&#x27;ve slightly damaged cheapest workshop vacuum (it&#x27;s cheapest, but happened to be rather good quality) using it for heavy duty tasks (and saved 50x it&#x27;s price by doing those tasks myself). Is this the live one should live? To be slave of your possesions? Do you really need the best tools from the start? I&#x27;ve started with cheapest possible ones and if they break too soon, I&#x27;ll get better ones. But for now, the almost cheapest ones fully earned their worth.')
