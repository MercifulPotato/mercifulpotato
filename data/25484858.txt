They sort&#x2F;of tried to put Facebook out of business and failed so miserably they may not get over it for another 5 years. They haven&#x27;t even been able to beat Spotify, where they arguably should be dominant.<p>Apple is pretty pitiful as a services company. Yes, they&#x27;re trying, and they may eventually figure out whatever structural issue it is that&#x27;s keeping them from being successful here, but I think for every significant business Apple has successfully cloned (Evernote, maybe? What else?) you can come up with at least another where they haven&#x27;t been able to despite trying, and another 2 or 3 where they haven&#x27;t tried (yet).<p>Yes, many small startups watch WWDC with fear in their souls that Apple is about to disintermediate them. It&#x27;s worth spending some time to understand the differences between those companies and companies that Apple has failed to compete with despite trying hard. I&#x27;m sure some obvious differences will jump out at you if you&#x27;re willing to abandon the position that Apple is an unbeatable juggernaut.')
