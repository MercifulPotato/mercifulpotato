Except that&#x27;s 1 tab and 50 history entries.<p>To recover that state via history is practically impossible.  It&#x27;s a needle in a haystack.  I&#x27;ve occasionally needed to do it, and it takes a long time.<p>(Compared with a tab, a bookmark doesn&#x27;t work well either for something to come back to.  Anything where there is a context, such as scroll position.  Perhaps if bookmarks were better, keeping track of scroll position and allowing text to be highlighted or a note to be attached, and showing a thumbnail (scrolled to the right place), and retaining some temporal relationships between different pages.  But I find bookmarks consisting of just a title and URL to be completely useless.)')
