Tempe has offices for MS, KPMG, Norton&#x2F;Lifelock, Netskope - and those were just what I could see from our LimeLight offices.  That&#x27;s on top of a pretty decent start-up&#x2F;small biz scene.<p>I&#x27;m always surprised by how much tech. we have here now.  So much more opportunity then back in 2000s..')
