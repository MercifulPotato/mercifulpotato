The mongo drivers are Apache licensed so in theory someone could use them as the basis for a driver that speaks to postgres instead, right?  I see tools like that showing up in my search results but since I have no experience with them I won’t link to any, if anyone here does have such experience sharing their results would be appreciated.')
