Item(by='ganafagol', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604765738, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25015329, text='Sorry if you felt attacked by the term &quot;lady&quot;. I&#x27;m not a native speaker and intended to express the gender by using the colloquial meaning of &quot;lady&quot;. If you had preferred me writing &quot;DoreenMichele is female&quot; then so be it, I can completely accept that. I&#x27;m a bit less positive about you pulling this into being a gender issue overall. I corrected the previous poster&#x27;s use of pronoun &quot;he&quot; when referring to you, and I did it in a &quot;P.S.&quot; so it was not the main point of my post. If that&#x27;s a problem and you&#x27;d rather like people calling you &quot;he&quot; stay uncorrected, so be it. But please don&#x27;t insinuate anything about my thoughts about gender equality, or that correcting the use of &quot;he&quot; instead of &quot;she&quot; has anything to do with gender equality or virtue signaling, for that matter.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where you feel I dogged you. I was presenting my view on what science is and is not. I did mention that you seem to think that you ought to get a nobel prize, and that this kind of statement tends to make me cautious, but both were merely a statement of fact. If you don&#x27;t want anybody to quote you on that, don&#x27;t say such things in the first place. And again, that has nothing to do with gender.')
