Timnit lied about who fired her, hid the fact that she gave an ultimatum and has now dedicated time to publicly smear and attack everyone at Google, including listing people who should be fired (by name!) on Twitter.

She never apologised, although she demands apology from Google coworkers.<p>The other activist was fired when she deployed political messaging code in production while hiding the whole process from her team and manager.<p>Do those strike as a people that will honestly present their story and would be good to work with?
