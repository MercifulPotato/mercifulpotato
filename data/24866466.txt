Unfortunately the competition is so bad that Spotify can do really, really bad things before it outweighs their overall competence at service delivery.<p>I don’t understand how it got to this point; Tidal seems like the most viable option but I swear even back in 2008 the field had far more solid options (e.g. Zune, as much as it was a commercial failure, was really great to use IME).<p>I just don’t understand how other streaming services haven’t delivered something like Spotify Connect yet.
