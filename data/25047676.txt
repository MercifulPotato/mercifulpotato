What I mean by &quot;cactus&quot; history is that the feature branches have a linear history that starts at the tip of the master branch but when we merge them back into master we still use a merge commit. Looks like this:<p><pre><code>      o-o-o   o-o-o   o-o\n     &#x2F;     \\ &#x2F;     \\ &#x2F;   \\\n    o-------o-------o-----o\n</code></pre>\nWe like doing that because, as the grandparent poster said, it clearly delineates the point where each PR was merged. AFAIK, the Gihub option to require a linear history assumes that you would want to flatten all the commits without any merge commits at all:<p><pre><code>    o-o-o--o-o-o--o-o</code></pre>')
