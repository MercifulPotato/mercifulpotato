Why shouldn&#x27;t California, New York, Texas or Florida split into North&#x2F;South or East&#x2F;West versions to gain more Senators. I understand the compromise that the House represents people and the Senate represents states so the small states don&#x27;t get overrun by the will of more populous states. But, by the same token, small states should not have so much power that they always overrun the will of the larger states. There should be balance. The House remains relatively in balance due to regular apportionment with the census. The Senate has no mechanism to make sure their power remains balanced. This is a gap that needs to be addressed.')
