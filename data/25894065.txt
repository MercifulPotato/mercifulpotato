Andrews and Naidenko say previous research shows that levels higher than one ppt can increase the risk of conditions such as testicular cancer, delayed mammary gland development, liver tumors, high cholesterol and effects on children’s immune response to vaccinations. “It’s a calculation of what would be a safe exposure level,” Andrews says. Even when the researchers shifted their analysis to a higher level of 10 ppt, they still found some 18 million to 80 million Americans to be exposed. Representatives of the chemical industry have disagreed with such concerns. “We believe there is no scientific basis for maximum contaminant levels lower than 70 ppt,” the American Chemistry Council said in statement to Scientific American.<p>anyone have more context on gauging the safe levels? What are the studies that show 1ppt increases the risk for cancer?<p>the EPA also currently sets the level at 70 ppt:<p>&gt; To provide Americans, including the most sensitive populations, with a margin of protection from a lifetime of exposure to PFOA and PFOS from drinking water, EPA has established the health advisory levels at 70 parts per trillion.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;ground-water-and-drinking-water&#x2F;drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-and-pfos#:~:text=To%20provide%20Americans%2C%20including%20the,at%2070%20parts%20per%20trillion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;ground-water-and-drinking-water&#x2F;drinking...</a>.')
