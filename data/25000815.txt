But that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;ve seen: Something is wrong with the methodology here, perhaps some form of sampling bias. Perhaps Trump is attracting supporters who typically didn&#x27;t vote before, so polls&#x27; that use things like &quot;likely voters&quot; aren&#x27;t performing well. I suspect it&#x27;s still more complicated than that though.<p>I&#x27;d like to see more polls after the election that ask people &quot;who did you vote for&quot;. If those polls are skewed against actual results in the same way as pre-election polls, that might point in the direction of the problem.')
