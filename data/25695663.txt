It’s very popular to bucket these things into black and white binaries but I don’t buy it. There are people who are on the fringes, both left and right, and then there are a lot of people who fit somewhere in the middle. Even “left” and “right” is a vast oversimplification at times.<p>When you start to think about it that way the perspective you’ve outlined doesn’t make a lot of sense. Should these people have legally nonsensical court cases heard simply because they’re a minority group and we need to ensure diversity in plaintiffs or something?<p>Overall, the argument only makes sense if there is some innate “right to be heard” that these people are being deprived of. There isn’t. There have been fringe movements that weren’t indulged by society at large for thousands of years, I’m not sure why any obligation would have changed.')
