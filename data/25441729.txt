The Google Video download URLs to watch the video, without any ads, are right there in the hxxp:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xxxxxxx webpage.  I use a tiny shell script of only 97 characters to extract them.  The truth is, where YouTube ads are concerned, neither a modified dnsmasq plus RPi so-called &quot;Pi-Hole&quot; nor any browser extension &quot;ad blocker&quot; is required.   No user needs to run Javascript to play videos just like no user needed to run Adobe Flash to play videos.  Flash and Javascript are useful, maybe even essential, for tracking and advertising, but are unnecessary for playing video.')
