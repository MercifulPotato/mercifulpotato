Being a SE is another thing. Being able to communicate with your (tech or non technical) colleagues in a constructive&#x2F;useful way is also another important thing.<p>What I have seen is that a lot of software engineers lack communication skills. Being able to deal and communicate with other people, feel empathy, see things from their perspective, deal with non technical POs or managers, crazy CEOs, offensive colleagues and all sort of things is something that should be taught before you enter the market somehow. And when I say &quot;deal&quot; and &quot;communicate&quot; I mean it in the most fruitful way for you, your colleagues, the company. In that order.<p>So &quot;being&quot; a SE is not only knowing the theory.')
