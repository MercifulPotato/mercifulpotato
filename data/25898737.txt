It&#x27;s almost like everyone&#x27;s forgotten what it actually means, or can&#x27;t be bothered to actually take the time to understand what they&#x27;re using it to describe.  As far as I can tell, the Boston Globe is not deleting anything (not that that would be censorship, either), just appending corrections&#x2F;updates and maybe de-indexing some stories:<p>From the OP:<p>&gt; What actions does this initiative involve? Will you delete stories? Will you remove names? What about Google?<p>&gt; We have a number of options, including updating a story with new information and removing a story from search engine results. We consider every case on its own merits, and take the action appropriate based on the individual circumstances.<p>&gt; Are you concerned about erasing history?<p>&gt; We’re considering these on a case-by-case basis but we think the value of giving someone a fresh start often outweighs the historic value of keeping a story widely accessible long after an incident occurred. People’s lives aren’t static, they’re dynamic.<p>If this is censorship, so is the corrections page and new &amp; updated editions of books.')
