The problem is even you people in the Senate can&#x27;t agree on what&#x27;s true, so instead you&#x27;re trying to make us, a private company, the arbiter of what&#x27;s acceptable to say as it relates to US elections. Doesn&#x27;t that seem insane to you? Let&#x27;s do this - you guys form a bipartisan committee of Facebook truth deciders. When there&#x27;s controversy over whether a post is true or not, we&#x27;ll kick it over to you guys, and you let us know whether to keep it up or remove it. If a bipartisan Senate committee can&#x27;t agree on what the truth is, then you all agree to stop complaining about the decisions we make on that front. Isn&#x27;t that better than having a private company control election-related speech?&quot;')
