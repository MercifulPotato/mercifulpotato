The 75% number was fabricated to allow them to build a model.  Asymptomatic people could be 0% as infectious as symptomatic people.  Or, by some unexpected turn of fate, they could be 200% as infectious as symptomatic people.  The evidence doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Your link even mentions another scientist who believes that asymptomatic people are only 35% as infectious.')
