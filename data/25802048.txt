Thing is he came in early daily and left late at night, had been twice divorced, and lost custody of his daughter. The guy literally lived in his van behind a Chili&#x27;s across from the office (we tried taking up donations to help him get a place but he refused it and donated it instead...hell of a guy...).<p>Anyway one morning apparently his manager came in while he was releasing some stress and threatened him with sexual harassment so he left instead. It was sad that he was let go, but he eventually wound up working for Wells Fargo so I guess he landed on his feet.<p>And I know for a fact that one of our analysts took almost hourly bathroom breaks because she was, in her own words, &quot;hyper sexual&quot; and it helped her concentrate. Also a damn good analyst, so I was like hey dude whatever you need to get those projects cranked out. She was like a machine lol.<p>All that to say...I&#x27;m going to assume they are pretty high as well :D')
