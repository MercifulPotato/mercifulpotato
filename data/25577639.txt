That&#x27;s well understood.  I&#x27;m talking strategy of who gets vaccinated, how they find out, how they get in line to receive the vaccine.  How government tracks and ensures that the population is getting to an effective level of immunity.<p>I have not seen a whiff of that information and management system being put in place.  We&#x27;re still random walking our way through this crisis.  CVS has more information on the vaccination status of people in the country than the government does, for fuck&#x27;s sake.<p>It&#x27;s almost as if we&#x27;re leaving it to everyone to figure it out themselves, or on a voluntary basis.<p>Do <i>you</i> know how you&#x27;re supposed to get the vaccine?  Has anyone contacted you or given you information?  Have you seen any information on when <i>you specifically</i> are to sign up to receive the vaccine?<p>A more contagious&#x2F;virulent variant of the virus was just detected in Colorado, today.   And we&#x27;re still letting a patchwork of counties figure it out as it comes.')
