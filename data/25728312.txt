Item(by='c_prompt', descendants=None, kids=[25728804], score=None, time=1610370142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725561, text='&gt; Listing the apps installed on my phone should give me the option to sort them by “Latest installed”. I am pretty sure that if I had had this option and I had seen a QR Code Scanner installed just a few days ago, it would have immediately grabbed my attention. As it is, the way Android lists the installed apps is pretty useless for this purpose.<p>I was able to find it pretty quickly by going to:<p>Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Usage Details &gt; Battery Usage Since Full Charge<p>This showed me the most recent app used. As I hadn&#x27;t used the QR scanner app in quite some time, it seemed a reasonable place to look first.')
