People who volunteer might be systematically biased toward&#x2F;against whatever thing you were trying to measure. Then giving half of them a placebo would not reveal the true effect.<p>Suppose there&#x27;s a hidden gene that causes people to be able to fly like superman if they&#x27;re given their mother&#x27;s poop. The gene also causes people to not volunteer in poop feeding studies, because the experimenters unfortunately placed the adverts on the ground. You find volunteers, you give half of them the poop and the other half the placebo. You find that none of them can fly, so you conclude poop doesn&#x27;t cause flight.<p>If you make this probabilistic it gets less obvious to pick apart statistically, but same problem.')
