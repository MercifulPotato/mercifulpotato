Nobody said you <i>have</i> to date fit &#x2F; thin people - just that people shouldn&#x27;t lie &#x2F; pretend about it. You have a fetish on fatties? Set the <i>weight</i> filter up high. This is clearly superior to the current model, where it&#x27;s easy for people to lie about weight&#x2F;age&#x2F;height&#x2F;income&#x2F;...<p>The <i>real</i> criticism of this model is completely different, and much deeper. People don&#x27;t actually know what they want and who would make them happy, and they often conform &#x2F; default to social conventions in their public preferences - e.g. maybe you want to filter out 10+ older men because you don&#x27;t want to go on dates with &quot;creepy&quot; dudes, or you want to filter out fat women because you don&#x27;t want your friends to judge you - even though in reality, you might actually be <i>happier</i> with those matches, or, more likely, those attributes are often orthogonal to your actual happiness.')
