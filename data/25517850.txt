You would have a separate config repo on your local machine (or other trusted place).<p>When you deploy your project, you 1) setup your host if necessary 2) install your software 3) install your config.<p>I recommend ansible for automating some of this.  Check out a tutorial for ansible for setting up mysql or something similar, and you should get the gist of it.  In this case, mysql is install from an RPM or .deb (or maybe in a docker container) rather than from a git project, but the abstraction is the same.')
