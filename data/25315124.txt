Seems to me like a lot of SF (and SF-inspired) &quot;big tech&quot; wants to be known for their &quot;wokeness&quot;[1], which leads to hires like Timnit and other &quot;politically-outspoken&quot; people, which in turn leads to situations like this, James Damore, and other individuals&#x2F;situations that amount to workplace political activism.<p>I am wholly uncomfortable with any discussion of politics in a workplace environment like a mailing list. I am more than fine with employees choosing to associate politically outside the workplace and workplace spaces, no matter how radical I find their views. This is in itself political - it supports the status quo - but anything else is inviting dissent and combativeness, and situations like these will keep happening.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve not seen the email outlining her conditions &quot;or else&quot;, but I feel I&#x27;d have very much taken the same stance as you, given the surrounding coverage of what was in that email. Ultimatums to your employer don&#x27;t often go well. And perhaps this is a good thing for her, because she may leave for a place that better suits her.<p>-<p>[1] my derisive use of this term does not stem from actual efforts at inclusiveness, those are good, but from surface-level attempts at it that end up feeling performative, at best.')
