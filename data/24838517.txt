Yeah I was asking a nonsense question, but just tongue-in-cheek trying to hint that we shouldn’t compare PBRT run times to Chris’ project to render Moana on a 2070, they’re solving different problems. Chris’ renderer is also brand new and hasn’t had a chance to evolve the way PBRT did. But all that said, it’s <i>very</i> impressive IMO to render the whole scene with (cpu)Ptex using such a small GPU without it taking far longer. I happen to know for a fact that it’s possible to render Moana much faster than cpu-pbrt if you have access to one of the 48 GB models and don’t need to use out-of-core techniques.')
