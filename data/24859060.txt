Most of the people I know who live in cities, even cities with good public transit, own cars but they mostly own cars to get out of the city on weekends and so forth. Even if it&#x27;s relatively cheap it still has many of the downsides of owning a car in a dense city but you can&#x27;t actually use it for many of the purposes you&#x27;d want a car in the first place.<p>I guess if it&#x27;s aimed at teenagers maybe? But that seems even more niche.')
