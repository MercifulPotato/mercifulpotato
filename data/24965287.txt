Of course if said application makes assumptions about what is underneath then it might face trouble if said assumptions are not met, but that is really a problem with the application (and in practice usually workaround-able).<p>I meant fragmentation of unnecessary DE&#x2F;Distro&#x27;s which keeps reinventing the wheel instead of working with another project doing the same thing but very well.<p>In the case of Trinity DE, I agree there was a need initially when the KDE moved on leaving a huge number of users dry, but this should&#x27;ve been a temporary project. Or maybe evolve like the MATE project has (which still could&#x27;ve been avoided if they collaborated with XFCE instead of creating the MATE spinoff). This doesn&#x27;t seems to be the case here. But yeah, I haven&#x27;t test driven this RC of Trinity DE yet and my last test drive or Trinity DE was an year old, maybe things are better. Still not sure if this benefits Linux as a whole but I guess that is not my call.')
