I have started to more and more think my diagosis is just a result of not being a high productive high intelligence individual.<p>I more and more realise that my brain and personality is not the kind that is made for desk work. I find it boring and difficult.<p>I have done other types of works that suits me better i beleive my life would be so much better if i just accepted that i was never to be sitting at a desk solving problems.<p>School has always been difficult for me, simply because it hard to learn the things you need to learn in shcool, for more intelligent individuals school is not the same big deal as it is for me. But thats just the way things is. The same way i was not born 2meter tall and an musculuar body.<p>I beleive that we will see more and more ADD&#x2F;ADHD diagnosies in the future, simply because automation puts more demands on the individual and the jobs will be more mentally demanding.<p>I see a future where meds like adderal will be availble in the supermarkets.<p>Instead of giving people ADD&#x2F;ADHD diagnosises we should just teach people to accept that not everyone are made for mentally demanding tasks and that not everyone goes thru school without it being a huge difficult task. Parents also needs to learn that their kids might not will be able to compete in the job markets in the future and the solution is not to medicate it away.')
