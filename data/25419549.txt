Then they don’t sell them because they know other people will want them in the future. Thus they develop a “monetary premium” from that additional demand, and become “stores of value” from the general market behavior.<p>The theory inside Bitcoin circles is that rich people have been buying up art, unproductive real estate, etc., not because they are good money but because they do not have access to good money, i.e. long-term deflationary, fungible, divisible, portable stores of value, because of our current regime of inflationary fiat money.<p>In seeking to preserve their wealth, they acquire collectibles, which then become monetary due to scarcity and expectation of future demand. It may be the very same impulse and process that led to the emergence of money in the first place, in the form of shells.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nakamotoinstitute.org&#x2F;shelling-out&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nakamotoinstitute.org&#x2F;shelling-out&#x2F;</a><p>If Bitcoin demonstrates itself to be “better money,” it should absorb some of the monetary premium of these other goods, as people will have less need to allocate their resources into paintings no one will see and houses no one will live in.')
