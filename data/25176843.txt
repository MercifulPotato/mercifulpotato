Desktop systems need only agree on connector ports, tablet design requires agreement on all dimensions of the tablet.  And nobody&#x27;s doing that in Android land.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ello.co&#x2F;dredmorbius&#x2F;post&#x2F;lqgtwy_rhsfbdh5cdxb1rq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ello.co&#x2F;dredmorbius&#x2F;post&#x2F;lqgtwy_rhsfbdh5cdxb1rq</a><p>(There are othher grievous problems with Android, I&#x27;m focusing on the physical here.)<p>Apple&#x27;s iPads, at least, offer a set of fixed sizes and are (for now) ensuring matching keyboards through third-party vendors.  Many of those keyboards are crippled for Linux use (missing critical keys, such as esc, or entire rows, as with function or numeric keys), but there are at least a few options.<p>Apple are also providing extensive onboard storage up to 1 TB or more), where Android offerings are still often only a few GB.  The latter is insufficient for my primary use:  as a portable text library.  (128 GB is about the minimum useful storage for this).  Audio, image, or video work is even more constrained.<p>The reader function is where tablets shine over laptops, at least in form.  The latter have compute power and flexibility, but displays are unsuited to reading, especially at 9:16 ratios:  too short to read portrait, too small to display 2-up readably, and incapable of rotating in most cases.  A tablet in portrait mode is a reasonably good reading device.  Except that the OS and app infrastructure are utterly unsuited.<p>This is a long-standing complaint, and I&#x27;m seeing little progress.  Google have no interest in breaking free of advertising-based captive markets, Apple ... I don&#x27;t know <i>why</i>, but are similarly brain damaged.<p>It&#x27;s the war on general-purpose computing.  From at least two fronts.')
