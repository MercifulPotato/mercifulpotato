On top of that developers were increasingly running their own containers with docker-compose to test services talking to each to each other.<p>We migrated to k8s to A) have a way to standardize how to run containerized builds and get the benefits for &quot;it works on my laptop&quot; matching how it works in production (at least functionally) and B) a common set of patterns for managing deployed software.<p>Resource scheduling only became of interest after we migrated when we realized the aggregation of our payloads allowed us to use things like spot instances without jeopardizing availability.')
