This is the paradox of tolerance. A society that will remain tolerant, needs to be intolerant of those who would take that away.<p>The law in the US for exceptions to free speech, incitement of imminent lawless action, fighting words, true threats is very narrow. In the case Gooding v. Wilson while being arrested and saying to police &quot;White son of a bitch, I&#x27;ll kill you. You son of a bitch, I&#x27;ll choke you to death...You son of a bitch, if you ever put your hands on me again, I&#x27;ll cut you all to pieces&quot; was found to be protected free speech by the supreme court, not fighting words.<p>Another example of what is legal free speech and not incitement can be found in Brandenburg v Ohio. A Ku Klux Klan (KKK) leader in rural Ohio contacted a reporter at a Cincinnati television station and invited him to cover a KKK rally. Portions of the rally were filmed, showing several men in robes and hoods, some carrying firearms, first burning a cross and then making speeches. One of the speeches made reference to the possibility of &quot;revengeance&quot; against &quot;Niggers&quot;, &quot;Jews&quot;, and those who supported them ... announced plans for a march on Washington to take place on the Fourth of July. Another speech advocated for the forced expulsion of African Americans to Africa and Jewish Americans to Israel.<p>Virginia v. Black goes into more detail on true threats, citing the relevant cases that preceded it.')
