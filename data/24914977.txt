However, it is fundamentally just another middleman, and will not stand the test of time.<p>Personally, I think Amazon&#x27;s legacy will be AWS rather than online shopping. More than anyone else they&#x27;ve turned computing power into a utility. Like electricity this has made whole new types of businesses possible.<p>Edit: Still reading the article and want to note I don&#x27;t mean this as a crticism. I&#x27;m really enjoying this story.')
