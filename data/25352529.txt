It&#x27;s relevant for your internal accounting, taxes, etc...<p>You can&#x27;t just start handing out business credit cards to everyone you send to the store, the alternative is to ask employees to pay out of pocket and pinky swear to reimburse them.<p>Then there&#x27;s the question of liability.  If your business account shipped something, any questions of liability are clear cut and easy to deal with.  If a random employee shipped something, who&#x27;s liable for any issues?<p>And how about efficiency?  Not only are you paying a reduced rate with a business account, but the provider comes and picks up your packages from you on a regular basis.  If instead of putting things in the right place and answering the door when the UPS driver comes by, now you&#x27;re paying however many employees to pick up a bunch of packages, drive over to the closest location, and wait in line.  I don&#x27;t know what the lines are like at UPS right now, but I do know that the USPS lines around me are about 45-60 minutes depending on the time of day.  Not to mention that line starts outside in the cold.<p>And that&#x27;s all assuming your employee brings 20 packages to the clerk and has no problems shipping them all in the same transaction.<p>Which means it&#x27;s possible that your employee(s) <i>didn&#x27;t do their normal job</i>, got <i>frustrated and cold</i> and <i>risked infection</i> standing in line instead, you <i>paid a premium</i> to do so, and <i>some of your packages didn&#x27;t get shipped</i> regardless.')
