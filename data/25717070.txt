The fact that you&#x27;ve accessed the service doesn&#x27;t necessarily imply you&#x27;ve accepted anything.<p>- Even if registration is ironclad, accessing the service won&#x27;t prove you agreed to any particular version of the ToS. The ever popular amend-at-will clauses never hold up in court, so you really do need to know which version was agreed to.<p>- ToS are often presented coercively. Maybe you&#x27;ve already signed a lease and moved in, but to actually pay your rent you need to accept an additional one or more third-party ToS because the landlord doesn&#x27;t accept cash or checks. Maybe you&#x27;ve already paid for your vehicle registration, and after the cash is removed from your account you&#x27;re presented with additional terms that need to be agreed to in order to receive your tags. Even if you&#x27;ve agreed to some specific contract, that kind of coercion can invalidate the additional terms, even though the party whose ToS you agreed to might not have known about the coercion.')
