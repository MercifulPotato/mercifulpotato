If there is not enough workers, they&#x27;ll have to raise wages. What&#x27;s wrong with healthcare workers getting 80k? (in reality, they&#x27;d poach someone elses workers, they&#x27;d have to raise their wages, and so on, then slowly there would be more workers due to more people going into field due to high wages, and if not, then get a H1B worker for 80k+).')
