I became much more focused on web development, but SEO experience has been helpful in a number of ways since.<p>The biggest case I can remember is a former employer who ran a niche search engine. They were trying to get ranked anywhere, but almost never showed up in any results. It didn&#x27;t take too long to see what was going on. It turns out that a developer had plugged in a regular expression to generate a canonical link on any given page. However, this regex was case-sensitive and was only whitelisting lowercased letters. So when you would go to the page &quot;&#x2F;job&#x2F;12345&#x2F;Data-Engineer&quot;, it would tell search engines to go to &quot;&#x2F;job&#x2F;12345&#x2F;ata-ngineer&quot; instead. The link would still work since the site would use the &quot;12345&quot; portion as the page&#x27;s ID, but nobody was searching for &quot;ata ngineer&quot;. Literally just putting the letter &quot;i&quot; in the regex&#x27;s flags was enough to start ranking on the first page for a large number of the company&#x27;s listings (though reindexing took several weeks since the problem was large and existed for well over a year at that point).')
