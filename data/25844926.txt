But you can&#x27;t rule out the possibility that a few people, who happen to be positioned exactly right at a particular point in time, correctly assess the risk of a certain bet as being much lower than the rest of the market thinks.<p>Gamestop is a good example of this, as was Tesla at multiple points in its history. As was put options on major stock indexes in early February of 2020. And so on.<p>It&#x27;s very comforting to assess market events as truly random and any success as luck. It&#x27;s possible to come up with definitions that lead to this conclusion. Personally, I&#x27;m fairly certain that this is wrong. But the distinctions are practically by definition so subtle that they seem random to anything but detailed, correctly-informed scrutiny.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that you could build a long-term successful <i>career</i> out of this, where you make likely-successful trades every day. But I do claim that you could fruitfully dedicate part of a long-term portfolio -- say 10% -- to make speculative bets on the very occasional situations where <i>you</i> happen to be positioned to see something that isn&#x27;t yet obvious to others.')
