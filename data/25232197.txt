Item(by='quantumwannabe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606507998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25230843, text='HN is worse than other sites because if a comment is downvoted early on by a handful of users, the upvote button disappears and it can’t be upvoted later by others who agree with it. So there is no way of knowing the true score of a comment if the people who dislike it found it first.<p>HN also literally disappears downvoted comments by making them unreadably light colored and eventually hiding them to all users who haven’t enabled the “Show Dead” setting.')
