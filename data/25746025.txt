Which is some thin PR language on top of the truth: Facebook develops their apps to maximize user addiction and subsequently enact a lot of de-facto peer pressure to constantly expand their install base without them even having to try. Built-in word of mouth plus peer-pressure.<p>Facebook conditions their userbase to need the app in their life, whether because your pictures are all there or because your family is on it, and beyond that it doesn&#x27;t really matter if they listen to their base. They&#x27;ve got them already.<p>Maybe the userbase <i>thinks</i> facebook addresses their users&#x27; &quot;needs&quot; (strong word for it), but that&#x27;s more of a commentary on FB&#x27;s propaganda team and black-hat UX than anything else.')
