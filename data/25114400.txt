What I care about:<p>- Open Now (Optional)<p>- Sort by Rating<p>- Search by food category, not name of restaurant.<p>Part of the problem is I have a food allergy.  I&#x27;m highly allergic to soy, so I can&#x27;t eat all dishes at most restaurants except their drinks.  The few I can eat at tend to be very high end or very highly rated, because the alternative to ingredients that use soy is almost always better tasting (eg, they make their own bread from scratch at a sandwich shop), so if I sort by rating I can find restaurants I&#x27;m not allergic to.  I still have to ask 20 questions when I call in.  Flavor is not enough alone, but it&#x27;s a surprisingly accurate indicator.  I use Yelp for this reason and feel disgusted when doing so.')
