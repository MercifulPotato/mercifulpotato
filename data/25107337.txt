That&#x27;s absurd, since even on a good day China is major food importer - you don&#x27;t disincentivize your own farmers from growing in a situation like that.<p>The statistic you&#x27;re talking about is a top-down demand by the CCP that local officials claim a per capita income is met to get their own bonuses. Guess what - the officials all say they&#x27;re 100% in compliance, as always.')
