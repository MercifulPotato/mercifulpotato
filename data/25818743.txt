An org comes in promises to keep things confidential. Objectively assesses the situation, inquires for more info (emails, convos etc) and determines the outcome. If someone needs to be fired and it&#x27;s a male superior, then so be it.<p>HR is never going to tell their boss that they should be fired for mistreating another employee for example, if they do not also want to lose their jobs.<p>In reality it makes sense to have an internal HR for all things like hiring recruiting etc etc etc but when it comes to managing deteriorated relationships between employees it will never be done right unless an independent third party comes into asses.')
