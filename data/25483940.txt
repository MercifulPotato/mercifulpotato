I can&#x27;t safely and easily electro shock myself at home. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m curious about and would try. You&#x27;d need to have me come back a few times and see what I pick when the electroshock option is no longer a novelty. Even then, you&#x27;re going to have to be careful that there&#x27;s no way this could turn in to a competition of sorts where I get the idea to try to outlast the other participants or even just myself seeing how much I can take.<p>This would be like determining that I prefer my burgers to have weird chutneys and exotic ingredients on them because that&#x27;s what I order at restaurants given the option. No, plain cheeseburger with maybe some tomato or pickles is way better. But I can and do make that myself, often, and imo better than must restaurants do. I&#x27;m ordering something different that I don&#x27;t do at home, not picking my favourite choice.<p>Or &quot;here&#x27;s your favourite movie you&#x27;ve seen a ton of times and have on your hard drive. Here&#x27;s another one you&#x27;ve thought about watching, haven&#x27;t bothered to, but if you don&#x27;t watch it now you&#x27;ll probably never have another chance; which one do you want to watch?&quot; Pick the latter and they clap themselves on the back for their miraculous favourite movie changing ability.')
