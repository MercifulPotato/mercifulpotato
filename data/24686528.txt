It&#x27;s not quite access - it doesn&#x27;t actually persist&#x2F;store the data, just aggregates it from other sources which is probably what is required here.<p>Access is a little legacy and would have it&#x27;s own issues. I think in reality it depends on how you are ingesting data (which is probably hospitals submitting excel templates or similar?). Maybe these could be automatically aggregated and put onto an analytics platform? (e.g. PowerBi). Hospitals could maybe report it on a portal, but I&#x27;m not convinced that the leadership would have wanted to change the established process (because of operational focus, change reduction &amp; risk).')
