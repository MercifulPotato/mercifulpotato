It&#x27;s about research in neurodegenerative diseases, specially ALS (Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease). It is my way to raise awareness about these diseases.<p>My two attempts at monetizing have failed. I got zero revenues either from ads or from a &quot;Donate&quot; link.<p>* At least I would like to gain enough to pay the server fee and a new computer every few years.<p>* Ideally I would like to earn enough to enable me to attend a few conferences each year.<p>* In a dream world I would make experiences on TDP-43 aggregates on Ciona intestinalis [1], an aquarium  invertebrate chordate which has motor neurons and which can even regenerate its whole nervous system in one month!<p>If I don&#x27;t boost artificially the audience by submitting links to HN, I have roughly 5000 visitors per month. Nobody ever tried to contact me. Indeed I do not want to change the goal of this blog.<p>Please do you have any suggestions?<p>Thanks and regards from France,<p>Jean-Pierre<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;padiracinnovation.org&#x2F;News&#x2F;<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ciona_intestinalis')
