If you can build renewable power at a fraction of the price, why go nuclear? We can keep gas as backup until storage solutions are better developed.<p>If money was no issue you could just build a ton of pumped hydro in Scotland and or batter storage.<p>And if you absolutely want to spend on nuclear power, spend it in SMRs and molten salt reactors. ThorCon is probably not that far from a working solution if given enough funding.')
