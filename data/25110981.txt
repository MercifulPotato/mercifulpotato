It&#x27;s waiting to use that moment when you switch on the JavaScript for some other tab forgetting about this one, to do some nasty stuff probably. Cloudflare is doing it same way (waits for your mistake, refreshing in the background till JS will be on), but more stealthy - with longer time of refresh. They steal the bandwidth too - and Google was sued recently for eating mobile data.<p>(JavaScript in my browser is not granted for whatever purpose I didn&#x27;t needed, it&#x27;s a privilege which only few sites deserve.
