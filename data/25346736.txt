No one truly want to maintain a RedHat clone for little to no pay, while at the same time dealing request and complaints from companies who wants the benefits of RHEL, but no pay for the development and maintenance works done by RedHat.<p>Realistically it&#x27;s some bean counter at IBM who asked why RedHat is giving away the very same thing they&#x27;re trying to sell. Said bean counter do have a point in my opinion.')
