For example, a company like Finless Foods (which I&#x27;m decently familiar with) isn&#x27;t selling meat to customers yet. For this reason it is unsurprising that the general public doesn&#x27;t know about them, let alone to the same degree that they do for Facebook (billions of users) and Tesla (~1 million vehicles sold). I&#x27;m saying these are unfair comparisons (that&#x27;s at least 6 orders of magnitude difference in users!). If people could get FF in their local supermarket I&#x27;d understand your point, but they&#x27;re (like every other cell-cultured meat company) producing small quantities, learning how to refine the product, and how to scale. It is wildly misleading to say that FF or MM should have the same recognition as Facebook or Tesla. I was asking if there are companies <i></i><i>NOT in the research phase</i><i></i> and are producing products that I or someone I know would be using. Such a biotech company <i></i><i>would</i><i></i> be a fair comparison to FB or Tesla and I&#x27;d understand the criticism of the lack of fame to them. But you cannot compare companies with 0 users (or 0 <i>planned</i> users for at least a year) to companies with millions or billions of users. That&#x27;s an insane comparison, regardless of how groundbreaking these technologies <i>could</i> be. Yes, lots of potential, but they aren&#x27;t there yet. It is <i>potential</i>.')
