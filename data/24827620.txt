A younger athlete, before getting into high-level competition, or during the offseason, does a &quot;cycle&quot; or two of steroids. The effect is to build more strength or size. When the athlete ends the steroid cycle some, <i>but not all</i> of the strength or size is lost, assuming they continue training.<p>What this means is that they have a foundation to build on that&#x27;s already above what the athlete who doesn&#x27;t use steroids has.  A year or two down the road, there&#x27;s absolutely no trace of steroids in the athlete&#x27;s system, so they easily pass drug tests. However, the benefit was already gained.<p>So for athletes the limits are time-bounded, not dose-bounded.')
