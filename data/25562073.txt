I suspect it would be hard to detect, other than in combination with a catch-all domain.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing the catch-all for almost 20 years now. My suggestion if you go this path: use a subdomain.<p>At least when I first enabled it, catch-all on a top-level domain gets a massive amount of dictionary-style spam with common names (admin@ john@ jane@ postmaster@ etc), and that was with a fresh domain where I was the first registrant ever. This doesn&#x27;t happen with a subdomain.')
