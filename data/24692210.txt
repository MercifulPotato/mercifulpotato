They have higher dynamic range than the human eye and they&#x27;re very sensitive. They can see stars.<p>The LCD changes its brightness automatically. It also changes from light to dark mode (inverted UI colors) based on the time of day. Still an LCD showing black will leak some light, and as I said those cameras are pretty damn sensitive.')
