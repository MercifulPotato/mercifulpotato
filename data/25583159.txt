As a white male I have always been in the minority in every software job I have ever worked. It has always been majority Indian with number 2 being white or Chinese depending on the company. But regardless even if it were true why does that even matter? We are on a forum of people that are mostly in a white collar industry where this does apply. Does this not apply to my Indian coworkers, my Asian coworkers, my black coworkers, my hispanic coworkers, my black and hispanic coworker, my black spouse? Are they too stupid to be able to follow follow FI&#x2F;RE? I doubt it because they are all smarter than me. Apologies for my angry tone but I just hate this needlessly divisive talk.')
