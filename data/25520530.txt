We now know where that party was headed and how it ended, and it almost ended society!<p>At this point any improvements I feel should be focused on minimizing damage and maximizing the public good.<p>This is the antithesis of anticipating interests as that approach has failed to deliver and even worse has only served to exacerbate echo chambers and divide populations.<p>Better to gauge interests and make suggestions from a large and vetted list of diverse sources as a primary ingredient of a larger cake of suggestions with actual user defined interest suggestions being the subtle and minimal spice.')
