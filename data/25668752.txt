Modern JVM has many options to sandbox a running app.<p>But it seems that WASM tries to be a mininal CPU target instead, which is questionable - I canâ€™t wait seeing memory errors (even if only inside a single webpage) on the web. With the good quality GCs available with JS, but even more so on JVM, I would say that running system languages should not be the point.')
