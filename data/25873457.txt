Thatâ€™s it.<p>That&#x27;s not a value proposition that is beyond the realms of possibility for other companies to develop. So why does Palantir appear to engage with more unethical projects that other companies if it&#x27;s not by having a low ethical standard? (Obviously I can only comment on what is public knowledge.)')
