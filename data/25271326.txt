You value well-tested code, best practices, and automating everything. You know how to create solid and maintainable technical solutions from scratch, making smart trade-offs given business priorities. You know few greater joys in life than merging PRs that rip out thousands of lines of tech debt while having the support and license to do so.<p>Us: We&#x27;re a small, tight-knit, and fun team mostly based out of Nashville, TN (Music City USA, baby). Post-COVID, we&#x27;re looking forward to our next absolutely hog-wild team off-site. Flexible hours, super friendly people, and all the runway in the world for growth.<p>Stack: PHP (Symfony), Ember, AWS, CDK, Docker<p>Reach out to chat: rtuck [at] songspace [dot] com')
