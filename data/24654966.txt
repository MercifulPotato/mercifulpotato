Nobody other than Calvin is misled into thinking that those records are faithful recreations of color and sound. But without those obvious markers, people lose their incredulity. What you&#x27;re seeing in these modified records <i>pretends</i> to be real in a way that the originals do not.<p>I would expect tech people to understand the risks here by comparison to using AI to perform image upscaling: you are <i>inventing</i> detail based on what the AI <i>expects</i> to see. For artificial works, this is often great. For, say, a police department trying to upscale grainy CCTV footage, it produces a work of fiction that has the potential to become outright dangerous.<p>It&#x27;s fine to present these as works of art, and with the proper context, even as records of history. But pop culture rapidly divorces the art from the context, and I would expect any responsible historian to be extremely clear about the processes use here, even to the point of protest (it is analogous to how astronomers have a hard time expressing to people that false-color photography and artistic illustrations of far-off bodies do not represent reality).')
