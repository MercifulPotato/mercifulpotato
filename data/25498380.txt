I can explain all of the motions of all of the celestial bodies (better even than newton-einstein gravity can!) using epicycles, but that&#x27;s trivial because really epicycles are just fourier transforms under another name and all continuous-valued functions have well-defined fourier transforms.<p>1 - give me a prediction, not just an explanation.  Can you take epicycles and project the motions of any given body better than newton?  No.<p>2 - Give me a multimodal observation.  Imagine the world before we unified terrestrial gravity with heavenly motion - these were two separate phenomena.  Could epicycles explain things outside of the category which it is designed to explain (heavenly motion)?  No.  Newton&#x27;s theory <i>also</i> explains why if you throw a book across the room it will fall to earth, which epicycles do not.')
