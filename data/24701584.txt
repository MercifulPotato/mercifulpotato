That&#x27;s actually one reason the site guidelines say &quot;<i>Please don&#x27;t sneer, including at the rest of the community.</i>&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>After pondering it for years, I believe there are deep reasons why people arrive at anthropomorphized images of the community like this. We generalize based on what makes the strongest impression on us, and unfortunately what we dislike tends to make stronger impressions than what we feel good or neutral about: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dat...</a><p>The community that you think you&#x27;re encountering is thus an afterimage of things you noticed and disliked because those burn more into the retina. (I don&#x27;t mean &#x27;you&#x27; personally; this is common.) It&#x27;s your own creation, in the sense that the selection of inputs is determined by your own pre-existing opinions and feelings. This is how we end up feeling surrounded by demons in a place like this, when in reality it is just a large and diffuse population sample: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=demons%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=demons%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all...</a>. People with different (let&#x27;s call it) pre-existing conditions notice different things, make different generalizations, and construct different images.<p>The reason it gets so emotional is that our relationships with other people are the most intensely emotional part of our lives, and a large and diffuse set of social inputs provides all the data points one could possibly need to select from.<p>A lot of people experience HN painfully in this way. That&#x27;s a pity, and I feel bad about it; I think the solution is for the community to get more accurate reflection about the dynamics that lead to these impressions. If enough people become aware of them, maybe the needle will shift some. I wrote about this at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23308098" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23308098</a>. In that case the context was about people feeling surrounded by social&#x2F;political enemies rather than by unpleasant&#x2F;stuck-up people, but the underlying dynamic seems the same.')
