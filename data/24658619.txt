We are hiring a staff engineer for our Merch Science team. This team is a nexus within the company, working to balance our two-sided marketplace. I&#x27;m really excited about the next few quarters - we are building systems and running tests to better understand the right rate of listings and mix of inventory for our customers, a huger lever for us.
