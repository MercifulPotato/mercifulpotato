Think of libel: very hard to prove because it requires clear falsehoods, intent, and expression.  So plenty of people, especially politicians, have learned to walk the line.  They can legally convince people that their opponents are space aliens who stomp on apple pies and interrupt baseball games.<p>A better example for this &quot;adaptive&quot; kind of law is online gaming.  If a player uses an exploit to gain an advantage, the developer will often correct that exploit.  When developers stop pushing bugfixes, the game often ends up being dominated by whatever exploits were left.  For law, legal precedent is like a bugfix.')
