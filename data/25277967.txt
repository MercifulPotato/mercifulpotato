It remains to be seen whether lab-grown meat will be equally nutritious.<p>Don&#x27;t most of these kinds of things wind up being marketing jargon which later gets largely debunked? Taking antioxidants as an example, we manufacture most of what we need already, you only need trace amounts of nutrients like vitamin C to satisfy the rest of your needs. Attempts to supplement those sources further with &quot;superfoods,&quot; pills, etc have approximately zero affect on any metric of interest.')
