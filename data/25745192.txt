They&#x27;ve already put $400k into their business incubator, but it hasn&#x27;t opened yet.<p>Their science museum kinda sucks, and their &quot;maker space&quot; is a laser cutter tacked onto the incubator as an afterthought.<p>The building I bought is 220,000 sqft and I&#x27;m passionate about doing all the things that tax is supposed to pay for, but I didn&#x27;t know this at the time.<p>If I fail and nobody notices then everything is fine for them. But if I succeed, people might wonder what the tax went to if I don&#x27;t get some of it, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s all already spoken for.<p>The thing is, I don&#x27;t even care about that money. I just want to do my own thing without interference.')
