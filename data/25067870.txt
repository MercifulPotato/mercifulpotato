In some cases this means ensuring equity of treatment.<p>Similar cases have shown up with COVID. Every couple of months this year I&#x27;ve listened to news stories about couples dealing with cross border restrictions on being able to see each other. The last one included a couple who had been together for years and were despairing about the fact that protections of border crossing only extended to married couples. I&#x27;m not suggesting judgement should be cast on them for not being married, as that&#x27;s between them, but it&#x27;s another example of how representing the significance of the relationship to the state can have consequences.')
