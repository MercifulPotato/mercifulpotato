But Spotify does make it convenient to have a portable library that doesn&#x27;t need backing up. I hate the lock in (unable to export playlists), I hate the inflexibility of their apps, and I hate that they can exercise both financial and editorial control over music and podcasts. Things are going in a direction where I&#x27;ll ultimately miss Winamp and the &#x27;old days of Internet freedom&#x27;. But the problem is that right now, Spotify is convenient-enough that we will continue the march away from the free Internet. We will keep marching until we hate Spotify, but there&#x27;s little to stop us along the way until it is too late.')
