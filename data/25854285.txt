The M1 is just a scaled-up version of the iDevice SoCs. From the reverse engineering we&#x27;ve seen so far, it is extremely clear that not even a single step towards any standardization was taken. It&#x27;s very much the ad-hoc hodgepodge of embedded crap companies build when they <i>only</i> care about their own complete product and don&#x27;t allocate any budget towards any &quot;refactoring&quot; that doesn&#x27;t directly benefit the end product.<p>They use some ancient Samsung UART for debug (because the first iPhones used a Samsung SoC?), old P.A. Semi I2C controller, the Synopsys DesignWare USB 3 controller (just like some random cheap Allwinner&#x2F;Rockchip&#x2F;etc), and here&#x27;s the fucking kicker, a custom Apple interrupt controller and a custom IOMMU too. These probably predate GICv2&#x2F;3 at least. But there was no reason for them to switch to the standard Arm GIC and SMMU so they didn&#x27;t &gt;_&lt;')
