Item(by='seibelj', descendants=None, kids=[24676575, 24676570], score=None, time=1601785911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24676224, text='There will always be offshore entities with strong rule of law (Cayman) because multinational companies need a neutral ground to settle disputes with competent judges without the whims of each company’s home base screwing it up.<p>That’s the most generous and ethical explanation for the continued support and existence of offshore judication. The unpopular reason is that offshore countries offer lower taxes and favorable regulation. As someone who believes in the smallest possible state and enjoys the benefits of offshore countries (as do Facebook, Google, and Apple which use a combination of the Netherlands, Ireland, Bermuda, and Cayman in complex corporate structures) I am sympathetic to this argument. Although my friends say I am a corporate stooge!')
