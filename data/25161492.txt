The approach of generating a configuration using a &quot;real&quot; programming language is superior (and nothing new).<p>&gt;But, I think people will try to push this further and integrate the infrastructure code inside the actual app. All of it will be managed, by the application itself, at runtime.<p>I would only adopt this approach if there is an abstraction layer in between, like k8s, or if it would be easy to create an equivalent implementation for a different cloud provider. Being locked into dependence on AWS isn&#x27;t the worst thing, but I would like to keep my application independent of a proprietary environment.')
