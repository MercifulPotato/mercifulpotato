They have no interest in being long or short. They&#x27;re like a furniture or electronics store. They match buyers and sellers, and for this, they make a slim profit margin. This profit margin is known as the spread. The reason they make a profit is because risk is involved. If they sell stock to you, but the price is so volatile that it moves up and up before they can find a buyer and equal out their book, they can lose a lot of money, and they can lose it fast.<p>&gt; This is why discount brokers (Robinhood, Cashapp, Webull, etc...) have stopped allowing people to buy GME, and AMC, among others. They can&#x27;t find a market maker to take your order. It sucks because retail made a lot of dumb moves, and bought a lot of shares they shouldn&#x27;t have bought, and they&#x27;re going to lose a ton of money, but it&#x27;s not a conspiracy.
