I don&#x27;t think you can expect to push everything out to the edges, for example partiality. I take your point that a lot of imperative programming is done in Haskell (e.g. State monads). However, I think what most Haskellers mean when they talk about pushing effects to the edge, is pushing IO and other less benign effects.')
