Google tracked Spiers down and fired her for it, 100% justified. Separately, Google&#x27;s hiring of a union-busting firm is fair game for disagreement, absolutely.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t consider an employer having total visibility into its devices to be a power-trip. The onus is on the employee to keep their personal stuff out if they don&#x27;t want it getting swept up. Of all companies, even Google couldn&#x27;t design machine learning or quarantining sufficient to wall off personal data from company data inside someone&#x27;s phone during their forensic prevention and investigation. So the legal department sure isn&#x27;t going to promise they can unbake the cake that is your voluntarily mixed-use device.')
