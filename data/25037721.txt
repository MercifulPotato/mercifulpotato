I can walk out to my deck, eat some food and read the book on my deck&#x27;s table.<p>In contrast: I don&#x27;t know of any laptop screen that has a decent amount of visibility in the open sun.

(Its getting close, oh so very close... but not quite good enough to replicate paper yet).<p>How are you reading your documents book in the park? Or on your deck? Or in your lawn?<p>&gt; harder to search<p>Search on your computer. Then open up to the page in your book. Page numbers exist for a reason.
