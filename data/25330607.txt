Item(by='KaiserPro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607333239, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326316, text='&gt; The residents were complaining not about the same kind of abstract risk that we deal with in IT,<p>No, I agree. I should have been more nuanced in my point. during renovations the sheer number of complaints are enormous.<p>They range from (and this is based on personal history):<p>o We don&#x27;t want a flat roof, they leak<p>o the scaffolding is allowing people to climb into my bedroom<p>o the builders are swearing<p>o the builders are dropping rubble on the walk way<p>o we are being charged to much for item x, look here&#x27;s a quote from supplier z<p>o I don&#x27;t like that the builders are speaking language y<p>o they are using flammable hole filler<p>I was lucky that on my estate we had a number of people who both had the ability to get the council to do things, and run multi-million pound public procurement contracts. we had the expertise to tackle both the council , the Quantity surveyor, the main contractor, the sub contractors and the site team.<p>our estate was just under a thousand homes. Grenfell was &lt; 200. Whats more there were less people in grenfell that had grown up with the council house system. We were lucky that we had a number of residents that moved into the place originally, so knew all the tricks.<p>Again, I&#x27;m trying to get across that its not as clear cut in hindsight.(apart from the corruption, that is clear cut.) The residents would be complaining about safety because thats often the _only_ way to get people to listen.<p>This should not however lessen the tragedy, and more importantly the motive to change. None of this is acceptable. Residents should be listened to. Standards should never be corrupted.')
