But the fact of the matter is, the clientele for this particular product is _hardware engineers_, and hardware engineers seem to take a stronger view than most, that if they bought it, they own it, they&#x27;re going to use it.<p>Particularly in the case of this old Tek that hasn&#x27;t been sold in decades, I think anything that keeps it out of the solid waste stream is great.')
