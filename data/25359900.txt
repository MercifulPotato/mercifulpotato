(Debian, not Ubuntu). Especially because of its release cycle and no-nonsense vision. I&#x27;m not sure which Debian release you&#x27;ve had experience with, but ever since Debian Stretch it&#x27;s been very solid.<p>Another system (altogether different since it&#x27;s not Linux) that comes close to Debian in terms of solidness is FreeBSD. However, the experience of doing `dist-upgrade` for Debian from a release to another is miles better than `freebsd-upgrade` and the shenanigans of upgrading all your ports tree. I have to do that once every 2-3 years, and it takes an hour for Debian, whereas it takes half a day for FreeBSD (for example I just had to do that recently for a 10.x to 12.2 database running on FreeBSD system)<p>I would definitely NOT recommend Ubuntu. If one looks at Ubuntu and think it&#x27;s like Debian - it&#x27;s not. It doesn&#x27;t come close at all in terms of robustness. An unrelated example: once you have Ubuntu up, there&#x27;s tons of service that I don&#x27;t know serves what purpose that&#x27;s already running. For Debian, that does not happen, you have a minimal set running.<p>Also, you can keep running Debian for years before having to touch anything. This is one of the behaviour I&#x27;m looking for when I consider systems for work (what I mean by &quot;solid&quot;&#x2F;&quot;robust&quot;).<p>So rolling release systems like Arch serves a totally different purpose.')
