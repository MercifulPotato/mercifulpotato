Many times, folks are creating drafts in Google Docs first and then copying it over. We figured, why not cut out the subpar text editors and just publish to a wiki straight from Docs?<p>It&#x27;s definitely not ready for prime-time but we&#x27;re at a point where we&#x27;re actively looking for feedback!')
