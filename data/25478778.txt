You don&#x27;t think Medicare refuses to cover certain things? They have to, because you can&#x27;t spend a trillion dollars to save one life.<p>And for that single payer is even worse, because whenever they refuse to cover something, the provider goes out of business because the refusal applies to 100% of their customer base. Then what happens when something isn&#x27;t covered isn&#x27;t that you get a bill for $50,000 and file bankruptcy, it&#x27;s that the provider who could have saved your life is out of business and you die.')
