Sorry to hear it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant one.  There is no overall authority in the Haskell world so I&#x27;m taking it upon myself to improve the experience of Haskell developers where I can[1].  If you would be happy to expand about the things you struggled with I would be very interested to hear concrete details, either here or on my issue tracker[2].  The things I am curious about are:<p>&gt; The documentation and tutorials for various libraries is often incomplete, outdated and written in a hard to grok plain text document<p>I am keen to make an effort to remove outdated documentation and to complete incomplete documentation.  If you give specific examples I shall try to do so.<p>&gt; Asking questions can also be painful as there’s definitely a tinge of elitism to some of the power members.<p>Could you say which forums you discovered &quot;elite power members&quot;?  For example, was it Reddit, Haskell-Cafe mailing list, #haskell IRC channel, Discord server?<p>&gt; Secondly, the conventions that are often encouraged go against writing clear and understandable code. Function names are small. You have interface functions (doThis) that exist just to call private functions (doThis’).<p>For better or worse, that&#x27;s the way the community likes to program. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s much I can do about that unless you have specific examples of code that could be rewritten to be clearer.<p>&gt; These odd conventions get compounded by a lot of warts on the language itself.<p>Did you have any specific warts in mind?<p>&gt; For feature flags there’s a standard set of 20 that every experienced Haskeller turns on but good luck finding that out as a beginner, and good luck finding out that’s why the example isn’t working for you.<p>Were there specific &quot;feature flags&quot; (called &quot;extensions&quot; in GHC) that you needed to turn on but that the compiler didn&#x27;t tell you that you needed to turn on?  That&#x27;s uncommon (though it is possible, OverloadedStrings is one such example).<p>Which examples did you try that didn&#x27;t work because they didn&#x27;t mention which extensions needed to be enabled? If you report them to me I will try to get them fixed upstream.<p>&gt; The repl often breaks<p>Could you say more about in which way the repl (&quot;GHCi&quot;) often breaks?<p>&gt; And you sometimes run into hidden libraries that are in your project but arent accessable until you import them.<p>Could you say more? That sounds like something that could well be true but I can&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s a problem.  You have to import libraries in many languages (Julia, Python, ...).  What went wrong here?<p>Thanks for any light you may be able to shed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tomjaguarpaw&#x2F;tilapia&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tomjaguarpaw&#x2F;tilapia&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tomjaguarpaw&#x2F;tilapia&#x2F;issues&#x2F;new" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tomjaguarpaw&#x2F;tilapia&#x2F;issues&#x2F;new</a>')
