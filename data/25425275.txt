From bot nets to hidden folders full of pirated files (or worse...), and an overall general expectation that all banking credentials ever entered on that machine are compromised.<p>When I go to my relatives for which i have installed a version of Linux, even though they don&#x27;t update it very often it is never infected with anything. No malware, no virus, nothing. Always working exactly as I left it. That&#x27;s one less headache when I deal with family members.')
