At 3 weeks my body finally transitioned to polyphasic sleeping (similar time as to the transition to dvorak typing) and I was finally functioning through all the sleep deprivation. Concentration was similar to monophasic sleeping.<p>I could take care of the baby while my girlfriend was sleeping at night and I could go out or work on my hobbies all night (with 27m naps) without any problem. It was like I was a liberating experience, I watched the whole of society shutdown at night, but I was awake every day all by myself, it was very odd. I also realized I didn&#x27;t really need a house if I could sleep anywhere, except in winter - but I started thinking I could just sleep 30m here and there (in trains, at work, in the park on a bench) perhaps with electric blankets. A real nomad lifestyle.\nI also noticed that I had to force myself being productive at night as my executive function wasn&#x27;t quite there - it was like my mind was used to doing nothing consciously at night, an unconscious part didn&#x27;t really see a point in being awake and doing things at night - so I mostly just was sitting there, contemplating or meditating. When I made a todo list it was better.<p>As I also had to organize naps outside and at friends and family places it caused some tension and conflicts (I can tell some really wild stories) - and eventually, also because I didn&#x27;t want to risk potential long term issues I went to 2 naps and eventually 1 nap each day.<p>Regarding 35 minutes, you risk entering deep sleep with 35m, at least I did when I went over 30m a nap. Or did you mean 25 minutes?')
