The live vaccine has significant practical benefits, which should not be overlooked as has happened here.<p>Yes it&#x27;s cheaper, which is often the thing highlighted in text written by industrialised countries where the price for the killed vaccine is not an obstacle to using it. It&#x27;s cheaper to make and it&#x27;s cheaper to deploy in the field.<p>But it&#x27;s also actually more effective at inducing immunity. There are at least two reasons for that, let&#x27;s start with the most obvious - this is literally the virus (albeit attenuated) so it&#x27;s the best possible template for what your immune system needs to fight. It&#x27;s not just fragments, or a similar shape mimicked by something else. Next, it&#x27;s ingested, your immune system will first run into it in your gut, which is exactly where a &quot;real&quot; viral exposure would begin - whereas the killed vaccine has to be injected into a muscle.<p>Having an oral vaccine also avoids objections to needles and similar interventions which may be a problem in some cultures - everybody eats and drinks.<p>2. This is currently considered important news in the industrialised north only because of coronavirus vaccine development, normally approximately nobody cares about polio cases in Sudan. But today I see several articles purporting that this is somehow relevant or has important lessons for us preparing for distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine.<p>But that&#x27;s nonsense, Oral Polio Vaccine is a live vaccine, it always did this, it&#x27;s been known it does this and that you need to figure out a plan for how to get from &quot;No wild virus&quot; to &quot;No polio&quot; possibly via internationally subsidised deployment of the killed vaccine for many decades.<p>In contrast there are <i>no</i> existing or planned COVID-19 live vaccines. This isn&#x27;t a zombie movie, fragments of non-working coronavirus can&#x27;t magically re-assemble into a working transmissible virus and infect people. A protein designed to be like the &quot;spike&quot; used by a coronavirus is not a whole working virus, any more than pebble shaped like a shark tooth is a whole working shark.')
