I was talking about the current situation where you cannot run your own server or even choose amongst servers.<p>It is pointless if you can view the source-code of that server, but have no way to check if the one server that you can ever use, runs that code at all.<p>It makes sense in a federated or decentralised setup, where you can run your own servers, choose instances, or even build your own version of the client with other backend-urls baked in. For Telegram all it offers is validation that the code is good, or not good. Without any power to do anything about that.')
