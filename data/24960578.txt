Or vice versa. Anybody who downloads both of them can xor them together and get the copyrighted work, but only one of them was actually derived from the copyrighted work, and you don&#x27;t know which one.<p>There are only three things that can happen next, right? Either you punish both Alice and Bob even though one of them is innocent, or you let them both go even though one of them is guilty, or you punish only one of them arbitrarily and thereby, because they&#x27;re indistinguishable, have a 50% chance of punishing the innocent person while the guilty one goes free.<p>Which one of those would you propose the legal system <i>should</i> do in that case, and why?')
