(It&#x27;s the one case where iron works as a catalyst but so poorly that they wish they could use Platinum instead.)<p>Desperate people such as Nazis and South Africans found that&#x27;s not worth doing even if you have cheap coal.  Now people want to capture CO2 from the air to do it.  Yeah right.')
