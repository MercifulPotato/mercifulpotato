Item(by='camgunz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606509600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227991, text='I&#x27;ve been using sc-im for a few months, and I like it a lot. It crashes here and there (not wonderful) so I wish it were a little more robust, but it doesn&#x27;t corrupt your files when it does so it&#x27;s just some work lost (save early, save often). But otherwise, it&#x27;s powerful and ergonomic for Vim users, so checks all my boxes haha.')
