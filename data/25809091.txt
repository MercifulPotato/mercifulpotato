For example, mypy has `Literal[&quot;foo&quot;]`, but typescript has the ability to template literals like `&quot;foo-${bar}&quot;` etc, and actually understand the results statically.<p>That&#x27;s not to say mypy isn&#x27;t great, it has some really good stuff, but I mostly think you&#x27;re underselling Typescript here.')
