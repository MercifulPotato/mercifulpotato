It has become indispensable, as the drone camera gimbal is slaved to my head. Much easier to inspect hard to reach stuff in (or on) the manufacturing facility I work at this way.<p>I&#x27;m always sort of impressed that I am able to have this functionality using (literally) the trash of others.<p>Once the resolution gets high enough that I can read small text comfortably, I plan on removing monitors from my office all together and migrating to some sort of AR terminal multiplexer. The general idea being that I can throw the headset on and wrap myself in some sort of window manager. I use a whole pile of monitors during daily work and despite needing them all during certain development projects, 50% of the time, I&#x27;ve got 2-3 displays sitting idle which is annoying. Having a 3 dimensional bubble of <i>monitor space</i> would fix this nicely for me.<p>I know this is what work spaces are for, but I&#x27;ve never been very proficient switching between them. I prefer to have all my current projects visible if I look around me.')
