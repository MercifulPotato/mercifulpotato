It will technically get you banned from Twitter, which is ridiculous.<p>Side Note: the oddest thing about the people who want to suppress speech, is that I find they tend not to be &#x27;overt, assertive people&#x27;. This is not the alpha-style nationalist authoritarianism of the gilded class, oddly, it&#x27;s the opposite - it&#x27;s the authoritarianism of the ostensibly vengeful transgressed and hyper-sensitive. It has Jacobin kind of element to it: populism of a kind of underclass, with shades of angry revenge.')
