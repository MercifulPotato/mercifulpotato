But if we have no information or even plausible theories, what good is this baseless speculation? Its not exactly news that China is a rising super power and probably has schemes within schemes. Maybe this one is the obvious one, that a working quantum computer would be very prestigious and economically valuable to the first country to get there. Or maybe not. But if it isn&#x27;t the obvious one, guessing at utter random without even reading up on the underlying paper almost certainly will not come up with whatever the scheme is.')
