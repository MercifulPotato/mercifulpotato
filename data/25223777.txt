Graphics is a particularly soft target,  eg: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=article&amp;item=macos1015-win10-ubuntu&amp;num=2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=article&amp;item=macos101...</a><p>I know —and apologies for the originally unintended, but retrospectively way-overused pun— I&#x27;ve compared an Apple to an orange there, and I realise it&#x27;s very different hardware... But it&#x27;s also not. It mostly depends on access. If developers can shim in a loader, and it doesn&#x27;t require soldering, it&#x27;ll be popular and get attention. These chips look too great to ignore.<p>Not my downvote, btw. Hopefully they&#x27;ll toss an opinion in too.')
