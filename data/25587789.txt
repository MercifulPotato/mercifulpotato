They were an irregularity, but it appears they were already investigated and the relevant ballots were correctly counted. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.11alive.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;elections&#x2F;fact-checking-claims-about-fulton-countys-election&#x2F;85-89c150d2-c917-44b6-b7ab-a29dd9dcb888" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.11alive.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;elections&#x2F;fact...</a><p>Every time we criticize Georgia, we should remember that the President&#x27;s party is the one in charge of elections there, and the one in charge of auditing and assuring security of those elections. There is every incentive for the state election commission to cry foul if there was foul to cry; the fact they have not is extremely telling, and one really has to widen the conspiracy net to come up with an explanation that puts the state election commission of Georgia in on a conspiracy to defraud the electoral process.<p>&gt; there is not institutional effort to investigate the irregularities<p>I don&#x27;t know what you would consider &quot;institutional effort,&quot; but there are absolutely processes for investigating irregularities and multiple investigations are currently in progress. Georgia just concluded one such audit today. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ajc.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;no-fraud-georgia-audit-confirms-authenticity-of-absentee-ballots&#x2F;QF2PTOGHLNDLNDJEWBU56WEQHM&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ajc.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;no-fraud-georgia-audit-confirms...</a> - they don&#x27;t get reported on in detail because, to be honest, the details are boring and therefore don&#x27;t make for very good news; they have about as much fun as a tax audit with even fewer exciting variables. and to really get a big picture of what&#x27;s going on, one has to track the news from multiple states, since every state manages its own balloting system.<p>A full and exhaustive audit takes time. The President commissioned such an audit at the federal level for the 2016 election, and it resolved in 2018, finding an absolute handful of actionable cases. I would expect the audits that are going on now to continue, as multiple parties are interested in pursuing them. But they take time; the one for 2016 took two years.')
