They bring him a disk but this is not good enough, there is no way this piece is worth that much he says and rejects the application.<p>They end up putting the software on a tape and declare that they&#x27;ve sold 2000 meters of fine Turkish software to the Brits. The clerk likes that, so the first software export from Turkey ends up being measured in Meters!<p>[0] The sources are in Turkish but the guy who was involved in this is Ali Akurgal.')
