It’s not a political argument, not even in theory. It’s purely a semantic one.&quot;<p>Which is quite much exactly what I said.<p>That a definition is arbitrary doesn&#x27;t mean that it is unimportant. If I use one arbitrary definition, and you another one, we won&#x27;t have any meaningful discussion. Sometimes this can be resolved, when the definitions themselves aren&#x27;t the central issue and we can agree about at least some provisional defintions. Sometimes the definition itself is the central issue, and can&#x27;t be resolved. Like when we disagree about the meaning of the term life. In this case, any provisional definitions won&#x27;t help.<p>&gt; then they aren&#x27;t really disagreeing over the meaning of the word &#x27;life&#x27;, they&#x27;re disagreeing over the nature or essence of life itself<p>Those two things are the the same. What is the meaning of a word other than the &quot;nature or essense&quot; of the thing it references?')
