While I&#x27;ve shipped side-projects to small groups of customers, I often feel that my technical inexperience means I can&#x27;t readily translate my vision into a quality product through code. I plan to work at a BigCo&#x2F;Startup first to better learn the ropes&#x2F;practices before going it out on my own. The idea is that I stretch my technical capabilities so that when I build my own project, I naturally integrate practices even if I&#x27;m developing faster eg. Tests to ensure that my code changes produce the right outcomes.<p>To SWEs turned Technical Founders, what technical skills&#x2F;practices&#x2F;areas from your previous jobs were most transferrable to your startup?<p>Possible practices&#x2F;skills I&#x27;ve identified so far include: Clean&#x2F;Idiomatic Code, Test Driven Development, Design Patterns, CI&#x2F;CD, Agile, UX Design.<p>As a caveat, I&#x27;m aware that MVPs don&#x27;t need to be polished products. It&#x27;s an easy trap to focus on engineering a product instead talking to users. Yet, I do think having the technical confidence is vital for the long-term development of a product.<p>Post was inspired from reading: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23446627')
