As someone who has recently started using Terraform a fair bit (in AWS), I have to agree that it leaves me thinking &quot;surely there&#x27;s a better way&quot;. I agree, it&#x27;s not code (any more than HTML is), and I agree, it does inevitably get heavily copy-pasted and become hard to maintain.<p>But I&#x27;m not sure that the article presents an alternative, at least not one that&#x27;s fundamentally different. The conclusion says &quot;hint: Ansible + Terraform&quot;. Ok, that&#x27;s a start, but it&#x27;s still just &quot;config + config&quot;. Where&#x27;s the code?')
