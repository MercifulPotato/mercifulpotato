It was not all &quot;back to the land&quot; luddite stuff. In fact I associate that stuff more with the 1970s and the New Age movement that came later. Of course then there&#x27;s eco-futurism that actually blends back to the land tropes with high-tech futurist tropes, which can get really interesting too.<p>I don&#x27;t like Italian futurism at all, though it did create a bit of interesting aesthetic work. It&#x27;s a very nihilistic fascist sort of futurism. I&#x27;ve seen an echo of it in the nihilistic accelerationist fascism that&#x27;s adjacent to the &quot;alt-right&quot; (or whatever it&#x27;s called this week) movements of the past decade. I get the sense that some of these people advocate fascism <i>because</i> it is awful, because they&#x27;re angry nihilists who want to burn the world down.')
