On the technical side, analysis is always much more difficult to stop than people think. In terms of people&#x27;s behaviour, adoption is nearly impossible and services will ban or flag such transactions, if mining pools even mine the transaction.<p>Sure grandma can just practice output control (that I still struggle with after using BTC for 8+ years) and pay hundreds in fees for coinjoins with every transaction, problem solved &#x2F;s<p>&gt; The Lightning network in conjunction with Tor will make tracing of transactions nearly impossible in the future.<p>I only see papers finding flaws that prevent it from being private, and that people are struggling to get it to work even without thinking about privacy. Scaling is still a difficult and unsolved problem for now, lets not make absurd privacy claims alongside it. Relying on Tor is an issue in itself.')
