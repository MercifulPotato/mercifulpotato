Item(by='VLM', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608657534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508159, text='&gt; if a junior enlisted solider did something like this<p>Exactly like this, I donno.<p>But in spirit isn&#x27;t the academy kind of officers basic training?  And anyone who went thru basic knows that the recruits do the dumbest imaginable things and the drill sgts slowly and laboriously socialize them into being competent military personnel.<p>Fresh off the bus recruits at basic can get away with the dumbest things imaginable, things that would instantly chapter a MOSQ soldier out of a line unit.  Think of the stupidest thing you ever saw a recruit do with a rifle WRT common sense safety or maintenance requirements.  Dumb lapses of discipline, incredible lack of foresight, etc.<p>Frankly not much is expected of new 2nd LTs other than shut up, stay out of the way, and listen carefully to your platoon Sgt.  Officers have a VERY slow and long maturation period compared to enlisted.  Enlisted experience is here&#x27;s a couple months to get MOSQ and then sink or swim.<p>Not that basic trainees get away with being dumb, that&#x27;s kinda the point.  The officer cadets have just earned the most epic extra duty imaginable for a long time.')
