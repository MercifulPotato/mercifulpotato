Fundamentally, deploying a Matrix homeserver in the <i>cloud</i> is the same thing. Homeserver requires a public ip address or domain name, it&#x27;s really hard to set up one at home.<p>I don&#x27;t have enough information about Matrix protocol but, a raspberry pi image, or Dockerfile doesn&#x27;t need IP or Domain, uses hosts file to trick the homeserver maybe, just supports bridges, would be perfect.')
