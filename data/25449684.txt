So, you said it&#x27;s a currency.<p>This is a straw man.  USD is a good currency because it is widely accepted, engaged with, and in use by people and organizations in commerce.<p>BTC is <i>not</i> a good currency because it is <i>not</i> widely accepted, engaged with, and in use by people and organizations in commerce.  Even in your paypal example, they first convert your hobby money to USD (a real currency)  before commencing the transaction.<p>Having billions traded or invested in it is a characteristic of an <i>asset</i>, which you keep repeating, and not a <i>currency</i>.  You&#x27;re failing to understand this distinction.')
