There&#x27;s a reason that &quot;May you live in interesting times&quot; is considered a curse.<p>Think about the year we just had.  Whatever else you might say about it, it wasn&#x27;t boring.<p>[Clarification] Individual local experiences may have been boring at times, but the year as a whole, from a historical point of view, was not.  And the things that made it non-boring also made it suck big fat honking weenies.  IMHO of course, but I&#x27;m pretty sure most people on earth would agree with that assessment.')
