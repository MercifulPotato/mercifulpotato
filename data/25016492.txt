I got interested in the ATARI ST when I read about the VT52 extensions in the Wikipedia and I wanted to try 4 bits color for foreground&#x2F;background and palettes.<p>I have this hardcoded to 9600bps but it should be able to do up to 115200 with no problem.<p>I really want to explore the space of modest processor with custom chips like Commodore &amp; Atari did on their 8bit and 16 bits systems.  I find it way more interesting&#x2F;fun than the ultimately successful superscalar&#x2F;big cache&#x2F;big gpu that we ended up with, and fpgas make it very easy to test things out.')
