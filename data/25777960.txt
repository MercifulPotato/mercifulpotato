Item(by='JW_00000', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610640165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25777880, text='&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to learn that Flemish people have a distinct English accent too<p>Yes! One thing I sometimes notice is that, in Flemish we pronounce &quot;wat is&quot; as &quot;wadis&quot;, and sometimes Flemish people in English will also say &quot;Whad is&quot;. So Flemish people end up saying &quot;Whad is dat?&quot; instead of &quot;What is that?&quot;. (Also lots of &quot;eh?&quot;s and the occasional &quot;allez&quot; pop up.)')
