As you say, there are only 24 hours in a day, but it gets worse when dealing with politicians and their schedules.  If they can be seen as doing something by doing a low-cost thing, it is do and move on to the next thing.  When actual action is demanded, it is a time consuming thing.  Bills are hard work even with a staff.<p>The path to change is attention of politicians to writing bills to address the root problem.  PR looks exactly like change but is much cheaper and often removes the problem from sight.')
