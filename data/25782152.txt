When we hit the end the only to get more cores will be either larger dies or more dies.<p>Moore&#x27;s law does help with efficiency to some degree, small transistors generally require less power to switch. However, most the power is last due to the miles of wiring in a modern chip when running at such high clock cycles. Again, it&#x27;s the parasitic capacitance.')
