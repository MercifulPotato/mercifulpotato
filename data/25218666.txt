Personally, I think it&#x27;s a very different distribution because its basically misleading. The very vast majority the 608 million &quot;farms&quot; are the equivalent of a small house and a yard.<p>There may be more classic Pareto distribution if you change the statistics - basically the title and newspaper article are misleading in trying to point out inequality. Its a trap. Advocates of Pareto like to downplay inequality by invoking Pareto distributions as being &quot;natural&quot;. Both points of view are flawed in this specific case (but are valid in other cases) because the statistics don&#x27;t mean much - it&#x27;s like playing a rigged casino game against a player where it&#x27;s the house that wins.')
