I’m not drawing any conclusion about the justification [not comparison], but he was not “unarmed”.<p>I stand corrected, though it doesn&#x27;t detract any from my overall point.<p>The shooting was still BS:<p>&gt; Blake details returning to his SUV while in possession of the knife. It was that knife that Sheskey said he saw moments before the DA said Sheskey followed his training and began firing until there was no longer a threat. Sheskey shot Blake seven times, paralyzing the 27-year-old father of three.<p>I don&#x27;t think someone holding a knife and <i>walking away</i> from you can be properly categorized as an actual &quot;threat.&quot;')
