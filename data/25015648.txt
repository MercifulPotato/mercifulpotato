E.g. Python is not a descentent of Smalltalk (see e.g. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;python-history.blogspot.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;python-history.blogspot.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;</a>), neither is Java (see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ccRtIdlTqlU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2448" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ccRtIdlTqlU&amp;feature=youtu.be...</a>). C# is also rather a brain child of Java and C++ than of Smalltalk.')
