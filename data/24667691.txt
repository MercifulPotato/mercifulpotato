They&#x27;re are two implications though, one is that it could never be decelerated below the speed of light and the other is that it&#x27;ll probably have to be traveling backwards in time.<p>Making something that goes backwards in time and faster than light (without using infinite energy) is left as an exercise for the reader.')
