May be a bottle of good vodka&#x2F;cognac to smooth introduction to the friend of the friend :). I grew up on a Navy base, and back in 90ies visiting my hometown we&#x27;d drink and enjoy sauna on a big active service Navy ship with my childhood friends  who served there at the time (as officers of course). Of course if you&#x27;re an &quot;American spy&quot; nobody would let you even come into the town, and an unknown person trying to pay money out of the cold to for example get some photos&#x2F;etc. is a sure way to get branded as one  :)')
