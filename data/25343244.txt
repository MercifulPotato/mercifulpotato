I&#x27;ve reacted fast in situations and it saved lives, but I wasn&#x27;t born that way. I had trained for years as a kid in a program literally called Life Savers[0] which taught swimming in contexts where others are drowning, first aid including CPR, and how to react in situations like burning buildings and downed electrical lines. One of the first things they tell you is that untrained people react to chaos by freezing and that because most people are untrained this collective freeze is enforced by social pressure. So you need to point and yell in order to get people organized and moving. For example, when I was giving mouth-to-mouth to someone I pointed and yelled at one person to get me a medic and they just stared blankly back at me, so I pointed and yelled at the person standing next to them and he jumped into action. It takes focus and leadership, but it&#x27;s vital during a crisis.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lifesaverscanada.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lifesaverscanada.com&#x2F;</a>')
