It doesn&#x27;t break type systems that are designed for it.<p>The issue seems to be that some people forget that their code might receive null values and that nulls are represented as a zero pointer which cause an exception if dereferenced.<p>The resulting backlash is worse than the disease: straightjacketing languages and littering them with more busywork.<p>I&#x27;ve gone the opposite direction in my work: not only can pointers be null but so can all other basic types. It&#x27;s incredibly useful and a real design win.')
