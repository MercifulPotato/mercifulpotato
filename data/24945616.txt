Item(by='dehrmann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604084154, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24942712, text='&gt;&gt;&gt; Lyrics parody swaps one set of words that accompany a melody with a new set of words, preserving the number of syllables per line and the rhyme scheme<p>This is halfway like the Max Martin trick for songwriting. The apocryphal story is that this Swede who wanted to write pop songs in English didn&#x27;t worry too much about the words and paid more attention to how they fit the melody. That&#x27;s why the lyric to &quot;I Want It That Way&quot; parse a little funny. I know he&#x27;s very intentional about syllables, but I&#x27;m not sure how much I believe the story--his English is actually really good.<p>Or you could say it&#x27;s the Paul McCartney &quot;Scrambled Eggs&quot; approach. &quot;Yesterday&quot; might be the greatest parody ever.')
