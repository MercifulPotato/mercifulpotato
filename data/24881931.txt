I also agree that the author, like many who try to define solarpunk by pulling utopic goals (ie startrek utopia, singapore vs HK) and fantasies, confuse the readers on what is punk and solarpunk.<p>Punk is not about where you are going, is not about what will become. Punk is about doing it regardless of that and what others expect you to. A solarpunk is certainly hopeful that actions will lead to a better reality, but they are more focused on action today than what will be of tomorrow.<p>A solarpunk is a punk because, unlike other more mainstream ecologist they don&#x27;t need to convince others of their view to act.
