The question is whether the conspiracy is feasible.  But it is feasible if only a few counties or cities committed fraud.  What makes conspiracy infeasible is widespread collusion without a mechanism of coordination and ensuring secrecy.  Collusion in a few large municipalities does not seem obviously out of the question.')
