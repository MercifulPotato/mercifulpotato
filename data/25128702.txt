Does the ISA, as a language, really matter? Or is it more a by product of who owns the ISA, eg intel sucks, arm is more liberally licensed.<p>I used to work at intel, and \nno one I knew there thought ISA mattered at all. That’s just a few people though, so I’m curious if people think there’s something better or worse about the different ISAs  as a technology in their own right, or if it’s more about the business interests behind them that matters.')
