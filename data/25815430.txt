However, I think the article could have made that point without completely discrediting the value Bitcoin provides by calling it a &quot;collective delusion that value can created out of nothing by convincing greater fools to buy it after you do&quot;...<p>I believe Bitcoin has served its purpose by being a pioneer, w.r.t popularizing an application of an immutable distributed ledger. However, it&#x27;s not the one we should use. Ethereum&#x27;s model (proof of stake) allows for most if not all of the uses of Bitcoin, without the non-scalable energy requirements and transaction costs, along with smart contracts, which have many potentially revolutionary applications (voting, public records, etc.). We could have our cake and eat it too..')
