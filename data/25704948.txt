GP did not exclude what you have commented in their comment.<p>But I don&#x27;t want to make this comment purely about criticizing someone.<p>There is a figure on Wikipedia [1] that shows that Filibusters have been rising starkly since the 70s – since politicians started realising how effective they could be under the new rules.<p>My conclusion of this is twofold:\n1. The use of a filibuster is an extreme measure and shows how divisive US politics has gotten – hence the more numerous reach for drastic measures.\n2. It is an inevitable devil&#x27;s spiral with two parties that don&#x27;t trust each other. Every use of a Filibuster by a Republican will give a Democrat a justification for one and vice versa (this is why Whataboutism should be avoided).<p>So please let&#x27;s not make this about &quot;But the Democrats started it&quot; or &quot;But the Republicans did more&quot;.<p>Instead, judge me on my hypothesis: &quot;The increase in use of the filibuster is an indicator of polarization and shows that polarization has been on the rise since the 70s.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate#The_two-track_system,_60-vote_rule_and_rise_of_the_routine_filibuster_(1970_onward)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Filibuster_in_the_United_Sta...</a>')
