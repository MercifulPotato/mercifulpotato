This is possible by creating such patterns that compression programs will recognize.<p>In this case the altered content is (quoting the README) &quot;decompressed data from the original file together with reconstruction data&quot;). So confusingly enough its precompressing includes decompressing.<p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;precomp&quot; is a real accurate name for the whole tool, but that might be where it came from.<p>With no flags it will precompress (including decompressing) and compress. With -cn, it will precompress alone. With -r, it will decompress and...I dunno, postcompress (including compressing)?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;findwords.info&#x2F;term&#x2F;precompressor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;findwords.info&#x2F;term&#x2F;precompressor</a>')
