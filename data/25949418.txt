In your example, the bank manipulated the housing price and now owns the house, earning them an asset. The the Robinhood example, they (maybe) manipulated the price, and then forced you to sell, so you now have the money. They don&#x27;t now own the proceeds from the sale (except what you already owed them). These don&#x27;t seem similar.')
