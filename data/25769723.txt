Do you think 50 years ago there could be civil discourse on legalizing rape or celebrating Holocaust? No, these people would get the same treatment. Or, as a non-imaginary example, just remember McCarthyism.<p>What changed is the level of discrepancy of Overton windows between rural and urban America. Thatâ€™s all.<p>&gt; platforms being used to organize illegal activities<p>Hah, but when they are used to organize illegal activities in countries like Egypt or Belarus it was not an issue.<p>&gt; proliferation of misinformation (during a pandemic)<p>If you think that an average citizen is too stupid to think for themselves, we might as well just abolish voting rights. And surely there is a better way to combat misinformation than giving censorship powers to private technocrats.')
