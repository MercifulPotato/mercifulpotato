But I also think it&#x27;s not easy because I posit that the people most susceptible to being swayed by extremism or conspiracy theories on Facebook are also the same people who would scoff at the concept of political distancing.  In fact, they may decry it as attempts to suppress free speech.  In that event, it&#x27;s like COVID-19 deniers.  They are the ones who would most flaunt the guidelines to avoid COVID-19, so they are the ones who would be most susceptible to get infected and spread infection among other COVID-19 deniers.  This idea of political distancing may stop the spread of misinformation among the general population if the general population agreed to it, but it&#x27;s the peopled swayed by extremism and conspiracy theories that would cause the most issues and&#x2F;or societal damage anyway.  How do you slow down the spread of misinformation amongst people who seek it out is the more difficult question.')
