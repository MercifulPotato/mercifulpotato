It&#x27;s still got a little way to go, but already some larger codes are using it to great effect. Also, as a member of the JuliaGPU group, I know that AMD and Intel GPUs should be supported by KernelAbstractions within the next month or two, so a single generic kernel will be able to run unmodified on all major GPUs.')
