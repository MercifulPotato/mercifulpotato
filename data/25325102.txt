Sort of like reading Shakespeare or Camoes is useful in appreciating what the human race has done and what can be done with older versions of the language. If you&#x27;re a cretinous boob, I guess learning handwriting, grammar and so on are also entirely optional. We can just teach kids how to thumb twiddle their phones, take birth control and twerk their asses.')
