The same code can either copy or insert, depending on whether you use std::begin or std::back_inserter; this isn&#x27;t principled but it&#x27;s powerful.<p>The &quot;six types of iterators&quot; overstates it. You don&#x27;t need to sweat those details unless you are writing boost or something. Just add what you need.<p>I miss C++ iterators in other languages. For example, in Rust it&#x27;s hard to talk about &quot;a position in a String&quot; which may be advanced or retreated. Usually you give up, use an integer index, and this is much worse.')
