Item(by='cauthon', descendants=None, kids=[25843894], score=None, time=1611129699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25843458, text='&gt; I was disappointed to find out that AI ethicists at Google aren&#x27;t LessWrong style AI ethicists. I&#x27;ve just read one Google AI ethics paper in it&#x27;s entirety but it seemed pretty non-insightful and not actionable.<p>This seems like a contradictory criticism to make. The Less Wrong folk, in my perception, mostly dabble in thought experiments (such as Roko’s basilisk) that aren’t terribly relevant to real world AI work. Timnit’s work on identifying racial and gendered inaccuracies in facial recognition [1] seems much more actionable.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;1003482&#x2F;amazon-stopped-selling-police-face-recognition-fight&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;1003482&#x2F;amazon-s...</a>')
