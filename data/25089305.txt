It&#x27;s pulling way, way more because it&#x27;s in the turbo window, and the gap between base &amp; turbo is huuuuuge.<p>So right now when Apple claims the M1 is 10w, we really have no context for that. Is it actually capped at 10w? Or is it 10w sustained like Intel&#x27;s TDP measurements? How much faster is the M1 over the A14? How different is the M1&#x27;s performance in the fanless Air vs. the fan MBP 13&quot;?<p>Frequency would give insights into most all of that. It&#x27;s not useless.')
