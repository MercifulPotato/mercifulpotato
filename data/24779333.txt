This kind of superconductivity only occurs in very specific compounds at very specific temperatures -- way cooler than what&#x27;s going on in the earth&#x27;s core.<p>We&#x27;ve found a few substances that are superconductive at very low temperatures, but it doesn&#x27;t have any impact on geology because those conditions simply aren&#x27;t found on earth.')
