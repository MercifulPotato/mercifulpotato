What makes a notebook &quot;pro&quot; is having options for display, ports, memory, mass storage devices, docking, etc., plus the supply and delivery chain that go with it. Also, for eg music production, things like stable interfaces, timings, and apps to base larger investments on. When I bought my Powerbook, it came with a PCMCIA slot (that I used for a third FHD display), exchangeable battery, memory, optical storage, wired networking in addition to WLAN, commitment to support for Java development, POSIX certification. Many of these things may be uneccessary today, but MBP prices haven&#x27;t changed or have even increased since. The MBP doesn&#x27;t even have a std keyboard layout without touch bar and ties its design aesthetic to a glossy screen&#x2F;screen-top. Feels like a rip-off to me even if I personally can afford it.<p>Edit: and there&#x27;s nothing &quot;Pro&quot; about the lack of perspective for both S&#x2F;W development and music production on Mac OS')
