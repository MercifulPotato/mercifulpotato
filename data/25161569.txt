I saw C++ and now Rust filling that role.<p>I&#x27;ve not dug into the implementation details enough to confirm but when I see comments about runtime checks, I&#x27;m concerned there might be things going on that make this cover only one domain rather than covering these related domains.  Even if its a matter of &quot;programming right&quot; to fit all domains, that just seems brittle.')
