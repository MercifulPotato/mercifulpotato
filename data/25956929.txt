There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with making money. What&#x27;s wrong is never being satisfied no matter how much money you make. &quot;Growth, where it no longer serves a purpose beyond the accumulation of more growth&quot;, &quot;endless growth&quot;, &quot;growth unchecked&quot;. The author doesn&#x27;t say that growth itself is bad. If you&#x27;re a sole proprietor, it&#x27;s not necessarily bad to grow and hire employees. The question is, at what point do you stop prioritizing growth and start prioritizing other things in life â€” happiness, love, friendship, leisure, ethics, the environment, etc. At some point there are diminishing returns to accumulating more wealth, but there&#x27;s a collective insanity that says no accumulation is too much. Society celebrates the ultra-wealthy, but to me the ultra-wealthy seem more like gluttons. Would you celebrate someone who eats constantly and weighs 500 pounds? That&#x27;s not healthy.<p>Look at Warren Buffett. Dude doesn&#x27;t even know what to do with all of his money. He only knows how to accumulate, he knows nothing else. He&#x27;s pledged to give away most of his fortune to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation... which means he&#x27;s delegating the spending of his wealth to someone else... after his death! Buffett literally has no idea how to spend the wealth he has accumulated. Doesn&#x27;t that seem bizarre to you? Why does he keep accumulating?<p>Some people will claim that if you don&#x27;t constantly strive for growth, then you&#x27;re &quot;complacent&quot; and &quot;lazy&quot;. But that&#x27;s completely false, because financial wealth is only one aspect of life. If you only strive for financial growth, then you are one-dimensional; you&#x27;re lazy and complacent about the non-financial aspects of your life.')
