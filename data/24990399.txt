If the engine stops for some reason, it still has some minutes of endurance in electric-only mode, for an emergency landing. With an unmanned helicopter, if the engine fails, the crash is mostly warranted, even with the autorotation function.<p>Besides, the mechanics are simpler and therefore more reliable. And the propellers are smaller than a helicopter rotor, which is safer. Multirotors are also much simpler to operate than a helicopter. Most industrial customers do not want to operate unmanned helicopters because of their complexity.')
