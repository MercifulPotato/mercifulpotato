Item(by='ryan-duve', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611582740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25902885, text='This article helped me feel less out of the loop with what goes on on &#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets, but I would say it fell short of explaining how the market was &quot;solved&quot;, or even proving that claim.  I understand the bottom line says focusing on large companies can yield bigger profits than penny stocks, but I can&#x27;t see how that is a &quot;solution&quot;.  The evidence does not seem comprehensive.  Showing that Palantir was correctly analyzed early does not convince me there is a winning strategy.  The same is true for screenshots of account balances.<p>Defining &quot;success&quot; by net gains over a reasonably long time, I think it is impossible to prove whether a fluid collective of forum posters have a &quot;successful&quot; strategy.')
