I love that this exists, and want to encourage you to continue.<p>Like a lot of people working in tech, I&#x27;ve had persistent neck and posture issues for years. I&#x27;d love to see you expand to cover those, focusing on the many smaller muscles in the neck like SCM&#x2F;Scalenes&#x2F;Occipitals&#x2F;etc.<p>Another great area to expand is &#x27;click where you have pain&#x27; and it would recommend certain stretches, weights, trigger points, etc. There are common pain referral patterns that most people do not know about and I imagine that would be very helpful for people who don&#x27;t have easy access to physical therapy or even feel they are candidates for it.<p>After casually mentioning my neck issues to people over the years, I&#x27;ve found so many people open up about persistent pain they have but that they&#x27;re not addressing because it hasn&#x27;t reached a bad enough point. I think that&#x27;s an ideal audience to target with online resources like musclewiki.')
