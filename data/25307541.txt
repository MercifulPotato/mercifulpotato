The classic smallpox vaccine (the first vaccine ever) kills 1-2 people per million vaccinated for the first time. 14 to 52 people per million experience lift-threatening reactions. About 1000 people per million experience a serious but not life-threatening reaction.[1]<p>Until 1972, smallpox vaccination was routine in the US. Killing 1-2 people per million was considered better than having a smallpox epidemic.<p>The classic smallpox vaccine is a live-virus vaccine. It gives you a disease similar to smallpox but far less dangerous, and triggers the immune system into a reaction that eliminates the disease it induces, and thereafter blocks both it and smallpox. There&#x27;s a newer vaccine, a killed-virus vaccine, against smallpox. It has fewer side effects, but it&#x27;s never been widely used, since there hasn&#x27;t been a smallpox epidemic in a while. The U.S. Army has a stockpile, just in case.[2]<p>The first Western coronavirus vaccines are RNA vaccines. They have a molecule similar to part of the virus, just enough to trick the immune system into creating antibodies. They don&#x27;t have a complete virus, so they can&#x27;t reproduce and cause an infectious disease on their own. This is supposed to be safer than the older live-virus and killed-virus vaccines. But the RNA molecule is fragile, hence the need for freezing in storage and transit.<p>First get it working, then go for ease of use. Merck has a pill version in development.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;smallpox&#x2F;vaccine-basics&#x2F;vaccine-safety.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;smallpox&#x2F;vaccine-basics&#x2F;vaccine-safety.h...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usamriid.army.mil&#x2F;press_releases&#x2F;FINAL_News_release_FDA_smallpox_vaccine_30_SEP.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usamriid.army.mil&#x2F;press_releases&#x2F;FINAL_News_rele...</a>')
