Item(by='elihu', descendants=None, kids=[25880826], score=None, time=1611374906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25877530, text='&gt; Is it really so historically significant it&#x27;s worth the amount of effort you&#x27;re describing?<p>Space launches are getting a lot cheaper, so moving the ISS to another orbit might not be such a big deal as it used to be.  We don&#x27;t really need to keep the ISS around forever, but on the other hand, losing it would in some ways be similar to the burning of Notre Dame in 2019 (I can&#x27;t believe that was less than two years ago).  It&#x27;s mankind&#x27;s first permanent foothold in space.  In that sense, it&#x27;s irreplaceable.<p>Let&#x27;s say moving the ISS at the end of its usable lifespan costs a half billion dollars.  That&#x27;s like asking every U.S. taxpayer to pay about two dollars.  Is it worth it?  To me I think it&#x27;s worth a lot more than two dollars, even if it unlikely that i&#x27;ll ever actually be able to visit the ISS in my lifetime.')
