Item(by='chapium', descendants=None, kids=[25340295], score=None, time=1607389289, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25339884, text='&gt; Gun ownership is very common in this country, and anyone on the other side of any door can have one.\n&gt; So I can get that part.<p>Its completely unacceptable.  Police don&#x27;t pull over drivers for speeding with a gun drawn.  However, anyone in Florida may be armed and you cannot reasonably argue that the drivers are cool headed.<p>This overreaction is unprofessional, dangerous, and thuggish.<p>We have a law that we may not be required to quarter soldiers, perhaps a better law would have been to make it illegal to enter private property without consent armed.')
