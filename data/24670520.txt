Like hacking old code to run on a new machine, totally disregarding why we build the new machine in the first place. I personally don&#x27;t know what should be a good model for digital lending but it can be different from how we do it with physical books. This kind of band aid thinking will just cause more legacy issues in the future and may also detract from really taking advantage of the new format.<p>Actually can you explain why you think the licensing model will work for some books and not others? How will volume of demand impact this?')
