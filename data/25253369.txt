I grew up in southern California and apparently have that West Coast or news broadcaster accent, which my kid has picked up. And that&#x27;s what the studios wanted. One was for a Singapore TV kid&#x27;s show where one of the main actors spoke English with what I guess you would call a Singapore accent. The producer wanted to replace that. Another was a cartoon for Indonesian TV. In both cases they wanted the &quot;neutral American accent&quot;.')
