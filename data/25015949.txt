Ultimately it&#x27;s laziness on my part but also frustration: if I&#x27;ve never used the OS before, how should I have an opinion on what partitions I need&#x2F;what size they should be?<p>That&#x27;s not restricted to the BSDs, obviously. I also can&#x27;t be arsed with Arch for that reason.<p>But the main reason is that I actually quite like Linux. I find it comfortable and I&#x27;m not really interested in switching any more.')
