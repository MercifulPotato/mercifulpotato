We&#x27;ve already seen a small trend this way with low resolution images of different people with vaguely similar physical features because used as &quot;evidence&quot; of actors in hospitals &#x2F; shootings &#x2F; terrorist scenes &#x2F; etc.<p>That all said, I don&#x27;t see this as a reason not to pursue GPT-3.
