In order to actually break into a mass desktop market, there has to be consideration of the ways people who do not currently use Linux behave.<p>Oddly, the actual mass market desktops have (and have had for a long time) solutions for the &#x27;general-purpose screenshotting and key-rebinding programs&#x27;.<p>I know how bad was X11 technically, and sympathize with replacing it - but that by itself does not make Wayland a success. It took Wayland over a decade to almost get basic capabilities, and it&#x27;s going to take another decade until all the compositor-based protocols are standardized (probably by eventually only having a single compositor implementation). By the time Linux finishes reimplementing its desktop, Windows and MacOS will be in an entirely different place.<p>Maybe this can&#x27;t be helped - Open Source desktop development was always extremely underfunded and undersupported.')
