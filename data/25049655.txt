You cannot proceed until the storage read operation is completed. There is no parallel work to be accomplished here. This isn&#x27;t UI code. There&#x27;s no event loop. Why would you want this to be asynchronous? This seems like async as a dogma, rather than as a tool to accomplish something specific.')
