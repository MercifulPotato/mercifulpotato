The actual rule is &quot;unit price will trend toward the marginal cost of an additional copy&quot;, but that elides a couple of caveats; first, this only holds true under conditions of a &quot;perfectly competitive market&quot;[0]; second, over a sufficiently long term <i>ALL</i> costs eventually become marginal costs[1].<p>[0] Suffice it to say that most businesses try to leverage or introduce imperfections in the market (aka &quot;sustainable competitive advantage&quot;).<p>[1] Instead of thinking about the &quot;sunk cost&quot; of building a factory, consider the (eventual) marginal cost of building the next one.')
