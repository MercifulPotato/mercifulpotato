In the one to three months between full vaccination of vulnerable individuals and drastically reduced R due to general vaccination,<p>Not a given.  It&#x27;s <i>very likely</i>, but we don&#x27;t know how effective the vaccines will be in preventing transmission.  Certainly there is past precedent for the opposite.<p>Also, there&#x27;s likely to be pockets of population with poor vaccine penetration, so even if it confers sterilizing protection, we&#x27;re likely to see endemic spread in these subpopulations continually challenging the vaccinated population.<p>&gt;  is a variant of the virus going to appear that will be able to effectively infect vaccinated people and spread enough for the pandemic to continue?<p>We see a hepatitis B vaccine escape variant every year or two, despite a much lower community disease burden.  I don&#x27;t think anyone can know how likely this is.<p>&gt; All of this would have to happen in a subset of the population that has a 20x lower chance of being infected and even when that happens,<p>It&#x27;s not very likely that the population has a 20x lower chance of being infected; the vaccine almost certainly does more to prevent symptomatic illness than any infection.  They&#x27;ve shown a 20x lower chance of <i>symptomatic illness</i>.  You&#x27;re also leaving out the critical window before the first dose where protection (against symptomatic illness) slowly climbs over weeks to 70-80%.<p>&gt; It would also have to compete effectively against other variants in the non-vaccinated population while it is doing so<p>Already the currently circulating variants are not equally neutralized by the vaccine.  There&#x27;s going to be immediate pressure making the variants that are least impeded more prevalent.<p>&gt;  unless you believe that these extensive mutations will happen in one, vaccinated, patient, which is pretty much impossible.<p>Again, the most likely scenario for the emergence for the UK variant is prolonged infection in one person with a low immune response.  People like this are well represented in the groups we&#x27;re immunizing first, too.<p>These things aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive, though: you start off by favoring the current variants that the vaccine is least effective against.  Then, you have ongoing evolution in vaccinated individuals with lower responses.  Then the favored variants become endemic, circulating mostly in subpopulations with lower vaccine coverage and occasionally finding vaccinated people who are more susceptible.<p>How quickly it all happens depends upon total disease burden.  I agree we will probably not get a worst-case escape variant in the first few months of the vaccination campaign, but I think we&#x27;ll probably see some adaptation towards escape and lowered efficacy.  Indeed, you don&#x27;t even need mutation for that: just preferential selection for existing variants with lower vaccine efficacy.<p>No one&#x27;s done the assays on the UK variant yet, but I will not be surprised if the current vaccines are somewhat less effective against it.<p>If the disease remains endemic with relatively high levels of circulation, variants that escape the current vaccines will be all but certain in the long term.')
