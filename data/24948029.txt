Then, if I choose to, I can go into a single topic, like a specific movie and discuss and view only topics about that particular film.<p>---<p>I am just one guy, making this site in my spare time. I don&#x27;t even feel that comfortable posting on this site, as most of the projects here and their authors are much more experienced.<p>I love message boards.  I&#x27;ve always been on them, and love sharing ideas and opinions, and spreading knowledge and information.<p>I wanted to create a place where people could find and talk about anything, so I had the idea of Cliq.  I wanted it so much, I taught myself programming and began to make Cliq a reality.  A few years later, I have what I consider to be a functional site in BETA!  Of course, there is tons more to do, but I would love to start getting actual users opinions on the site and turning Cliq into a cool place to hangout and express opinions, respectfully and intelligently!<p>Because this is a site in progress, I am open to any ideas and suggestions that people might have!  Think of a good place to put them, and make your own Cliq!  Remember, the sites designed to be dynamic and user controlled!<p>Facebook login won&#x27;t work - but the regular login should still work for testing.<p>Thanks')
