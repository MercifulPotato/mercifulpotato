I did go into it with my eyes open, knowing the kinds of tradeoffs I was making.  I could live alone, but this was a choice I made to help her.<p>However, I was unprepared in the extreme for the ambient hostility toward men who live with their mothers, no matter the reason.  I do not attempt to date or anything near it (I have additional factors that would make dating ... unlikely ... already, and living with your mom is just gravy on top), nor do I &quot;hit on&quot; women, but there was a (to me) startling rate of women who, upon finding out my situation, make it abundantly clear that they would not date me, despite me not asking.  I refer to this as &quot;pre-jection.&quot;<p>I wonder if this sort of thing will continue, now that it is happening to a significantly larger segment of the population.')
