Coupled with the fact that an obvious way to boost profits of a game is to design it to be easily portable across some combination of PC and various consoles, and why would you hyper-optimize a game for hardware?<p>We&#x27;re in a vastly different world than BBC Micro or the Sega Genesis, where a game targeting multiple platforms is now pretty normal, and if it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s usually for business reasons rather than hardware incompatibility. And ports in those days were often from-the-ground rewrites, which I would probably hazard is not true today of most of them.')
