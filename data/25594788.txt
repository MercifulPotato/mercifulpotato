The most critical point seems to be the social aspect: Boys ostracize academically successful boys, and therefore boys are afraid to be seen as academically successful. Other minor social factors seem to be that teaching methods unintentionally disparage boys who weren&#x27;t academically successful, often by creating competitive environments where they fall into a failing feedback loop and just quit participating in the competition altogether.<p>It ends on a note saying that the way to fix is by acknowledging the fact that boys are falling behind, and adjusting our teaching methods and schools&#x27; social environments.')
