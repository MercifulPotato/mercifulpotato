Great suggestion!<p>Cross at San Ysidro, grab lunch at Tacos El Franc and some craft beers at Border X Brewing in Tijuana. Visit CECUT, navigate the traffic circle around Las Tijeras for a real Latin American driving experience, and pick up a torta and some chapulines at Mercado Hidalgo, and then head over to Tecate for a relaxing stroll around the zocalo and a visit to the brewery. Or even south to wine country, and beautiful Ensenada where I&#x27;ve spend many weekends wandering around on-foot exploring by myself.<p>The beaches in Ensenada are <i>gorgeous</i> and don&#x27;t get the crowds of the So Cal beaches. I recommend the Ultramarino bar for craft beer and live local music (mostly rock), and if you can find them (it&#x27;s a very walkable city), the fish taco stand across the street from the birria stand (you&#x27;ll know it when you find it) is where my family and I head straight-for when we enter the city limits. If you&#x27;re just looking to hang out and get some work done with your laptop there are several good hipster coffee shops with wifi.<p>If you&#x27;re really, really fancy, Verde y Crema in Tijuana is pretty cool (I&#x27;ve only eaten there once, it&#x27;s a little pricey for me). Tijuana also has a bunch of hipster bars, that are what I imagine SF looking like back when Lenny Bruce was doing shows (Try a big &#x27;ol caguama of Indio beer at El Tigre - It&#x27;s walkable from the San Ysidro pedestrian crossing).<p>We could even do the biannual Rosarito to Ensenada bike ride when things open up again after COVID. Hundreds of people turn out, they let you cycle along the toll road, and it&#x27;s very family-friendly. That Tijuana-to-Ensenada toll road drive is my favorite coastal drive, only second to California 1.<p>Aw hell, maybe we could even go to a Xolos game.<p>A visit to the border sounds just wonderful right now, and I can&#x27;t wait until we get the vaccine out so I can start heading down every weekend again.')
