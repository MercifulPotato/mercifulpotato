Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=[24764454], score=None, time=1602579866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24763517, text='Having grown up in the US in the 1980s and 1990s, the American Revolution and WWII both loom large in the mythology of American exceptionalism, so I think the sacrifices of the soldiers weigh psychologically disproportionately.<p>I think most college-educated Americans are aware that the Soviets lost nearly endless waves of soldiers against the Nazis.  I also think most Americans are largely indifferent to the numbers of German rank-and-file soldiers killed, as if sympathy for the enemy dead would somehow diminish admiration for the heroes who defeated the Nazis.<p>On a side note, I have a Scottish friend who still swears up and down that Americans weren&#x27;t involved in D-Day.  I tried pointing him at Wikipedia entries for Utah and Omaha beaches, but I get the impression he believes it&#x27;s just American propaganda that the US had much involvement in WWII before the Nazis were on the retreat.')
