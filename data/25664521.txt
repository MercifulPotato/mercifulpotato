(Discovery from the other party, sure, but that’s not investigation.)<p>Due process means that <i>if</i> you’ve raised a legally cognizable claim, <i>then</i> you get the chance to have the (legally admissible) evidence <i>your investigation</i> has gathered for that claim heard by the court.<p>&gt; Litigants cannot do it outside the court process, because they have no power to conduct an investigation that requires warrants to be issued by court for the police, or other permitted authority, to make an arrest, seize property, and conduct a search necessary for the purpose of investigation.<p>No one is arrested, nor warrants (search or otherwise) issued on behalf of litigants in civil cases.<p>&gt; Facts are the notions that the court establishes during the process, not when cases are filed.<p>Specific fact claims (which is not “Something funky might have happened, we’d like it to be investigated”), which, if true, would meet the criteria of some legal wrong that can be remedied, are a threshold requirement for a case. This has always been the rule, its not some new problem that first emerged for Trump.')
