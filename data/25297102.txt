I&#x27;d go so far as to say almost never.<p>Focusing on the problem, exploring and defining it well, being clear on user needs and then considering possibilities and constraints, moving to testing and validating&#x2F;experimenting quickly before sinking too much money and time into whatever random solution &#x27;technology&#x27; wants to throw at it has so many benefits.<p>Getting that right and spending some time on it generally pays off for everyone, users, sponsors and those working on the technical side of delivery as they are working on more valuable and better appreciated pieces of work. It is quite often the case that the resulting technical work is more interesting and enjoyable to work on too as the eventual solution you work on is more novel than building out the  bulk standard solution that would have been the default proposal.')
