Looking at top of the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newest" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newest</a> page illustrates this pattern.  Almost every timestamp there ends with a dot, except for the cases where the submitter commented on their own submission, in which case that comment has the dot.
