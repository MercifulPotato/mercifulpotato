The lack of childcare, the lack of access to grandparents, the lack of school, the volume of energy in the house <i>constantly</i>, the messes, the crazy amount of dishes and food prep because they donâ€™t eat breakfast and lunch at school anymore; I could go on and on, I can laugh and I can scream and curse, in the end I do what you do and just try to be present and carry on.
