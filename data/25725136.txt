While their candidate, Trump, promised to change the political landscape he actually prooved even more incompetent than the former. There are 100s ofreasons which im not going to bother to mention here. He lost the elections for those reasons and also because he was not tearing down the establishment but the nation. I see people comparing BLM with the proud boys and that is the most dishonest thing to do. BLM were protesting about police brutality which affects us all. Proud boys were a rebranding of a radical group who was directly following Trumpâ€™s orders.')
