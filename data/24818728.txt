A medium sized marketing firm could, on their own, set up 70,000 distinct s3 bucket URLs, or a large one could easily justify that many distinct domains. Many existing block lists and uBlock&#x27;s dynamic (uncountable) behavior far outstrip these limitations. This spec will break the back of ad blocking for good, and Chrome engineers and PMs know it.<p>Spec: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.chrome.com&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;declarativeNetRequest" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.chrome.com&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;declarativeNetReques...</a>')
