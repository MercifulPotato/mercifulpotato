The actual rate of change, or at least, the (large) portion of the rate influenced by greenhouse gases, will only turn negative if the amount of gases absorbed by plants, the ocean, and other chemical processes exceeds the amount produced. We&#x27;re likely not hitting that even in 2020. Even if we did, we would hardly be moving the needle long term.')
