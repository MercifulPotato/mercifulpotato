There is no incentive to reuse plastic when it&#x27;s less expensive to use virgin material.<p>The use of Solar Panels have always been more expensive and less convenient than fossil fuel but we&#x27;ve started to make the transition to solar power chiefly because of the energy credits that the government has been giving to encourage the development of alternative energy.<p>I think we need to start doing the same with plastics and other polluting trash that we output as a society. Plastics will always be less expensive to just dump and not recycle. We need to give industry an alternative. Tax credits will have the benefits of creating new industries and more jobs. Unfortunately we will face the same resistance from the fossil fuel industries that we currently experience but long term it&#x27;s the right thing to do.<p>It would be nice to get companies to do it with out government incentives but as we have seen that just does not happen.')
