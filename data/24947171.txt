If one of their vehicles gets in an accident, it&#x27;s extremely likely that the other (human) driver was at fault.<p>It looks like in 2018 Arizona had 1.4 crashes per million miles <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azdot.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-Crash-Facts.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azdot.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-Crash-Facts....</a> and Waymo released data that they had 2.9 crashes per million miles, over twice as many. 7.7 if they hadn&#x27;t had human intervention, almost at another order of magnitude than the average driver. That&#x27;s rough.<p>I&#x27;m really not interested if the other driver is almost always at fault, that&#x27;s not the number to get down. Their mid-term goal seems to be to drive on public roads with mostly human drivers, so they need to get better results. If they&#x27;re getting bad results over lots of data, it&#x27;s not just bad luck: the way they&#x27;re driving is causing more crashes, even if they&#x27;re not at fault. Additionally, fault classification is worrisome, since there is the potential for bias.<p>Various factors might make this remark wrong<p>- &quot;Crashes per mile&quot; isn&#x27;t the right metric: injury, fatality, or similar should replace or augment it.<p>- I compared data from Arizona to data from Waymo&#x27;s zone, which might be more crashy.<p>- Crashes in the doc I linked underestimate total crashes, since many go unreported.<p>- I am not comparing apples-to-apples -- new commercial minivans might be far more crash-prone than the average vehicle.')
