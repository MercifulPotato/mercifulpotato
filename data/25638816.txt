I cannot recommend it enough, if you haven&#x27;t played it and like puzzlers you should pick it up.<p>It&#x27;s an extremely engaging story, and a narrative tool I have not previously encountered. No spoilers as this is revealed immediately, but essentially you are navigating past events through frozen timepoints at the moments when people died, and have to determine the identities and fates of all the about 60 crew aboard the boat, which requires a bit of puzzling things together across the different events that lead to peoples deaths.<p>I doubt we&#x27;ll see a similar follow up game from Lucas Pope, as he has commented this game grew much larger than he expected and he would scale back for his next projects. Also from papers-please to Obra Dinn he seems to be one to break the mold at each iteration, but I really wish there where more games like this, with different stories to investigated.')
