That&#x27;s not enough these days.<p>If you want to build anything mildly interesting, you need to have a solid background on software engineering (building data pipelines in Spark, Flink, etc. goes way beyond knowing SQL), you need to really understand your runtime (e.g. the JVM, and how to tune it when working with massive amounts of data), you need a bit of knowledge about infrastructure, because some of the most specialized and powerful tools do not have yet an established &quot;way of doing things&quot;, and the statefulness nature of them make them different from your typical web app deployment.<p>Maybe if you want to become a data analyst you only need SQL, and I would still doubt it. But data engineering is a bit different.')
