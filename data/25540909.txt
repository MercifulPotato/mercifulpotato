This can be exploited for code execution.<p>---<p>Case 1: Packages in ~&#x2F;bin,  &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin is read-only:<p>A user wants to look at a &quot;foo file&quot; from the internet. The file is malicious, it exploits &quot;foo viewer&quot; and gets local execution. It is a cryptolocker, so it encrypts all the user documents.<p>The malware has installed trojaned &quot;~&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sudo&quot; wrapper, but since the user does not use &quot;sudo&quot; that often, it did not have a change to get executed. And none of the system services look into user&#x27;s &quot;~&#x2F;bin&quot;.<p>A week later, user notices that a document is encrypted. But the time machine backups are still OK. They reformat their machine, and then use time machine backup to restore the documents. Day is saved!<p>---<p>Case 2: Packages in usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin:<p>A user wants to look at a &quot;foo file&quot; from the internet. The file is malicious, it exploits &quot;foo viewer&quot; and gets local execution. It is a cryptolocker, so it encrypts all the user documents.<p>The malware has installed a bunch of trojaned binaries, including &quot;&#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin&#x2F;touch&quot; binary. Unfortunately, there is a LaunchDaemon which runs the script periodically which contains the line &quot;touch &#x2F;some&#x2F;file&quot;. That is run as root, so in a short time, the malware gets root access. And it immediately used this access to disable time machine and delete all the backups.<p>A week later, user notices that a document is encrypted. And the time machine backups are gone, too. Oh no! the documents are lost unless they pay the ransom!<p>---<p>You might notice that some people may consider the scenario unrealistic: What if the user uses command line a lot, and is used to running &quot;sudo&quot;? What if a malware social engineers user by popping up a fake dialog  asking for user password? Are there other privilege escalation methods? How often does this happen anyway?<p>You should make your own decisions, but hopefully you at least see what the people are concerned about.')
