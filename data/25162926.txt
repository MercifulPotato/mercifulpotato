First, no opening &quot;(&quot;. What kind of Lisp hacker does this? Second, both in C and in C++ functions can (of course) take variable-sized arrays. (And, there is no such language as &quot;C&#x2F;C++&quot;). If you are trying to explain why a Lisp company failed, is it the right place to put obviously false propaganda about the winners?<p>On page 14, several howlers in one, &quot;<i>[Word tagging] eliminates the need for data type declarations in programs and also catches bugs at runtime, which dramatically improves system reliability.</i>&quot;  Where to start? Dynamic type errors are a major cause of program failures in obligate runtime-bound languages, today. Word tagging turned out to be a dead end, easily outmatched by page tagging in normal architectures.<p>Higher up on page 14: &quot;<i>... an extra instruction in the final 386 architecture to facilitate garbage collection.</i>&quot; What instruction? Was there one, really?<p><i>Also</i> on page 14: Asserting novelty of virtual memory in the &#x27;80s, really?<p>Page 16: Calling out the importance of their proprietary debugger gives the lie to the claim on page 14.<p>Page 20: &quot;<i>Many potential customers of Symbolics were interested solely in Symbolics&#x27; software. However, customers could not buy the software without purchasing a expensive LISP machine.</i>&quot; It looks like the authors would like to think the software was attractive. But of course any such potential customers could get the same software from MIT without a 5x$ machine hanging off. Did they?<p>Page 28: &quot;<i>The Symbolics documentation was outstanding ... former Symbolics employees still treasure them.</i>&quot; People developing important things can&#x27;t afford to spend enough attention on docs to make them outstanding, because the important things demand that attention.<p>And, yes, the kerning is positively abominable.
