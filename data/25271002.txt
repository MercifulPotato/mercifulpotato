It is Okay and better than the abominable life of a single day of the Apple Watch. But, it is still pale in compare to the 14 days of the Garmin Instinct. I put the Apple Watch 3 away to have the Garmin Instinct. It doesn&#x27;t have all bells and whistles comparing to the Apple Watch: no apps, no payments, no direct texting input (at least for my iPhone) but I can wear it while I sleep and charge once every 9 days (I use the GPS quite often and it eats up battery). The GPS in my opinion is superior to the Apple Watch. It&#x27;s pretty rough, too. I have the regular Instinct but you can opt in to buy the Military one with tougher case and HALO jumping alert.<p>After using it for a year, I kind of understand why pilots often use Garmin watches:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gigazine.net&#x2F;gsc_news&#x2F;en&#x2F;20191025-garmin-smart-watches-pilot&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gigazine.net&#x2F;gsc_news&#x2F;en&#x2F;20191025-garmin-smart-watch...</a>')
