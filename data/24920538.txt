One of the first things that stands out is what Mazda told Consumer Reports about its Lane Departure Warning System with Lane-keep Assist:<p>&gt; Mazda responded that its system was not designed or intended to center the vehicle in a lane and that the automaker doesnâ€™t believe its vehicles are equipped with technology that meets the criteria CR is using in its evaluation.<p>Not necessarily something I would have understood from its website or brochure.  This probably takes the CX-5 off of my short list.<p>Incidentally, the submitted title casts this as Cadillac vs. Tesla, but the actual title is &quot;Cadillac&#x27;s Super Cruise Outperforms Other Driving Assistance Systems.&quot;  In fairness, their 2018 article did have a similar title: &quot;Cadillac Tops Tesla in Consumer Reports&#x27; First Ranking of Automated Driving Systems.&quot;')
