I would like to think that some part of my brain is no longer associating alcohol with the buzz I used to get.  It seems far fetched, but plausible?  The other side of it is I definitely would feel the &quot;buzz&quot; of alcohol before I actually drank it, such as when I was walking home from the store carrying booze -- I would feel elated.<p>To be clear, the &quot;buzz&quot; I refer to is straight up pleasure, not intoxication.  On naltrexone I felt the intoxication without the pleasure.  It made me think, is this what it&#x27;s like to drink alcohol when you are not an alcoholic?<p>Very easy to moderate in that circumstance.')
