I’m a 20-something female, born in the heart of Silicon Valley, and have been heavily involved in tech during my short career.<p>Heads up: This isn’t animal farm, this is 1984!<p>I never post on here and stopped reading awhile ago due to the one-minded propaganda I consistently find on the site these days (i was a lurker a longtime before i made this account) but I feel compelled to share my opinion because these times matter, and us young (and old) folks matter.<p>Amen and a-women? Welcome to the best addition to New Speak. Please look that up if you don’t know what it is. Have you zoomed out on how Big (and Little) Tech had subtle involvement here?
