They also were much worse about losing luggage back then, and if it was lost, if was gone for good usually.<p>Private is another ballgame entirely. If you can afford it (or someone else is paying), and you don&#x27;t mind the inflated carbon footprint, there&#x27;s really no reason not to choose it.')
