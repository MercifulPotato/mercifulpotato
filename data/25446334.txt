Both are subject to high and low swings to inflation and deflation. The one thing bitcoin has not been in its history is stable. This still ends up to being the equivalent to &quot;there are 14 standards, let&#x27;s make a standard to unify them... there are now 15 standards&quot;. Plus, all you described was a currency exchange with an extra step. You could replace bitcoin with rice commodity, wheat futures or Tesla stock and achieve the exact same thing. Again, &quot;redistribute to my pocket&quot; with extra steps.<p>Look, I&#x27;m not trying to be a dick, but bitcoin was sold on the lie that it helps poor people. You&#x27;re not wrong for wanting to help poor people. But people need to come to the realization that bitcoin has been Theranos-like the whole time. It&#x27;s a waste of time if you&#x27;re goal is to help the poor.')
