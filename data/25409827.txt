I absolutely develop web applications on my Mac, using a graphical IDE. I&#x27;ve also developed for Arduino boards using a graphical IDE on my Mac. I&#x27;ve written software natively on my Mac that I put into production on Linux and Windows machines. And all of that is supported on the M1 as well. They even built a complete and complex and powerful subsystem to allow you to run Intel code on their new processor.<p>Apple has never stopped me from installing VSCode or Atom or Sublime or Jetbrains and they&#x27;ve never given me any reason to think they would do so in the future, especially given Rosetta 2. I&#x27;ve never run a VM on my Mac.<p>I have no idea what point you&#x27;re trying to make here, so I&#x27;m trying my hardest to argue against the best possible interpretation, and that interpretation is still so unbelievably wrong that I still feel like I must be missing the point.')
