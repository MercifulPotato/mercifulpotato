If I understand correctly, the loss of objective reality is <i>one</i> explanation for Bell&#x27;s inequality, but not the only one.<p>And no, I&#x27;m not going to watch a 20 minute video to find out what your argument is.<p>And as for the second point, even if you don&#x27;t like &quot;objective reality&quot; in there, do you deny that there are natural laws that govern things?  (Bell&#x27;s inequality would be one such law.)')
