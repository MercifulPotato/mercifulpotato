Item(by='gricardo99', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607056519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25297063, text='yep, I think that&#x27;s the key point I need to drill into my head.  The unix&#x2F;linux idiom where 0 is true&#x2F;success and non-zero is a failure can be counter-intuitive when combined with &quot;if&quot; (at least for me, hence my mistake reading the code).   In most&#x2F;other computing contexts &quot;if 0&quot; is never taken.   I think this might explain why I&#x27;ve seen a lot more bash code that is explicitly written in the form more familiar to &quot;if&quot; usage in other languages (pseudo-code):  &quot;if res == 0&quot;.   But &quot;if COMMAND&quot; is taking care of the interpretation of the return code, so doing the explicit compare is redundant.')
