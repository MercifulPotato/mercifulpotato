But still... the approach suggested makes kind of sense. A curated list of trusted sites as kind of seed. Not the entire web. This can be as small or as large as can be useful. It does not need to be about the entire web. How big is the &quot;useful&quot; blogosphere, for example? Cannot an opensource project that gathers momentum somehow create a curated list of let&#x27;s say 10 000 trusted blogs and index those? Index all mailing lists that can be found, index all of reddit, index Hacker News, index Wikipedia, the 100 most well regarded news sites in each country, etc. Would not such an index be a good start and better than Google in many cases?')
