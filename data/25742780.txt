Which is interestingly the same thing as your example. Just instead of the feds trying to force you to say something it&#x27;s Trump trying to force&#x2F;coerce&#x2F;pressure Twitter to host him. (Which is basically the &quot;free association&quot; part of liberties.)<p>Twitter is a publicly traded company. Its owned by the public so Jack Dorsey can&#x27;t claim it as his own platform. The second he sought the benefits of public funding, it became the publics platform- democrat or republican should have equal right to it. But he&#x27;s welcome to tweet his opinion if he wants to.')
