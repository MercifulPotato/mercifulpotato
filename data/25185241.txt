The first one to be approved (by Merck) does not use an adenovirus, but the second approved one (by J&amp;J) does.<p>Note that approvals of these were late 2019 and the summer of this year. So still very new from an &quot;approved on humans&quot; point of view (although not _as_ new as mRNA-based vaccines). The techniques have both been in development for years and years of course, including determining their safety profiles.')
