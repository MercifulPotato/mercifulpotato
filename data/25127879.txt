Enormous PRs = less confidence in merging code on a team. If you are pushing small commits then it is easier for the team to follow the changes and review them.<p>- easier to merge and ship small incremental changes than large ones<p>- easier to revert small commits<p>- better commit messages since you can summarize the smaller change instead of &quot;coded a lot of things&quot;<p>- if you have a messy commit history in a PR you can squash them when merging upstream<p>I&#x27;m not sure what your git methodology is but I tend to avoid cherry.<p>We&#x27;ve got a clean production&#x2F;master branch that we merge develop into on releases. We merge feature branches into develop. Very very rarely we may hotfix something on develop. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used cherry in 6 or 7 years on repos with 2-30 active devs.<p>What are you using cherry for daily around releases?')
