The reason is that electrolyseurs aren&#x27;t free, the capital costs are high. Not saying this is impossible, but it&#x27;s challenging to make this economically feasible.<p>One more thought is that you can basically adapt all industry production to excess energy. I think the reason people want to do this with hydrogen electrolysis is because a) it&#x27;s new and b) they associate both with energy transition. But neither means it&#x27;s the best option.')
