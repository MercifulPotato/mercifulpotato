He&#x27;ll usually in turn call someone else in his network of drivers, and someone impeccably professional (maybe with a beard, but always in a suit) will show up in a new E-class (or better) with perfect reliability. There&#x27;s never any fuss, the price is fixed beforehand - never surge pricing - and at about 50% more than the cheapest possible non-refundable pre-paid shuttle service, I consider it well worth the cost. Any random taxi here, by contrast, will be a ripoff at best and frequently unreliable.<p>Almost* everywhere I&#x27;ve lived I&#x27;ve sought out and patronized &quot;a guy&quot; like this. In some (not rich, not western) places it&#x27;s  been a solo operator with his own car. In others maybe a bit more professionalism in terms of having a business name and business cards (i.e. a car service, but not a big name one). I&#x27;ll take &quot;a guy&quot; over Uber or (god forbid) the local taxi mafia every time.<p>Commodity taxis are shit. Repeat business builds trust.<p>*- I never found &quot;a guy&quot; in Seattle. Fuck Orange Cab and STITA. And for plenty of other reasons, fuck Uber.')
