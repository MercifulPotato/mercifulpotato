They were founded based on the ideals of free speech and selfless sharing of technology. Both of these ideals are dying.<p>The GNU project makes it very clear that they are striving for the freedom of the user to modify and adapt the software that they use. So every time a GNU tool is used in the private back-end part of a SaaS webapp, that&#x27;s directly opposite to the spirit of the GNU project, because you, the end user, have no way of modifying said SaaS.<p>And it&#x27;s not only free speech in source code, it appears to me that free speech in general is under attack, now that people have noticed that a twitter storm and a supposed code of conduct violation is enough to wield immense power, for example by destroying someone&#x27;s reputation, job, and life. We have effectively handed loaded guns to random strangers on the internet and, predictably, the results were bad.<p>The spirit of selfless sharing is also dying quickly, which I would blame onto the greed of internet startups and onto the entitlement of users that don&#x27;t understand that GMail isn&#x27;t truly free, just because there&#x27;s no credit card charge.<p>I myself try to stay away from open source nowadays, because it ruins my mood if I get an entitled email from some random stranger who is insulting me because my free app did not solve his&#x2F;her problem. In my case, a big company was kinda guilty in creating this problem, because they advocated my FOSS module on their homepage as if it was part of their expensive paid offering. So some of their customers feel like it&#x27;s my duty to offer support...<p>Also, I would be very hesitant to release anything valuable with LGPL or even GPL these days. Chances are, it&#x27;ll become the next cool &quot;service&quot; that Amazon, Google, and Microsoft will offer in their clouds, and I as the author of the software actually providing the service, will get nothing.<p>Case in point, one of my consulting clients is paying like $30,000 annually to Microsoft for hosted PostgreSQL. But apparently, re-selling PostgreSQL as a service with presumably millions in revenue is not enough for Microsoft to become an official sponsor... \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;</a>')
