I suspect that it is overwhelmingly true as I&#x27;m fairly sure that Google legal would have reviewed it and ensured they didn&#x27;t say anything falsifiable and likely that this paragraph is entirely true.<p>&gt; Timnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who Megan and I had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback. Timnit wrote that if we didnâ€™t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.')
