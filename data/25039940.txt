I&#x27;ve had developers, in earnest, ask how they can use TypeScript on run-time data inputs. I have to break the bad news to them and simply tell them: no, you can&#x27;t do that. That&#x27;s not how type systems work.<p>Out of the box, GraphQL provides no validation, that I know of, beyond the elementary data types. Anyone that knows a thing about XSS or SQL-injection can tell you that a string is not always just a string. Anyone using C&#x2F;C++ that has dealt with stack overflows and code injection can tell you that an integer is not always an integer. Sometimes it&#x27;s a pointer. Oops.<p>You&#x27;re going to hand code validations, each and every time. Because no tool knows how many characters your DB is setup to handle for a username, for example. GraphQL and TypeScript won&#x27;t save you.')
