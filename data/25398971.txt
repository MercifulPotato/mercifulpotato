I can see on my wife&#x27;s face she&#x27;s been talking to her mother when I get home. Even with new recent boundaries set (we&#x27;re not visiting anymore, no more answering the phone or WhatsApp 33 times a day and then when not answering right away having other family call to argue that you&#x27;re abandoning your family, fuck all of them), and I feel my spouse has made tremendous strides there, the mum is still finding ways to do this.<p>Downright psychological abuse.')
