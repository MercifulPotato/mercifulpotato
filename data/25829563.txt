Though I have to admit I’m a bit disenchanted at the moment because I’ve had the same prime fresh basket open for almost two months now and all the baked goods I want are perpetually either out of stock or available one day further out then I can schedule. No problems with meat, cheese, or dairy but bakery goods are like catching unicorns.')
