Rarely more than a few lines (might be different for people doing ad-hoc analysis instead of making a db backed application). I don&#x27;t need modularity for a program that is only a few lines long.<p>The lack of really natural integration into modern day programming languages (and data model mismatches) is a much bigger issue imo')
