US labor force participation peaked in the 90s as female entrance into the workforce peaked. After that happened, the countervailing force of lower birthrates began to take over and the dependency ratio started to rise.<p>We&#x27;re all fighting for a piece of a pie that is, relative to the population, shrinking. And it&#x27;s shrinking because of demographic trends that began decades ago and would take decades to reverse.<p>Every developed country is going through the same thing, and some are in much worse positions than the US. Older people were lucky enough to be born into a world with demographics favorable to growth; younger people are unlucky to have been born into a shrinking world.')
