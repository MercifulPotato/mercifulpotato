What put me off btrfs were the rough edges, e.g. some RAID setups are considered beta. In ZFS those have been stable for a long time. The fact that btrfs has been in development for quite a long time and still has such issues is not very assuring to me. That said, if you only use the features big orgs are using, you are probably fine.<p>Performance has been great so far even on my underpowered machine, even with just 4GB. I don&#x27;t use deduplication though which makes a huge difference.<p>I chose Ubuntu 20.04 as OS since they are pushing ZFS support. Did consider FreeBSD as well where I had a positive experience in the past but since they are switching to OpenZFS anyway I stuck with Ubuntu since I&#x27;m running Debian derivatives on all my servers.')
