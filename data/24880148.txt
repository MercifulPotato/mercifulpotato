Haskell&#x27;s &quot;do&quot; notation seems to be an acknowledgment of this, but to me it&#x27;s adding another layer of abstraction just to recover what imperative syntax gives in the first place. Why not start from the imperative model, and then find other ways to try to limit side effects and mutation? Languages like Rust may be heading in that direction; &quot;Return of the statement&quot; as it were.')
