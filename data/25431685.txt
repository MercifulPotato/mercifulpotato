PAXOS is a negative example here for example, where Leslie said that formalization naturally derives such algorithms, but in reality many years and many iterations on the idea from many different researchers and engineers is what led to something actually useful in practice, as PAXOS wasn&#x27;t, and formalization was by far the least important thing ever.')
