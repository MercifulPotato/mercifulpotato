If you&#x27;re going to truncate the whole thing to rpizero, the rpi being first, is quite important.<p>From 36,000ft, there&#x27;s perhaps a similarity if you squint a bit, but as soon as you see the product, you know it&#x27;s not a Raspberry Pi Zero. And that matters even if you don&#x27;t know what a Raspberry Pi Zero looks like, because you have no frame of reference to confuse this with (everybody who&#x27;s heard of a Raspberry Pi Zero, knows what it looks like).')
