You&#x27;d think that people wouldn&#x27;t try and antagonize a family that owns their own torture tower and shows it off to tourists.<p>Regular corruption is fine in the West though, it&#x27;s a victimless crime. For people who matter anyway, not the peasants who have to drink drilling oil fluid.<p>The point is that in the West there are clear and mostly unchanging rules that everyone knows.<p>In China not so much. Today you&#x27;re the richest man in China, tomorrow you&#x27;re an enemy of the people, next week you have tragically fallen to your death taking a selfie from a ladder. All while doing the same thing everyone else in your wealth bracket does.')
