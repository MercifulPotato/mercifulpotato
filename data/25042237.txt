I think a big problem is that people are generally unaware of how dependent their tech is on company whims. A legally-mandated &quot;ingredients list&quot; or &quot;smoker&#x27;s warning&quot; note detailing all service dependencies (and associated &quot;stability score?&quot;) might help raise awareness.<p>My friend recently got a $6000 laser cutter that has a hard cloud dependency to do anything at all. It&#x27;s all through their cloud interface. That thing scares the heck out of me. Just the other day it failed and <i>just getting the error logs</i> required a round-trip to support.

I bet the machine will be a paperweight in 5 years, and require either wholesale replacement or a controller retrofit. In the meantime, I guarantee my offline CNC mill will be functional until it suffers some catastrophic hardware failure. Since it supports industry-standard protocols, I can use any of a hundred different software packages to run it, including several open-source ones. Unlike that laser cutter.')
