It&#x27;s been their MO for decades even before iOS. They are strongly opinionated and it doesn&#x27;t stop at the UI. Using Apple is like living a Frank Loyd house. It&#x27;s really nice, but Frank Loyd was known to tell you how he wanted you to dress and even down to what cutlery and textiles you should have. This is Apple, and in their defense it&#x27;s how they are able to achieve &quot;It just works&quot; and maintain security. Unlike Microsoft, Apple refuses to say yes to everything. If you don&#x27;t like it, vote with your wallet. They are many alternatives now, and most applications aren&#x27;t even native anymore.')
