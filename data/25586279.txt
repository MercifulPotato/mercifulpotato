Is not deadly enouth to kill an entire population, but enouth to cause panic.<p>The time that the virus stays incubated, already transmiting, but with not sympthons, is like is was designed to break quarentine protocols.<p>That sayed, if it is a bio weapon, I also think it got out by accident. The lab that in Wuhan alread have problems with employes selling animals that should be euthanized.<p>So I think is something like Chernobyl. Someone made a stupid mistake, but fear of repercutions, delay action that could avoid the spread of the virus.')
