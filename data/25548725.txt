In a peer reviewed paper in the Lancet, with a large phase III trial, the vaccine was found safe and effective enough to end the pandemic, which seems like a good enough bar. &gt;95% effective at preventing severe disease. This is a standard far beyond what we should be having during a pandemic.<p>Yet it&#x27;s still banned for use in the US and most of the world.
