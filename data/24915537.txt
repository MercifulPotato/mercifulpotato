However recently some directories under wsl2 are just empty and seem to be unrecoverable. I’ve filed a bug, however I can’t find a way to reproduce it so I don’t expect much motion. So far it’s just random directories are empty and I can’t delete them due to the resource being busy, and unfortunately the Linux utilities to check the locks on the directories error out.<p>I hope I’m just the exception here, but I’ve had to start re-evaluating what I’m going to do longer term, the short term is easier (push all).')
