Any systems developer should view corruption of a persistent storage system of any kind as totally unacceptable. And in this case the whole filesystem is open source! Meanwhile the open source people built a decent NTFS driver for linux years ago, I haven&#x27;t seen what specs are released but I assume they needed to fill a few doc gaps to make it happen.<p>Also other nice people did bundle up ext3 and ext4 into an app you could run on windows to browse and copy stuff from your linux partition years ago.<p>Now MS finally caves and accepts the defeat of linux being a better experience for devs, so they now &#x27;support&#x27; it and can&#x27;t check that saving files always works?!?<p>There is no way this only happens for bash history and git repos, some people have files they don&#x27;t instantly throw on the cloud, or consider half-ephemeral like bash history, in this case you wouldn&#x27;t be able to just re-clone as a workaround, I&#x27;ll keep running my desktop linux on my dev machine (although it&#x27;s not all rosey over there either, I trust it to save my files).')
