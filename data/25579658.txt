(I&#x27;m a founder.)<p>The trouble with &quot;low-code&quot; is that you&#x27;re stuck on rails - it&#x27;s very easy to do a few things, but the moment you want something the creators didn&#x27;t anticipate, prepare for a lot of pain.<p>Anvil is the opposite approach - it&#x27;s a <i>dev environment</i> that happens to be simple enough to build a dashboard in minutes, but with a Real Damn Programming Language. It&#x27;s basically Delphi for the web: It&#x27;s got a drag-n-drop designer, Python in the browser and on the server, code editor with full-stack autocomplete, etc.<p>(And unlike &quot;low-code&quot; tools, the runtime engine is open source, so you&#x27;re not locked in: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anvil-works&#x2F;anvil-runtime" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anvil-works&#x2F;anvil-runtime</a>)')
