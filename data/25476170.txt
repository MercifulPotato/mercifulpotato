But on the other hand, it feels absolutely dead at times, during the missions the city comes alive, but outside of missions it feels empty and soulless.<p>I&#x27;ve encountered quite a few bugs, but nothing game breaking yet. Usually it&#x27;s NPCs acting strange, or people just spawning in right in front of me. I definitely feel it under delivers, but I&#x27;m hoping it turns into a No Man&#x27;s Sky type story, where the game actually becomes super fun to play.')
