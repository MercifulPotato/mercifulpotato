In some cases in the case of the Pinkertons, there is a line in one of the documents that we&#x27;ve obtained that says that Pinkerton operatives were inserted into a warehouse in Wroclaw, Poland, to gather intelligence on what their warehouse workers were up to.<p>The Pinkerton case seems to be one case out of several mentioned in the papers and while the stated reason is to sniff out the application process even that is in direct conflict with official statements by Amazon.<p>&gt; So they have no proof and this is all speculation.<p>They list a few points they know about right before the line you quoted.<p>&gt; Another Amazon hit piece, real quality journalism here.<p>Still a lot better than the copy pasted Amazon press releases after it lost the lawsuit in France. Those were pure fiction with Bezos in the role of the poor abused Emperor Palpatine.')
