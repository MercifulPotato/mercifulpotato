Item(by='Rochus', descendants=None, kids=[24711002], score=None, time=1602093720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24710609, text='Thanks for the explanation. It&#x27;s about the wording. The fellow used &quot;whole environment&quot; and &quot;image based development&quot;. I used the term &quot;virtual image&quot; from the Bluebook to mean the same. The Bluebook says &quot;<i>Two major components of the Smalltalk-80 system can be distinguished: the virtual image and the virtual machine. 1. The virtual image consists of all of the objects in the system [...]</i>&quot;. The important point here is &quot;all of the objects&quot;, especially also the compiler. You cannot do anything in an original Bluebook system without running the virtual image. That&#x27;s what the fellow referred to by &quot;whole environment&quot; and I by &quot;running <i>in</i> a virtual image&quot;. In GNU Smalltalk you don&#x27;t need to load an image (i.e. persisted Object Memory state) to do anything reasonable. There is a compiler and and interpreter, and being &quot;file based&quot; is known to be a core benefit proposition of GNU Smalltalk, isn&#x27;t it?')
