It&#x27;s impossible to say whether it&#x27;s actually stored like this or if they encrypt it before they provide the archive to you.<p>Meta data is almost impossible to legislate against, and as far as I can see, is entirely legal to collect and use as you see fit.<p>How many people in the world are on hackernews, named &quot;lopis&quot;, use Firefox 65, have an IP address in $country, use this screen resolution etc etc<p>Easy enough to identify <i>who</i> you are.')
