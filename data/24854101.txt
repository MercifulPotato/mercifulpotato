I wouldn&#x27;t have posted my comment if they were less invasive or if people could skip more of them. But they seemed too invasive to me. They didn&#x27;t even try to (to give just one example) request age ranges like many other demographic surveys do, instead asking for exactly how many years old you are, which seemed kind of unnecessary. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if some subset of their data points were sufficient to identify a decent number of people uniquely.')
