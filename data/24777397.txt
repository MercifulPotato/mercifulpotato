I agree that it would be cool to be able to zoom out further than currently allowed to see more of the fractal map. The current zoomed-out view is something like Dynmap for Minecraft, I&#x27;d also be curious to see the equivalent of something more like Chunkbase that can show millions of cells at a time.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think the concept of &quot;the entire map&quot; makes sense. I expect it&#x27;s functionally infinite, probably capable of scrolling to 2^32 or 2^64 cells, only allocating new regions in the database as people scroll there and start working. On that scale, you probably wouldn&#x27;t see any activity at all.')
