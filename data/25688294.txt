It represents the attitudes of a few million of the weirdos, distorted further by roleplayers&#x2F;trolls and international infiltrators.<p>Your average Trump voter is just a normal Republican. They voted for Trump because there was an R next to his name and defended him because he was on their team. The Democratic voters would be no different if the dems ran an equally ghastly candidate. (They obviously have not done so, and I am not making the claim that&#x27;s random. I&#x27;m not saying &#x27;both sides are the same&#x27; in this post.)<p>It might be useful to understand the thedonald.win crowd, but it ain&#x27;t 70MM of your countrymen, Americans.')
