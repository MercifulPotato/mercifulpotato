Item(by='tshaddox', descendants=None, kids=[25183471], score=None, time=1606073974, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25177992, text='&gt; I realized that when I tip, I&#x27;m usually not rewarding the waiter&#x2F;waitress. That reward usually gets split across dozens of people and my waiter&#x2F;waitress likely sees none of it.<p>This seems...really good! I’d rather be able to tip the people who actually make the food and clean the table (things that matter!), than the person whose only responsibilities are carrying the food to the table and not saying annoying or obnoxious things. I couldn’t disagree more with you here.')
