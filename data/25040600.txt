Especially when writing FFI&#x2F;low-level Haskell. I suspect the heavy-lifting will be written in a more performance-conscious style. And a lot of it will be deferring to industry-standard C libraries. And then you&#x27;re right, idiomatic Haskell would have its place in the scripting layer.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything inherent to Haskell that stops it from being used to make high-quality commercial video games. So my plan is to try to build those in Haskell and let the libraries and infrastructure fall out (as it always nicely does using Haskell in my experience.) Honestly, developing high-quality games is more bound by art &amp; creativity than Haskell.')
