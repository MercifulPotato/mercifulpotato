More informally, it is a way to make the group &quot;act on something&quot;.<p>Here is an example. Consider the group generated by the symbols a, b, and their inverses a^{-1} and b^{-1}. As usual write a^2 = aa, a^0 = 1, etc. And impose the relations<p>a^4 = b^2 = 1, a^3 b = ba.<p>At first, this is <i>very</i> hard to understand. Which group elements are equivalent to which others? Is the group finite or infinite? If finite, how many elements does it have?<p>To construct a &quot;representation&quot;, make a square out of cardboard, mark the edges and sides, and interpret the symbols in the following way: a means rotate clockwise 90 degrees, and b means flip across its vertical axis. a^{-1} and b^{-1} mean do the same thing in reverse.<p>Now you can see, for example, that this group has exactly eight elements -- corresponding to the positions of the cardboard you can reach.<p>For any group, there are always representations which you can easily construct, such as this one:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Regular_representation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Regular_representation</a><p>But there are representations which are &quot;hidden&quot; in some sense, where it wasn&#x27;t clear initially that they should exist at all. That&#x27;s where the magic happens.<p>The Langlands program is <i>extremely</i> technical; I specialize in another area of number theory, and I only vaguely understand it myself. But very <i>very</i> roughly speaking, the Langlands program describes multiple ways of constructing certain kinds of group representations, and says that you end up constructing the same representations.<p>The modularity theorem, which was the linchpin in the proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, is an example of a theorem along these lines.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Modularity_theorem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Modularity_theorem</a><p>And the Langlands program is very far from complete.')
