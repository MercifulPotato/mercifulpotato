The PIV cards used by the DOD and some other departments are <i>not</i> universal within the executive branch, and the legislative and judicial branches manage their own IT systems (sometimes still managing it locally rather than having any kind of centralized system). Government IT is very much a set of feudal territories still and many of them are not well or consistently managed.')
