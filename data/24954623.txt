Item(by='goatinaboat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604173912, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24952886, text='<i>SLBM are big, a Trident II is 13.6m long and 2.11m wide[0] and Ohios need to fit them straight up plus the hull, so we&#x27;re talking 14m moulded depth or so (excluding the sail),</i><p>There are designs that use the sail, the North Koreans are using that configuration. They took old Romeo class and extended the sail back along the hull to fit 3 launch tubes. But the tubes extend so far down into the hull that they have had to remove batteries in order to do it. Which is a pretty severe compromise as what you absolutely want in such a sub is endurance.<p>Interestingly they have designated those missiles Pukkuksong, which translates as... Polaris!')
