Half of us just wear whatever we slept in the night before.  Most people don&#x27;t get dressed until lunch time.  Even in the office it doesn&#x27;t get much fancier than a t-shirt and jeans.  I guess our tech lead wears a button down shirt, but his jeans usually have giant holes in them, so I would call that a wash.<p>Expecting an interview candidate to wear something nice would feel a bit hypocritical.')
