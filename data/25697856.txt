What&#x27;s relevant to me is that it was a violent incident which people enthusiastically engaged in; nobody seems to have premeditated the specific deaths that happened, but many of the participants spoke quite openly after the fact about how excited they were to be able to break their way in and how glad they are that it happened.<p>I do agree that we need to calm down rather than going down the rabbit hole of making 100% sure it can never happen again. But one of the critical ways in which a society calms down is by reinforcing its commitment to nonviolent norms of communication, and that involves a collective recognition that glorification of violence is incompatible with norms of kindness and respect. Reading a comment on how neat it was to watch people break into the Capitol is like reading someone&#x27;s detailed story of how they&#x27;ll kill burglars who break into their home - I <i>get</i> it, I really do, but it&#x27;s incredibly poisonous to polite discourse.')
