Item(by='jkepler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611591285, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25902327, text='I crossed from Southampton to NYC with my family of 3 on the Queen Mary 2 in June 2019. Amazing experience, and one we hope to repeat sometime.<p>I&#x27;d found a 57% sale on cabins right after Christmas 2018, and even with upgrading to have an ocean facing balcony, that room for the three of us was 25% cheaper than three transatlantic airline tickets, including our flight to Southampton and from NYC to our final destination.<p>We were moving, so being able to bring as much luggage as we could handle also mean no extra baggage charges. Cunard has slowed their crossings to 7 nights at sea, since most passengers cross for the experience.<p>The ship&#x27;s Internet connection was more expensive and slower than I thought the price was worth, so I didn&#x27;t bother. It was super nice to have time for reflection on my previous work assignment before arriving and starting the next---and all with no jetlag.<p>I spent some time working offline on a personal python project in one of the lounges. Also read a book on creativity and another about the changing international monetary order from the ship&#x27;s library---said to be the largest library on the open oceans. One of the people lecturing in their auditorium&#x2F;planetarium was a former chief counsel for the NSA (though I can&#x27;t recall his name), lecturing on surveillance; fascinating Q&amp;A with the audience afterwards (Asked what he fears most when kicking back with friends around a campfire, he said he fears the dissolution of nation-states).<p>Other passengers with cruise line experience said that the QM2 is different---their kids program and entertainment options are minimal compared to cruise ships, but then again, the QM2 is built to cross the north Atlantic comfortably, and her cruising speed, or 2&#x2F;3s of maximum speed, matched the top speeds of most cruise ships. Cunard requires formal dress in all but one restaurant and in public spaces on the ship after 18:00 each evening, alternating formal and black-tie, with tuxes available to rent. My wife, my son, and I had a blast dressing up and &#x27;going out in the town&#x27; in the middle of the North Atlantic.<p>So, if you watch for a good sale, it can be a very reasonable week of vacation, or an actual transatlantic move.')
