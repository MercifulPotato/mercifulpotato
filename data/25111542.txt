How so? Like the REPL? Because when I think of tooling, I think of things like IDEs, dependency management, and distribution. Python has one of those things now (IDEs&#x2F;notebooks), but even that took a while, IMO.<p>Python is a weird case study for me. I&#x27;m not trying to flame war or anything- just pointing out my own blind spots and&#x2F;or biases. But I just don&#x27;t see much of anything redeeming about the language. It <i>can</i> be pretty easy to read, but I don&#x27;t think most code I&#x27;ve seen actually <i>is</i> easy to read&#x2F;follow.')
