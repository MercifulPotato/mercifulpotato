There&#x27;s no thought to giving a reason or not if they don&#x27;t need one. It&#x27;s a pointless thing to think about when you think police are about to storm your house and murder your family to stop something that&#x27;s made you unpopular with the government.<p>Coming in and drawing their guns once informed her family was in there probably didn&#x27;t improve her view of police.')
