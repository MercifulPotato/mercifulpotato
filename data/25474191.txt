Looks like Dr. Seuss and Gene Roddenberry died almost 30 years ago.<p>It&#x27;s kind of ironic that Star Trek envisions a post-scarcity society where we can abandon pettiness like this and build on each others works and explore the universe while in the real world the petty owners of the copyright use the power of the state to prevent people from writing their own book using their own labor, creativity, and funds using characters from the 1960s or earlier.<p>In effect, the copyright owners are saying: &quot;We own the society and its culture. Do not touch.&quot;')
