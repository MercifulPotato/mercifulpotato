One of the really obvious answers is that they control the whole stack — not just the hardware and OS but also the compilers and high-level frameworks used in many demanding contexts.<p>If you&#x27;re Intel or Qualcomm, you have a wider range of things to support _and_ less revenue per device to support it, and you are likely to have to coordinate improvements with other companies who may have different priorities. Apple can profile things which their users do and direct attention to the right team. A company like Intel might profile something and see that they can make some changes to the CPU but the biggest gains would require work by a system vendor, a compiler improvement, Windows&#x2F;Linux kernel change, etc. — they contribute a large amount of code to many open source projects but even that takes time to ship and be used.')
