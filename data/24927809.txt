If someone is causing a problem ask them to leave and&#x2F;or ban them. Maybe you need some policy internally that says who handles complaints of this kind, but you don&#x27;t need to tell all conference attendees they aren&#x27;t allowed to threaten one another or assault each other.<p>As far as friends of the organizers, I assume that&#x27;s not settled with CoCs either. I bet if Jeremy were good friends with the right people this wouldn&#x27;t have happened at all. Maybe it&#x27;s not solved either in the CoC-free case, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worse and I think it&#x27;s a relatively rare thing anyway.<p>It&#x27;s not just correct to say that &quot;people can&#x27;t say...&quot; Of course they can. People don&#x27;t read the codes of conduct and don&#x27;t know that they say. Even if they did know, the language is bound to contain ambiguity. Jeremy, for example, didn&#x27;t know he wasn&#x27;t allowed to disagree with people.<p>Genuine question for you: do you read the code of conduct at conferences you go to?')
