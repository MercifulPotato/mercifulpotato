Phone numbers are traceable to identities. They really should have used usernames or e-mail addresses.<p>Also, Signal&#x27;s desktop app shouldn&#x27;t require a stupid phone app to enable it. I have a big powerful setup on my desk and you&#x27;re asking me to go around my house looking for a silly 6&quot; device to give it permission to log in? That&#x27;s backwards. It should be the other way around if anything.')
