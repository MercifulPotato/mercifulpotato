In Canada, Charter free expression rights have been interpreted to include <i>the right to access and read information</i>, so censorship of foreign publications generally infringes the rights of Canadians who might wish to view them.<p>Of course I suppose that infringement is sometimes justifiable.  Obviously free expression has limits and we do have probably-constitutional laws against foreign propaganda.  But the government can&#x27;t just ban a book because it was by a foreigner, thankfully.')
