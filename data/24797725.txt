Item(by='JamesBarney', descendants=None, kids=[24797877, 24797811], score=None, time=1602825468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24797430, text='&gt; I always found this argument lacking, like what is that supposed to show me... that there were these 20 times he denounced them and then this VERY publicly one time he didn&#x27;t?<p>Yes. This tells you his public stance is that he&#x27;s anti white supremacist and willing to denounce them.<p>Do you honestly think he chose the debates as a the best time to secretly signal his base that he&#x27;s a closet KKK member?<p>&gt; like imagine this was like child trafficking or something. you denounce that shit heavily each and every time, no ambiguity, no question. even if you&#x27;re asked to do it 50 times it should be 50&#x2F;50. the fact that people have to pull that as a &quot;defense&quot; is ridiculous lol.<p>If my wife asks if I love her 50 times and I say yes 49 times, but once I get distracted.  Which is more likely I secretly hate my wife or I just got distracted.')
