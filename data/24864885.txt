A systems language, sure. Memory safety when no garbage collection, fine. But we do have a garbage collector in the browser. And are expecting to get it for webassembly too. And when I compare Rust code to typescript, I want to howl in agony and ask, why would we inflict on ourselves this punishment. At least I can see the elegance and the beauty of Purescript, although I can&#x27;t write anything useful in it. But Rust is just so horrendous for frontend, where the existing languages are so much nicer!')
