Never set a maximum number of reviews. It will create an unstoppable backlog no matter what you do.<p>2. If you have a huge backlog of like 500 cards then just hit &quot;HARD&quot; on 50% of them until the backlog is spread out over multiple days and you have a manageable number reviews.<p>3. Don&#x27;t have too many young cards at once. Stop adding new cards after you have 500 young cards (exact number depends on how easy the cards are).')
