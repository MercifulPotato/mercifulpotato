How the OS is monetized makes no difference.<p>Look at Kindle as an example. Kindle has an ad subsidized model along with no ads one. Would Amazon even make the model work if they weren&#x27;t big and didn&#x27;t have other stuff to sell through it?<p>Look at game consoles, the cost of device and OS is subsidized by the cut Sony and MS receive from games. Would this model even work if they had no money or games to sell?<p>I will again circle back to Siri to make my point again. Apple is rumoured to be working on a search engine, this along with alrwsdy default Siri as a voice search engine. How do you think Apple is paying for all the cost of building and running this? Revenue they earn by selling devices. Can someone even compete to them using the same model if they don&#x27;t have an OS or hardware to sell? Definitely no.<p>If we accept these analogies then a lot of tech companies are susceptible to analogous accusations.')
