Today it&#x27;s hard to find TVs that are just TVs and not smart TVs and similar thing is happening in the PC builders ecosystem. Built a new desktop computer recently, and had to spend more time searching for things that don&#x27;t have RGB things in them, seems most components nowadays have some sort of RGB lights in them, even when it&#x27;s completely not needed.<p>Back in my day, people used to buy strips of RGB lights to add to their setup, so us normal, non-RGB people could still buy the same components. Today, it&#x27;s a lot harder to find stock CPU fans that don&#x27;t ship with RGB lights...')
