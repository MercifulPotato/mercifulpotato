Building super intelligent unfettered AI has a known end condition where said AI at worst might steamroll local area then <i>pass onto higher plane of existence</i> or however you decide to call the process of <i>Sublimation</i>.<p>Because a super intelligent AI quickly can reach that point, and with resources available to many Involveds, finds cheaper and more interesting methods to reach there than disassembling biological life.')
