The project leader has to decide whether speed issues need fixing or not. If they don&#x27;t need fixing, then it is indeed a wasted resources trying to do so. If they need fixing, then of course it is the task for the project leader to find the neccessary resources.<p>Speed issues are almost never unfixable. But, the cost of doing so might be prohibitive, usually companies deliver products which are just fast enough. The question is, with a given budget, how do you ship the better product for the customers needs? Do you want it to be fast with fewer features or not quite as fast, but having many more required features? To decide this, it is the job of the project lead, the architects and of course marketing, which has to sell the product.<p>And both as a project lead and a developer, I can say, it is really fun to make something faster and more efficient, but far too often there isn&#x27;t the time&#x2F;resources for it. Most of the time you have a customer waiting for new functionality or bug fixes much more urgently than for some speed improvements.')
