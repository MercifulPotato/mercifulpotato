It&#x27;s normal to have a low threshold to send people to biopsy. From the number of developed cases you can get some idea about what ratio of &quot;ok&quot; results you should have as a referring doctor. (this is tracked) But once you do biopsy &#x2F; further checks I haven&#x27;t heard of overdiagnosis by a large factor - not the &quot;you should have surgery&quot; overdiagnosis anyway. &quot;Wait, see how it develops, retest&quot; seems more common.')
