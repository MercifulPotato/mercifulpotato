If enough rules like &quot;class A {} is very different from A = class {}&quot; are piled onto JavaScript it&#x27;s going to become like C++, a language so complex that people would rather learn a simpler language so they can focus on the complexities of their actual problem space rather than the complexities of their language. A new language called Zig is now trending upward because a growing number of programmers would rather have a language they can 100% understand after a reasonable time investment rather than a language like C++ where even after a 20 year career with it and implementing portions of a compiler for it you still get painfully surprised by some obscure rule interaction you never dreamed to imagine possible.')
