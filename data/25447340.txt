Opera, Brave, Safari, Edge, etc. could take up Firefox&#x27;s install-base without significantly increasing Chrome&#x27;s.  At least Firefox is a known entity for them and they would probably rather have a guaranteed platform with Google as the default search engine than having to negotiate with whatever sprang up to replace Firefox.')
