I meant the email analogy in the sense that you can communicate with people who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> on your instance.<p>&gt; I didn&#x27;t join radical.town or whatever, so I don&#x27;t really feel like I&#x27;m a part of that community.<p>That&#x27;s fine, and you aren&#x27;t required to feel so anyway. They&#x27;re just other people on another instance, who are also in your timeline.<p>&gt; Does that make sense? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve fully processed this stuff yet, so it might not be a great answer.<p>It&#x27;s alright! I understand it can be slightly jarring at first. I run a single-user instance so it&#x27;s truly quite like Twitter -- there&#x27;s no &quot;community&quot; that I&#x27;m a part of, and the feed I see is something I&#x27;ve curated for myself by following people across the fediverse.')
