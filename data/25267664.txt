It links to libc shipped with the operating system. That is about 30MB of code that C executables get for free.<p>You can link libc statically and dead-code-eliminate everything except print. That&#x27;s what Rust does too, but Rust has fancier machinery for formatting and handling of panics with backtraces. These bits don&#x27;t get dead-code-eliminated as thoroughly in Rust (probably because the print could theoretically fail).')
