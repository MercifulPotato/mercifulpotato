You might still have to pay for shipping costs, but I imagine that checking and repackaging a product costs Facebook money too.<p>Perhaps Facebook would lock the account again after processing the returned product, but that should give the user enough time to export any useful data from the account, and to provide alternative contact details to any Facebook-only friends.')
