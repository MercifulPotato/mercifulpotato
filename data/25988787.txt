It is no longer so fancy to have silver stuff and it has maintenance costs (cleaning, storing, etc.) that are not worth it IMHO.<p>On the other hand, gold is known for it&#x27;s unique properties, so, besides jewelry, it has tons of applications. Which justifies its relevance in modern societies and, as a store of value, makes a lot more sense.')
