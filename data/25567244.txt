Silicon + CMOS happens to be one <i>really</i> high-performing combination. But it&#x27;s not the only possible platform for computation. The past has seen us through vacuum tubes, magnetic core memory (and its cousin, magnetic logic), TTL (or resistor&#x2F;transistor logic if you want to reduce the process steps), and through to modern MOSFET-based technologies. Along with each transition are numerous other computational platforms which <i>didn&#x27;t</i> catch on -- usually because they didn&#x27;t optimize for the things which the market demanded (e.g. perf, power, yield, and cost at volume).<p>Among all the possible platforms for logic, it&#x27;s hard for me to imagine that there&#x27;s not at least <i>one</i> which has properties usable for at least <i>some</i> set of applications by enthusiasts.')
