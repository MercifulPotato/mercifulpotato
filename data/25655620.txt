That could also help in a more rapid improvement of maps as opposed to the mostly-useless state it&#x27;s been in (except for a few countries and regions in certain countries that Apple likes and works more on).<p>&gt; and still a little YouTube (anonymously in a Firefox container)<p>If a Firefox Container is an option, then I&#x27;d rather prefer Startpage to DDG for search. Most of the time, I end up performing the search on DDG at least twice (the second time with a bang command to go to Startpage or Google) or I have a heuristic that DDG won&#x27;t help and just go to the other search engines.<p>&gt; DNS → Cloudflare DNS<p>Others to consider are Quad9 (9.9.9.9) and NextDNS (if you want ad and tracker blocking lists to be configured at the DNS level, sorta like a Pi-Hole, but on the cloud).<p>&gt; I feel like I&#x27;ve won a lot by doing all this. I own my data now, so Google can&#x27;t arbitrarily take it away from me, which gives me peace of mind. I&#x27;m no longer part of their ad ecosystem, being tracked all around the internet and having my attention sold to the highest bidder.<p>The &quot;Google can&#x27;t arbitrarily take it away&quot; is a good argument, but &quot;I&#x27;m no longer part of their ad ecosystem, being tracked all around the internet&quot; requires a lot more effort than just avoiding using google.com, youtube.com, gmail.com, etc. I&#x27;m not saying that the current transitions are useless, but that there&#x27;s more to it.')
