It looks like a scraper was used (Scrapy).  The only note I could find in the paper just says:<p>&gt; Additional recipes were gathered from multiple cooking web pages, using automated scripts in a web scraping process.<p>Is it legal to republish these recipes without explicit permission from the origin sites?  I would be wary of using these for anything without more clarity.<p>EDIT: There&#x27;s no license information in the full dataset, but it does list the source URL of the scraped recipes.
