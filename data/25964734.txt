As far as I know, there are only 2 ways, dividend and gaining control of the assets.<p>A stock where neither of both are possible ever (now and in the future) has no fundamental value since you have no way to extract value from it, it&#x27;s pure speculation. Stock buybacks only have value because something else gives the stock value.<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t think the situation described above actually happens in the real world, dividends or ownership will (or at least can) happen at some point.')
