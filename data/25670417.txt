From your link:<p>&gt; <i>Dave Patrick Underwood...was shot May 30 while on guard duty outside a federal courthouse in Oakland and was one of two officers targeted in a drive-by shooting amid nearby protests.</i><p>&gt; <i>David Dorn...the retired St. Louis police captain was killed by people looting a pawn shop</i><p>&gt; <i>[one person] was killed trying to blow up an ATM on the sidewalk.</i><p>&gt; <i>Marvin Francois...was fatally shot after a protest in Kansas City on May 31, with police reporting his killers were three men attempting to steal his car.</i><p>&gt; <i>a number of police officers are also recovering from injuries from shootings, stabbings, and objects thrown at them during protests.</i><p>I do stand corrected. Including the violence by civilians (whether protestors, looters, rioters, or business owners), the leftist protests did lead to a lot more bloodshed. I misunderstood and thought you were talking solely about the police.<p>Your link only identifies one as killed by police:<p>&gt; <i>Jorge Gomez, 25, Las Vegas: Gomez was shot by officers during a protest that turned violent on June 1; Gomez was armed and allegedly pulled a gun at officers.</i><p>And one as possibly killed by police, with no evidence:<p>&gt; <i>David McAtee...was shot on the morning of June 1 as National Guard troops and local police tried to disperse crowds of protestors in Louisville...two of the officers involved in the shooting had not activated body cameras.</i><p>Following up on most of the others, they were reportedly murdered by other civilians for unknown reasons. It&#x27;s not even clear those deaths are related to the protests.<p>It matters who killed those who died, and why.')
