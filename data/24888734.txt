Which will then incentivize governments to take on the platforms. This also raises issues of unequal treatment - say the NY Post report was factually wrong - why pick on the NY Post only? Why not the hundreds of other &quot;news organizations&quot; peddling unverified and factually incorrect reports on Twitter.<p>I wish it did not come to this. I feel this action will uncork second order effects which we will come to rue for a long time.<p>Edit: This story was flagged which is unbelievable.')
