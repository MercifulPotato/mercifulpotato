The situation in its nature does look like the CDS calls which caused the 2008 crisis. I think some &quot;too big to fail&quot; players wrote a humongous amount of GME&#x2F;etc. uncovered calls (and similarly structured contracts) in the previous months which now threaten to take them down. I mean writing the $100-200 GME calls were practically free money back then while these days it has materialized as the tens of $B liability. Similar to CDS - the statistics practiced on Wall Street permits to have tremendously huge potential liability if it is at a very low probability. When such a low probability event happens though ... hopefully  you&#x27;re too  big to fail and the system  would then step in to save you by socializing your losses in some way.<p>So, before going outright bailout road which would be tough politically, i think big people decided to try to spread&#x2F;socialize that &quot;too big to fail&quot; players&#x27; loss among the retail investors, and thus the stock buying block for retail investors (i&#x27;m voting with my dollar - have a bit of long of AMC).')
