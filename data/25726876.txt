Power - what happened at the Capitol was conducted by people who have enjoyed broad political power, whereas the BLM protests were about the people who have been unjustly under the thumb (or knee) of those in power.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true at all. There is a lot of resentment out there from poor whites who have been getting the short end of many sticks lately. They may be better off than poor blacks on average, but they do not enjoy political power. Don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking that just because the people who enjoy political power are white, that all, or even most, whites enjoy political power.<p>I believe both protests were by groups lacking in power, and that this sort of thing is only going to get worse as economic inequality increases.<p>Most people don&#x27;t have power, and it&#x27;s getting worse as power is concentrated into the hands of the few. As bad as black people have it on average, pitting poor blacks against poor whites is a distraction from the real power disparity, which is that a lot of people in the US are really, really poor. Whilst the elites pay lip service to the issues faced by blacks, whist doing almost nothing to help (a rich black kid getting into a better school does nothing for the impoverished masses), the poorer whites don&#x27;t feel like the elites are even pretending to try to address their problems. And they&#x27;re right.<p>The US needs to fix its inequality issues if it expects either side to stop protesting, and violence is only going to get worse as people see their issues not being addressed.<p>Storming the capital was not a bright idea, but angry people are stupid, and they&#x27;re going to just cause as much destruction as possible until life for them gets better. History is littered with examples of inequality leading to violent uprising.')
