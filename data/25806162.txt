I grew up in Kampala and the LRA was simply something we heard about on the news and didn&#x27;t impact our lives. That said, the impact they had on the northern districts especially  on all the children there is heartbreaking and still felt to this day.<p>I wasn&#x27;t alive in the 70s so can&#x27;t say exactly what Kampala was like then but my parents and grandparents say it&#x27;s more modern now. And overall there are more people having better lives on average than the smaller group of well off people at that time.<p>From an economically standpoint I think a challenge we have is that we are landlocked and have to be dependent on our neighbors substantially amongst other challenges that delving into would turn into an essay. That said I see future promise and growth for the country')
