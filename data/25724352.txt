Nobody deserves to work under an abusive manager.<p>You could try to find out if there is another team or department where things are more stable, and if it would make sense to try to get transferred there. If you do that, make sure that you frame it in terms of your career and interest, and not as in response to mistreatment from your current manager.<p>The risk is that the culture might be similar, so you might encounter the same problem.<p>The other option is to find another job. From what you said, if I were in your place, I would go for this without hesitation.')
