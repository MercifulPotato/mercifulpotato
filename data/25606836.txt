If they&#x27;re applying for paid developer positions, they would need a work visa anyway. I&#x27;ve only ever hired for remote freelancer positions, so I&#x27;ve never been involved with any of my contractors&#x27; visa details.<p>Why would this exclude people with family obligations? When I say &quot;narrowly-acoped project,&quot; I mean 5-10 hours of work. I&#x27;ve never gotten an offer for a dev role where the application interview process took less than 5 hours, and those were unpaid hours.')
