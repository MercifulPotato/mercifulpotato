Item(by='spacefiish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603154478, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24827295, text='&gt; this [this fast and loose style] interrupts more productive work and deters deep thinking<p>This doesn&#x27;t mesh with how I feel toward Slack. Slack itself is the thing that&#x27;s disrupting my productivity and deterring deeper thinking by pinging me all the time. When I open Slack, the vast majority of the time, I&#x27;m looking to express my point as clearly AND concisely as possible so I can get back to doing whatever it was, which is 99% of time more important. As a result I use (or don&#x27;t use) grammatical conventions, capitalization, and emoji depending on the context of my message and what will allow me to get my entire message across the fastest, and hopefully correctly.<p>If I&#x27;m messaging the person I&#x27;ve pairing with all day, or if I&#x27;m coordinating with my team about who will pick up a story, I&#x27;m much less likely to give my message all the proper formatting. These people what I&#x27;m like and how I tend to communicate, and so I can rely on that prior knowledge to &quot;cut corners&quot; here and there.<p>I&#x27;m also much, much more likely to use emoji because I can communicate my intentions and my &quot;intonation&quot; nearly instantly, without having to sit there and worry about wordsmithing my whole message. Sure, sending &quot;I&#x27;m done for the day&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m done for the day &lt;wave emoji&gt;&quot; mean the same thing, my hope is that by including the waving emoji it shows I&#x27;m not signing off out of frustration, but instead that I&#x27;m just at the end of my hours and it&#x27;s time to log off. This is a bit of a contrived example, as I don&#x27;t think hardly anyone would read the first message and think &quot;they&#x27;re mad&quot;, but I hope my argument is still clear.<p>That being said, if I&#x27;m message in a large public channel that perhaps has multiple teams or belongs to a team I don&#x27;t normally interact with, I&#x27;ll spend much more time wordsmithing and editing to make sure I&#x27;m following proper conventions - mostly for the sake of clarity.<p>The author does make some very salient points (think about how others could misinterpret your message, expand acronyms&#x2F;use them sparingly, write to your audience, etc.), and as a whole I think erring on the side of more &quot;professional&quot; and &quot;standardized&quot; is always a safe bet, but I can&#x27;t help but feel that they bought a little bit too much into the &quot;Slack has replaced email&quot; argument (not really his fault, that is how they like to market it). For me, the main benefit of Slack over email is the lowered barrier to entry to starting a conversation and the ability to keeping it flowing; part of achieving that is being okay with somwhat lowering the standards of communication.<p>Unrelated: I posted this comment and then tried to correct a typo, and the edit didn&#x27;t go through. After I hit &quot;Update&quot; the page would just refresh and the text stayed the same. Anyone seen that before?')
