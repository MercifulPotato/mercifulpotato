Somehow <i>CIA</i> are portrayed as opposed to capricious unaccountable extralegal domination of society by powerful cronyist authoritarians? Come again? In scores of nations, including USA, they have taken the opposite side. &quot;The Boys&quot; is more explicit than e.g. &quot;Black Panther&quot; in its CIA whitewashing, although that movie was probably more insulting to the memories of numerous dead Africans.<p>One salient difference between the characters of Butcher and &quot;King Henry&quot; (this is not specific) is that Henry <i>is a king</i> and Butcher is a somewhat violent homeless dude. One deeply suspects suggestions to see them as somehow the same.')
