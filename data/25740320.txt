Government journalists (the equivalent of prosecutors). Not getting any explicit special protection, but that&#x27;s not the point. Your job is to present government&#x27;s position and actions.<p>2. Anti-government journalists (the equivalent of advocates). Those would get explicit special protection. You could only be one as long as you&#x27;re not taking government money. You would be obliged to control the government.<p>They should have completely different job titles.')
