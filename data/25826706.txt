I think you&#x27;re pointing out that the estimate would help you decide when you need to start so you are done before the &quot;real life events that needs the thing&quot;.<p>Is that correct?<p>Like for example I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s useful to learn that no, you will not be ready for the Christmas event. Or no the cruise ship will not be ready in time. But it might be useful to know: &quot;If I want to be ready for the Christmas event when should I get started and how many developers do I need?&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a good example I guess, though I haven&#x27;t seen this issue arise very often in software. I could imagine someone needing to know when to start feature freeze and prep work for scaling up leading up to a big sale event if you run an online store for example.<p>My take on this is that asking devs to guess that time would obviously not work. And if you did this type of forecasting for any other discipline, you&#x27;d instead gather historical data about how much time things took in the past and plot that to forecast how much you&#x27;d think it takes in the future. Which is a process that can be done without needing to ask a dev for their personal not data based guesstimate.')
