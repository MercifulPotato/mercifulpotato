Galaxy 2.0 has plugins to import what it can of games&#x2F;achievements&#x2F;play time from as many other vendors as it can and tries to show something of a view of every game across all your major services&#x2F;accounts. Many of those plugins are open source, written in Python, though of course Galaxy 2.0 itself is not itself open source and it is still the primary installer&#x2F;launcher for GOG&#x27;s own service, if you are concerned about vendor control. There&#x27;s a third party export script in Python as well [1], though it is reading JSON and SQLite files directly and not using an official API.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gog.com&#x2F;galaxy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gog.com&#x2F;galaxy</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AB1908&#x2F;GOG-Galaxy-Export-Script" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AB1908&#x2F;GOG-Galaxy-Export-Script</a>')
