I&#x27;d consider myself to have a decent resume for an undergraduate. I&#x27;ve interned at a &quot;big N&quot; so to speak, I&#x27;ve done side projects that are relevant in my field of interest and I&#x27;d consider myself to have amassed some domain specific knowledge. Yet my resume gets random rejected&#x2F;ghosted from a remarkable amount of places. It&#x27;s especially bad when I don&#x27;t fit neatly into a category for recruiting. So many places wouldn&#x27;t hire me because apparently &quot;I want to work during COVID cause online school sucks&quot; is too confusing.')
