For things like caches the reduction in delay caused by adding another layer is significant.  AMD had to increase latency of the L3 cache in Zen 3 by 7 cycles as a trade-off for the increased size.  If they were able to stack SRAM with another layer of transistors placed vertically, that latency penalty could be reduced.')
