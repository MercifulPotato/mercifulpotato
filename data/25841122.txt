I was in my early 20s and someone I knew from the pub had a mum who was a curator. She asked her son if he knew anyone because &quot;web developer&quot; was a fairly uncommon skill!<p>I eventually got crowded out by a proper agency but I&#x27;ve still got clients in the culture sector that I got from word of mouth from that. My company is still doing stuff as a direct result of that contact.<p>(I&#x27;m 49 so do the maths yourself)')
