The answer is to truncate, not rewrite. However, truncation isn&#x27;t always natural. One shouldn&#x27;t start abbreviating words, for example, that don&#x27;t normally get abbreviated.<p>In cases where there isn&#x27;t a natural way to truncate, a better option is to look at the HTML doc title, a subtitle, a heading, or sometimes even a photo caption, that say accurately and neutrally what the article is about. There&#x27;s often also a sentence in the opening paragraph that can be used. Sometimes none of those exists, but you can find a representative phrase lurking in the article body. The key is that it be representative though, not cherry-picked. There&#x27;s a bit of interpretation involved there, but you can nearly always pick out the general-overview phrase if one exists. They have a distinctive quality.<p>Rewriting should only be a last resort. When we edit titles, we always try to use representative language from the article and rather than to make up language ourselves.')
