You&#x27;ll feel like you need to spend hours in the kitchen preparing elaborate food that&#x27;s optimized for looking good in photographs rather than tasting good. Your kids&#x27; memories of the holidays will be dominated by all the time you spent trying to assemble overly fiddly and elaborate homemade decorations and whatnot, rather than the time you spent letting them get themselves transform perfectly good cookies into horrible dribbly icing covered messes, and have a great time doing it. You&#x27;ll worry that the only good vacation is an expensive vacation. And so on and so forth.<p>Which. . . I shouldn&#x27;t be so negative. Plenty of people enjoy fancy elaborate things, and love to talk about what they&#x27;re doing and share it with others. And that&#x27;s great. But it&#x27;s really easy to look at the Internet and get the impression that what everyone is snapping photos of for Instagram is an accurate cross-section of what people are typically doing, and develop a serious case of FOMO anxiety.')
