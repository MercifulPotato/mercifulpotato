You migh thave N projects where a few want contributions and a few don&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t want several sites to manage them.<p>2. The code part of github (a git tree on a webpage) isn&#x27;t even the key functionality. It&#x27;s PR&#x27;s, CI. You may accept feature requests and bug requests but still not want PR&#x27;s.<p>3. Having collaborative development with a small team of e.g. 2 people means <i>internal</i> pull requests, reviews, discussions etc are important (and could still be useful to see or contribute to by external users), so taking away PR&#x27;s  isn&#x27;t the same as going under ground with the project.<p>4. GitHub is a well known site, people will find your project there.')
