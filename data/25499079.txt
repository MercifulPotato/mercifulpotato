Like, there is not even a place to show a delay on the station signage usually!<p>With Czech trains its very rare if it arrives on time, often the platform is only reported a couple minutes before arrival and might change if the delay is too long. Then the train arrives at random part of the platform and people trying to get in or out fan out around the carriage doors. Once you climb on board up a couple steps from the platform to the train, you can expect more delay to be accumulated as you travel. Also the toilets on the stations might often be an &quot;xperience&quot;.')
