Even if you believe the president was entirely uninvolved and unaware, the purpose of the insurrection was to <i>keep</i> a leader in power, not remove one. The actions of tech companies are both a <i>challenge</i> to the supremacy of the (current administration of the) state and a way of enforcing the supremacy of the state.')
