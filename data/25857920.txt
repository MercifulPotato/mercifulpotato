Imagine walking into a funeral for someone who has died from the Therac-25 and you start talking about poor UI design, cultures where people don&#x27;t stop to fix problems, and hardware interlocks. It would be pretty poor timing and people would get upset at you making excuses for incompetent doctors and greedy hospitals.<p>Now imagine that the entire sphere of public discourse is that funeral.<p>Symbol-focused people see risk assessment and systems-thinking as signs that someone is disloyal to the cause of dismantling systemic racism.')
