Loved Mob Psycho 100 from the same creator, though.<p>I did try Hunter x Hunter last year - I gave up precisely because I felt like I&#x27;ve seen everything 100 times already.<p>I guess I should just take the uncle commentor&#x27;s advice and stop trying to watch this class of shows if they aren&#x27;t rewarding.<p>OTOH I really did enjoy Yakusoku no Neverland and Decadance in the past year, so I guess there&#x27;s always something.')
