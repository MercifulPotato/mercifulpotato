I think this depends on the price difference between a flight with a Boeing and any other plane. Almost everybody has heard from the issues with Boeing, and if they can spend a few $ more to &quot;feel safe&quot;, quite a few will do so I suppose. And with the already very small margins in the large-volume-budget-price segment, it&#x27;ll be hard to reduce prices even more to counter that effect.<p>As soon as Boeing stays out of news for some period of time or if another airliner brand has a significant, newsworthy accident it will be forgotten though, I&#x27;d guess.')
