But couldn&#x27;t the first ball be any ball? That doesn&#x27;t really matter. So wouldn&#x27;t it just be 1&#x2F;50^5 for 6 balls?<p>And wouldn&#x27;t the odds really be: p = (1&#x2F;49 * 1&#x2F;48 * 1&#x2F;47 * 1&#x2F;46 * 1&#x2F;45) for the balls to be drawn in order in one lottery?<p>The odds for them not to be drawn in order are then: 1 - p.<p>If there are 1000 lotteries per day, the odds it doesn&#x27;t happen in a year are: ynp = (1-p)^(365 * 1000).<p>The yearly probability would be: 1-ynp.<p>If the balls can be drawn in any order, but they have to end as 6 ascending balls - then I think the probability is much higher, right?')
