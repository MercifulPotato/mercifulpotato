Normally the reporting of a security vulnerability includes a POC of an exploit. There isn’t one here, because hackers haven’t been able to exploit it. If an activist saw this story, got scared of WhatsApp, and decided to use SMS or Telegram instead (especially if they didn’t use the opt-in secret chats feature, which most people don’t), their security got weaker.')
