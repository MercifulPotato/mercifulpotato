That echoes what BYD in China has been saying recently.[1] Lithium-iron isn&#x27;t a new technology. It was popular for industrial power tools for a while.  It is safer than lithium phosphate, not being prone to thermal runaway, but has less energy density. BYD has been able to get the energy density per unit volume up, but energy density per unit weight is still lower than lithium phosphate.<p>The article also suggests that Apple would have a &quot;manufacturing partner&quot;. After all, iPhones are made by Foxconn. So this may just be Apple selling BYD cars outside China. BYD sells more electric cars than anyone else, including Tesla, but has been having trouble getting into the US market. Apple can help with the marketing end.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dIt5z4wT9RE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dIt5z4wT9RE</a>')
