Because, unfortunately, a lot of people don&#x27;t read beyond the title, and that only helps to perpetuate the anti-k8s&#x2F;Istio&#x2F;devops sentiment that has become so popular and pervasive lately.<p>Are there a lot of situations where a service mesh complicates things and causes more problems than it&#x27;s worth?
