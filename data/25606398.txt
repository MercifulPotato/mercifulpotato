I already rock climb and ski a little bit.  I am hoping to learn to lead easy ice climbs and get into the backcountry to ski this winter, including some overnight trips.  We got out today, booted up a snowy canyon... only to find no ice.  Oh well, that is the process: we just keep going out and doing progressively more difficult goals, and try not to get killed in a slide or a fall.<p>Also, my company has hired someone to work directly under me, so I hope to learn to be a competent manager, which I&#x27;ve never done in a formal situation.  I&#x27;ve been reading a lot and reflecting on my own experiences, and have been documenting our processes.  I will have a plan to onboard the new person soon.<p>Finally, if the covid situation eases up later in the year, I hope to return to performing music.  I&#x27;ve been in a lot of bands and performed solo, or even one-off gigs with other musicians, but I hope to be able to build a band that a) I am fronting for &gt; 80% of the material and b) brings in some income beyond what it takes to operate.  That part of the business has its own set of learning curves, at least as far as I can tell from my years as a semi-professional side guy.  The plan there is to start as a solo performer and gradually add other musicians, using low-rent bar gigs as rehearsals, but I am not sure how that will work out.')
