Item(by='sensanaty', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605440387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25079434, text='Razer laptops come with the latest and greatest in terms of GPU&#x2F;CPUs, plus they usually feature things like high-refresh displays, full RGB keyboards etc. They&#x27;re still overpriced, mind you - since you can find comparable laptops for literally half the price - but at least they have the powerful hardware in them to somewhat justify their steep pricing. Similarly to Apple though, their pricetags are heavily inflated by the Razer branding.<p>Can&#x27;t comment on the Surface, never looked into them much.')
