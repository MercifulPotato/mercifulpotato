Rarely does Amazon have the best price anymore.<p>For me, I found this not to be true. I&#x27;ve been ordering gifts for people fleeing the company I work due to a merger and the changes, so there has been a lot. Literally everything I found on niche sites I found on Amazon for cheaper and at a faster delivery rate aswell.')
