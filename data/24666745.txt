[...] How do we avoid this?<p>Hold really is awful. And it&#x27;s gotten so much worse during covid. Re how do we avoid this: for starters, there should be laws against companies putting people on hold without providing a callback option. As far as I can tell there&#x27;s no reason not to offer a callback option except to screw over your customers who aren&#x27;t willing to wait on the phone and listen to their awful hold music for an hour straight to save some money on customer support and prevent your unwilling customers from cancelling. (BTW while we&#x27;re at it, there should also be laws allowing anyone to cancel a subscription service online. California partially does this by requiring an online cancellation option when the subscription was started online.)')
