While I largely agree with you in that most people state-side haven&#x27;t heard of it happening here, that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t subconsciously exist.<p>The main thing I think the article got wrong is this:<p>&gt; they&#x27;re often clever attempts to find out something very specific<p>I don&#x27;t think they are &quot;clever&quot; attempts. People aren&#x27;t that clever, in general. It&#x27;s very possible that people are just used to asking these very normal questions out of habit (e.g. &quot;are you vegetarian&quot; is a perfectly normal question to ask before going to lunch with someone, to factor that in your suggestions of places to eat). It&#x27;s just that they <i>may</i> be subconsciously deriving further biases based on the answers instead of taking the answers at face value. If, for example, someone not being vegetarian was originally just a benign question to go out to lunch together, but later subconsciously causes the manager to not give them that promotion, that would be discrimination, and I can&#x27;t say for sure that <i>that</i> doesn&#x27;t happen.')
