Item(by='kristopolous', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609768110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25629404, text='The jokes fall flat because it&#x27;s no longer taboo, it feels derivative even if it was original, and the context is gone.<p>This is why Bob Hope is lame to us. He may have popularized the &quot;tight 5&quot; standup format but everyone copied him and many do it better.<p>This is also why Amos &amp; Andy is just a fairly uninteresting half hour of blackface racism or why Mr Yunioshi in breakfast at tiffany&#x27;s just looks stupid now. Sure these are racist but when you look past that, they&#x27;re also not funny any more.<p>They&#x27;re pointing at some, bringing focus to it, but it has no more symbolic resonance.<p>It&#x27;s also why if someone made say mrs doubtfire today it&#x27;d look like an outdated flop.<p>There&#x27;s a societal context that gave these things a dynamic which no longer exists.<p>It&#x27;s actually the same reason Monica lewinsky and draft card jokes wouldn&#x27;t work today. There&#x27;s no longer a supportive scaffolding to give it the context.<p>Race and sex based comedy can still be done, it just needs to live in the 2021 context.<p>It&#x27;s still racist and sexist, which are both morally objectionable, but unlike this site, it could probably still also be funny.<p>For instance, you could do a black Mr. Magoo who gets treated with constant dangerous racial prejudice but in the magoo character, always assumes good intentions and miraculously survives everything. Runs into klansman, thinks it&#x27;s a costume party, etc..<p>You might also be able to pull off the 3s company dynamic (in the original, straight guy needed to convince everyone he was gay so the premise was &quot;straight man in the closet&quot;) but using a different spectrum that&#x27;s more relevant to today&#x27;s conflicts.')
