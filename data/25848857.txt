It is in the form factor of a traditional rangefinder, with great ergonomic controls, and even at &quot;only&quot; a micro-4&#x2F;3 lens still destroy even the best smartphone, while still fitting in my pocket with a prime.<p>The only thing that might replace it are some of these mirrorless full frame cameras being produced at reasonable prices (&lt;$1K). They won&#x27;t be as good at travel as m43 (due to lens size&#x2F;weight if nothing else), but give you more photographic tools.<p>I&#x27;d never go non-mirrorless again, the Viewfinder is a second class citizen in mirrored&#x2F;SLRs, lacking useful features like focus peaking, realtime histograms, preview of color modes, but most importantly requiring you to take your eye off of the Viewfinder to review your last shot (as opposed to being a one-stop-shop screen for everything).')
