Really an amazing opensource browser! \nThe only extension necessary for me was adblocking and now it&#x27;s even better!<p>I did&#x2F;continue to have issues with qt-webengine though, like 144hz monitor with qt webengine is limited to 60hz but these things are unrelated to qutebrowser.\nIn fact most of my &quot;bugs&quot; can be related to upstream qt webengine and wayland support. I feel bad for the authors of qutebrowser for so often getting issues that is actually an upstream bug in qt. It doesn&#x27;t help that qt webengine work is rather slow (imo)<p>There&#x27;s magic about pressing &quot;o&quot; and typing in what you want to search from history or Google which is so fast and efficient. I have tried similar setups on other browsers but in qutebrowser the search algos are so simple and snappy, it works great. My colleagues sometimes were amazed at how fast I could navigate across the browser all thanks to this great software<p>Thank you qutebrowser!')
