It&#x27;s a bit weird (when you look into the mirror, light from the sun reaches you instantaneously, &#x27;slowly&#x27; moves towards the mirror, and then jumps back to your retina instantaneously), but predictions will work out the same. Of course, it&#x27;ll affect more than just travel time of light, you&#x27;ll also mess with anything that inludes a gamma factor, eg making inertia anisotropic (the force you need will depend on the direction you push in).<p>Ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t help the creationists, because things like time passed since the big bang for an observer following the Hubble flow does not depend on such conventions. All you&#x27;ll achive is changing the big bang from an instantaneous thing (which in itself is already a bit of a dicy concept in relativity) that happened everywhere all at one into a continuous thing that started 13.8 billion years ago and has been going on ever since.')
