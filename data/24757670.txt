Don&#x27;t take my word for it, do this test: search something, like the name of someone you know that&#x27;s not famous.  You&#x27;ll find that google will reports tens of thousands (or millions! lol) of results.  But click through 10 or 15 pages.  You&#x27;ll soon find that many of the pages have almost nothing at all to do with what you searched (and may not even contain any word from the phrase!), but that if you get far enough, maybe 300 results or so in, you&#x27;ll see that when google runs out of results it will magically just update to show the real number, which is often just a few dozen for a search like the one I described.')
