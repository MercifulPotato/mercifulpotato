However, you can indeed buy devices with no OS and load Linux (even Linux Certified devices from major OEMs), and even better you can buy a device from a Linux-first&#x2F;Linux-only vendor like System 76, Think Penguin, Star Labs, etc.<p>If Linux isn&#x27;t your cup, OpenBSD is a strong contender for truly owning your equipment at the software level, as it is open source and well documented, with security as a major goal. Thinkpads and enterprise-class workstations fare best, but it also works great on older Macs.')
