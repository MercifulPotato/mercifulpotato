After having used Linux full-time in private and at work for the past 13 years, I had to switch to Windows 10 at my new job. I miss the hell out of my shell, my .zshrc file, and the general &quot;easy&quot; customization of Linux, but I&#x27;ll be more than happy to see how I&#x27;ll better adapt to Windows 10 thanks to this list and the tools provided in the comments here.<p>Edit: First thing I&#x27;ll install is most probably the Windows Subsystem for Linux :)')
