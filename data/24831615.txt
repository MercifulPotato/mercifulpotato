This is sufficient to justify the use of the squeeze theorem here, although you are correct that the axiomatization of geometry is quite subtle.<p>I did not give much thought to the definition of the trigonometric functions while writing this because I assumed this theory is usually fully developed before we begin complex analysis (but is it?).')
