That&#x27;s in &quot;millions of national currency units&quot; (except in Japan which is in &quot;hundred millions of national currency units&quot;) so the Japan bar is in 100M JPY, the Europe bar is in 1M EUR, and the US bar is in 1M USD. It was clearly not meant for comparison against regions, just over time.<p>2. Not only is the currency inconsistent the values weren&#x27;t adjusted for purchasing power parity, i.e. how far a national currency unit goes in that country relatively.<p>If we convert the values to USD adjust for PPP the picture changes completely. All values in USD, PPP adjusted:<p>2016 - USA: $52.4B<p>2016 - Europe: $46.16B (PPP factor 1.225, EUR:USD factor 1.11)<p>This is about a 13% delta, not the seemingly 53% delta represented on the chart. Also, this is limited to EFPIA member companies.')
