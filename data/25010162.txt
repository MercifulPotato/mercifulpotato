Maybe Elixir even took inspiration (or it&#x27;s just a plain good idea). I&#x27;m really surprised that I had never heard of or encountered it, maybe it&#x27;s just an accepted part of the ecosystem so no one talks about it and&#x2F;or I assumed everything was written manually. Also haven&#x27;t used Python professionally which doesn&#x27;t help.')
