Anonymized identifiers can be deanonymized. They should utilize zero-knowledge proofs in such a way that they can prove &quot;yes, I have an identity verified by entity X (and Y and Z) (based on passport&#x2F;phone number&#x2F;...)&quot;, without disclosing any of those details.<p>It could, optionally, yield an identifier unique to each requester and unlinkable to others unless an explicit proof of the link is provided. Though if this is included, there has to be some mechanism to avoid huge ad networks sharing the same &quot;requester entity&quot;.<p>This is a solved problem. All that&#x27;s left is politics, implementation and alignment.')
