Your average joe isn&#x27;t going to think too hard about how they work, and they also lack the skills to assess it themselves.<p>It&#x27;s not a problem without prior art though, and other industries have had to find solutions such as certifications, regulatory bodies etc. Think of medicine, food, vehicle saftey standards and the like. I&#x27;m not an electrical engineer but I can trust my fridge to draw what it says it will, because I know it&#x27;s been through the regulatory processes to get to market and be stickered with the 4 star energy rating.<p>I think at this point we might need a privacy and ethics regulator for technology, with a certification program.')
