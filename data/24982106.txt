ES classes predate react significantly IIRC. React may have been the first &#x27;popular&#x27; library that made use of them extensively, but I don&#x27;t think facebook should get credit for this one<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no reason why JSX had to be included at the same time with React<p>Without jsx, the value of react code is _much much_ lower IMO. I don&#x27;t think it had any chance of catching on without it.<p>&gt;Some people even throw Redux at the junior programmer at the same time.<p>Definitely agree that that is a mistake, but it also seems to be a mistake that people are long past. Not many people advocate redux these days, which I find unfortunate given how good redux toolkit makes it. That said, even without redux toolkit, it&#x27;s definitely not something to throw at junior developers in their first week<p>...maybe week 3.')
