Since my wife is Chinese herself, and I&#x27;ve been learning Chinese for quite a while. Most couples around me have tried and failed to learn each other&#x27;s language as well since they expect each other to be their sole on-demand language teacher.<p>For me, I think it works if I do mostly self-study with Anki. We schedule a certain time of day for like 5 or 10 minutes where I&#x27;m just running through my flashcards and my wife can correct me or clarify things.
