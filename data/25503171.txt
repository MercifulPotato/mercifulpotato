Outside of the main target demographic, you&#x27;re not going to get a lot of familiarity with anything but the very largest show.<p>In the US, how many current animated shows can you name? I can name a decent fraction of cartoons from the late 90s, but am completely unable to name anything since then--at least until I got a nephew and am now getting acquainted with the relevant demographic shows. That&#x27;s a 20 year gap in shows.<p>Compare other media. How many classical composers can you name? I doubt many people, even erudite people, could push well beyond the basic frontier of Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart. Recognition of well-known tunes (such as Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon, whose name my spellchecker doesn&#x27;t appear to recognize) is going to far exceed their name, let alone the composer&#x27;s name.<p>The most recognizable anime to a layperson in Japan is likely to be the big mega-blockbusters of various eras. I&#x27;d be more shocked if you said that no one had heard of Mobile Suit Gundam, Dragonball, Naruto, or Attack on Titan [which one they&#x27;d pick up on depends on their age] than any of the shows you&#x27;ve mentioned. Hell, the only thing you listed that I&#x27;d think people in the US with a passing familiarity with anime <i>might</i> know would be Cowboy Bebop.')
