CNN has to fill 24 hrs of TV and has less budget to do it then a network has for the half hour evening broadcast.<p>That means as little flying to flyover states as possible, never leave WDC or Atlanta,  certainly dont send Anderson Cooper to Egypt where he could get beat up by government thugs.<p>Thus its a lot easier to make the news about yourself;  reminds me of the ESPN morning SportsCenter from years ago -- when they ran out of sports lowlights the anchors would get caught abusing people on tape.')
