Item(by='pa7x1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603439853, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866804, text='JSONSchema has a date, time and date-time format in its latest versions.<p>The rationale for not including comments in a data exchange format is that they tend to be used for parsing and processing meta information which breaks the purpose of the data exchange format in the first place.<p>I don&#x27;t know where the obsession to use the same file format for everything comes from, the lack of comment support in JSON makes it a bad configuration file format. That&#x27;s OK, don&#x27;t use it. We have .ini and TOML (and YAML if you like it rough), why not use those that are a better fit for purpose?')
