Item(by='read_if_gay_', descendants=None, kids=[25129749, 25129914], score=None, time=1605628248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25124800, text='&gt; Apple markets this as a &quot;Pro&quot; device for professional video editing. That&#x27;s why I believe it is fair to take their word and compare it against my other options for a professional video editing rig.<p>That&#x27;s ridiculous. Threadripper has 8 to 16 times as many cores, runs on hundreds of watts of power and such a CPU alone costs the same as several Mac Minis. Them claiming you <i>can</i> use it for video editing doesn&#x27;t mean you can expect that a 1.5 pound notebook will measure up to literally the biggest baddest computer you can buy.')
