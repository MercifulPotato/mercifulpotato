People come, people go, some people stay. In my opinion some of the most interesting work (including but not exclusively in tech) is going to happen in the next few years in the Bay Area precisely because of the opportunities and breathing space this outflow of people (and perhaps eventually money) is going to open up.<p>I lived in the Bay Area for 20 years, including college and 2-3 tech booms (depending how you count). From what I saw, there is always some portion of local people (like the angry anti-skyscraper guy in this article) that is too xenophobic and anti change, just as there is always some portion of newcomers that is too transactional, extractive, and ready to skip town when the going gets tough. Both postures are perfectly defensible; it&#x27;s tough living in a place where rents are as unpredictable as they can be in the Bay Area, and tech leaders have not historically shown (IMO) enough commitment to the community and tax base, meanwhile those who move to the Bay Area for work are under no obligation to like it and stay, even if their complaints (about rent control, regulation, &quot;dirty&quot; streets, etc) are totally cliched.<p>Somewhere out there in the city some bleary eyed veteran of the scene is negotiating a tiny, bargain sublet for a few desks and a slice of a server closet in SoMA and will release something quietly revolutionary in the next year or so that in five years will be the next big thing. Or maybe it will be a cheery eyed newcomer leasing factory time in Hayward for a hardware thing, or someone testing robots in a warehouse in West Oakland, or whatever. Right now is one of the times when things get interesting.')
