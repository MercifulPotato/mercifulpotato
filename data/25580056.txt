Here’s a review about autoimmunity in COVID-19: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0896841120301281#sectitle0075" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S089684112...</a><p>&gt; There is a study[0] showing cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and other human tissues, thus predisposing the host to autoimmune diseases. This should apply even more so to any vaccine since vaccines produce a more robust immune response.<p>Since the antibody tested in the study was a commercial, monoclonal one, this is somewhat hard to assess. But I think you’re right given what they found in the blood tests.<p>&gt; This does not really shine a light on pre-disposition to an autoimmune disease 6-9-12 mo down the road.<p>Autoimmune reactions should happen in the short run, right?')
