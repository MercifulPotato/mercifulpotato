Also the shape and timing of the Swedish infections is very similar to other european countries, suggesting the peak was due to the natural evolution of the epidemic rather than lockdowns.<p>I don’t think this data is compatible with lockdowns being effective, which should be a key issue given all the consequences of lockdowns.')
