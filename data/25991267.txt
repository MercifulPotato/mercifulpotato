But it doesn&#x27;t have any official users library, and ideally a framework should have that available.<p>I&#x27;ve started looking outside of the Python ecosystem since it feels like there&#x27;s nothing new and exciting come out of there. I&#x27;ve played around a bit with NestJS and it&#x27;s amazing how far the TypeScript ecosystem has come.<p>It&#x27;s also crazy that SQLAlchemy doesn&#x27;t have typing support still, so TypeORM looks really appealing.')
