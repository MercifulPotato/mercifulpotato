Plus, &quot;200&quot; is in there so come on.<p>Atlantis was a very different show in a lot of ways, more Star-Trek-y than SG-1 but it worked, and Picardo got to be part of the main cast for a season which was pretty great.<p>Universe had maybe 3 good episodes in its entire run and suffered terribly from what I call &quot;Lost Syndrom&quot;[0]. It started to come together at the end, there&#x27;s even a point where some competent writer comes in and hand-waves away some of the stupider plot ideas as &quot;it was all a dream&quot;, but overall it was pretty disastrous I think.<p>[0] The writers pretend there is some master plan that will make all the mysterious dangling plot threads come together eventually but really they&#x27;re just making up crazy bullshit as they go.')
