Short answer: if DNSSEC is implemented strictly, it seemingly gets you most of the way there. Not clear if a configuration change or update to the protocol could completely mitigate the attack.<p>BTW, there are nearly 13 million DNSSEC signed zones; the trend is certainly up [2].<p><i>Does DNSSEC mitigate the attack?</i><p><i>Yes and no, the server must implement strict DNSSEC check   (i.e., refuse the responses that break the trust chain) to prevent the off-path attacks.
