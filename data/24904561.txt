Yet when I call various doctors offices to schedule a routine procedure such as an ultrasound or a physical or X-ray, they all tell me to sign a blank check.<p>I can figure out how much I need to charge to develop real estate, but a doctor can’t tell me how much (or what codes they are going to bill) for a physical?  And if you so happen to start talking about something, you might be charged a different charge code that costs you hundreds extra?')
