My goal for this year was to read 75 books, and I think I&#x27;m at 33 or 34 right now. The main one that has stood out to me so far was <i>The Universe Speaks In Numbers</i> by Graham Farmelo. Explaining why this book stood out to me would take a lot of words, and I plan to write a blog post on it at some point. But briefly, it comes down to it getting me excited about math again.<p>And as something of a counter-point to that book, I also read <i>Lost in Math</i> by Sabine Hossenfelder, which was also very good.<p>Others that were definitely worth reading:<p><i>Analogy Making As Perception</i> by Melanie Mitchell<p><i>Society of Mind</i> by Marvin Minsky (re-read)<p><i>Engineering General Intelligence, Part 1</i> by Ben Goertzel<p><i>The AGI Revolution</i> by Ben Goertzel<p>And on a lighter note, some fun - if bizarre - cyberpunk styled novels I read were <i>Necrotech</i> and <i>Nanoshock</i> by K.C.
