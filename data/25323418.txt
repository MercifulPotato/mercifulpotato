I currently work in a small college town doing something I love (teaching CS in a private school) and live in the nearby countryside.<p>My school runs its IT department like it’s the 1990s from buildings constructed in the 1890s.  That should give a frame of reference as to the progressiveness and pace of change I can reasonably expect.  It’s salaried but I treat the job like a contracting gig: I provide my own equipment and network connection.  It helps me sleep at night.')
