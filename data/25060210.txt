Of course, the universe is a giant quantum computer. This leads to the idea that even if life is very unlikely, it can still develop since there are so many &quot;attempts&quot;. It also means that life can develop many times, but in different attempts. By this I mean different parallel attempts, such that whatever happens in one of these attempts is not accessible to what happens in another attempt.<p>I also think life is very rare, and I am in fact of the opinion we won&#x27;t find any other instance of it.')
