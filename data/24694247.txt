That&#x27;s not an easy question to answer.<p>The benefits of demonstrated effect are balanced with those you describe of the experience-based approach.<p>It&#x27;s a gray area.<p>You just can&#x27;t AI-away an ER doc (at least not with current tech). Something&#x27;s got to interview, intubate, suture, palpate, and prescribe all those bleeding, festering, diabetic masses flowing into the ER like the tide of the Thames.
