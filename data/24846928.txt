They get over $400 million revenue per year, much of it from Google. They&#x27;re part of the problem. They&#x27;re gatekeepers.<p>Also, their funding initiatives to change the web are total BS. They don&#x27;t want to change anything. They will only fund projects that reinforce the established order and help to lock out the competition. They like things just as they are.
