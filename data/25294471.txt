But I always wondered about my former employer, who included the normal postings and the postings for H1Bs in the same places, but it was kinda clear which was which. Same hiring manager for all postings no matter the team, and a  much vaguer job description. Like a type of role and some technologies to be experienced with instead of “you will work on team A who makes product B.” Probably on the legal side of the line, but I never would have applied for one of the jobs that wasn’t “for” me, why apply for generic Sr SW position when another job you could tell what team it was and talk to people on it.')
