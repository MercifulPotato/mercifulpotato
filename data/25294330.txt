I&#x27;m mostly a lurker<p>I have a network I maintain of 18+ 1gbps, 32GB DDR4, 8 core xeons, with DDoS protection up to 100gbps, spread across the globe (LA, Denver, NY, TX, FL, Atlanta, Amsterdam, London) and many other places.<p>The project I was working on got halted. I was wondering what are some cool things I could set up with a network like this especially behind cloudflare? Any suggestions on running fun stuff for communities? I just want to give back. But of course if you guys have some million dollar ideas I&#x27;d like to hear it.<p>I&#x27;m burned out from computing lately and just can&#x27;t come up with anything.<p>Thanks again!')
