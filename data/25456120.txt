Several sibling comments to this one think you&#x27;re trying to make some kind of argument for draconian &quot;IP&quot; measures. You&#x27;ve made a comment to the effect that you&#x27;re not (and I didn&#x27;t read your parent comment that way) but I think it&#x27;s worth me pointing our your intention explicitly.<p>Jack Valenti had particularly repugnant beliefs in that he stated that copyright should be infinite. (I don&#x27;t have the exact quote, but it was something like &quot;1 day less than forever...&quot;)  Those kinds of beliefs show an incredible blindness to the reality that art and culture are fundamentally built upon transforming older works. There are no new stories under the sun.')
