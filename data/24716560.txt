We don&#x27;t know how to design a plane flying efficiently (and thus achieving a good range, and the range is already an issue for supersonics) in both modes, subsonic and supersonic (well, we do have B-1 and Tu-160 though that is well beyond commercial reach and i&#x27;d say those planes more like illustrate the issue than showcase the solution). Concorde for example was using afterburner to get to supersonic mode as quickly as possible, and while afterburner is very inefficient, such approach was overall still most efficient for Concorde because the plane  was designed for the supersonic mode.')
