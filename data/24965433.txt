Like, here are the basic things that hooks can do:<p>1. Tell the component to re-render<p>2. Store an object that persists between component renders<p>3. Run something after the component has been rendered<p>4. Run something when the component unmounts<p>React doesn&#x27;t give you functions that do these operations individually. Instead, you get weird hybrids like useState, which combines storing a value with telling the component to rerender when the value changes. So you sometimes have to jump through hoops to get the behavior you want. (Well, useRef sort of does (2), except it constructs the object itself.)')
