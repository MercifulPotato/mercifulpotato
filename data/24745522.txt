Why?<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure now that you are a native English speaker. I am not and I do complain. But if one only knows one language then I can only quote Lutwid Wittgenstein: &quot;The limits of my language mean the limits of my world&quot;. (he refers to thoughts)<p>&gt; If you can see validity in literate programming than basically my variable naming is a tiny tiny step in that direction.<p>No need for that, because history has shown that people like English keywords, but that&#x27;s about it. Just look at SQL - many people complain about the verbose syntax, which comes from trying to make it read like English &quot;for business people&quot; (who don&#x27;t use it anyways).\nCheck discussion here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24730713" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24730713</a><p>But SQL is not a general purpose programming language - let&#x27;s look at one of these: COBOL. It is literally what you want: programs look like text, which comes from trying to make it read like English &quot;for business people&quot; (who don&#x27;t use it anyways). And guess what? No one who actually uses it really likes the syntax.<p>Maybe you should start with Mathematicians and ask them to stop naming their variables &quot;x&quot; or &quot;f&quot; and use English instead of symbols. How about that? :)')
