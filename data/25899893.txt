I&#x27;ve never played with it myself but my understanding is that this would be sufficient to provide drivers in one&#x27;s own kernel, given enough plumbing and shims and such.<p>(With enough shims one could borrow drivers from any kernel -- see ndiswrapper to use Windows network-card drivers in Linux -- but the rump kernel scaffolding is supposed to make it easier.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.netbsd.org&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;justin&#x2F;2015_AsiaBSDCon&#x2F;justincormack-abc2015.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.netbsd.org&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;justin&#x2F;2015_Asi...</a>')
