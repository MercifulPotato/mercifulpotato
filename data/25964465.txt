Some kind of generic not-Conservative vote? People vote <i>for</i> other parties - they aren&#x27;t split among a vote <i>not for</i> the Conservatives.<p>If it really were simple vote splitting then coalitions would form, and they don&#x27;t - because the other parties aren&#x27;t a simple platform of not-Conservative and they disagree with each other as much as they disagree with the Conservatives. In fact one of the only two parties to successfully coalesce <i>was</i> the Conservatives!<p>As a concrete example - the second choice in most parts of Scotland isn&#x27;t Labour, it&#x27;s Conservative. Are the Conservatives and Labour splitting the not-SNP vote? If you think that then is any party that stands except the ruling party a vote splitter? Seems a silly definition to me.<p>&gt; Well, try 51% for a start.<p>An absolute popular majority? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s realistic and it would be extremely unhealthy if that was the case.')
