Video game sales are driven <i>heavily</i> by screenshots, trailers, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Play&quot; videos. Graphics and physics look good in those media, actual personal fun experiences less so.<p>There&#x27;s probably some higher level business principle here that products end up designed to optimize for the property that most heavily constrains sales instead of the properties that maximize customer satisfaction.<p>See also: Hollywood movies, book covers, synthesizer presets, house flippers, car interior widgets, etc.')
