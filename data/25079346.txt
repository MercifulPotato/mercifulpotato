With DRM my options are:<p>- Pay $20 for a copy that I can&#x27;t play on all of my devices, and that I may be unable to play at some point in the future if the producer decides they don&#x27;t want me to anymore.<p>- Pay $10&#x2F;month for a streaming service that won&#x27;t allow me to watch at full resolution on several of my devices, and has no guarantee that the content I want will continue to be available.<p>- Not consume the media at all.<p>- Download it from a shady pirate site, but then assuming it actually is what I think it is (which is questionable) be able to use it however I want.<p>No good options.')
