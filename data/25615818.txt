This has to be created over time and there are few shortcuts.<p>In addition, for each experiment you need: a defined time window, up front criteria by which to judge the results,  optionally form solution ideas together, give all teams the same amount of time and opportunity, after the experiment is finished each team presents their solution in a fact based manner in perspective of the criteria. After this the teams rotate and see what they can improve on their original solution with the remarks and information from the other tracks. After this decide together or with an informed captain which solution to continue. After this there should be no hard feelings, no personal consequences. Each team should be treated equally because they all contributed to the end goal. This is what will give you a fair competition <i>and</i> help create team safety.<p>This can be done on all kind of levels, between one day for something small and two&#x2F;four weeks for the bigger challenges. Making it bigger than this will incur a lot of stakes&#x2F;vested interest.')
