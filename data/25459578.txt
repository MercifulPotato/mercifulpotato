Item(by='madjam002', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608234730, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25457724, text='IANAL, but my understanding is that you might still need a consent box even if you use Plausible.<p>I&#x27;ve only skimmed over the docs, but it looks like they derive a unique identifier from the IP address and user agent which changes every day. IP addresses still count as Personally Identifiable Information under GDPR, so deriving an identifier from this for a use case such as analytics would likely require consent. This is speculation though so I&#x27;d be interested to hear what others think.<p>If it is critical to the operation of the website (functionality like storing saved items in a shopping cart, or security), then you wouldn&#x27;t need consent.<p>In reality though, Plausible looks great and using it is a huge improvement over Google Analytics for privacy.')
