Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611167274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25844854, text='It sounds like you&#x27;re using &quot;inlining&quot; to mean &quot;stack-allocating the closure&quot;, but when I think of &quot;inlining&quot; I think of &quot;expanding a function body into its call sites to elide function-call overhead&quot;. Maybe there&#x27;s an implicit relationship between the two that I&#x27;m not understanding? I guess in order to stack allocate a closure you have to generate new function instances for each &quot;type&quot; of closure, and since these types rarely change between call sites we just inline them? Apologies if I&#x27;m just dense.')
