He replied &quot;Did you see the guys around her? If I hired her, we&#x27;d get nothing done around here!&quot; I was appalled.<p>Erm, I actually don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an undue assessment necessarily if the guys really were acting like idiots.  Hiring a female employee into that atmosphere would be suicidal.  And the candidate is lucky she doesn&#x27;t work there.<p>The problem is the VP of Engineering not trying to <i>fix</i> his employees acting like jerks around a female candidate.  Eventually that&#x27;s going to bite the company in the ass.')
