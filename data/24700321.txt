People uttering these things might not even see how damaging these comments are to the groups they target, because they&#x27;ve never met very many of these groups or ever been around someone who would check their behavior. It&#x27;s just a fact of life when you grow up lacking any perspective of another culture, and the national culture encourages you to adopt biases that aren&#x27;t rooted in reality, and you have no personal experiences to disagree with them.<p>People also so kindly forget that the midwest experienced white flight like nowhere else. That sentiment is still in living memory among the older generation.')
