The response to this post has been really great and encouraging. Unfortunately we had to close our general admission bc the response was too much for a zoom call...oops! If you want to stay in touch or interested, but can&#x27;t buy a ticket at this point please check out our google form. Thank you!!\n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;1FAIpQLSdhUEMiZnaWbHAhhioCuB4MotsYf1Mo3NVIEe-FFK0ptYi3Zg&#x2F;viewform?usp=sf_link" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;1FAIpQLSdhUEMiZnaWbHAhhioC...</a><p>------<p>Hey folks, I&#x27;m Vivek! I&#x27;m excited to share my vision for ending the plastic epidemic and The Sustainable CO-OP Store.<p>Our vision is to create an Amazon-like online store, along with a physical location, but only for sustainable friendly products.<p>Instead of building this startup as a traditional investor-backed company, we have decided to create it as a worked-own cooperative. There are many reasons why worker-owned co-ops are amazing. Greater financial equality between all workers, increased business stability, a democratic workplace, community-centric and much more. Still, the thing that I believe is most powerful about a worker-owned co-op is that it&#x27;s mission-driven over financially driven.<p>When we complain about how farms use various chemicals in our food or how social media companies are continually trying to get us to use their apps, it&#x27;s because these companies are under pressure to grow their profits--quarter after quarter, year after year. They have investors who demand growth, which often forces them to compromise their products and services to meet these demands.<p>Worker-owned co-ops generally don&#x27;t have those same pressures because the workers, not the investors, own the business. And because the workers get paid a salary or wages, they aren&#x27;t stressed whether the company grows or not. They instead can focus on whatever they determine is most important, whether that be job security, profitability, the product, or something else.<p>We have our first general meeting tonight, and we&#x27;re looking for folks who are passionate about the environment and may be interested in getting involved (it isn&#x27;t a full-time thing yet). For this idea to succeed, having a few enthusiastic software developers will be essential. If this sounds like you, this meeting will be of interest.<p>I hope to see you tonight! Thank you<p>PS. If you want to learn more clearly about the difference between a startup and a co-op, I made a video on YouTube.
