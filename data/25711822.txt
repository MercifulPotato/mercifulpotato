Tired of wasting time talking around the real issue while they make up fake whataboutisms.<p>Because that&#x27;s what this conversation is about.  A murderous mob sic&#x27;d on Congress by the President because he didn&#x27;t like losing an election.  So again, to all the people defending this action, do you realize what you are defending?<p>And I&#x27;m happy to have this conversation.  Folks want to minimize Trump&#x27;s lies that directly lead to the deaths of 5 people, one of which was a cop beaten to death by his mob, then yes, let&#x27;s have this conversation.')
