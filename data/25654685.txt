I don&#x27;t dislike my job, and I absolute like the people I work with.<p>But earning 800$ a month for the amount of work I do is soul crushing. Life in Mexico is cheaper, but not that much cheaper.<p>At 25, I know I&#x27;m still young, but I also know I could be earning much, much more than that but I haven&#x27;t had any luck with interviews recently.<p>At this point, the only thing I wish for is being able to rent a place on a relatively safe neighborhood without spending 70% of my salary on it.')
