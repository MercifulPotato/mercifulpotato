I find it super boring, don&#x27;t have many active friends there. But I see relatives who use it regularly, for whom Facebook is  quite near to being their complete access to the world, their world.<p>Your poo-poo&#x27;ing dismissal of access to the locked-on standard of sharing life events &amp; baby photos seems so heartless to me. You don&#x27;t seem to be willing to budge, to show an iota of sympathy for people&#x27;s use, any willingness to acknowledge that this monopoly of broadcast human connection (&amp; replies) is such an overwhelming monopoly because it works, because it has suceeded, because it is efficient &amp; useful. It is that way because everyone is there. It&#x27;s won because it came out on top, because metcalf&#x27;s rule is true; the value of a network is (exponentially at first, sigmoiding eventually to 1, a fully connected universe) proportional to the amount of nodes and connections on it.<p>Being denied the ability to not only write but to read too to the world&#x27;s one and only mass human network is unbearably cruel. You should show <i>some</i> sympathy. I agree that life can be pretty good without it, that we can cut loose a lot of the ambient connections we otherwise would never keep. But that ability to connect, to humanize at such a massively larger scale than was possible before is, to me, absolute magical &amp; I love those who do use it well.<p>I just wish it wasn&#x27;t a monopoly, mostly. This connectivity is too vital, too good to be Facebook&#x27;s &amp; Facebook&#x27;s alone.')
