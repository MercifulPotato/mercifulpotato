For the longest time I didn&#x27;t want a contactless card, a little bit out of fear of someone being able to steal just by being close enough but mainly out of &quot;it&#x27;s such a minor convenience it&#x27;s not worth asking the bank for the card&quot;.  Several years go by and the non-contactless card expired, and the new one was contactless, but I still wouldn&#x27;t use it.<p>Then one day I did, and holy shit it&#x27;s the best thing ever, I&#x27;m never using cash again (this was before covid hit which has made contactless mandatory now).<p>I&#x27;m sure there are a few other things in my life like this, i.e. things that I&#x27;m aware of, but making stupid choices about, I&#x27;m just not aware that it&#x27;s a stupid choice.')
