I know a lot of people on the prosumer plans have this too (friends of mine on xfinity don&#x27;t have a lot of speed dips) but I have never been under 75&#x2F;30 (the base of my plan) and my router tests <i>every day</i> so I can have historical reports. I&#x27;m often over 100 down (always 30 up though)<p>The plans tend to be more than the consumer plans, of course, usually by 25-30 dollars, but you do get a little bit more than just no data caps, at least. Its been easier to deal with and I&#x27;ve had it for a few years.<p>I don&#x27;t like Comcast, but this arrangement made dealing with them much less painful. I&#x27;ve actually been impressed with the service levels.<p>When I had xfinity (consumer Comcast, if you will) I had outages, speed dips, all kinds of things. Not since business class.<p>Your mileage may vary, of course. I wish I could switch to a different ISP like Sonic, but alas, my alternative is dialup or very slow DSL, so this is the next best thing I could find.')
