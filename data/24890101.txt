But I still draw that distinction.<p>I&#x27;m not a strict consequentialist. I think that people&#x27;s intents matter and that their inner lives have moral significance.<p>So, for me, that outcome (Facebook benefiting) is only <i>one factor</i> in the moral calculus. In the case of the people I know (and likely John Carmack, though I don&#x27;t know him), it isn&#x27;t the dominating factor.')
