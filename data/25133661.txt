If North Korea would blink, and go for a desperate all in attack, it will likely do so with China backing it. This country is being run over the phone from Beijing after all.<p>The most realistic, and highest success chance scenario is that North Korea will coordinate attack with China.<p>In all conceivable scenarios, NATO will have more resources even after 100% one sided nuclear attack on it (3000-4000 warheads,) and be able to subdue both China, and NK with conventional forces, and standing armies alone.<p>Not to say, China&#x27;s neighbours will not stand still too.<p>Even a whatever pyrrhic victory will likely be the end of political regimes in both NK, and China.<p>If they will attack, they will weight in that price first.')
