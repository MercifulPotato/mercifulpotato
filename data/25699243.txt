It&#x27;s incredibly easy to rack up hours on such games, yet if you asked people if they were prepared to commit hours to the game they&#x27;d be likely to say no.<p>Twitter is even worse. Not only does it not make the time commitment clear up front, the tweets are short enough that you read them automatically. Then you&#x27;re hooked into the doom scroll as you keep automatically reading one after another.<p>As a writer it means you don&#x27;t need to bother with structure and other classical writing skills to keep your reader interested. You can just write disconnected chunks of text and rely on twitter to keep them interested.')
