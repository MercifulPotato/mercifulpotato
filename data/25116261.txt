Well, maybe, but that&#x27;s tact.  However, is it true?  Bear in mind that an excessively gregious society, and yes there are differences in societies, cultures, might view a more reserved culture as such.<p>And the real reason I&#x27;m responding is, how many &quot;people there are on the streets&quot; is irrelevant, in terms of being &#x27;social&#x27; or not.  People going places != social.  It can equal work, needing supplies, traveling, etc.<p>I grew up in a small town, population &lt; 1000, in a massively large county (&gt;1000 square km), with barely 15,000 people in it at the time.  When I first moved to the city, I would walk down the street and wave at people.  People reacted, to my perspective, quite oddly.  Some actually shied away, others looked at me as if was a lunatic.<p>Yet where I grew up, not waving would have been beyond rude.  In the city, it was seen as absurd behaviour.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is, Sweden could be quite anti-social, without it being &quot;mean&quot; to say so.  It&#x27;s all perspective.')
