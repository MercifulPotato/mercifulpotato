I don&#x27;t think there was any studies about taking medicines or supplements for prevention.   the drug studies ive looked at seem to be run by the drug companies and they aren&#x27;t pushing vitamins and nutrition.<p>what I&#x27;ve learned while figuring out what supplements I should be taking is that the entire recommended daily allowance is based on avoiding acute diseases like ricketss or scurvy, and not based on a model of what is optimal for our bodies.   when you look at diseases by latitute or wonder why our annual influenza pandemic  is during the winter months, it makes me wonder why there hasn&#x27;t already been studies of supplements.  it seems like a perfectly straightforward study.')
