Why? Because DB insists on having 18th century style 1st and 2nd class tickets.\nAnd most people can&#x27;t afford that.<p>However hyperloop has no such distinction, because all the pods can be made to &quot;first class standards&quot; due to the direct point A to point B routing nature. Alternstively, the richt people have to wait until their pod is at capacty, which I&#x27;d be delighted to see.<p>So in reality ICE capacity is probably half of what hyperloop could provide.<p>Edit:\nI&#x27;m using the assumption of 1 ICE per hour, because that&#x27;s how the entire german train system is sheduled.\nAnd we&#x27;re comparing Hyperloop to the current system.')
