You could barely publish a paper on ANN.<p>Just to demonstrate, one the most common books during period, &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 2nd ed&quot; by Norvig, 1080 pages, has less than one (1!) page dedicated to ANNs. I personally think Norvig is an idiot with regards to Artificial Intelligence, and his book (used in 1500 schools in 135 countries and regions) singlehandedly slowed down the progress of AI by a few years, until a new generation of students outgrew this archaic book.')
