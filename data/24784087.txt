Company B also sent a similar representative to Company A.<p>The post is largely about comparisons&#x2F;contrasts&#x2F;learnings the SRE observed. At some point they make a statement that, if they had to choose only one, they would prefer having comprehensive dashboards reporting live prod statuses over extremely comprehensive testing.<p>I&#x27;ve tried every possible combination of Googling&#x2F; HN&#x27;s search but couldn&#x27;t find it--anybody happen to know where it is?')
