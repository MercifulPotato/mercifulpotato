The current model of hierarchical decision making and control parallels the monarchies and tyrannies of old. The worker is asked to be a corporate robot for 8 hours every day - think only corporate thoughts, perform only corporate actions. Except &quot;corporate&quot; here is defined as &quot;whatever the people above in the hierarchy say&quot;.  There is little fairness and justice inherent in such a system - the worker&#x27;s productivity enriches the corporation without the worker having a say in how their contributions should be used.<p>The alternative is a democratically-run corporation, one in which everyone has a stake and can influence the direction of, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;SB117729012338178557" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;SB117729012338178557</a> . In an ideal world this model would be partly enforced by law and employees&#x27; speech regarding company politics would be as protected as their political speech in public. Yes, right now a wise CEO would listen to their employees like how a wise ruler listens to their subjects, but there is no requirement for that. Tyranny is not only allowed, but rewarded and employees&#x27; only recourse is leaving one life of serfdom for another. Obviously, the current situation is better than what it used to be, but corporations are still entirely structured for the enrichment of the ruling class at the expense of the working class. We can do better, maybe.<p>Even this very comment I am writing, I would not dare to write under my real name for fear of retribution. I am extremely thankful for the somewhat obscuring nature of pseudonymous internet communications, but the fact that I can only voice my thoughts in this format is somewhat of a problem itself.')
