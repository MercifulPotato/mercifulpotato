Congratulations on your success.<p>Feedback:<p>- Could you remove the email requirement for getting started? Maybe figure out a way for people to associate an email account after they do the &quot;Getting Started&quot;?<p>- Could you put a back button on the tutorial?<p>- In addition to the poll at the end of the tutorial, I hope you are capturing implicit feedback data to determine how effective it is.  Things like average time between clicks and whether users click the buttons you suggest immediately after are indicators of effectiveness.<p>- For the registration form, maybe get rid of either the label &quot;Display Name&quot; or the placeholder text &quot;Your Artist Name...&quot;?  It was confusing having them be different.<p>As for actual content, unfortunately I can&#x27;t help you.  I don&#x27;t have any personal music to upload so someone else will have to give you feedback.  I hope my suggestions on registration were helpful.  Congratulations again on your early success and good luck expanding in 2021.')
