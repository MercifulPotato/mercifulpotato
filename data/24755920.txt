Item(by='wenc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602519009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24752635, text='&gt; claiming that algorithm does not matter, especially from people without experience actually using both.<p>Here&#x27;s the basis of that claim [1].<p>That said, I have not tested it empirically myself so I think that is cause for moderating my claim -- I place a high value on empirically-tested knowledge. Take my claim as partially withdrawn.<p>But to make the argument more precise, an algorithm producing a lower rep load because it uses intervals more efficiently does not imply it produces a significant delta-difference in retention. It merely means the algorithm lets you fit more stuff into a memorization schedule. That seems to be to be quite different from improving retention itself of say a smaller inventory of facts. Just wanted to be sure about the actual claim that is made.<p>p.s. one of your links is broken.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;learninglab.psych.purdue.edu&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;2011_Karpicke_Bauernschmidt_JEPLMC.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;learninglab.psych.purdue.edu&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;2011_Karpicke_...</a>')
