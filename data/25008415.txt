Lack of resources, family, lack of practical freedom... the list goes on. Hell, some people actually are patriotic.<p>But frankly, I do think this matters much less than people are making this out to be. Larger-than-life superhero CEOs are bullshit. I do not believe you needed Musk or Kalanick to get things that look like their companies. US culture just desperately wants to believe in their homemade gods, so you get conversations like this.')
