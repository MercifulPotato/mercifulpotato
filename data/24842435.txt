FPGA cloud instances are also an option.<p>Register Transfer Level (RTL) development generally has less pleasant tooling and a much longer feedback cycle than software development. So expect some friction there.<p>Also, for the algorithms part, you might have something in software that isn’t a great match to hardware and will need some re-architecting. Sorting is a good example of this. Check out “sorting networks” for a popular way of accomplishing sorting in hardware.<p>I did a master’s thesis on transitioning a graph inference algorithm into an FPGA implementation. \nSend me an email if you have any specific questions.')
