They are usually placed in a context of a sentence or an entire paragraph. Even if the screen reader reads a raw URL as literally the word &quot;link&quot;, it&#x27;s still reasonable. You can even do something like HN does with the URLs next to article titles, list just the domain - or domain.com&#x2F;username for sites like medium or github, just like HN started doing recently.')
