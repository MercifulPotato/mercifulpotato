If you installed that runtime from a system package, you don&#x27;t touch the global modules - they&#x27;re managed using system packages.<p>If you install the language runtime on a side (via pyenv, asdf or something else) or use a project-space environment (python venv, bundler, or local node_modules) you can install whatever modules you want for that runtime without conflicts.')
