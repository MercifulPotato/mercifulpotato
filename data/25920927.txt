Often, the filesystem could be so &quot;fscked&quot; that you can&#x27;t mount&#x2F;boot.<p>In the &quot;metadata only journaled&quot; bucket, if you use order...meaning writing the data before you write the metadata, you will have a consistent filesystem that can be mounted, albeit possibly missing some data.<p>In the last bucket, you&#x27;re also getting a consistent filesystem that can be mounted, but with less data loss. At the cost of some performance.<p>I think they are saying both buckets 2 and 3 are &quot;modern&quot;. I certainly encountered lots of fsck giving up in the 90&#x27;s on &quot;bucket 1&quot; type filesystems.')
