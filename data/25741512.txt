So if someone supports an idea and then commits violence then discussion of this idea should be removed from the public square. I don&#x27;t see any evidence that the &#x27;stop the steal&#x27; campaign organized the violence in the Capitol. This just seems to be a game of association. A bunch of people who committed illegal violent acts believe X, people using the slogan Y also believe X so any use of slogan Y should be removed from the public square.<p>It looks like the original reason the &#x27;stop the steal&#x27; page was removed from Facebook was for &#x27;misinformation&#x27; and now they are blacklisting the slogan because it&#x27;s associated with &#x27;misinformation&#x27; and they also believe that talking about such things causes violence.')
