That&#x27;s <i>a lot</i> of learning about how to do state management in JS. I would argue that&#x27;s beyond what an individual developer could <i>ever</i> do. Mobx has similarly large numbers - almost 3000 commits from more than 400 developers. No doubt other popular state libraries also have those sorts of numbers.<p>If you need a general state management library you&#x27;d be crazy to write your own. You might be able to do 90% of what the big, popular libraries have done, but that&#x27;s just settling for something 10% worse for no good reason. Why give up all that knowledge, testing, and creativity when you can build on top of it? Let other people make the mistakes.')
