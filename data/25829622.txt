There were 4 officers that entered the building so are we just supposed to assume that the only one with a body camera was the only one who didn&#x27;t get any footage of inside the house?<p>They released the body camera footage supposedly as proof that the raid was proper, but they don&#x27;t even have any footage of what they&#x27;re disputing. Had there been any real sense of danger or concern about officer safety why would they all just stand around out in the open for 13 minutes where anyone inside with a gun could just start taking pot shots at officers with plenty of cover for themselves but none for officers?')
