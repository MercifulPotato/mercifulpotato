I&#x27;m ok even with the Oxford&#x2F;AstraZeneca one. I&#x27;d be ok even with the Russian one (I live in the US, so there&#x27;s pretty much zero chance this would become available here).<p>If it&#x27;s available from private clinics for hundreds of dollars before it&#x27;s available for free, I wouldn&#x27;t take it. I&#x27;ll wait until my turn comes for the free vaccine.<p>PS: I fully trust the FDA. Once they give their authorization, I have no hesitations to take the vaccine. It goes without saying that I wouldn&#x27;t take the Oxford&#x2F;AstraZeneca or any other vaccine if it hasn&#x27;t received the FDA EUA.')
