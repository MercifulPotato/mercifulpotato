Item(by='Arnt', descendants=None, kids=[25858895], score=None, time=1611237466, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25858677, text='This is basic law: Stuff is allowed unless forbidden. Because of that, employers generally have the right to require things of employees, and the exceptions are what&#x27;s specified in law.<p>So if your employer wants to require of the people in your team that they know C++, speak Swahili or carry photo ID, that&#x27;s allowed because not forbidden. But the law does have provisions for religious discrimination (in most countries, perhaps all) so requiring your team to be Pastafarians is out (if that&#x27;s what the law says, the law might make an exception for the Pastafarian Church).<p>Requiring vaccines might also be forbidden by your employment contract. But is it? I doubt it.<p>Your contract also could say &quot;the employer cannot permit you to take paid sick leave if you&#x27;re ill on the day after a vaccine&quot; or &quot;the employer cannot permit you to get a vaccine on company time&quot; but both sound far-fetched to me.')
