The idea being that you label the contract with something like “temperature in Chicago” which causes the actual temperature in Chicago to be the only value everyone is likely to agree on (i.e., the real value becomes the Schelling point)—thereby allowing for decentralized embedding of real world information into the block chain.<p>I’m unclear if this mechanism is actually in use, though, and I’ve seen a convincing attack proposed which might explain why Schelling coins don’t seem to be in widespread use.')
