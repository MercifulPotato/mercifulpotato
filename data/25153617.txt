Which is sad, but probably because I did so bad in Calculus as an undergraduate. But, one thing I absolutely did take away from Physics was the idea of units and their conversions. It has come in handy so often though in and outside my degree of computer science. If I had to simplify it, it really helps you not to compare apples to oranges. At the beginning of Street Fighting Mathematics it brings up that point. For example it isn’t a good comparison to compare the wealth in assets of a given company to a countries GDP. Because, GDP is happening over every year in time whereas the wealth is merely effected by what point in time it’s observed. Units help one see that in order to be truly and more fairly comparable they have to be the same type of units.<p>I used an analogy of units in physics recently to help a teammate with types and generics, sadly I can’t remember exactly what I said haha other than don’t compare apples to oranges, but I think I had further insight than just that.')
