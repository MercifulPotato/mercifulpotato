Sure, they <i>do</i> that — and if their budget were heavily constrained, that’s the one thing they wouldn’t be able to de-prioritize doing — but with their budget as large as it is, they don’t <i>spend most of their time or resources</i> doing that.<p>And, just the same, the Navy doesn’t spend most of its time, budget, or manpower on “naval warfare”!
