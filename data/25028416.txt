Your comment initially made sense to me.  Then I remembered the many wrong and harmful ideas that I recognized and rejected since that time.  These ideas lead to real harm for many people.<p>For example, during Bill Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial for sexual harassment of his woman intern, I thought that his behavior was no big deal, that we accept that powerful men like to play around with women, and that the intern knew what she was getting into when she got the job working for him.  Later, I realized that I was wrong.  Those beliefs enable sexual harassment of women across society.  We must reject those beliefs so women can have equal opportunity and good quality of life.<p>Other wrong ideas that I had:<p>- Poor people are poor because they are lazy.<p>- Violent criminals are violent because they don&#x27;t want to control themselves.<p>- Unlucky people failed to prepare properly or were careless.<p>- Gay people are bad for society.<p>- Men should be breadwinners.  Women should be housewives.<p>- USA is powerful because God is rewarding its Christian citizens for following His rules.<p>All of these ideas are wrong.  These ideas harm people and make our society poorer.<p>Yes, I can remember my previous thought processes and see the dancer spin the other way, but the dancer is carrying a single-edged sword and spinning the other way way hurts people.')
