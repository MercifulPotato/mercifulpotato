Other silicon designers like IBM with POWER10 are moving to serial memory with massive &quot;L4&quot; caches, seen previously with their Centaur memory controllers. I can see Apple using OMI or a similar serial memory bus to add extra memory, using 16&#x2F;32&#x2F;etc GB of PoP RAM for caching reads and writes to slower off-chip memory. I expect Intel and AMD will eventually move to a similar memory model, at least in server grade hardware.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16226&#x2F;apple-silicon-m1-a14-deep-dive&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16226&#x2F;apple-silicon-m1-a14-de...</a>')
