I don&#x27;t think the original commenter is actually trying to blame people..&quot;</i><p>My point was that free or unfree are not the issue here. It&#x27;s just not true, just as its not true about advertising or data gathering. Free isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s making a problem. It was a problem before. Whether your business model is eyeballs (it usually is in print, online, paid or free), subscriptions or both the most important types of journalism aren&#x27;t economical. They&#x27;re generally produced because journalistic cultures value them. Those that don&#x27;t generally just become tabloids.<p>Sending a journalistic team to Yemen to produce 10 articles is much more expensive than having people work from the office and produce 100 articles about politicians&#x27; and academics&#x27; opinions about that war... or articles about Kim and Kanye. A view is a view, a magazine sale is a magazine sale.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure people &quot;want nice things&quot; in the sense that they want quality journalism. <i>We</i> want them to have &quot;nice things.&quot; It&#x27;s important for society. Doesn&#x27;t necessarily benefit the reader much.<p>Good journalism has always been hard to fund and rarely economically sustainable. Nothing to do with &quot;people these days&quot; or with &quot;free.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s related to FB and Google in a roundabout way. They are the monoliths. They get all the bread. People read the content on FB, and if you don&#x27;t want to let them then people will read someone else&#x27;s content. So people read the content on FB, and FB gets the ad money. FB doesn&#x27;t have a journalistic culture, journalistic ethic, or any kind of ethic. It was the journalistic ethic that was enabling hard journalism to be cross subsidised. That ethic is now broke.')
