Someone opining that COVID is a „liberal conspiracy“ is objectively unfit to engage in the sort of reasoning research requires, and a waste of students‘ tuition at best. Objecting to the very idea (Not any specific issue) of engaging with ethics in AI is just as disqualifying as it would be in medicine. Being happy about bloodshed is just lame, as is the „I was hacked“ excuse. Being happy about some cops‘ violent deaths is just as unacceptable as any other innocents‘ murders.<p>Some items lack the specifics to evaluate them. I could imagine the authors here might be hiding some rather objectionable statements behind phrases such as „supposedly made insensitive statements“, considering they felt the need to repeatedly put scarequotes around „racism“.<p>Then, when you click through to the sources you’ll find actual cancellations are rather rare. That ethics guy is a retired professor, and this list is taking issue with the simple fact of him being criticized for his criticism. Some items are about „open letters“ in student newspapers expressing criticism, not even asking for dismissal.<p>A number mention the person in question being placed „on leave“. The vast majority of those instances will resolve with consequences short of dismissal: some training maybe, docked pay, or nothing at all.')
