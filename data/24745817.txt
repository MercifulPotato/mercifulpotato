It seems like the example linked about British Airways was JS under the britishairways.com domain being changed, not a third party CDN.<p>Incidentally, a few years ago when people were loading third party scripts over HTTP, I demoed a fun hack where, if you control a user&#x27;s DNS, you could redirect queries to popular CDNs to a proxy that injects keylogger code <i>and tells the browser to cache it indefinitely</i>. Because at the time almost every site included either jQuery or Google Analytics, you&#x27;d have a persistent keylogger even after the user switched to a more secure connection. How far we&#x27;ve come!')
