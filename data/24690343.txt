Obviously it scared me enough that I&#x27;ll never fall asleep in a car again, but it was due to sleep deprivation from being up many hours irresponsibly the night before.<p>If you&#x27;re falling asleep often at the wheel I would recommend you tell your primary. He&#x27;ll likely refer you to a sleep doctor. I didn&#x27;t have major symptoms, but after a recommendation from my primary I discovered I have a bad case of sleep apnea.<p>If you&#x27;re falling asleep at the wheel often (and btw, you&#x27;re doing the right thing by pulling over and napping) you should go to a sleep doctor. You might not be getting a proper amount of sleep, for whatever reason, and they might be able to help.')
