All Android handset OEMs basically have no choice to install Google services because AOSP isn&#x27;t mass marketable on its own, and nobody can really compete with Google&#x27;s combination of Play&#x2F;Gmail&#x2F;YouTube&#x2F;Chrome&#x2F;search.  Once you have a Google account, you get funneled into these other services, and it makes it difficult for any other services to gain traction.  If we want AOSP to truly be free, then it has to be useable outside of the Google ecosystem.<p>Android is like a club with free drinks, but Google Services are the $150 cover charge.')
