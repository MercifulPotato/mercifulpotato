Map (and select, collect, each, and some others) iterate over an enumerable.  Pluck and select are active record methods that generate SQL.<p>It&#x27;s a good example of choosing magic&#x2F;brevity over expressiveness.  You don&#x27;t know that Tag.all.map calls SQL because it&#x27;s not something you explicitly tell it to do.  That&#x27;s the real issue with Ruby &amp; Rails.  The magic lets you do some powerful stuff but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tell what exactly is happening.')
