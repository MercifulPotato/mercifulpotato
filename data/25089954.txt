It&#x27;s about building out the factory itself, if that doesn&#x27;t motivate you, it&#x27;s just not for you.<p>Oh, I liked building a factory, in order to unlock then figure out the new mechanisms or defend against the bugs.<p>If I didn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t have played through completing all the science.<p>But for me the game ended at that point because after that it was just more of the same with little more to discover.<p>I can see how some people enjoy cranking it to 11, but that part isn&#x27;t for me.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing some of the challenge, but I feel like I could mostly scale to arbitrary size (I think my game currently keeps one rocket port with prod modules saturated) now by simply copy&#x2F;pasting factory chunks and letting the bots replicate them.  I guess I would find automatically furnishing long range construction with construction supplies kinda interesting to do... but I dunno why I&#x27;d want to try. :)')
