We&#x27;ve been there before and, IMO, the shift to COTS software was one of the best things to ever happen to U.S. Government agencies.<p>(On a side note, I&#x27;ve lost a lot of faith in VMware. For something they claim to be &quot;secure by default&quot;, there sure have been a shitload of CVEs in the last year or two! Also, just a few months ago, they had to &quot;re-release&quot; patches for a 9.8 because the original patches didn&#x27;t completely fix the issue!)')
