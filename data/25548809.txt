This leads people to believe - through the pretense of knowledge - that Vit D supplements are useless. Combine that with high faith in &quot;science&quot; as if studies can&#x27;t ever be poorly designed and blammo now you have experts telling people it&#x27;s a waste of money that makes your pee expensive. It&#x27;s truly sad.<p>Just Google &quot;vitamins are useless&quot; to see what&#x27;s getting turned out.<p>Edit: personally I feel it&#x27;s like giving starving people 200 cal per day of food, seeing that they die anyhow and saying &quot;look food doesn&#x27;t work to fix starvation!&quot; yeah maybe not, but at what dose?  If the dose makes the poison perhaps the dose also makes the medicine')
