It&#x27;s nothing more than normal TCP traffic except with a message to the OS and other programs that whatever is on that local computer network, you don&#x27;t want it routed outside the local computer.<p>There&#x27;s absolutely nothing stopping anything with access to localhost from routing it anywhere that process wants. Does not even take a malicious actor, all kinds of legit programs expose localhost. It&#x27;s really not something you should use for anything except as a signal to other well-behaving programs that you are using the network stack as a machine-local IPC bus.')
