We need to compare the cost with the effect and with the likely course of events without the subsidy (the latter is often difficult to do especially when the &#x27;natural&#x27; trend already goes in the same direction as what the policy tries to encourage, and in this case sales e-bikes and e-scooters are already booming).<p>I may sound very critical. This is because I do think that many of these so-called &quot;green initiatives&quot; at the moment cost public money with no clearly quantified or quantifiable benefits at a time when public finances in most European countries are already pushed to the limit.<p>&gt; <i>Just that people are applying for and taking taking the money. Of course they are.</i><p>Indeed.')
