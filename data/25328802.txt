I think there are a few issues at play, some more nuanced than others.<p>The first (and most black-and-white) is that CDPR&#x27;s social media presence has been very… trolly. For example, &quot;did you just assume my gender&quot; is not something I&#x27;ve ever heard a queer person say; it&#x27;s an anti-woke joke at their expense aimed at people who disdain the notion of gender fluidity. These, I think, color the rest of CDPR&#x27;s conduct; there are other things that might be considered benign if not for their consistent trolling here.<p><i>&gt; The criticism of the character creation surprised me: sure it could be better, but is it not also the most embracing version created yet in any AAA videogame that we known of.</i><p>The cynical take is that CDPR is exploiting the issue; they know that this is a popular topic right now and they&#x27;re appropriating it in order to sell a video game. But even if you assume good faith on the part of CDPR, I think this is a case of intentions not mattering. Ultimately this game is going to be played by a lot of people, and help shape how many of those people see trans issues, and trans people are unhappy with the impression the game will leave.<p>I also observe that people often use &quot;at least they&#x2F;we are trying&quot; as a way to evade criticism — even constructive criticism — which makes it hard to move forward. Like, are you only supposed to engage with people that are already hostile?<p><i>&gt; Same with the poster: is it not cool to have a buff trans protagonist - they are objectified, but that is the point of posters (see captain america or black widow posters).</i><p>Objectification isn&#x27;t binary; there are plenty of ways to highlight conventionally attractive features, which is why you see films like Wonder Woman lauded for their representation while characters like Black Widow are criticized for superficially similar portrayals. And of course criticism refers only to a consensus; there will always be people who are offended at benign representation and others who are fine with flagrant stereotyping.<p>Ultimately, I think the author knows that AAA titles are made by teams of hundreds of people, many of whom <i>are</i> trying to make a progressive game. But whatever the creators&#x27; intentions, when all is said and done the game and marketing thereof will look how they look, and people will feel how they feel about it.')
