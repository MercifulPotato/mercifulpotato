The &#x27;serious&#x27; members will create a new subreddit (i.e. &#x2F;r&#x2F;movies &gt; &#x2F;r&#x2F;TrueFilm) in order to shake off the casual members and return the discussion to its roots.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, but the subreddit design has definitely given Reddit more longevity since you can rotate your memberships and only join subreddits with higher effort content. Yes, the default subreddits are filled with the same memes every post, but just unsubscribe from those and curate your feed.<p>Not a solution for HN, however.')
