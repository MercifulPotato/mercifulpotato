I am personally familiar with many of them, some with websites, others without. That&#x27;s not the situation I&#x27;m writing about.<p>If I am considering patronizing an unfamiliar restaurant, and my only source of information about it is some untrustworthy third party platform, I&#x27;m moving on. Like I said, many restaurants exist, I&#x27;m losing nothing by going somewhere trustworthy.<p>And again, I cannot emphasize this enough: <i>I do not want some third party asserting itself into my relationship with the restaurant.</i>')
