In Amazon’s early years, you only paid taxes in state where you were located. If they’d setup shop in CA then they’d pay sales tax on all shipments to CA (~20% of early sales). By setting up outside CA&#x2F;NY (their two earliest markets) they’d have a competitive pricing advantage over any competitors set up in either. Arguably, this regulatory “loophole” gave Amazon a huge head start.<p>Think the article confuses sales and income&#x2F;capital gains tax. Being in a small market was an advantage from a sales tax perspective. Being in WA or NV was advantage from income&#x2F;capital gains tax perspective. The latter gave Amazon an advantage in hiring. And, later when successful, allowed Jeff and early employees to realize more wealth from their stock&#x2F;options.<p>Nevada, on both fronts, would have been as much of more efficient. But, I’m guessing, the difficulty of recruiting great technical talent (which was needed in the early days of Internet ecommerce) would have swamped those advantages.')
