Right or wrong a lot of how for example the US constitution was setup was explicitly about limiting the power of a populist.<p>But also these discussions aren&#x27;t really about the government. Full stop the government shouldn&#x27;t be able to shut sites like parlor down, but part of how society works is by consensus forming and in my opinion social networks really have messed this up.
