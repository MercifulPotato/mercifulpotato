We have a system for accurate measurement x,y,z,rot by imaging a flat scale and are currently focussed on precision engineering&#x2F; microscopy&#x2F; xy stages; but I didn&#x27;t realise the big photogrammetry systems were so slow or desired micrometre accuracy. May be a whole set of questions about depth of field and mechanical and thermal stability, but just a thought')
