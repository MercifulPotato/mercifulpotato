Isn&#x27;t the effect of gravity the same at the event horizon for all sizes of a black hole?<p>I thought the size only affected the &quot;acceleration&quot; of the gravitational pull based on the distance from the singularity? A supermassive black hole means you will take longer to be spaghettified, but it will still happen and it will happen before you cross the horizon, won&#x27;t it?')
