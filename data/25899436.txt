The hatred of IE came because it was frozen and non-standard and full of bugs. It wasnâ€™t that the default box model was ever good, it was just that it was the spec, and there was a big push to follow the spec instead of blindly copying bugs from other browsers. At that time, we also thought XHTML was a good idea, but eventually experience taught us how to balance the spec with practicality.')
