You could even call it luck. The reproducibility implied by the fact that at least <i>some</i> of it is true is not a &quot;nice-to-have&quot;, it&#x27;s the whole point of it working. We wouldn&#x27;t call it true if we couldn&#x27;t confirm it to be true.<p>To me it seems you&#x27;re conflating reproducibility with insight. Of course insight is also key, and it may be useful even if it&#x27;s wrong, as long as it causes others to recursively have new insights and create hypotheses and do experiments that eventually turn out to be true.')
