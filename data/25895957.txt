This is a false dichotomy.  The government is just an abstraction over a group, like any other; literally nobody who is suggesting that government-based solutions aren&#x27;t good are advocating for individual accomplishment outside of groups.<p>The government has no hands and no brain; all actions undertaken under color of the state are carried out by &quot;individual&quot; humans.<p>Nobody&#x27;s saying that coordination amongst people in large groups isn&#x27;t required.<p>If there is a &#x27;spectrum&#x27;, it&#x27;s &quot;individuals&quot; vs &quot;groups&quot;, or it&#x27;s &quot;compulsory groups, on threat of violence&quot; (the state) vs &quot;voluntary association&quot; (how almost every other group in our society works - and 100% of the effective ones).<p>You can&#x27;t meaningfully threaten world-class, creative, hardworking people into being maximally efficient and effective.  You need a carrot, not a stick, and the only solutions the state provides are based on their ability to print cash (already not a problem if you&#x27;re effective and productive), or a stick.')
