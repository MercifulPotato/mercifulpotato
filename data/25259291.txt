Not only that but the ROB is something like 3x larger. You can basically hold 3x as many instructions. No other mainstream chip maker has that many decoders in their CPUs.<p>The author completely misses &quot;the baby in the water&quot;<p>Yes, X86 core are HUGE, the whole of CPU is for them only.<p>They can afford wider decode, even though at a giant area cost (which itself would be dwarfed area cost of cache system area.)<p><i>The thing is, have more decode, and buffer will still not improve X86 perf by much</i><p>Modern X86 has good internal register, and pipeline utilisation, it&#x27;s simply they don&#x27;t have something to keep all of those registers busy most of the time!<p>What it lacks is memory, and cache I&#x2F;O. All X86 chips today are I&#x2F;O starved at every level. And that starvation also comes as a result of decades old X86 idiosyncrasies about how I&#x2F;O should be done.')
