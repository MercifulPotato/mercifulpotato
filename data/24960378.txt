The ongoing (and supremely noisy) American culture war is extremely disinteresting to me, I just want people to have the information to make their own decisions and reach their own conclusions.<p>Perhaps you like the alt-right and learning that information would make you more eager to use Substack, perhaps not. Either way, it’s better that people have more information than less.')
