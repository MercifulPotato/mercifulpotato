I had a family member that worked for a large Fortune 500 company tech company.  He got to take a look at the invoice for consulting on a project They pay consultants $1500 an HOUR for anything from QA to software engineering.<p>I had another family member who worked in a big 4 accounting firm.  These companies regularly pay in excess of $800 an hour for the most ridiculous consulting. $1500 a day for two people is robbery in the world of consulting.')
