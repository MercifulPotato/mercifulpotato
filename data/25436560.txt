There is exactly 0% chance of there being no changes. Why even bother pretending otherwise? Does anyone actually believe that things aren&#x27;t going to change?<p>EDIT: Like, it doesn&#x27;t even have to be a <i>bad</i> thing! Sell it! Go hog with &quot;we&#x27;re integrating processes to make the product better for users&quot; and &quot;this will let us ship updates faster&quot; and &quot;you&#x27;ll get more features now that we&#x27;re an official Google product&quot; (Android support, hopefully). There&#x27;s no reason to go with this absurd premise that there will be no change (which nobody&#x27;s going to believe anyways) when you could be saying &quot;yes there will be changes and that&#x27;s a good thing for you&quot;.')
