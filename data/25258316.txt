SARS-CoV-2 is what&#x27;s called a &quot;positive sense&quot; RNA virus, which means that it is directly translated by cellular machinery to produce more virus copies. It should have no interaction with cellular DNA.<p>Retroviruses are a subset of RNA viruses that utilize the strategy you&#x27;re referring to. This requires additional machinery be coded for to allow reverse transcription to DNA and then subsequent integration into host DNA. The vast majority of RNA viruses are not retroviruses.')
