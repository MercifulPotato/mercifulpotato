What are those containers really?<p>One feature that web really needs can be called a &quot;container&quot; or an advanced iframe. That super-iframe would allow to intercept or change the global JS API for the underlying site and everything that app transitively loads. For example, the site wants to use getUserMedia for tracking? Fine, because the container it&#x27;s in has replaced getUserMedia with a mock, in a way not detectable by the site. This would allow to see what JS API the site uses. This would effectively kill fingerprinting.')
