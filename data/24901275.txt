So if your language didn&#x27;t support multi-threading, you have to find multi-core cpus. And scaling it would require that expense. But.... that&#x27;s not the case, you can run as many as apps you want. In hindsight, of course, I used to have pentium cpu with single core and OS can converge instructions from multiple ongoing tasks and give impression of parallelism.<p>But then my question is what is the advantage of parallelism. Why not simply just run multiple instances and keep data outside of app in some sort of shared memory?')
