Item(by='H_Pylori', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611547401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25898297, text='HTML, and the web stack by extension, have their faults, but the advent of the web should&#x27;ve been a humbling experience for Alan Kay. I deeply respect Alan Kay for his achievements, but he appears to have been stuck in &quot;object land&quot; for a few decades now. For example, he seems to hate the idea of &quot;simple data&quot; for philosophical reasons (see [1]), but it&#x27;s undeniable that &quot;data&quot; is not a bad idea at all and we use it proficuously every day. The fact that a physicist succeeded in creating a worldwide hypertext, and the best computer scientists didn&#x27;t, should be telling. There is a lesson here somewhere, just dismissing the web as the work of amateurs is missing the mark. I love Alan, but sometimes, he is his own worst enemy.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11941656" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11941656</a>')
