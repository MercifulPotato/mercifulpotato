They&#x27;re just a lot more fun.<p>One of my favorite cars was a little Suzuki Samurai. It wasn&#x27;t at all fast but it was a blast to drive with the top down and go 4wheeling on the National Forest roads.<p>Consider &quot;lowriders&quot;. Those aren&#x27;t famous for being fast, they&#x27;re famous for going slow, but they&#x27;re a lot of fun to cruise the strip in.<p>I think people fumbling with their phone while driving is a bigger issue right now than people speeding and racing.')
