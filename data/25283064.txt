Because they radically expanded production capacity. Effectively, Germany gave the world a &#x27;gift&#x27;!<p>This had the long-term affect of dramatically increasing global solar + wind deployments (b&#x2F;c prices fell) and transferring a huge economic boom to China, who actually made the solar panels and who&#x27;s government subsidized production.<p>Unfortunately, for domestics political reasons, Germany also shut down their nuclear plants and kept burning coal. So their total CO2 emissions have been roughly constant and about 10x higher, per person, than France or Sweden.<p>The article is correct in that vastly more electrical transmission is needed to effectively integrate renewables. The article is misleading in describing price spikes. Yes, there are 2-45 days a year of price spikes for a few hours, but on average price is lower b&#x2F;c of renewables outside of Germany. (Again, Germany did everyone the favor of buying renewables before they were economic.) Texas average prices are some of the lowest in the world. CA wholesale power prices are very low globally, while retail prices are sky high b&#x2F;c PG&amp;E is a monopoly combined with an inadvertent domestic terrorist organization.<p>Something the article only eludes to, the energy transition covers many more areas than just power production. Germany has done a bad job in both transportation and building emissions. They&#x27;re overly reliant on Russian natural gas for heating and have been slow to embrace electric cars (VW is doing &#x27;ok&#x27; but not great). Both issues are separate to renewables but major failings of German policy to either reduce emissions or increase energy security.<p>Overall, the German investment in renewables electricity production is a massive success and global gift. Completely underrecognized. Everything else sits in the category between &quot;failure&quot; and &quot;didn&#x27;t even try.&quot;')
