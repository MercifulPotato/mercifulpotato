IMO, it’s worth the area.  Even if you assume the compiler gets it right and finds tons of ILP, it’ll get it wrong for the next hardware rev when your core inevitably changes and you have to break apart your VLIW instructions and get ILP back dynamically anyway.  To say nothing of shared pipelines in an SMT processor, where VLIW basically runs counter to SMT and the only way to know which units are going to be available on a specific cycle is during runtime.<p>&gt; and they&#x27;re going to succeed this time.<p>I don’t see any reason why VLIW would succeed more in future attempts than in past attempts.')
