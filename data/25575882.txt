High blood lead in early childhood is not detected later in childhood [0].  The New Zealand study uses blood tests performed ten years too late.  This flaw makes the study almost useless.<p>Additionally, only 30 of the children in the study had low blood lead, &lt;5 ug&#x2F;dL.  This is because the blood was collected in the 1980s and New Zealand only banned leaded gasoline in 1996.  Look at Figure 1 in [1], and notice that at 5ug&#x2F;dL, the damage is already done.<p>[0] Caito, S., &amp; Aschner, M. (2017). Developmental Neurotoxicity of Lead.
