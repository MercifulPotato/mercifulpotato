Burisma emails were hacked;\n2.  Hunter Biden&#x27;s iCloud account was hacked;\n3.  They bought a Mac, dumped a bunch of the hacked photos, along with some real hacked emails and some forged ones;\n4.  Sent someone over to the computer shop;\n5.  Either the store owner was complicit from the beginning, or they just used him as a dupe;<p>The above may or may not be true.  But again, IIUC that&#x27;s the line that Twitter is taking.<p>If that&#x27;s what Twitter believe (or can credibly claim to believe), then they&#x27;re executing the policies in their TOS.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s true, and I&#x27;m not saying it ain&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s just my understanding of Twitter&#x27;s stand on this.')
