Burisma emails were hacked;<p>2.  Hunter Biden&#x27;s iCloud account was hacked;<p>3.  They bought a Mac, dumped a bunch of the hacked photos, along with some real hacked emails and some forged ones;<p>4.  Sent someone over to the computer shop with the frame up on the laptop already in place;<p>5.  Either the store owner was complicit from the beginning, or they just used him as a dupe.<p>The above may or may not be true.  But again, IIUC that&#x27;s the line that Twitter is taking.<p>If that&#x27;s what Twitter believe (or can credibly claim to believe), then they&#x27;re executing the policies in their TOS.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s true, and I&#x27;m not saying it ain&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s just my understanding of Twitter&#x27;s stand on this.')
