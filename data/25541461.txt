I don&#x27;t even take it myself, my girlfriend uses one dose (usually 2x0.5g before going to sleep) maybe every tenth day or so; I myself might use it once a year. But the stuff lasts for years and I don&#x27;t fancy running out or not having some with me when I (or someone near me) needs it, so we just buy it in bulk and replace when empty or after the expiry has sufficiently passed. I get a lecture from the apothecary every time. Does nobody else buy ahead, especially in the pandemic?')
