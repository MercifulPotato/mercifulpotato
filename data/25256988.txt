This is nothing like the 1976 swine flu vaccine rushed out without proper science and clinical trials. The Moderna product has been heavily-tested. Waiting is throwing life away, and living like a hikikomori isn&#x27;t an option unless someone doesn&#x27;t have a life to live. In conclusion, I&#x27;ll most likely get the Moderna one as soon as possible.')
