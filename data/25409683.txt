One can&#x27;t cut taxes below zero, for starters. Some industries need more than just having negligible taxes to get started, especially in capital intensive businesses.<p>Furthermore, the idea that the only lever that the government has to induce people to do things is lowering taxes is completely absurd. Tax cuts didn&#x27;t build the Hoover dam, the interstate highway system, nor send a man to the Moon.<p>The government can use targeted investments, messaging, procurement, tax cuts, and so on in order to move people towards certain outcomes.<p>The day that the US government announces that they&#x27;ll buy 100 million masks a month for a strategic reserve or replace all of the mobile devices for all federal employees, as long as they&#x27;re at at most a 50% premium over the cheapest option and are fully traceable from raw materials to finished product as being fully built in the US and allied countries, is the day that people will start investigating if it&#x27;s possible to do so, and start trying to do so if it&#x27;s possible.<p>&gt; This seems like something you need Democrats to do rather than something you need Trump to do.<p>It takes two to tango. Many other countries are able to pass laws and make progress, even in complex multiparty negotiations during minority governments.')
