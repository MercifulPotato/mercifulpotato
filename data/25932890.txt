The utilitarian &#x27;weighing&#x27; mode of thinking is not appropriate for every situation, and I think you (inadvertently) made a good case for why, at least with schools. The fact that schools also educate can be worked into an analysis even of the &#x27;bad sides&#x27; as not contingent, but a part of the same system that creates the &#x27;bad sides&#x27;.<p>The very <i>fact</i> that we consider weighing the &#x27;upsides&#x27; of something is if we give it, or part of it, legitimacy in the first place - legitimacy that may not be deserved. I&#x27;m silent on the topic of social media, but we wouldn&#x27;t even begin to consider the &#x27;upside&#x27; of murder or rape or defamation, for instance - and that&#x27;s not because people in the past have done that analysis for us, it&#x27;s because collective experience has shown the analysis isn&#x27;t worth doing - that the utilitarian analysis is the wrong method to apply to the question, just as there are good and bad methods in science or philosophy.')
