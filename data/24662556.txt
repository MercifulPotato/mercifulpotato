Naughtiness<p>&gt; Though the most successful founders are usually good people, they tend to have a piratical gleam in their eye. They&#x27;re not Goody Two-Shoes type good. Morally, they care about getting the big questions right, but not about observing proprieties. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d use the word naughty rather than evil. They delight in breaking rules, but not rules that matter. This quality may be redundant though; it may be implied by imagination.<p>&gt; Sam Altman of Loopt is one of the most successful alumni, so we asked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator application that would help us discover more people like him. He said to ask about a time when they&#x27;d hacked something to their advantageâ€”hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking into computers. It has become one of the questions we pay most attention to when judging applications.<p>Everyone breaking a rule will say that they&#x27;re doing this. They&#x27;ll claim they&#x27;re just bending the rules. Even when they&#x27;re engaged in massive law breaking behaviour they&#x27;ll claim that those laws don&#x27;t really matter and that the ends justify the means.<p>Hacktoberfest highlights the problem with this paragraph of Graham&#x27;s. Hundreds of thousand of people being &quot;naughty&quot;, hacking the system, cause problems for other people.')
