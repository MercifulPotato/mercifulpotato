Even if you use an ad blocker you pay for the ads you don&#x27;t see anyway.<p>In fact the more we use free social platforms and digital content, the more we pay for it from our pockets. On top of that, we also enrich the platforms themselves, that is the middleman. See that $100 billion revenue figure for Google alone? That&#x27;s also us, the consumer&#x27;s money.<p>So one opportunity for disruption is I think targeting the middleman, i.e. the platforms. You can offer cheaper ads to the advertisers by being more efficient than Google that burns absurd amounts of money on their mostly awkward and useless &quot;moonshot&quot; projects.<p>I think you can in principle be more efficient than Facebook too, by employing 100x less engineers if you focus on one task and do it well.<p>In other words, the problem of &quot;killing&quot; Google or Facebook doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean building literally alternatives to their products, but rather by creating more efficient advertisement platforms. Pick whatever method of keeping the users&#x27; eyes on the screens and be less greedy, more efficient.')
