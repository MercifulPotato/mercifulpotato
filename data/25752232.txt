Item(by='slapshot', descendants=None, kids=[25752436], score=None, time=1610480116, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25748129, text='My concern is not that AWS should be forced to host content they don&#x27;t want.  It&#x27;s that AWS (and Apple, Facebook, and others) have misrepresented what they do.<p>It&#x27;s no shock that DailyKos shouldn&#x27;t have to host pro-Trump content.  Nor should &#x2F;theDonald have to host pro-Bernie content.  We all agree that people can choose who to associate with, and that free association is important.<p>But AWS (and Facebook and others) didn&#x27;t say &quot;we&#x27;re sites that present only one kind of content&quot; the way &#x2F;theDonald and DailyKos did.  They presented themselves as universal tools for people to express themselves, build their own sites, install apps, etc.<p>So it comes as a shock when AWS says &quot;we actually only want to support sites that present views that Jeff Bezos thinks are reasonable.&quot;  And when Apple says &quot;you can only download apps on your phone that we think do a good enough job moderating.&quot;  And when Facebook bans people for posting wrong opinions.<p>The government can&#x27;t and probably shouldn&#x27;t force AWS to host content that Bezos doesn&#x27;t agree with.  It would be Amazon&#x27;s right to host only content that is pro-Trump, or equally Amazon&#x27;s right to only host content that is anti-Trump.  But when Amazon presents something as a neutral utility but secretly enforces different rules, we can and should criticize them.<p>That&#x27;s true even if all the content being removed today is garbage. I haven&#x27;t seen any &quot;worthwhile&quot; content that&#x27;s been affected by the recent moves, and I have never heard of any valuable speech on Parler.  But I am still concerned that Apple gets to decide what apps I can install on my phone because they don&#x27;t like the content.  For every Apple (managed in California by socially liberal periople) there&#x27;s a Walmart (managed in Arkansas by social conservatives) that will take the same powers and use them in a different way.  Walmart is legally free to remove pro-BLM books from their online bookshelves, but we can and should criticize them if they do.')
