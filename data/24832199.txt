It is not possible to imagine a video game produced by an open community, because it requires the vision of an auteur, not design-by-consensus. That requires hierarchy, or solo development. Both realistically require a lot of resources and thus are overwhelmingly commercial in nature.<p>The year of the linux desktop seems to never arrive because all of the support and integration of the various components requires constant application of labor by an army of people, if it is to be usable. Android and Ubuntu might be able to succeed, but &quot;the community&quot; will not.<p>The community can maintain stuff that is &quot;boring,&quot; where there is no controversy. When the right approach is clear to all. The community can write an emulator, but cannot write a video game. It can write a kernel, but cannot support a whole distro that &quot;just works&quot; for normal people.<p>Maybe in some distant future when there is no constant churn of new features and drivers and rewrites then we can have an open community-maintained distro that actually works for a normal person. Doubt such a time will ever arrive, but if it did then and only then would OSes become boring.<p>Web rendering engines are complex and happen to be open source nowadays, but are commercially supported and wrapped in proprietary packages. Mozilla is failing to keep up with gecko, so the last non-commercial rendering engine is dying a slow death. It was able to succeed somewhat because following standards is straightforward and thus can be considered &quot;boring.&quot; Some have likened browser development to emulator development.<p>But packaging it all up nicely and providing the best possible user experience? I wouldn&#x27;t count on it.')
