This allows the compiler to check that, indeed, you never use the data in a way that would break things. Hence your compiler can then give guarantees about thread-safety.<p>Now it seems likely that, when compilers do this and you write wrong code, your conclusion might be &quot;I need a mutex lock for this&quot;, or if performance matters, &quot;I need to rewrite this to allow performant lockless code. But the main question remains &quot;Can I currently modify this data without issues&quot;.')
