We registered Google accounts for each dealership, we added them to each dealerships&#x27; AdWords account so they could see where and how their money was being spent.<p>One account from the middle of the batch, while I was the _only_ one with access and definitely had not done anything unusual with it (and certainly nothing we hadn&#x27;t done with the other half dozen accounts) was banned before we could provide it to the client.<p>I opened a ticket with the accounts team and didn&#x27;t get a reply. I escalated through our AdWords contact since account support was, as expected, useless. Figured given overall our company spent millions a year maybe they could at least get this looked at. They were apologetic, but realistic in telling us that there was basically nothing that could be done and it was unlikely anyone would ever respond to the ticket so we should probably just register another Google account and cross our fingers that one didn&#x27;t get banned.<p>Found the old email the other day. Just passed 6 years with no response from the accounts team.')
