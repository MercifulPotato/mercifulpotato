Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[24829051], score=None, time=1603130680, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24828588, text='The submitted title (&quot;State of California Knew the Fires Were Coming&quot;) was badly editorialized, which breaks the site guideline about titles [1]. We take submission privileges away from accounts that do that, so please don&#x27;t do that.<p>All is not lost though. If you want to say what you think is important about an article, you&#x27;re welcome to. Indeed, that&#x27;s helpful. Just please do it as a comment in the thread. Then your view will be on a level playing field with everyone else&#x27;s [2].<p>The main thing we&#x27;re trying to avoid is submitters using the title field to promote their interpretation of an article. Titles are by far the largest influence on threads, so it&#x27;s important that they reflect the underlying content neutrally. Otherwise, simply by virtue of being the first (or luckiest) person to submit an article, one user would have the power to frame it for everyone else, and that would lead to an entirely different kind of site.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22level%20playing%20field%22%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22level%20playing%20field%22%...</a>')
