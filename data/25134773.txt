Even one hit to the deck will probably neutralize it&#x27;s ability to launch&#x2F;recover aircraft.<p>- Submarines and satellites are&#x2F;will be enough to locate surface naval fleets.<p>- Once you&#x27;ve located your target, you can simply overwhelm it&#x27;s defenses with massive missile barrage. Whether the missiles are ballistic, hypersonic, or traditional sea skimming AShm doesn&#x27;t matter. The economics are in the attackers favor. Defenders must target each incoming with multiple anti missiles, and can only carry so many. The enemy will simply win by sheer numbers as they have no practical carrying capacity.<p>It seems pretty clear that carriers would need to be far, far away from any near peer adversary in a shooting war. At least until enemy subs and satellites are out of the picture. Even then you risk ballistic missile attack from the Chinese interior if your location is somehow discovered.')
