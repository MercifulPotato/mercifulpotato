I did not care to touch any settings. I have a persistent tab in my browser and it keeps having the notification dot for silly reasons:<p>- My connection flaked out (duh, I closed the laptop lid).<p>- Connection for one of my contacts flaked out (?!).<p>- Something in the signatures changed.<p>I get how any of that might be a sign of compromise. But I really don&#x27;t care, I don&#x27;t use this for anything sensitive. And with only about 20% of notifications being about an actual message, I&#x27;ve developed a blindness towards it.<p>Edit: having written that, I&#x27;ve noticed it is not doing this right now. Come think of it, it might have stopped a while ago and I simply didn&#x27;t notice (c.f. developed blindness).')
