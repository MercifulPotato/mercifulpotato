The big one would be re-establishing communication networks, being able to coordinate with groups across a large area is obviously the first thing any group with power (or looking to establish power) will do after ensuring food, water and shelter. It&#x27;s pretty much a necessity if you want to maintain any power.<p>I could see embedded style sensors and technology being very practical, tools for measuring temperature&#x2F;humidity etc and logging it constantly, sensors to measure water levels in rain tanks, basic inventory systems for food, basic automations for things like farming (automatic watering systems&#x2F;collection systems even?)<p>Security is another one to think of: Sensors to detect people entering&#x2F;leaving an area, trail cams for hunting, alarms etc.')
