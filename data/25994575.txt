I spent most of my teen years learning &quot;good habits&quot; thru counseling and all that jazz. It wasn&#x27;t until I started Vyvanse that all those &quot;good habits&quot; that was taught to me actually made sense. All the meditation practice actually got put to good use when it comes to controlling anger.<p>I do wish I hadn&#x27;t waited 15+ years between diagnosis and medication, because it is life changing. I can now read HN&#x2F;reddit without getting sucked into a vortex of endlessness. Pomodoro actually works. And the inner chatter, they still exist. The TVs in the head are still on with all the channels going at once. But you now have a remote control with a mute key and you get to choose which channel you wanna focus on.<p>p&#x2F;s if you&#x27;re Aussie, Vyvanse is now on PBS so you no longer need to pay $100+ a month - rather it&#x27;s now $6 to $40 depending on your cirumstances.')
