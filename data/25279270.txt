Or see stats about the changelists submitted, bugs resolved, etc. of each person?  Or see their dot when they are viewing a document?<p>Maybe these Microsoft features crossed a threshold of creepiness past which the world should not go.  But to act like it&#x27;s a settled conversation, where right and wrong are so obvious that the issue was agreed upon long ago, does not match with reality in my opinion.')
