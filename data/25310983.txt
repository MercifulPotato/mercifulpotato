Not only is it a superior way to create and engage with communities (the only good subs are the comment&#x2F;text driven ones these days anyways, if I want stupid videos I&#x27;ll go to TikTok and Instagram where all that content comes from anyway), it&#x27;s more performant.<p>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on at Reddit HQ but I guess there&#x27;s a reason I&#x27;ve never heard anyone brag about working there.')
