I&#x27;ll definitely read this paper in full.<p>What I&#x27;ve gleaned so far:<p>One big primary difference between camps (pro, con) is emphasis on monetary policy versus fiscal policy.<p>As a layperson, it seems to me that all involved are still struggling with the metaphors, the narrative. What is the Ray Dalio level explanation?<p>Worse, fundamentally, I don&#x27;t think people yet agree the definition of &quot;money&quot;. On this, David Graeber&#x27;s book &quot;Debt: The First 5,000 Years&quot; blew my mind. Methinks this debate (and rhetoric) would become more constructive if the belligerents stopped wrestling with notions of money as a thing -- to be minted, exchanged, and hoarded -- and squinted a bit to think instead about debts.<p>So I&#x27;ll now share (again) my very draft metaphor:<p><pre><code>  Government spending is a loan, which is repaid thru taxes.\n</code></pre>\nAfter all, banks create money thru issuing debt, and governments are the biggest banks of all.<p>With this frame, addressing inequity then becomes a matter of who receives those loans and their consequent tax burden.')
