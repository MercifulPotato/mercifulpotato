But if plastic ends up in rivers and oceans it&#x27;s going to slowly fall apart and release particles. Tires always release particles when used.<p>The problem is how do you replace these? And how many that could be recycled or burned aren&#x27;t? A lot of packaging plastic doesn&#x27;t end up in the right place, so the only way to get a significant reduction here is to get rid of any non-essential use. And we should start where there is the most plastic used. Both of these together point to single use plastics in food packaging.<p>You don&#x27;t need to package vegetables and fruit in plastic. Recycled paper bags do just fine.<p>It&#x27;s an easy reduction.')
