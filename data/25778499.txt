If you&#x27;re lucky, you have the task of hounding a team within your company to get their data management practices in order. And the conversation there is whether they should make their job harder in order to make your job easier.<p>Unfortunately, data engineers rarely deal with purely in-house data. You&#x27;re gonna be pulling data from a variety of data sources. I can assure you that if you&#x27;re pulling from government data sources, you&#x27;re gonna have a hell of a time. Speaking from direct experience, my team is probably going to spend $10M&#x2F;year just trying to keep a government dataset in order, because they won&#x27;t do it themselves. I&#x27;m talking lawyers, legal analysts, data engineers, data scientists, data entry personnel, etc.. just to fix data that should have never been broken in the first place.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be a shock that cleaning the data is the path of least resistance for many.')
