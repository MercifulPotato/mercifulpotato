It always comes from people who have better jobs and more stable income<p>I grew up in dirt poor family of 6 in a post civil war country and my mother is a nurse - I&#x27;m very familiar with the realities of these jobs. I just know for a fact that if a nurse would start making 2x her salary a lot of people would suddenly not have access to assisted care. It&#x27;s a shitty situation - but supply of cheap labor solves the problems of poor people - if you can&#x27;t see that you&#x27;re out of touch.<p>Rich and well off people will always have access - they already pay more anyway for quality.')
