I don&#x27;t buy the &quot;SF is not very fun during the pandemic&quot; rationale as more special than any other notable city, and NYC tends to have less space than SF. To me, that says the SF case has more complexity. IMO, the key factor here is that there appears to be a much higher ratio of people that were primarily there because work was best there, where many other cities have populations that tend to choose the city in question specifically more than happen upon it.')
