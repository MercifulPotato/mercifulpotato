I&#x27;ve messed around making a game using this concept... An infinite 2D open world where people&#x27;s chat messages appear over their heads. If they&#x27;re speaking using the encrypted chat and they haven&#x27;t shared their private key with you, it&#x27;s gibberish. All messages and player locations are sent to all players, and you can zoom visibility in and out so you can&#x27;t correlate location to find out who&#x27;s talking to whom since everyone can theoretically see the whole map.')
