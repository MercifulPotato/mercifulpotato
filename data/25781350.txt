Running it in cli mode was sufficient for me, but i was also able to use GUI mode by installing an X Server (VcXsrv i think) on Windows and making WSL work with that. It makes sense to use it from WSL, if you do your development work there as well. Also, it was before WSL 2, so i don&#x27;t know if anything&#x27;s changed now.')
