Imagine being a dope fiend .... yep; still not imagining it. Imagine being a &lt;insert another degenerate and completely non sympathetic category of person&gt; -no thank you!<p>Community decency laws used to work just fine, and I do not see their eradication as an improvement in the over all state of the human race. Just like anti-gambling laws; and gambling is at least not pumped into every household.<p>Every society has a right to chose the levels of degeneracy allowed: necrophilia, prostitution, drug use and bestiality are all victimless crimes as well which should be allowed via your imbecile version of &quot;liberal paradigms.&quot; Looking forward to your spirited defence of philip morris brand heroin-addicted prostitutes being voluntarily violated and eaten alive by wild beasts for family viewing on early evening television.<p>Denmark doesn&#x27;t get to claim &quot;muh cummies&quot; as a great cultural achievement.
