It might not be good for every candidate, but having a conversation about the code seems less stressful to me than having the interviewer bring out a whiteboard and essentially say, &quot;Please perform for me!&quot;<p>You say:<p>&gt; One issue was the syntax was so weird compared to the type of code I&#x27;m used to writing and reading from others in library code that it was hard for me to comprehend the logic without the benefit of looking it up.<p>From the point of view of an interviewer, that&#x27;s feedback I&#x27;d be interested in. One problem I&#x27;ve seen in some of our code is an engineer using a completely valid but very obscure method of doing something, and then the rest of us having difficulty maintaining it. I would want to hear, &quot;this looks hard to maintain.&quot; But I understand that in an interview, it can be difficult to assess what the interviewer wants to hear and that can be nerve-racking. I personally think take-homes are a reasonable compromise, but not everyone does.')
