I&#x27;ve had a lot of debugging nightmares, but thankfully never anything as bad as that.<p>One thing that looks fishy is this branch:<p><pre><code>  if (container_tasks_len == max_container_tasks) {\n    printk(&quot;cplayground: ERROR: container_tasks list hit capacity! We &quot;\n    &quot;may be missing processes from the procfile output.\\n&quot;);\n    break;\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nSince you said printk can block, why isn&#x27;t calling it in the rcu critical section a bug? Is it because you immediately break afterwards and don&#x27;t try to reference the next task?')
