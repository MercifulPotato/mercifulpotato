There are many people who have legitimate need to hide where they live (by buying assets under a shell): victims of stalking or domestic violence; members of minority groups such as LBGT in very religious areas; reporters; public figures who are being targeted by political enemies; whistle blowers; famous people; corporate executives; high net worth individuals; anyone who angers law enforcement with legal activity; etc. In the age of public record aggregation, it is trivially easy for anyone to locate the average person, let alone someone with the privilege level of law enforcement who can do so with effectively no oversight. As someone who received death threats because of who their parent worked for and used to have armed security outside of their house, I have strong feelings about this issue.')
