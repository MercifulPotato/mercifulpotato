You can still have new Etherum contracts that are really interesting. My favourite is flash loan, which is a loan inside a callback as long as you give back the money inside the same transaction.<p>With Bitcoin the improvements come from increasing the security of the code base even more, to be able to store many trillions of dollars worth of value safely. Examples are unit tests that find bugs in the compiler or the CPU. It may be not fun, but one of the most critical infrastructures we have for the 21st century.')
