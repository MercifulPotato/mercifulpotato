But is actually quite possible to defeat USA on the seas and on land if different countries join against it.<p>Europe is not Iraq or Afganistan, as a whole, it is stronger than the US. I have lived and worked in China(and the US) and while I believe they way weaker(China) than what they project, they can f*ck the world immensely. They can contaminate the Pacific Ocean (with radioactivity and other poisons) forever.<p>BTW most of the intelligent and educated(engineers, scientists) people in the US comes from outside the US. Not reasonable to believe they will contribute against fighting their own countries.<p>This &quot;war on everything&quot; American mentality needs to stop.')
