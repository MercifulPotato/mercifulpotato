Primarily through huge stock grants as part of their multi-million dollar compensation packages.<p>2) Companies always discuss employee compensation, especially raises and bonuses, in terms of the value an employee has relative to their peers.<p>So, it&#x27;s no wonder that people believe that their value has something to do with their compensation: it&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve been told by the companies themselves; it&#x27;s how the most visible employees (leadership) are compensated.')
