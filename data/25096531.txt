Having minimal standards on free expression is probably a good thing, lest they get kicked off all the app stores.<p>When I tried Parler there were plenty of accounts that exist solely to troll Trump and his supporters, none of which were banned. Perhaps that Cow account was banned for reasons other than its speech.')
