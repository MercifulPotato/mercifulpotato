The race got cancelled due to COVID and they refused to give us a refund. Eventually we asked for a charge back and the credit card refused saying the &quot;organizer claims they settled it&quot;. Indeed, by promising us future tickets that are worthless to us (VR46 is retiring, we have kids and need to organize, etc). This was in the summer.<p>MotoGP just refunded us the tickets, a year after we purchased them.
