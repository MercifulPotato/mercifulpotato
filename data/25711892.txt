The problem is I&#x27;m not sure you can reason with illogic like that, especially people who&#x27;re angry and have been manipulated for years to decades to more or less blindly hate, lacking critical thinking and&#x2F;or integrity behind their thinking - and will more than likely be quickly ban if calmly pointing out the definition of inciting, and likewise pointing out that Twitter is a private platform - and the internet is reflexively neutral in America.<p>You&#x27;re correct though the deplatforming will be inflammatory, but the self-made bubble filter these communities of like-minded people are already on a runaway train that&#x27;s only going to stop when real world circumstances don&#x27;t allow them to just ban the confrontation digitally, when reality will hit them.<p>As I posted elsewhere, there&#x27;s a lot of healing necessary due to multi-generational dis-ease progression - healing to open people&#x27;s hearts and minds, so they can develop their critical thinking and logic that&#x27;s influenced by the heart to develop empathy; I discuss this further in a comment from yesterday - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25702673" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25702673</a>')
