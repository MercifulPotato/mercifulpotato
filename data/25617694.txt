I&#x27;ve already been running into Defender problems myself.<p>Defender kept trying to quarantine my Windows hosts file so I had to add it as an exception but then 3 weeks later it started doing the same to my WSL2 Ubuntu&#x27;s unmodified hosts file.<p>I&#x27;m glad I opted for Ubuntu and manually installing tools that I need instead of using the Kali subsystem.
