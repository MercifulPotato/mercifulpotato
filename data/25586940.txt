Just because an iPhone is &quot;made&quot; in China does not mean it&#x27;s a Chinese phone. Apple have rigorous standards of quality control and factory management, they have oversight. \nA Chinese product, would be something that is designed in China and also made by Chinese production. Those are the Chinesium that have little to no quality control and are Chinese products. iPhones are not Chinese products, they are being built in China to Apple standards. \nI would agree with you that Anker seem to make nice products of a higher quality.')
