Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605922690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25166923, text='&gt;&gt; you&#x27;re implying &quot;nuclear = bad because France is moving away from it&quot; which is not what France is doing.<p>&gt; They literally are, and have formally said so<p><i>Citation needed.</i><p>As I stated in another reply to you, reducing dependence on nuclear has a lot of advantages unrelated to &quot;nuclear is bad&quot; or &quot;nuclear is not clean&quot; or etc. Like I said before, no matter what your energy source is, 75% of your power being produced from a singular source is not a good idea. You may be familiar with the old saying &quot;don&#x27;t put all your eggs in one basket.&quot; This is the same reason we don&#x27;t invest in a single stock. Dropping to 50% is far from getting rid of nuclear and it is an absurd claim.<p>&gt;  But that does not change the fact that many of the reactors will not be replaced when they hit end-of-life.<p>Many, but many are planed to be replaced. You&#x27;re focusing too much on the reduction aspect. Reduction is not elimination. France has no plans on eliminating nuclear in the foreseeable future. The only way this would happen is if ITER was a major success and small versions could reliably be developed and deployed. I&#x27;m not counting on that.')
