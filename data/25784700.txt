Sports are not a major focus at my school, so our TV budget is relatively small. That makes most good graphics playout software out of our reach ($5-10k+).<p>I found a framework called NodeCG [0] that let us build graphics that are essentially just web pages with transparent background (sent over the network to our video switcher). The problem is that is rather bloated in my opinion. What I want is to essentially have a WebSocket server that acts as a key-value store, that accepts connections from data-collecting scripts (scoreboard, stats XML, etc) and forwards that to my graphics pages. Then, using Alpine (we use Vue right now), all I have to do is define which data goes where, rather than needing a callback for each k&#x2F;v pair.<p>Hopefully, on top of that, I can build a WYSIWYG builder for the non-technical folks in our studio. Given that all of our pages have a fixed 1080p size, does anyone know of a good way to build this sort of thing?')
