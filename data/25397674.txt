My favorite thing about it was how working on my technique or a particularly tricky rhythmic pattern tickled my brain. I often found that I went through a few phases: “ahrg, this is impossible!”, “getting there but sloppy” and finally, often suddenly (after a good night’s sleep) “this is easy! I don’t know how I was ever not able to do this”.<p>Using vim and learning new features tickles my brain in kinda the same way. I don’t care much for the hacker credits. It’s a fun variety in my work day to practice some little feature that I read about, and it doesn’t look like I’ll run out of new stuff to check out anytime soon.')
