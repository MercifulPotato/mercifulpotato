Or at least, in some sort of closed-off execution context?<p>I&#x27;m thinking of Widevine level 1 DRM, for example. If I remember correctly, it mandates that all of the decryption has to happen in a &quot;Trusted Execution Environment&quot;, which seems to mean a hardware enclave. I think this effectively locks the user out of the whole decryption phase, which means that you <i>don&#x27;t</i> get to record your screen.<p>I might be wrong about this, though. Might have to do a little research.<p>(Funnily enough, just looking for information right now turns up this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21307308" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21307308</a> HN post, which does contain some interesting information)')
