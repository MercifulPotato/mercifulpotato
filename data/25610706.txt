There are many large, profitable companies (&gt;50k people) who don&#x27;t need public or media attention to fire the whole managerial line-org once abuse is discovered and then hold several workshops for all senior employees and managers detailing out what exactly is acceptable in the workplace and what is not.<p>In-fact you don&#x27;t get your bonus if you don&#x27;t attend these workshops and score in these tests. HR regularly queries all low-level employees about their work&#x2F;life balance and other other work-place issues and regularly sends feedback to senior management. Actually senior management even regularly has meetings with entry-level employees with team leads and management sent away from the room to obtain proper assessment.<p>But then this is a German company and not a US one. I will never work for a US MNC in my life after the bad experience I had early in my career.')
