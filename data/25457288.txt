Do you have effectively unlimited memory, unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, zero latency and infinitely scalable CPU available for the process(es) you are responsible for? Can you be sure that given system call is available and behaves exactly the same everywhere?<p>Of course not. If you were to act as if these things were true at all times, you would create something with sub-par performance and reliability, eventually driving up the cost of deployments to impossible levels.')
