Really? That is the a plan of priorities for pacman?<p>Well, wasn&#x27;t huge fan of previous diff implementation either - making diffs of already compressed data was a big stopper for significant reduction of bandwidth. But still 20-30% on average for rolling distro is significant improvement. And I bet that with proper unrolling compressed files then making diff and then getting it back together it would bring another &quot;extra&quot; 20-40% savings.')
