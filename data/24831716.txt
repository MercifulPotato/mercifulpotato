The problem is that as a society we are not anywhere close to treating nuclear power as a necessity. In fact, the present inertia is to move away from nuclear, with much of new nuclear reactor projects being cancelled, and a number of existing reactors actually closing. There is tepid support for nuclear AT BEST by the public and representatives, and nuclear is still vilified by environmentalist and the fossil fuel lobby (i.e. natural gas companies).<p>Given that reality, we&#x27;re looking at decades at best. Basically we need to see renewables through to the end and be convinced that they cannot power a modern economy before there can be any shift.')
