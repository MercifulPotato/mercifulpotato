Its paying content creators.<p>if you&#x27;re talking about youtube here (it&#x27;s not clear from your context), youtube is paying content creators with 55% of revenue from an ad (since YT takes a 45% cut).<p>But YT only pays out when there&#x27;s some $100 dollars of accumulated revenue for the content creator - hence there&#x27;s also some arbitrage interest income that YT gets to earn 100%.')
