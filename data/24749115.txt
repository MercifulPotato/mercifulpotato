Same with the mining and purification of steel and aluminum to produce windmills.<p>But a lot of those materials are renewable, or becoming more renewable. Most&#x2F;all materials are used in dozens of other things that are essential to modern society, so investing in making mining cleaner and making recycling more efficient and cheaper is not optional. The fact that renewables create more demand for materials, and more waste, can be a good thing, as economies of scale can make investments in efficiency and recycling techniques more viable.<p>In a solar&#x2F;wind power plant, all of the materials can in principle be reused quickly, given decent recycling technology.<p>Hell, now we&#x27;re even building windmills out of wood again, and turns out they&#x27;re stronger&#x2F;better than with concrete&#x2F;steel.<p>It&#x27;s not just the fuel that&#x27;s waste, when decommissioning the power plant you also have a lot of low-level radioactive material that can&#x27;t easily be recycled&#x2F;reused. Not a huge problem, but at a fundamental level it&#x27;s worse than renewables.')
