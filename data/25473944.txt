Say you want to find a risotto recipe and a Reddit thread comes up. So you go there and it’s a question and comments have the answers. Now with AMP you can only see so much of the comments, can’t upvote&#x2F;downvote, cannot expand&#x2F;collapse comments, can’t see the URL, your light&#x2F;dark mode preferences stored on Reddit isn’t respected, and the whole thing is weirdly slow and has scrolling issues. And the best part is that the whole bottom half of the page is taken up by links to random other Reddit posts that have nothing to do with the one you’re looking at. It is a shitty shitty experience to the point if it was invented by AOL we would all be laughing at it.')
