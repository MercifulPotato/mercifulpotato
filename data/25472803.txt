That way you can document a particular process directly in slack and everyone from your team can access it.\nFor example, you can create an hr command to save useful links for your team.<p>I had the idea of building this app because I kept forgetting how to use a particular command on another project of mine. So with this app, I can now document this process and retrieve it quickly for my team and me.<p>If you are wondering, I used Nodejs, expressjs, Slack API, and Stripe to create the app.<p>Let me know if you have a question!')
