It&#x27;s worth a read, and I highly encourage you to read the linked articles and exerpts. That should be a good start to a conversation if you want to continue. Another example I will refer people to isn&#x27;t a US case, but is one of the better documented cases, the Dutroux Affair aka The Belgian X-Files.

Wikipedia is heavily controlled on these topics, so don&#x27;t reference it expecting to find details on the subject. A good example of this editorial censorship would be the Franklin Scandal. If one were to just read the wiki entry one would walk away thinking it was just a hoax, which isn&#x27;t even close to the truth.')
