One year it&#x27;s a messenger of trade and peace. Another year it&#x27;s an anti-trade anti-peace rambler.<p>Of course, other democracies have similar issues. But none are as sharply polarized as the US forced two-party system, where the objective of each party is to run on a platform to undo the other.
