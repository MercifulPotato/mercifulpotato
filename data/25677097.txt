Crashes all the time for no reason, at some point it got an update and half the functionality just vanished into thin air. I will NEVER buy another Google powered TV, heck I might never even buy another smart TV (unless Apple releases one, because my Apple TV 4k and HD before that have been flawless for my needs!)')
