I use specific folders as reading&#x2F;watching&#x2F;listening queues.<p>Best of all it is FLOSS software, which is an absolute requirement for me to future-proof my use, and has an API that can be used to interact with external software. I use it for example as a document &quot;backend&quot; for my emacs org-mode journal (via the zotxt-emacs package).<p>There is an online sync service offered at a very reasonable cost (including a free tier). This is one of the very rare online services I&#x27;m paying money for. My understanding is that the sync server is open-source, but not production ready for self-hosting yet. The devs are supposedly working on it.<p>I strongly recommend you at least take a look.')
