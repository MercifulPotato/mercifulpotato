Interestingly though I fall on the other side of the remote work issue - I cannot wait to return to the office. My brain is quite stubborn about categorizing spaces; my computer room at home is where I do some side project programming and a fair amount of gaming. Having to try to recategorize it as a working space has proven impossible, and I don&#x27;t really have any other space in this house, with my wife also working remotely.<p>Besides, more generally the drive to the office helps put me in work mode. The whole office building is a place where work happens. Then the drive home helps put me in leisure mode. Without those neatly coded space&#x2F;time contexts I have been seriously struggling.<p>Everybody that keeps talking about how the world is going remote has been giving me a fair amount of anxiety. If I lose my office I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m going to function. Besides, my coworkers and I miss seeing each other and being able to work together in person. We don&#x27;t do <i>much</i> pair programming, but when we do, trying to do so over screen share has proven to be significantly less productive.<p>But then again, I am lucky to have an amazing team of people who I genuinely enjoy being around, and who are all very respectful of quiet time to work when needed. I&#x27;m also definitely an introvert but maybe less so than the average dev.. I miss social contact!')
