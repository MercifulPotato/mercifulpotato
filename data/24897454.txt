What matters is the beliefs they have and the outcomes of these beliefs.<p>For example, if you think about support gay marriage and LGBT nondiscrimination protections, these are things that would have been framed as fringe progressive ideas a few decades ago, and in the US it&#x27;s still framed as a &quot;culture war&quot; issue. However, if you are in the LGBT community, these things DO have an impact and will affect your life. It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether 30% of the population supports these things or 60%.')
