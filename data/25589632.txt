It&#x27;s like these people think we weren&#x27;t around when Flash was a thing or they just have rose colored nostalgia glasses on.<p>Flash was absolutely horrendous. Also, people keep talking about how easy it was to create stuff in it and how JS&#x2F;HTML involves too much coding. This is more revisionist history - Flash had its own proprietary scripting language called ActionScript and you definitely needed to have some coding skill to do most things in Flash beyond basic animations.')
