The only practical improvement you can make is containers (or similar).<p>To me this basically reads as &quot;we added a bunch of complexity on top of the problem without actually solving it&quot;. Package managers are supposed to prevent conflicts and manage giant dependency graphs, but they&#x27;re so shit at doing that while actually allowing people to use whatever software they want that we&#x27;ve invented containers to keep everything separate again.')
