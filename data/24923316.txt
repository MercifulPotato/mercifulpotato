It depends on how you view Twitter. If you view Twitter as a service provider, then net neutrality rules should be applied to them as well. But if you view them as a platform, they&#x27;re distinct and ought to have greater control. Like a forum, should net neutrality proponents argue against moderators like dang here on HN to be consistent? That&#x27;s absurd.<p>But Ted Cruz (and others) are trying to argue that Twitter should be considered closer to a service provider (and thus remain &quot;neutral&quot;, whatever that means here) than a platform&#x2F;publisher (which can control its content more). But Ted Cruz also argues that net neutrality proponents are &quot;snowflakes&quot; and net neutrality is wrong. It would be funnier if the consequences weren&#x27;t so potentially severe.')
