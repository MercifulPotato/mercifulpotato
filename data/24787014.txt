A custom map produced using OSMaps, some copy+paste magic, with some added notes (navigation hints, checkpoint cut-offs &amp; other pacing notes, emergency numbers), printed on a couple of A4 or A5 sheets of &quot;indestructible&quot; paper, is much more convenient than carrying the full map of the area, or two maps if your route falls over a boundary.<p>Yes, most of us use GPS watches and have detailed maps on our phones too, but tech can &amp; will fail and when it does while you are a little off course you&#x27;ll be glad you have the paper map (and, of course, the ability to read it).<p>There is no need for everyone to have one though: I&#x27;m happy to print copies of my maps for others, I know a few people who don&#x27;t have a printer of their own (they tend to use one at work if needed, or like your suggestion a local library).<p>I also like printing some things to read and scribble notes on away from the screen. e-ink implementations of this sort of thing are either expensive, so I&#x27;ve not tried them, or smaller than I&#x27;d like, or don&#x27;t work well (big, inexpensive, works well, pick at most two).')
