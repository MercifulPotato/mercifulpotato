So if each group had an equal number of people, and 100 people in the control group got sick, but only 5 people who received the vaccine group got sick, the efficacy rate would be 95%.<p>The hope, of course, is that the vaccine&#x27;s effectiveness (how well it does at preventing covid) is close to the efficacy, but it&#x27;s very hard to know for sure.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s best to have the trials spread out among demographics and even locations, to better try and identify what may cause the vaccine to be more or less effective.')
