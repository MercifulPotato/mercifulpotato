Almost everyone breaks the speed limit here, or can we just accept that sometimes people have good reasons for breaking the rules?<p>Do we want all that information in the hands of already powerful people so that they can selectively enforce it against their enemies? (admittedly less of a problem here in Norway, but you catch my drift).')
