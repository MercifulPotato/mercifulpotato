Don&#x27;t understand me wrong, I don&#x27;t take a lot of drugs. My experience is limited to one night on MDMA in Ibiza, one night on shrooms in Amsterdam and a whole lot of nights on weed.<p>I seem to suddenly understand everything about myself and the world when I smoke weed. It really puts me into the &quot;Everything is connected and everything repeats itself&quot;-mood, which I&#x27;ve heard from LSD trips. That all that&#x27;s happening is supposed to happen, doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s objectively or subjectively bad or good right at that moment.<p>MDMA made me insanely happy about myself and my surroundings for an hour. It was like feeling pure joy and happiness for an hour straight. Although I took it in Ibiza, I spent the night listening to music on the couch in the AirBNB I had rented. I read that a lof of people feel depressive and blue for a couple of days after taking MDMA. For me, it was different - I felt content and insanely relaxed for a couple of days, but in a very good way. Still 100% in touch with the world, just happy. But that effect went away in an instant which I&#x27;ve really felt. Went from smiling and being happy back to normal. Not sad or depressed, just normal.<p>I have a huge admiration and respect for psychoactive drugs. I would never consider taking Heroin, Crystal Meth etc., but I would really like to try LSD and other substances. \nIt also seems like THC helps me live with ADHD better than any official, legal pill.<p>All that being said, I don&#x27;t really know how to handle drugs in the long run. I&#x27;m in my early twenties, so maybe it&#x27;s normal to have a feeling of being lost and not knowing what I should really be doing with my life. I live in a nice apartment, earn good money, ride a beautiful motorbike and have a wonderful girlfriend. But except for my girlfriend, none of these things make me truly happy.<p>If I don&#x27;t smoke weed for a long time, I seem to loose myself. But the same can be said for when I start smoking too much, too frequently. I don&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m trying to say, but reading your comment made me think about that topic :)')
