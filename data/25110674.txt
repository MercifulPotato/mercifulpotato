I would like less polarisation. Do you?<p>Is wanting less polarisation and more understanding wanting the world one way? Seems like it might be the opposite. Seems also that those who are polarised want the world one way in opposition to the other group who wants the world the other. Is there a way to undo that? Would that way be painful? I think most people don&#x27;t like to change their minds. It&#x27;s painful. But just because it&#x27;s painful, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not possible or that it might be positive.<p>How do we achieve polarization?<p>How is actual peace is the real world achieved?<p>Wanting things to be one way is bigotry. I wish things to be understood more and less bigotry!<p>What are my beliefs? How have I advocated for them? I see only an appeal for common ground, understanding and therefore less bigotry overall.')
