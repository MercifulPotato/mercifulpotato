When Bill Gates started publishing Smart Basic (or whatever) in magazines, I got a copy and saw what crap it was. I could do better.<p>Why didn&#x27;t I? That was my very first thought. The reason was, I had to work halftime to pay tuition and buy food. I was mired in working to live. Ol Bill had a family to support him as he bought resources (ads in magazines etc), recruited staff, took meetings etc. Always a hot meal on the table when he got home from a big day.<p>One result of a Basic Income: more folks can be entrepreneurs, if they&#x27;re willing to live off that few dollars a month. It could make all the difference.')
