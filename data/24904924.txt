Item(by='GoblinSlayer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603780206, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24903222, text='From youtube-dl readme:<p>---<p>As a matter of policy (as well as legality), youtube-dl does not include support for services that specialize in infringing copyright. As a rule of thumb, if you cannot easily find a video that the service is quite obviously allowed to distribute (i.e. that has been uploaded by the creator, the creator&#x27;s distributor, or is published under a free license), the service is probably unfit for inclusion to youtube-dl.<p>A note on the service that they don&#x27;t host the infringing content, but just link to those who do, is evidence that the service should not be included into youtube-dl. The same goes for any DMCA note when the whole front page of the service is filled with videos they are not allowed to distribute. A &quot;fair use&quot; note is equally unconvincing if the service shows copyright-protected videos in full without authorization.<p>Support requests for services that do purchase the rights to distribute their content are perfectly fine though. If in doubt, you can simply include a source that mentions the legitimate purchase of content.<p>---')
