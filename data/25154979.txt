I&#x27;m not picky.<p>Theres been some technical arguments but they require some expertise to evaluate and probably aren&#x27;t suited for a presser.<p>&gt; But that&#x27;s the problem, isn&#x27;t it? You want the standard of evidence for reporting an allegation (e.g. &quot;the election was stolen&quot;) to place the burden of proof on the listener (&quot;Well, you can&#x27;t prove the election was NOT stolen, can you?&quot;).<p>its a bit ironic that you can ignore existing evidence in favor of a contrary belief but claim the other side isn&#x27;t presenting evidence.<p>&gt; And that&#x27;s pretty much the definition of &quot;fake news&quot;. It&#x27;s a lie. And they tell the lie because they know you&#x27;ll believe it. And that&#x27;s the problem. Not &quot;information overload&quot;.<p>Oh I don&#x27;t believe shit. its just odd that people are so insistent that this election was all on the up and up with no evidence whereas they aren&#x27;t even willing to consider that someone might cheat in an election because &quot;that would leave evidence and I haven&#x27;t seen any&quot;')
