Computer Science is not programming, but instead a subset of mathematics. A computer is to a computer scientist what a telescope is to an astronomer. Software Engineering is programming (though maybe the reverse is not true), and though many will insist that it is, I fail to see how it can be engineering unless a hair styist is also a hair style engineer.')
