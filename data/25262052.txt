The inlaw is not thought of as a person, but as the parents&#x27; pension plan. So if you marry into a family like that, it&#x27;s important you know the story beforehand.<p>(There&#x27;s an old Chinese riddle about &quot;Who would you save if your mother and wife fell in the river?&quot; The only acceptable answer is &quot;mother.&quot;)<p>For Filipinos, basically the same thing, except there was no &quot;one child&quot; policy as in China. However, their family is much more important than some outsider like you, so again, it&#x27;s something you want to discuss and think about before getting involved.')
