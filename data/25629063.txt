The only model I used in this project is the YOLOv4 object detection model to detect the ball in each frame. I collected about 200 images to train it.<p>For the other parts like the tracking and the overlay timing, I programmed it by myself.<p>I implemented SORT algorithm for tracking the ball and some programming logic to capture the overlay timing from each clip.')
