Their job is more like, know when you should use TLS and when you shouldn&#x27;t and know what it does and does not protect against.<p>A security engineer is just as likely to derive a tls cipher config from first principles instead of googling&#x2F;looking at ssllabs as a programmer is likely to reverse a binary tree from scratch instead of using a library or searching stack overflow.<p>Engineers (of any stripe) aren&#x27;t hired to recite random knowledge, they&#x27;re hired to know what knowledge is appropriate to apply to a particular situation.')
