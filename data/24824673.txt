A friend of mine suggested me LyX many years ago - he wrote a thesis on their EE department. On the other hand, we in the Math department had to learn Latex, because well, it is standard in that field.<p>These days I&#x27;m using org-mode [1] because I can easily dump something in Latex&#x2F;PDF (which I prefer) and export that in Word or odt (which I don&#x27;t like) but is standard in the corporate world. However, when I see someone is struggling with Latex (or is scared of it), I suggest LyX with all my heart. I believe LyX can be a good entry for Latex world.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orgmode.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orgmode.org</a>')
