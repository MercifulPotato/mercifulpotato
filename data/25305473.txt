This is what we should be focusing on, rather than, what, complaining that Pornhub doesn&#x27;t have some sort of magical age-detecting AI?<p>This is the part I never understand about CP being shared among high school kids. Why are the schools and police not coming down on the high school kids sharing CP? Make it really simple, receive CP and don&#x27;t report it, you will get punished. CP is no joke and letting people off who have received it and not reported it is not sending a proper message to these High School kids.')
