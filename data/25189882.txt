Using their own hardware vs Intel hasn&#x27;t prevented that.  Do you think there&#x27;s something else that has prevented them, related to their hardware?  If they limited it a year ago, people would have the option to just use their macbook for Windows or Linux?  Now they won&#x27;t?<p>I&#x27;m just genuinely confused as to why people seem to think that [a] Apple is planning to switch to a locked down ecosystem on their notebooks and [b] Apple has been somehow limited in doing this until they had their own &quot;silicon&quot;.')
