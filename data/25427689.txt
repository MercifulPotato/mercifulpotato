When you are small you can make progress as you are invisible to the big guys.

This requires recruiting all sorts of allies, like (in this case) some significant law firms, which means figuring out for them what&#x27;s in it for them.  Or 2 - get a bit of traction and then raise so much money that you can in fact stand up to the big guys.  But you need a business model that pays the investors back.  Also not easy.')
