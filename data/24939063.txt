If it&#x27;s unacceptable for women to work and compete with men for wealth and power, men will make enough to support their entire families, allowing at least one parent to always be there to raise children properly, instead of outsourcing that to strangers -- same for elderly care.<p>Is it not socially unacceptable for men to abuse their wives?  Yet it still happens.  So I don’t know what you’re going on about atomism and whatnot, but I’m happy my sisters and my daughters will have the ability to stand on their own.<p>And if women’s freedom causes the problem of parents not having enough time to spend with children, then that has something to do with minimum wage and overtime&#x2F;maximum hours at work laws than it does women’s freedom.')
