Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25567756], score=None, time=1609227009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25565110, text='I&#x27;ve recently taken a plunge and bought a modified GameBoy Advance(not the SP) with a backlit IPS screen. My 8 year old self would have gone insane seeing such a thing, it&#x27;s beautiful, crisp and makes playing all the original games a pleasure again, there&#x27;s something to be said about playing on &quot;original&quot; hardware(I know the screen isn&#x27;t original but I also have an unmodded GameBoy Colour and it&#x27;s exactly as I remember - an exercise in sitting somewhere near a light source to see anything, but not near enough so that you can&#x27;t see anything on the screen). Would highly recommend if someone fancies a good dose of nostalgia.')
