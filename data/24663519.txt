Never in my life I observed any kind of bias against christians or muslims at workplace.<p>Coming to the cast issues, there was a post here last week on the same topic. I extended the discussion to a WhatsApp group of 70+ colleagues&#x2F;friends who come from different backgrounds. I wanted to validate if I am the odd one, who has almost never observed cast based issues either. After two days of long discussion, we came to a conclusion that we tend to show more affinity to the people who speak our native language or&#x2F;and come from same regional roots, than our cast and religion.<p>Not denying that that the later doesn&#x27;t exist at all, I feel this whole topic is too exaggerated.<p>Disclaimer: My experience is limited to 20 years of while collar profession (only).')
