Just buy those low-power x86 mini-itx boards with 4GB memory and 4 SATA ports along with gigabit ethernet, they&#x27;re around $150?<p>Note the smaller size of RPi-etc makes no sense when you&#x27;re going to host 4 hard drives anyways which takes quite some space on their own, and you need a decent PSU for the drives too, and a solid case as well, etc.<p>Just buy those ASRock mini-itx boards at newsegg or somewhere and let RPi do what it&#x27;s best at.')
