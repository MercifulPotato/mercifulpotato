The SoC is made on 28nm (Series X|S 7nm) process so physically attacking it is very hard&#x2F;expensive.<p>Also goes into the difference between Windows (PC) and Xbox (Console) security. On PC the owner&#x2F;admin wants the help keep the system secure as it gets attacked by malicious parties from the internet. On console the owner is usually the bad guy (the one doing the attacking) and thus needs a very different approach.<p>Also stuff like Microsoft Pluton are direct descendants of the stuff done for Xbox and Live.')
