If the misinformation problem causes very adverse effects there are of course people who will come to see your platform as a bad thing and will either pressure or legislate you to change.<p>My previous example about the republican ballot shredding was one where a kid thought we would post a tweet that he was shredding ballots because he thought it would be funny. This not only caused an entire news cycle about how republicans that the entire process was unfair, but seriously called into the question the staff and security of those working on the elections. Many of them faced threats for an issue they didn’t know existed because of this tweet. Similarly if you have people showing up to pizza shops inciting violence because they believed Hillary Clinton was hiding children in the basement your platform will ultimately be seen as a conduit for this type behavior. It’s no different from yelling fire in a movie theater.<p>It doesn’t matter if <i>you</i> individually carefully select and get who you follow, you have to ensure everyone else acts accordingly - and as we can see they won’t.<p>You have to ask yourself if your platform was large enough to have these issues in the real world what would you do to minimize it - because if you don’t Congress will and the hammer of the state is very blunt.')
