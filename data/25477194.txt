If it&#x27;s a lone sheet of paper, I tend to just lay it flat against my cello and annotate there (and I must be careful not to mark the wood underneath the paper).<p>2) Correct. But so do good bindings, to a lesser extent. Many bindings aren&#x27;t easy to lay flat, though.<p>3) That depends. If you play the piano, a whole collection of studies sure will be heavy. But a melodic instrument playing a focused piece you will go through? No heavier than separate sheets: you&#x27;ll use them all anyway.<p>4) That issue is mitigated by most good editions, where the bottom right corner of the right page is a pause long enough to let you turn. I&#x27;ve seen many poor editions that <i>could</i> be laid out properly, but weren&#x27;t.')
