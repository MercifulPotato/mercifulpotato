Item(by='nrmitchi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602700203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24778652, text='I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d agree.<p>From personal experience speaking with larger companies (not FAANG, but larger &quot;start-up&quot;), I was always seeing an even larger difference. Think &quot;~150-170 in Austin, 225-250 in SF&quot;. You may want to knock my negotiation skills, and perhaps you have a point there that I could have pushed their initial non-SF numbers up, but these were at earlier-stage discussions and sharing those numbers seemed &quot;reasonable&quot; to them. And this was Austin, a city which the aforementioned salary calculator only gives a -20% &quot;adjustment&quot;.<p>Note that even that 30% is for a &quot;large&quot; AR city. Anyone else in that state is given a 37(!)% reduction.<p>In my opinion, which I&#x27;ve been trying to wrangle into a coherent blog post over the last couple of days, any adjustments like this should be an absolute-dollar-number figure. Percentages don&#x27;t make sense at _either_ extreme. A 60k&#x2F;year position with a 20% &quot;move to SF&quot; upward adjustment? That is unlikely to even cover the change in rent. 400k&#x2F;year with a 20% adjustment? Calling that &quot;cost of living&quot; is bonkers.')
