So it was basically the Borg collective- you, mindless drone repair plamsa conduit x347B.<p>I was not able to use my creativity and problem solving and it was soul killing. I am now back in Small-Mid Enterprise and I love it. I get to design solutions from the ground up, sell them to other teams and build consensus then slam through development and implementation. So I guess my lesson was, never join a megacorp again- people are expendable there and there is no value placed on their individuality.')
