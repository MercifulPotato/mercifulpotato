One reason for  this was well expressed by President Kennedy when, on November 18, 1961, he came out to inaugurate the new CIA Headquarters Building and to say good-bye to me as Director. He then remarked: &#x27;Your successes are unheralded, your failures are trumpeted.&#x27; For obviously you cannot tell of operatives that go along well. Those that go badly generally speak for themselves.<p>The President then added a word of encouragement to the several thousand men and women of CIA:<p>&#x27;...but I am sure you realize how important is your work, how essential it is - and in the long sweep of history how significant your efforts will be judged. So I do want to express my appreciation to you now, and I am confident that in the future you will continue to merit the appreciation of your country, as you have in the past.&#x27;<p>It is hardly reasonable to expect proper understanding and support for intelligence work in this country if it is only the insiders, a few people within the executive and legislative branches, who know anything whatever about the CIA. Others continue to draw their knowledge from the so-called inside stories by writers who have never been on the inside.&quot;<p>- Allen W. Dulles, &#x27;The Craft of Intelligence&#x27;')
