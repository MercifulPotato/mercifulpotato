I&#x27;m just a hypocrite who believes moral absolutism is objectively evil, in complete opposition to what I&#x27;ve been saying so far!<p>Or maybe I believe it&#x27;s dangerous because of what I&#x27;ve seen and experienced, but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s objectively bad because that would be extremely silly. No, it&#x27;s not bad and you&#x27;re not bad, I just don&#x27;t agree, I just don&#x27;t see things the same way.')
