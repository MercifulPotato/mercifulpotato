Item(by='ouid', descendants=None, kids=[25753047], score=None, time=1610479584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25751456, text='&gt;The fairest trade of them all is going to be between two people that can make an exchange without state interference and without feeling like the other person got more than they did, and tariffs interfere with that type of exchange.<p>Why does your definition of fairness include a clause about state interference? I don&#x27;t think you can argue in good faith about whether or not governments can act to increase fairness if your <i>definition</i> of fairness excludes government action.<p>Trade will occur at any price between the value to the consumer and the cost to the producer. In a perfectly competitive market, the agreed upon price approaches the cost to the producer, and it will necessarily be the case that the consumer got <i>more</i> from it. Is that fair?<p>This is going to sound condescending, and I&#x27;m sorry about that, but you should consider adopting a principled set of economic beliefs rather than one based exclusively on your politics.')
