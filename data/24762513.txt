No other city in the country just leaves waste in a pile unprotected on the side of the road like NYC. I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t at least have a god damn huge bin like any other first world city if it&#x27;s going to be a pile of trash anyway on the sidewalk day in day out. It&#x27;s downright medieval and I don&#x27;t understand how it isn&#x27;t a public health crisis having so many rats so close to eating and living.')
