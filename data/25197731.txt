Even as a kid, I remember asking &quot;are we the only people who take the key out of the car when we leave?  everyone we see on TV seems to leave their keys in the car&quot;.  If character A just took their damn keys with them... movie would have been over 20 minutes earlier!<p>And... in murder mysteries... or TV sitcoms... if someone just had a working cell phone, the &quot;communication problem&quot; (misunderstanding or missing) that&#x27;s at the heart of 90% of plots would be removed and the show would be over.  Would definitely make the writers have to work harder.')
