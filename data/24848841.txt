Squash Those Commits<p>That&#x27;s very odd advice, as the reverse actually should apply.<p>Since (in GitHub) merging with squash costs just one click more to the maintainer, and one can&#x27;t separate squashed commits, having separate commits should be the default behavior.<p>I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s preferrable to squash a disorderly branch history, but then, it&#x27;s about being orderly rather than squashing for its own sake.')
