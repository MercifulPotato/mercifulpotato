Very talented teens some, others are teens of average talent level. But they do have teens. They are also about 3 times bigger than discord. I think you could argue either way, because there may be a larger absolute number of teens on discord? The numbers are not broken out enough to tell. But given the nature of what we&#x27;re dealing with, I wouldn&#x27;t discount the idea of them not wanting anyone taking a closer look at what they are doing.<p>I myself am always suspicious of the &quot;Think of the children!!!&quot; crowd.')
