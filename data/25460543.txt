I don&#x27;t need to fork a project to benefit from the guarantee that I can fork it and do whatever I like with it.<p>There is a concept in many open source communities of a &quot;benevolent dictator&quot; project leader.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if the project leader is an individual, or a company.  Many open source projects are lead by a single company that dictates how it is ran.<p>The thing that keeps such dictators benevolent is the Freedom To Fork. Without the Freedom To Fork, how do we guarantee benevolence?  The current CRL folks could be the nicest, most wonderful people in the world, but there is no guarantee the company won&#x27;t change hands, the current folks won&#x27;t retire or move on, or their motivations don&#x27;t change and they begin to lose their benevolence.<p>Sure, CRL may be interested in partnering and playing nice- now.  But they hold the keys to the kingdom, and can lock the door anytime they want to.<p>I simply want the possibility, that if things don&#x27;t work out, I have options.<p>But you are right- I do have ideals about how projects like this should get funded and built.  And you are right, there are a wide range of reasonable answers.  I disagree with them being a fantasy though.<p>I think Postgres is a great example!  There is a long list of companies that are &quot;significant&quot; contributors to Postgres.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;</a><p>This list included consultants, hosting providers (Even the much maligned AWS is a sponsor), and companies that use Postgres.<p>WordPress&#x2F;Automatic is another successful example, one with a strong business as community leader.  They do well with their consulting and hosting business.<p>The Linux Foundation umbrella also has a variety of supporters and manage a lot of open source projects.<p>There are a variety of open source projects that are developed by companies that use them, much of the Apache Foundation projects fall into this category.<p>Another model that works well for many (I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this model) is the Open Core model.  If as a user I stick to relying only upon the open source editions of projects like GitLab, I get all the benefits of using open source.  (This does not prevent me from buying a commercial license from the company to gain support- if they are willing to support my use of their open source edition in an acceptable manner).<p>RedHat is pretty successful at selling support and consulting.<p>Other open source developers do well selling a hosted managed service of their product.<p>There are a lot of different ways to fund open source projects.')
