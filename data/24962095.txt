I&#x27;ll agree with that noble posture.<p>* &quot;Free to post without randos commenting&quot; - <i>mmhm</i>... if you don&#x27;t want internet randos to comment, don&#x27;t post it to internet randos. To a certain degree, the whole point of posting it to the intertubes rather than emailing it to close friends &amp; family, is to reach internet randos :-&#x2F;<p>* &quot;Based on believing individuals should have the liberty to do what they want, as long as they aren&#x27;t harming someone&quot; - I fully agree in principle, but I also 100% believe that red forward lights are in fact &quot;harming someone&quot;. As I pointed in a sibling comment, I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s a rule that&#x27;s there for funzies. &quot;Principle of least astonishment&quot; is crucial in driving, and drivers have lifetime of reflexes based on &quot;White lights are coming to me, red lights are moving away from me &#x2F; braking&quot;.\nCan you imagine being on a lonely country two lane road, and then some red lights are coming your way in the opposite lane? Etc etc... scenarios are not difficult to figure out.')
