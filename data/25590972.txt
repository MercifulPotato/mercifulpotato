Italy locked down on 9th March, Singapore on 7th April, Kuwait on 10th May, Bhutan on 11th August. It&#x27;s not every country, it wasn&#x27;t all at the same time, and it definitely wasn&#x27;t immediate - e.g. within a few days of Wuhan&#x27;s first lockdown on 23rd January.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>presumably because of peer-pressure, to avoid being shamed.</i>&quot;<p>Presumably because of a global disease pandemic.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>I think it&#x27;s quite possible that the medicine could be worse than the disease, but that discussion hasn&#x27;t even been had.</i>&quot;<p>It&#x27;s been had a lot, months and months of it.
