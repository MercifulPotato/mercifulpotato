I can&#x27;t remember) cells undergo a selection process in the thymus that select against cells with receptors that bind to self proteins, that is proteins made normally by the body. Sometimes this fails and you get autoimmune disorders. Chances are very slim and no more than any other antiviral vaccine.')
