A trick that the MacBooks can no longer pull of at all since eGPU support was killed.<p>It&#x27;s a fantastic experience, but in no way has having this laptop for the last 6 months &quot;redefined how I think about a laptop.&quot; It still does all the same things a laptop does, it still has all the same limitations a laptop has (like the physically small screen vs. other common gaming choices - be it desktop monitors or TVs). The M1 in the MBA doesn&#x27;t really change any of that. Especially since the loss of bootcamp &amp; eGPU means the MBA is a rather terrible gaming experience unless something <i>drastically</i> changes between game devs, Apple, and MacOS. The extra battery life is definitely welcome, but it&#x27;s not game changing revolutionary, either. For some it may now be enough to go all day without charging, which is a key milestone, but many people were already there with the existing set of ultrabooks, too. Beyond that, eh? Kinda like a phone that can last 2 days. Cool trick, but it wouldn&#x27;t change anything about my day to day life unless there happens to be a power outage overnight.')
