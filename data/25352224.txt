All online articles on it uses similar quotes that trace back to a couple of old studies that aren&#x27;t that comprehensive.<p>The common parroted advice is not to use slow cookers for this because they don&#x27;t get hot enough to destroy toxins in some bean varieties - this seems to be based on slow cookers not reaching above 80C though, when I&#x27;d say most slow cookers get much hotter than this.')
