Ideas as a secret. You can create scarcity at the initial step of sharing. You can even create monopolies at this step. The framework for this is NDAs. The vital difference here is that once broadcast an idea can no longer be exploited by the author. And once shared with a third party, repeated use can not be controlled. \n2. Authorship as attribution. This is done by preventing plagiarism.<p>Replacing IP law with NDA contract law and attribution protection would still allow selling software but not subscriptions for software you run locally. Also it would allow everone to record radio broadcasts, which is illegal now but was never enforced.<p>I strongly believe the initial sharing of an idea&#x2F;software&#x2F;music&#x2F;etc. Is the right step to create scarcity.\nOnce something is provided to the public, the public should be able to use it in any way as long as attribution is preserved.')
