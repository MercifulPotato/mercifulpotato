It&#x27;s an insurrection.<p>&quot;If we cut our enemies communications then that&#x27;s just fueling the fire&quot; is not something you say mid war. You cut and code break and infiltrate and capture and kill and anything else because the time for &quot;deplatforming&quot; and &quot;fuel on fire&quot; and any other business as usual peace time political concept is irrelevant. That game isn&#x27;t being played any more, the violence game is.<p>It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re playing chess with someone and they just got up and shoved you, and you punched them, and then a bunch of onlookers are all &quot;well what if they had played knight to f4? Would you punch then!? Punching shouldn&#x27;t be allowed in chess!&quot;. Except the chess game ended when they got up and shoved you. Treating these people as political opponents ended when they broke in to the Capitol building with guns and bombs with the stated intent of killing politicians. They&#x27;re enemies of the state and therefore enemies of institutions that exist thanks to that state and any individual that likes that state.')
