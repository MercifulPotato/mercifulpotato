Guess what isn&#x27;t? Linux desktop gaming.<p>Again, focusing on the current state and not what some eventual steady state might be if Linux were better supported.<p>&gt; Selection bias. I&#x27;m guessing you know a lot more Linux users than the average person.<p>Definitely true (and I had already explicitly called that out), but the fact that those people exist at all lends plausibility to the idea that the set of people who want Linux but want Windows games might be non-negligible and points to the logical flaw in using the current count of Linux gamers to determine what that market might look like if Microsoft weren&#x27;t interfering (if they are, not sure on that at all -- taking ancestor comments at face value for now for the sake of argument).')
