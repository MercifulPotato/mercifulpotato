They put 10% down, you pay back 100% of the loan + some little interest. What does that mean? They can loan out 10x the money they have, and people pay it back in full, 10x their return. Each of those have a small bit of interest and fees. Making them a nice cushy income stream.<p>The FES can also just create money with a click. This devalues all the other dollars slightly, but then those funds can be shared.<p>Overall, this isn’t surprising.')
