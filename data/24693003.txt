Even a vertical mouse could work too. Else something which ensures mouse doesn&#x27;t drop (foam, cord not too long, a holster to store it, or something magnetic perhaps).<p>What is the effect of such a desk going to be on blood flow? Does this increase chance of hemorrhoids?<p>I&#x27;d just use a hangmat with a MBP for a simple lay down desk. More modular and less work. Or a bed + laptop; what I currently use for remote work. More out of necessity (noise and space constraints) though.')
