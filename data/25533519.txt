I imagine because it&#x27;s built in, easy to configure, and works out the box with the ability to map drives so it&#x27;s transparent to users.<p>In contast, anything more secure tends to add inherent friction (since just blindly giving access due to some potentially replayed hash of a user&#x27;s likely weak password isn&#x27;t exactly going to be appropriate in a secure setup). And if it adds complexity, people still go for the old solution.<p>I hope they had backups - I&#x27;ve often caught out the same Windows SMB-using orgs out when checking their backups and discovering both of their weekly-cycled drives are empty and devoid of backups, despite having been diligently swapped out according to the schedule!')
