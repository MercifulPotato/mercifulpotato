But I love it. Their furniture is very versatile, functional and easy.<p>Also, even though furniture snobs hate it, I love pointing out their KALLAX or BILLY units behind them in online meetings :D :D Then it&#x27;s &quot;oh yeah but this is my home office, it&#x27;s not so important&quot;.<p>In my place literally all my furniture is from Ikea and I love it. I don&#x27;t like spending much on it, and IMO the durability is really excellent. What really helps is that they sell cheap covers for my couches, so if I get bored of them or they get dirty I can just buy a new cover for 29 euros and it&#x27;s like a brand new couch again!')
