This is despite the fact that statistically it is extremely likely to be both safe and 100ish% effective at preventing death.<p>If we could magically jump in a time machine and vaccinate the whole US with Astrazeneca last Feb, would we have had a pandemic? No. We would have had some cases, maybe a few deaths, but nothing resembling this year.<p>So I get it. You don&#x27;t love the studies. I agree they aren&#x27;t perfect. But I think it would be helpful if everyone who wanted to point a study flaw would end with a disclaimer: &quot;But of course the FDA should instantly lift the ban on Astrazeneca, because such a ban is absurd.&quot;')
