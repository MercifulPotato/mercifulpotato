He told me that if this project fails he might as well pack\nhis bags. The same was true for his boss all the way up to the VP. There\nwas no way out.<p>&gt; With only a week left we decided eat the 8 figures and drop support for iOS 8.<p>I&#x27;ll say this: If I were an Uber investor I would be pretty angry.  And the story\njust gets worse from there.<p>This is a story of gross incompetence.  It&#x27;s not an engineering disaster,\nit&#x27;s a management disaster.  This is classic &quot;inmates running the\nasylum&quot;.  ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;44098.The_Inmates_Are_Running_the_Asylum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;44098.The_Inmates_Are_Ru...</a> )<p>This is the story of some hackers who got in good at a big company with\nlots of money and <i>sturm und drang</i> so they had no adult supervision\nwhile they partied while pretending to be actual engineers.  (That they\nwere pretending to themselves too doesn&#x27;t make it any better.)<p>The writing was on the wall, but rather than own up and take\nresponsibility they double down and keep messing things up for months\nand years.<p>&gt; This is when the real brilliant engineers started to shine.<p>This is when they get pulled from other tasks to clean up your mess!\n(cf. Broken window fallacy.)  Those real brilliant engineers should be\ndoing other better things than dark rituals to appease the Swift compiler\ngods.<p>Look, we all make mistakes.  There&#x27;s a blog post from an engineer at a\ncompany I used to work for complaining about the pointless middleware I\nwrote years earlier.  (I feel ya bro, I told them at the time that it was\npointless.)  Here&#x27;s the thing: I got out of that place when I realized\nthat the folks running it weren&#x27;t really competent.  (And, sure enough,\nthey got pushed out by the investors and now the company is a &quot;Wallstreet\ndarling&quot;. So...  Yay?)<p>I&#x27;ve burned enough investor money in my career that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s\nfunny anymore.  (I never really did think it was funny, I don&#x27;t like\nwaste, but I was young.  REDACTED was only my second official job, and in\nhindsight it was really crazy.  I mean, they built a skating half-pipe in\nthe office!  At the time, everybody thought that was real cool.)')
