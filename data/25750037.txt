Kissing up to campaign donors or not pushing for a policy you made a campaign promise to enact are not the same as trying to throw an election result into doubt with no evidence at all.  Scale matters. How far and vigorously you knowingly depart from objective fact matters.  To claim otherwise is just another lie.')
