It doesn’t take a genius to know GameStop will have a hard time in a cd-less world and full digital download marketplace. It <i>also</i> doesn’t take a genius to know GameStop will not go to <i>zero</i> dollars (so don’t short to that level).<p>Love the defense of the intellect of the retail investor and a group that doesn’t need to be coddled, great defense against the patronizing and condescending suggestions.<p>Second edit: Jim Cramer recently peddled Raytheon’s earnings up. I’m not a genius but they got the earnings from laying off 16k people. Ok, how many quarters can you do that for? This is a play someone can consider (in either direction).
