Facebook has designed everything about the Facebook experience to funnel users from registration to &quot;engagement,&quot; and this is their main line of business and revenue source. Anything Facebook does to require someone to have an account is also forcing them to be a customer of their principle product.<p>The same situation doesn&#x27;t really apply to Microsoft or Apple. No doubt there are examples of both trying to monetize account holders (e.g. cross-promotion of products) but neither of them views the &quot;having an account experience&quot; as being <i>the product.</i> You don&#x27;t &quot;sign up for Microsoft&quot; in the sense that you sign up for Facebook, the account is not a feature but just a tool for providing identity to various products.<p>This lets Microsoft and Apple make a far stronger argument that requiring an account to use a product is just a technical aspect of the working of the product. Facebook would find it extremely challenging to make this same argument. Google might find itself in a position that is more of an awkward in-between, except for basically all of their attempts at either generalized social media or meaningfully unifying the social aspects of their products have failed, so if they&#x27;re trying to funnel Google Docs users into being YouTube users they&#x27;re at least miserably bad at it.')
