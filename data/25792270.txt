Spain has always been the sum of several national identities. This has of course created frictions, but there wasn&#x27;t the push that order countries had to eradicate those identities when the birth of most modern states happened.<p>Franco tried to change that (as well as eliminating a sizeable part of Spain that didn&#x27;t fit with his values). To this day, many spaniards identify the spanish national identity with those Franco&#x27;s values (despite being fairliy minoritary and Spain a very socially progressive country).<p>After the transition to democracy, regional governments had a lot of incentives to create or reinforce their own identities to gain economic leverage against the central government. This has always been extremely transparent and it&#x27;s no coincidence that the two richest regions have the strongest independentist movement.<p>So yeah, there is a lot of self-hatred or internalised inferiority complex... But also dishonesty. Many of the comments you will read online are self-interested (catalonian independentists) or even straight propaganda from the catalonian government. Not that it would be hard to find any other spaniard to rage about how Spain is, actually, a 3rd world country.')
