What&#x27;s really driving their desperation is needing to <i>pay rent</i>, as the banks continue operating as normal, demanding their periodic tribute, and threatening to confiscate businesses if they don&#x27;t find some way to pay up.<p>You said &quot;people with their small businesses don&#x27;t want handouts&quot;. The problem is that they&#x27;ve internalized rent as some inherent fact of life, while viewing anything that could mitigate rent as a &quot;government handout&quot; - despite decades of government financial meddling being responsible for this jam!<p>The direct solution was&#x2F;is to suspend all rent&#x2F;mortgages denominated in USD, and let the pain accrue to those who are usually benefiting from vacuum-up economics. Instead, as always, disinvolved capital was given a pass (along with a huge bailout!) while the political machine went to work dividing the productive members of society to distract from their real enemy.')
