So I&#x27;ll give you an idea: DLT (distributed ledger technology) is good for one reason: it&#x27;s a consensus mechanism. You have a distributed architecture and you want different machines to agree on the same state, even when some of them are compromised. This is not just sexy for handling money (cryptocurrencies) but this is a long-standing problem in computer science. Consensus that doesn&#x27;t care about compromise exist and is used all over the place in database replication (RAFT).')
