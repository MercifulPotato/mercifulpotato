Nothing about git requires push or pull, and nothing about git requires that you only use a single &quot;canonical&quot; repository.<p>The key point about git is that <i>every</i> copy of the repository is semantically equivalent to every other copy. The one on your local machine is a fully fledged repo just like the one on your colleague&#x27;s machine and just like the one on github or wherever else a &quot;canonical repo&quot; is hosted.<p>This is utterly different from older systems like svn or perforce, where the &quot;central server&quot; is semantically distinct from whatever you have on your machine.<p>At any time, you could decide that a different instance of the repo is canonical (shared push&#x2F;pull), and that&#x27;s what make git decentralized.')
