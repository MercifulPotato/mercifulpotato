Finding borrow is rarely a problem. Borrow fees may be relatively high, about 0.1% per day right now for GME. But considering that short sellers are targeting an 80%+ profit within a few weeks, that&#x27;s not a real deterrent<p>Virtually 100% of shares held at retail brokers are available to borrow. This is especially true at discount brokers like Robinhood, where borrow fees are a primary revenue stream. Ironically the more WSB people that buy GME, the <i>easier</i> it becomes to borrow.<p>&gt;  If the stock goes up too much, the short seller needs to buy it back no matter what, for lack of margin.<p>This is incorrect in the vast majority of cases. Virtually every prime broker (i.e. the brokers used by hedge funds), uses portfolio margining. The prime broker calculates an aggregate &quot;value-at-risk&quot; for the entire portfolio, then requires the fund to post that collateral. As long as they have over that threshold, they won&#x27;t trigger any margin calls. But even if they do, there&#x27;s no reason they have to buy back GME specifically. They could just as easily liquidate any other position to bring down VaR in another less lucrative position.<p>Remember a major multistrat fund like Citadel or SAC will have something like $30 billion AUM, then lever that up by 500% or more. One of these players could short 30% of the float in GME, and it&#x27;d still only be 2% of their portfolio.')
