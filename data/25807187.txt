But the materials that will last have evolved much less quickly.<p>The latest trends are still often depicted using inorganic pigments on canvas or carved in marble, and signed using the artist&#x27;s name, styles can be wildly different but that part is exactly like it was done over the most recent centuries.<p>A recognized predecessor might have simply been inorganic pigment on a cave wall, signed with a hand stencil, when you&#x27;re trying to paint a masterpiece that will stand the test of time.  If nothing else had ever been proven this is what most would do.<p>And that tradition would likely have lasted orders of magnitude more generations when pop culture or art appreciation cycles were slower.  Much slower in all probability, and probability can have some tall odds.<p>Like when there&#x27;s not that many people in the world yet, most of them are going to be more similar than they are later.<p>Seems like the initial trend from earliest centuries could have actually lasted for earliest unfathomable millenia before any other school of art might have arose naturally as it was going to do anyway.<p>Could be all art everywhere started out always being signed with a hand stencil and it was so widespread and universal a trend it did not dissipate for tens of thousands of years.  And it was everywhere, at home, at work, on billboards etc., you just couldn&#x27;t get away from it, for like eons.  It&#x27;s been a while and it wouldn&#x27;t be too surprising if the only thing preserved from way back then is in caves, and it could have been painted there intentionally for generations to enjoy into the unforseeable future, based on proven techniques from the unknowable past.')
