Or both. :)<p>Generally the projects I&#x27;ve felt best about have two features:<p>1) The API knows how to represent resources across multiple media types, usually including at least markup and JSON.<p>2) UI is well-annotated enough that developers and machines find it easy to orient themselves and find data.<p>But you&#x27;re quite right that this isn&#x27;t common. I have my own guesses on the reasons why. My observation&#x27;s been that the workflow and stakeholder decision making process on the UI side places semantic annotation pretty low on the priority side; most places you&#x27;re lucky if you can get a style guide and visual UI system adopted. And there has to be cooperation and buy-in at that level in order for there to be much incentive to engineer and use a model&#x2F;API-level way of systematic representing entities as HTML, which often won&#x27;t happen.<p>And TBH it is extra effort.')
