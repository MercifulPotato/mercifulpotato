You&#x27;re partially right though. With China&#x27;s gradual opening, there have been more mainland Chinese entering higher tiers in various disciplines. Still, that&#x27;s not to say that China&#x27;s creativity isn&#x27;t crippled by its government. Personally, I feel it&#x27;s a drop compared to what could be with a more democratic government. Also everything that we&#x27;ve seen so far is due to China opening up and decentralizing. I predict the opposite will happen in the future as Xi reverses the trend. Yes, it&#x27;s conjecture, and I hope I&#x27;m wrong.<p><i>&gt; Chinese entertainment is great if you don&#x27;t care about politics.</i><p>This is just personal taste but imo it&#x27;s terrible. The only works that have freedom are nationalistic in nature like the Three Body Problem, where it&#x27;s easy to see what it really is once you substitute the West for the &quot;aliens&quot;. Everything else is mostly historical fiction set in ancient times, or maybe some time around WWII. My guess for this is because it&#x27;s easier not to run the ire of the CCP if you&#x27;re doing fictional work in a setting that happened hundreds of years ago.<p><i>&gt; China innovates on rocket force to sink US carriers, hence ahead in hypersonics.</i><p>Are they really Chinese innovations or Chinese retrofitted Russian designs? I don&#x27;t know enough about modern Chinese rockets, so I&#x27;m actually asking a question, because historically most Chinese military equipment are variants of Russian models.<p><i>&gt;  It matters because before nuclear war is conventional war. Conventional capability require to solve border disputes, become regional hegemon of a bunch of middle powers without nukes.</i><p>India also has ballistic nuclear weapons, and so does Japan... It&#x27;s good to know that China&#x27;s leaders have the same logic as US leadership. For the US, imo our defense budget is a mainly a cover for massive corruption.<p><i>&gt; CCDI investigated&#x2F;punished over 1M+ party officials, even Xi doesn&#x27;t have that many enemies. But of course there was element of power consolidation, and completely justified in retrospect now that CIA confirmed (just this month) how far they&#x27;ve infiltrated CCP under Hu.</i><p>Chinese politics have varying factions which are made up of many members. It&#x27;s not like anti-corruption drives are a new tactic to remove your rivals in China. I mean you even admit it.<p>This is not an emotional discussion for me, but I feel that it is for you. If I&#x27;m right on this, I&#x27;m not looking to insult you, and if continuing this discussion is going to make you angry; I&#x27;d rather end it now because it&#x27;s not going to change anyone&#x27;s views.')
