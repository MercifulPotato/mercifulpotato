Item(by='TulliusCicero', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609464559, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25597994, text='Yeah, infrastructure seems like the #1 difference.<p>The truth is, even somewhere considered reasonably bike friendly like Germany, bikes are still clear second class citizens compared to cars, in terms of transportation investment. In terms of quality of infrastructure and amount of space allocated in cities, there&#x27;s just no contest there.<p>And in the US, it&#x27;s downright pathetic. The general attitude of city governments when it comes to bike numbers amounts to, &quot;we&#x27;ve tried nothing, and we&#x27;re all out of ideas!&quot; Pointing to the clear success story of Vancouver BC actually putting forth a serious effort and getting results will get you nowhere, they&#x27;ll keep on muddling through and feigning confusion as to why nobody wants to use their fragmented, dangerous bike network composed mostly of door zone bike lanes that suddenly end whenever it was inconvenient to continue dropping paint on the road.<p>I&#x27;ve lost track of all the painted bike lanes that suddenly disappear and then show up again 50m later because cars needed a dedicated turn lane right there, or the times the bike lane curves and yeets itself into the sidewalk with no warning. Even a quick glance at Google Maps with the bike lane layer on makes it immediately clear how badly bike networks are almost always implemented there.')
