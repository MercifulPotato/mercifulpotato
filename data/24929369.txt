I can highly recommend looking into Tailwind (and Tailwind UI). For me, it solved some of the pain of still having to deal with CSS and various preprocessors for it.<p>I can now create entire working apps using just Elixir code and the utility-style Tailwind classes within my server-side templates. I still need to write some js and css, but where LiveView reduced the need for custom js to a minimum, Tailwind did the same for css.')
