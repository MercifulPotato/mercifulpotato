The higher you go, you give up temporal resolution and area coverage, which is key for Planet&#x27;s <i>monitoring</i> mission. There&#x27;s also plenty of other phenomenologies to go after - for example Blacksky announced their next-gen constellation will have SWIR. And for us, the thermal is really only possible since we are already capturing such high resolution visible (due to the long wavelength of LWIR).')
