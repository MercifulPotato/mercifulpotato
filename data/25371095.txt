It does not refute the wider range of possibilities where a lab escape was part of the path from nature to human circulation.<p>(When that article points out things like &quot;Scientists have yet to find the direct parent of SARS-CoV-2 in feral beasts&quot;, or that with regard to some specific Chinese-military viruses Yan fingered, &quot;bat coronaviruses were circulating in wild bats and could have been discovered by anyone&quot;, it&#x27;s saying things completely consistent with the idea that this could be a wholly natural virus <i>that was carried to Wuhan &amp; then escaped into that urban environment</i> via lab collection then escape. There were a lot of researchers carrying novel natural strains from caves back to labs!)<p>Your links [1] &amp; [2] are interesting but seem to include no opinion or reasoning for or against a lab escape or lab-enhancement, either way.')
