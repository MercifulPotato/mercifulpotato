All our public source code is permissively (ISC) licensed. Weâ€™re currently keeping some of our secret sauce closed-source, but the EULA allows use of it freely to encourage its adoption in 3rd party hardware and software. Ultimately, we plan to commercialise SOUL by licensing back-end drivers and other IP for use by vendors who are building SOUL-compatible hardware products.</i>')
