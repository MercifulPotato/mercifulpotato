Also, people that are better-educated tend to lean liberal and therefore might prefer to consume liberal outlets, but that doesn&#x27;t mean liberal outlets are better at informing people. Looking at the frontpage of MSNBC, it&#x27;s almost exclusively political opinion pieces centered around the US.<p>Moreover, the key question is not whether you&#x27;re being informed better by consuming this media, but whether it is worth risking some of your well-being by consuming it. Research has found that media that is upsetting is the most addictive. People with addictions make up all kinds of rationalizations on how their addiction has upsides. The idea that you&#x27;ve been wasting time consuming ultimately useless information that irritates you - it&#x27;s not very attractive.')
