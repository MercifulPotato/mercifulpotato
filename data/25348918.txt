Children with chronic medical conditions are more likely to be vaccinated, and some preliminary reports show a correlation between medical conditions that indicate flu vaccination and narcolepsy [1]. And from what I can tell, the control group didn&#x27;t exclude kids vaccinated with other H1N1 vaccines.<p>Because of that, that study can&#x27;t say that the 4x higher number is the relative risk of taking Pandermrix.<p>There are also issues with potential over diagnosis and recall bias because of public awareness of the issue through the media [1].<p>The real problem is that this effect is so small, not that the effect takes years to develop. We&#x27;re talking 4 cases of narcolepsy per 100k kids. Even a 10 year long study of 30k Phase 3 vaccine participants is unlikely to discover something like that.<p>Nearly all new drugs that are released could have similar side effects. It&#x27;s just not feasible to conduct studies large enough to discover them until you start rolling it out to millions of people.<p>1.<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4962758&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4962758&#x2F;</a>')
