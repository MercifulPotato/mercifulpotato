If it&#x27;s just energy, which seems like to me, energy might be supplied by hydrogen or other CO2-free sources.<p>Water use compared to personal use isn&#x27;t that important. Most water used by an industrial society is used in agriculture and that&#x27;s probably true for Chile.<p><i>I think what&#x27;s really going on here is that the current methods of producing lithium are really not very environmentally harmful.</i><p>Agreed. The negative impact of mining generally comes from companies incentivized to cut corners. Strong regulations requiring waste be contained, etc, are what needed. The worst problem is that large companies do cost arbitrage across the world, incentivizing countries to lower their standards - why all the &quot;rare earth&quot; mining went to China when they were willing cut corners and then the West screamed bloody murder when China stopped wanting to be the world&#x27;s garbage dump.')
