Instead of using the web-standard certificate authority to authenticate user connections to a server, Handshake stores references to the IP address of the websites registered in its system. Namebase is a platform that offers users access to the Handshake network<p>That makes no sense at all. But it sounds like handshake is simply an alternate DNS protocol?  Or does it also serve as a certificate authority somehow?  Is it actually more decentralized than DNS (which is already of course decentralized in one axis, but not the relevant one for keeping a lookup available if the entity hosting DNS decides to remove it).<p>Very confusing.<p>It seems like tor .onion address would be an actually mature solution to this problem, instead of this thing that seems like press release babble?')
