I used to do that, thinking that I &quot;needed to get my money&#x27;s worth&quot;, but I&#x27;ve started bailing on games if I&#x27;m not having fun after 2 or 3 hours and don&#x27;t ever regret it. The way I look at it now is that paying for a game is like paying the price of admission to a museum. If I&#x27;m not liking the show on display, I&#x27;m not going to stay there for longer just to feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth. Paying the price of admission isn&#x27;t a promise of enjoyment.<p>but like, I&#x27;m not really trying to convince you of anything, I&#x27;m trying to get clarity on what you&#x27;re saying, because your original comment is so ambiguous that it doesn&#x27;t actually help me figure out whether or not I want to play Cyberpunk.')
