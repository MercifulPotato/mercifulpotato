I vaguely remember from not so long ago that one of the criticisms was that the acceleration forces would crush any fragile parts like electronics, but is it still true that electronics can&#x27;t be hardened to survive the acceleration forces? Are there other problems that make the idea of rail gun launchers simply impossible?')
