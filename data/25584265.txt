But even if you ignore Template metaprogramming (which many argue is too difficult to understand...), bog-standard C++ techniques like CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) shows how useful templates can be outside of containers.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curiously_recurring_template_pattern" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curiously_recurring_template_p...</a><p>---------<p>C++ templates are extremely different beasts than generics. Templates are closer to a meta-language than a language feature. They hold important roles in optimization... specifically allowing you to convert &quot;runtime code&quot; into &quot;compile time code&quot; in a huge class of problems.<p>CRTP is a great example of retaining OOP-style polymorphism while compiling down into highly efficient non-virtual calls... with practical applications into GUI frameworks, video games and more. And its only made possible due to templates.')
