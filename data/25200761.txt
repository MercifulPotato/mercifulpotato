I do this with every note app like this I see. NotePlan is very close to what I need&#x2F;want, with the daily logging approach.<p>Unfortunately, NotePlan doesn&#x27;t support inline PDFs as IMAGES (not links, displayed inline like a PNG). Without support for this, it&#x27;s unusable to me (basically every note taking app is).<p>Latex symbol &#x2F; equation rendering is also important, but I can live without that.<p>If you added that functionality, I&#x27;d be more or less happy to pay whatever you want for the app.')
