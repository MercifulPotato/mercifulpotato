Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think this is a tech problem. How do you get the devs to move en masse from Ethereum back to BTC? The network effects are just so enormous, it feels like a catastrophic failure needs to happen to Eth at this point.<p>I&#x27;ll check it out and play around, will never say never. I&#x27;m just generally skeptical of sidechains because why can&#x27;t Eth just be a sidechain to BTC, or various incarnations of the same end like atomic swaps, BTC collateralization, etc?')
