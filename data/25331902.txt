Spend most of the conversation listening, except as needed to keep the conversation going. Imagine you can&#x27;t see or hear them, but only read their words on paper. How sure are you that they are not a computer program? For me, notes of emotion, hints of future hope or past regrets, recognition that humans are flawed or acknowledging that others may hold a different perspective are strong moves. Silliness, reasoning, compassion, specialized interests score points too.<p>Next, run this test on yourself. Be more human.')
