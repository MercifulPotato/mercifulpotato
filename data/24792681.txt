When I&#x27;ve switch jobs I&#x27;ve never had a shortage of offers so if I saw that post it&#x27;d raise a flag for me and I&#x27;d be less inclined to follow up with that company - other really positive factors might swing it back or not.  This means I might end up missing a great opportunity but job searches are never exhaustive and we all just try to do the best we can to evaluate different positions with our limited resources.')
