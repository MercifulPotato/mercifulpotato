It is always Windows people trying to bend libraries to make them easy to &quot;install&quot; for them.  On Unix installing libraries system-wide was never too much of a hassle, and now with Nix you can have reproducible distinct development environments for each project. I hate that sadly a lot of the projects I work on must also work on Windows, but I&#x27;d just hire a Windows person simply to deal with their build system stuff.')
