The other problem is that this can sound like bragging or attention-seeking. Nonetheless, as another commenter pointed out, it might be healthy to normalize some of these experiences (insofar as such a thing is possible). In each case, I&#x27;m not the only one who has had the experience.<p>On DMT, I&#x27;ve had the experience of retracting all of reality into a singularity, where I remained for eternity in infinite bliss, until I (&quot;I&quot;) was ready to Big Bang the whole thing out again, which I of course dutifully did. As you can imagine, this is a very condensed version of the story.<p>I&#x27;ve had experiences of discovering how reality is &quot;actually&quot; a dream, and becoming privy to all of the precise, minute details of how everything is projected from the psyche of the Godhead that we all ultimately are.<p>I&#x27;ve had the experience of living countless lives, from the perspectives of both victims and their perpetrators, until I&#x27;ve seen very precisely why unerring compassion is the only sensible response to anything, ever, period. Why all evil is illusion, and can only be driven out by light (the primordial love that manifests as all of reality). Why humanity suffers so much: because we project the darkness within us outside of ourselves, so that we can avoid taking responsibility. How we wear these projections as a badge of honor: look, we are the good guys, fighting the bad guys!<p>I have also had more &quot;conventionally strange&quot; trips (if that makes sense) in which physical laws are broken in arbitrarily strange ways. Think of the old Tibetan Buddhist story of a master who was able to fit a large animal (a yak maybe?) into his shoe, without the Yak getting smaller or his shoe getting bigger. Some of these experiences offered me the chance to use all of my normal tools to confirm them as thoroughly as I would be able in sober reality, until I was thoroughly satisfied that no combination of neurotransmitters or standard physics could suffice as an explanation. I would love to share more details, but I&#x27;m not sure I can.<p>I would not blame someone reading this and concluding that I&#x27;m batshit crazy. From my perspective, the crazy part is us being so certain we&#x27;ve got reality figured out in the <i>slightest bit</i>. This belief in a fundamentally lifeless reality is the root of so much suffering (for example, the whole climate crisis), and yet we&#x27;re doubling down on it. It breaks my heart.<p>My rational mind has even constructed radically skeptical arguments demonstrating why we should not (see my profile, e.g.). Your mileage may vary, of course.<p>Edit: wow, a lot in common with gavinray&#x27;s response.')
