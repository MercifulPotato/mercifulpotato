Assuming a social media network could be split off from a larger company as a separate line of business, the legal operating environment influencing its content moderation, algorithms, and so on wouldn&#x27;t immediately change, just because the business was restructured. I&#x27;d expect far more fallout from the financial and operational ramifications, not all of which would be good, than any legal ones.<p>I&#x27;m still not exactly sure how Section 230 relates to any of the issues in public discussion.  Only that it&#x27;s good for the platforms, and some folks want to hurt the platforms, so Section 230 must go.  I&#x27;ve seen at least one draft of a proposed bill for adding additional conditions to Section 230, but they reminded me, more than anything, of hypothetical First Amendment questions from law school exams. It&#x27;s by no means clear that platforms, especially new platforms, will simply do whatever you tell them to do in a condition to Section 230.')
