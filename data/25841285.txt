To be more clear, does it really matter if taylor swift has to settle for the engagement afforded her by taylorswift.com or should society view it as a problem that somethingpopular.com has the power to prevent her from engaging on that platform?<p>&gt; <i>This actually makes my case against the dominance of a platform or monopoly.</i><p>It&#x27;s important to distinguish <i>popularity</i> from &quot;dominance&quot; or &quot;monopoly&quot;. If you&#x27;re using anything akin to MAUs to define dominance then your case is hopeless because you&#x27;re effectively in opposition to the concept of popularity. Social media users aren&#x27;t being held at gunpoint, they capriciously engage in any platform that gives them what they want on the internet at a given moment, social media is just one slice of that and is generally regarded as the least productive way to spend your time online.<p>&gt; <i>Why are these people getting zero engagement? Are they bad at SEO? Did they not pay the Google tax?</i><p>It&#x27;s just the nature of physics, regardless of the factors involved, there are only so many spots available on the front-page. The overwhelming majority of social media users are less than a rounding error in terms of the engagement they will <i>ever</i> receive except for a minuscule fraction that might end up going viral for some reason.<p>&gt; <i>To answer your last question, I don&#x27;t know. Maybe we shouldn&#x27;t. I think these are serious problems though, and they&#x27;re going to require serious thought.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem, it&#x27;s basically a fight over who should get to be in the popular club. Not that I think there aren&#x27;t other problems, in my view the ad model is the only problem. If companies that collect PII and track users were forbidden from selling ad space and had to take on a subscription model like netflix, suddenly the incentives would shift and all the bad behavior would stop. For people concerned about deplatforming, these companies would actually <i>lose</i> money in the form of subscriptions when they ban people rather than <i>earn</i> money by purging toxic content to please advertisers.')
