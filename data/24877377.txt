In my opinion it&#x27;s more likely that in the future it will remain a niche, but never become really a hit in the general population.</i><p>Historically (that is, from the point that VR first became a buzzword in the &#x27;90s), the importance of low latency and other ergonomic issues has been consistently underestimated. Improvements in hardware were usually eaten up by greater rendering fidelity and scene complexity, keeping latency right on the edge of acceptability, which unfortunately means that about 10% of the population experiences loss of orientation or motion sickness. A similar effect occurs on standard desktop setups, but affects a much smaller group (something about the difference between moving the scene in response to head vs. hand movements).<p>As long as developers (of both platforms and games) keep trying to push more polygons at faster refresh rates without addressing latency, 1-in-10 people are going to reject it outright, and rather more forcefully than in a &quot;eh, not for me&quot; sense.<p>Keep in mind that the reason disagreement between the inner ear and visual field causes nausea is to get you to vomit harmful psychoactive substances, so it&#x27;s a pretty deeply rooted response that doesn&#x27;t respond much to desensitization through exposure (ie. If it&#x27;s a problem for you, you may not be able to &quot;get used to it&quot;).-')
