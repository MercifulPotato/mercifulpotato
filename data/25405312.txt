A boomer&#x27;s family could live off one salary. Since then women have joined the workforce and kind of the whole world by moving (migrating) or remote. While it is definitely true that those &quot;<i>none</i> westerners were dead poor in the past compared to today&quot; there is a 20+ year long wage stagnation in the west and increase in prices on some of the very fundamental needs like housing, which results in memes about gen XYZ <i>not</i> being able to afford them, create stable conditions, have a spouse and <i>then</i> a family (kids).<p>Anyway, we are in this together, always on(line), connected, one global world and it depends how you view it: Appreciate the advancements the <i>non</i>-western world has made or focus on the gap they still have to the west. Though this all comes to <i>the expense</i> of the western world, which is kind of required to close the global gap.')
