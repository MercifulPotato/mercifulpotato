Quite a few F2P games on Steam collect credit cards unlike what Apple&#x2F;Google allow developers to do.<p>Steam also has a ton of social network features like chat&#x2F;communities&#x2F;etc.. and they support multiple platforms. They also reduce their cut to 25% and 20% above $10 million and $50 million respectively.<p>Developers and users are completely free to use or not use Steam, GoG, Epic, Itch.io, or others. Quite a few developers do pre-orders on Humble, and then sell on Steam, etc.. You&#x27;re stuck with Apple&#x2F;Google TOS for the vast majority of apps regardless if you&#x27;re the developer or user. Epic couldn&#x27;t possibly bring the same lawsuits against Steam, maybe the consoles, but even they allow different in-app purchase payment providers (F2P games collecting credit cards again) and subsidize the consoles quite a bit at the start of each cycle.')
