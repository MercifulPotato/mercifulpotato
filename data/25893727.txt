I&#x27;m on the path at spending about $20 per month for fairly clean water and $20 a month for the air. I haven&#x27;t solved the food contamination problem as I didn&#x27;t have my sights on it but I&#x27;ll include it now (I have been trying to cook at home more over the past two years, so maybe I&#x27;ve been taking baby steps here without realizing it).<p>As for the government, re:regulation, I&#x27;m trying to shy away from the politics because (at least for America) it&#x27;s burdened down by identity politics instead of policy focused discussions.<p>As for me and my house, we&#x27;re doing our part to bare the costs of personal responsibility.')
