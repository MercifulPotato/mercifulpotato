But Wikipedia worked out pretty quickly that this is a terrible definition when a thousand microstates all recognised each other but didn&#x27;t recognise any &quot;actual countries&quot;, and then claimed that Belgium no longer existed. So instead they use a policy of &quot;does this geopolitical entity operate in the way that humans typically understand countries to operate&quot;. Taiwan passes that check.')
