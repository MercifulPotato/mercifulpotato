Short cables up to about 0.5m (1.5 feet) can use the full 40 Gbps. Slightly longer cables up to 1m can still carry  enough signal for Thunderbolt 3 but usually at reduced speeds (20 Gbps).<p>Above about 1m (3 feet) a passive cable usually isn&#x27;t good enough for TB3 connections and you have to use a more expensive &quot;active&quot; cable. Active cables have built in signal-boosting circuits -- they&#x27;re amplifying and re-transmitting signals, not just passing them over the wires.')
