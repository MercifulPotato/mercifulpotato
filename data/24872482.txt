Even if people bought unlocked Windows phones directly from Microsoft Stores they couldn&#x27;t get SIMs from half the major carriers at any given time as Microsoft was forced not to support given Verizon SIMs as one point due to a dumb war with them and Verizon flat out refusing to allow the devices on to the network. (At a different point AT&amp;T almost did the same thing, but relented.)<p>On top of that, even though that was towards the end of the era of massive phone hardware subsidies from the carriers, it was still the era of massive phone hardware subsidies from the carriers if you bought directly from them.<p>Apple had&#x2F;has &quot;luxury brand&quot; caché that Microsoft couldn&#x27;t build into its stores if it wanted to, and first mover advantage on top of that. Many consumers didn&#x27;t blink if there was a huge sticker price difference between the iPhone in the AT&amp;T Store and the unlocked one in the Apple Store, because it was a luxury brand. Microsoft was never going to earn that. Additionally, if a lot of people showed up to an AT&amp;T or Verizon store with an unlocked iPhone and were refused a SIM that would be a major scandal, and would get a lot of luxury good &quot;entitlement&quot; people out of the woodwork. People told that they couldn&#x27;t buy an unlocked Microsoft phone and use it on their carrier just shrugged and moved on (to an iPhone or an Android).<p>&gt; And with their recent closing of Microsoft stores, it’s clear that they are doubling down on rent seeking from Office and Windows licenses.<p>Windows and Office are still getting improvements, it is a bit disingenuous to consider those products &quot;rent seeking&quot;.<p>Xbox and Surface are doing just fine with or without Microsoft-specific Stores.<p>Besides, both before and after the Microsoft Stores, Microsoft had good retail relationships with Best Buy and others. It&#x27;s not like there is &quot;zero&quot; Microsoft retail exposure without Microsoft owning their own boutique retail stores.')
