If you absolutely <i>have</i> to charge there (because you can&#x27;t charge at home for a lack of a private spot) you end up driving in circles, trying to get a spot, or go to a charging station instead after you have given up at the mall when the parking is full. Suddenly every shopping trip ends up with the risk of taking an hour instead of 15 minutes. Not recommended unless you have your own charger and parking available.')
