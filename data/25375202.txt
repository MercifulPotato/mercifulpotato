However, unlike the others, instead of using this special treatment to reduce risks, FAANMG have decided to monetize it instead, by blatantly exacerbating already questionable anti-consumer practices. Their culture and governance impels them to one-up each other, until they cross the line.<p>If Facebook just required a login, I believe the regulators would let it slip, it&#x27;s just a toy after all. But in their arrogance, they let their automated algorithms brick customers&#x27; $400 device. Although this alone would eventually bring the attention of authorities upon them, they decided to double down on their hubris by not providing any support to the affected customers. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, Facebook refuses to even acknowledge the problem and back down. At this point, they are clearly baiting the anti-trust agencies. Not unlike a mafioso blocking a disabled spot in front of the police station.')
