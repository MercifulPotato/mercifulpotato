When making a location specific search, often even including the word “Ireland” or the city I live in, I will get results from the UK, or the US. Bizarrely, toggling the “Ireland” location switcher on often makes the results worse - which is surprising since it will often prioritise .co.uk domains above .ie domains, which seems like a slam dunk for location-dependant searches (such as for example “buy new bike chain”) out of Ireland with an “ireland” toggle switched on.<p>Example: there is a mobile network named Three in both the UK and Ireland. With the Ireland location toggle enabled, the search “Three network coverage” places the Irish Three (three.ie) in fifth position, under four .co.uk results.<p>I’m at the point where if I need to search something that could be location dependant I throw a !g onto the search term by default.')
