It was a really good chemistry class and book--the book taught 6th grader me so much chemistry that I never took another chemistry class in my entire engineering education (electrical engineer--so not so critical).<p>The class had a bunch of nurses finishing up their training.    The nurses complained <i>bitterly</i> about how hard the class was and that it was the blocker for graduating--in spite of it practically avoiding all math.<p>Cogitate on that--20+ year old college students couldn&#x27;t understand a book that a 6th grader could.<p>Just because someone is a nurse doesn&#x27;t automatically make them an authority on health decisions.<p>&gt; Frankly, there should be serious consequences for the staff involved.<p>That will likely happen after Covid.  Right now, everywhere is so short of staff that nobody is going to risk offending a qualified nurse and having them walk.')
