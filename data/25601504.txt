For sure there will be more cooperation between the two countries, but in the last survey only 20% of NI residents favoured a united Ireland. [0] I doubt Brexit has shifted that number too much. I&#x27;d more expect NI to become an independent country, but Scotland will be first.<p>In terms of Ireland I think this is good for them, as it&#x27;ll give them more opportunity to be more independent. At least when I was there (nearly 10 years ago, in Dublin), it felt like &#x27;the UK but slightly different&#x27;, i.e. very different from the rest of Europe. Online retailers often didn&#x27;t have an IE store, but most UK retailers would ship to IE for extra shipping.<p>Now it will probably be the other way, IE retailers will ship to NI for a little extra. The combined markets have a population of nearly 7m people, so it&#x27;s bigger than a lot of European countries.<p>As OP says it might be painful to begin with (for NI and IE) as they adjust to the new position. Ireland drives on the same side of the road as the UK, and uses UK plugs, so cars and consumer goods will most likely become more expensive too.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;5&#x2F;56&#x2F;Northern_Ireland_Constitutional_Preference.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;5&#x2F;56&#x2F;Northern...</a>')
