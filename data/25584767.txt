The programming and project architecture may be stellar, but without a clean, professional looking user interface, most folks won&#x27;t give it a chance. Take Gimp for instance. The software is an excellent alternative to Photoshop, but most people who aren&#x27;t really into OSS or programming tend to overlook it or immediately disregard it, due to its UI.<p>Like the article&#x27;s author talked about contributing answers to forum questions, I think other areas open-source software projects need some changes. I think the OSS community needs to try and recruit more design folks into their teams, rather than just programmers.')
