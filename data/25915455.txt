This show isn&#x27;t supposed to be a narrative history of a computer company.  This show is to encompass the vigor, innovation, power struggle, paradigm shift of the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s of the computing revolution.  I was just a kid when all of this began and grew up during this era.  This show does a great job of showing the excitement during that time.  Everyone knew back at that time something was brewing with technology and it seemed there was something new and exciting every month.  It was also a battle for supremacy to see who was going to lead the revolution.  A very fascinating part of tech history.')
