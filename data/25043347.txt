It&#x27;s going to record an entire program running on your local machine, including all the data that it reads and writes. That includes local files, network connections, events from your window manager, pixels put on the screen, any environment variables that happened to be defined, etc. If any of that is private then you shouldn&#x27;t upload the recording to Pernosco. If you&#x27;re working on a public GitHub repository then your concern is pretty much limited only to your local environment. Make sure you don&#x27;t have security tokens in your environment variables when you record. If your program opens files, make sure it opens something harmless. If your program visits webpages, don&#x27;t record it visiting a page you want kept private. It&#x27;s only natural then that the EULA would want you to give Pernosco permission to receive that data, store it for you, and then present it back to you during your debugging sessions.<p>There&#x27;s also the on-premises option.')
