Don&#x27;t give me this &quot;it&#x27;s a private company&quot; line: unaccountable individuals at corporations can deny you transportation, speech, and financial services --- they can ruin your life merely because they dislike you. Yes, tech companies can&#x27;t take away your freedom. They can&#x27;t put you in jail. But they can effectively exile you from civilization. Should private individuals have that power?<p>I get it. Some people are just fundamentally uncomfortable with democracy: public consensus is a messy way to govern a society. Besides: Twitter and other tech companies are, right now, making the decisions that you think are right. But what you&#x27;re essentially doing is opting into a VC-funded startup that offers you cool stuff at an unsustainably low price. When the VCs demand a profit, that company will raise its prices, and you, locked in, will be forced to pay, forever.<p>Power works the same way: give up control to individuals now and you might like the immediate results, but you&#x27;ll change your mind when those individuals start doing things you dislike, and when they do, you&#x27;ll have no recourse. Throughout history, we find that people who vote dictators into power regret it later. Let&#x27;s not repeat that old mistake.')
