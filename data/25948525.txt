The drawing of the numbers is a massive televised affair, with children singing out the numbers, I kid you not.  Lots of interviews with winners big and small.<p>There were lines outside the ticket shops (semi social distanced and with masks). Street vendors of tickets were walking around asking people “don’t you want 200 million Euros?” Or whatever the number was, I didn’t win so I forget.<p>Point being, with the Christmas lottery all but personally endorsed by the Pope and the King, and with millions of poor and poorly educated people watching this spectacle, I’d be shocked if some people didn’t cause themselves real trouble as a result.  Just one more ticket...<p>(My friends there treat it mostly as a joke but still do buy one ticket each, every year, on principle.)')
