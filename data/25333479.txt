Or - are themes even viable with Tailwind?<p>I&#x27;m a backend Dev who plans to buy Tailwind Build (or w&#x2F;e it&#x27;s called). I enjoy the idea of not having to worry <i>(as much)</i> about design, and instead just focus on content layout, etc. Tailwind is neat that way.<p>With that said though i&#x27;m not a fan of the .. &quot;modern&quot; design. I&#x27;ll use it, i guess, but on text heavy pages ala Wikipedia or HackerNews, Tailwind looks like it would waste a lot of space. Though maybe i&#x27;m off base.<p>The point of this is to ask if theming has gotchas. Eg maybe themes work, but they&#x27;re rarely ever supported well enough, leaving you with little gaps in design that cause problems. Thoughts?')
