Of course outlets like Vox and Guardian hate Israel and call it &quot;racist&quot; all the time. It&#x27;s a bunch of lies, naturally. One is about official language (there&#x27;s no &quot;right&quot; of anyone to have their language as official, it&#x27;s a majority decision and majority in Israel speaks Hebrew - as BTW do all Arabic citizens, who learn it at school and can speak and read it just fine, so nobody is dicriminated about anything), another is whining about Jews living on a land as if it was some sort of crime, third one somehow makes low turnout in Arab neighborhoods into an evidence (without a shred of proof) of somehow discrimination. And it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s 5% turnout - it&#x27;s 49.1%. In 2015 it was 63%. so I imagine, depending on the cycle and attractiveness of the candidate, it moves between 50 and 65%. US turnout in 2016 was 60%. And I am supposed to take this as an evidence of &quot;marginalization&quot;? That&#x27;s really scrapping the bottom of the barrel. Taking a usual electoral ebb and flow and presenting it as some kind of rampant racism. Of course, that&#x27;s exactly what haters of Israel always are and will be doing. And this is demonstrating my case perfectly - this is what you are basing your claim that the whole state of Israel (including the very same Arabs that you pretend to care about of course) should be removed from internet on the basis of that Arab participation in recent election slightly dropped and they lost some votes. This shows very prominently how extensive your censorship ambitions are.')
