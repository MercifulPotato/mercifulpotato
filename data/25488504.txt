Give yourself 15 minutes to submit a solution. Start with super basic &quot;reverse a string&quot; type questions and go from there.<p>Once that feels natural, start interviewing at companies- whoever will interview you- take their call. Ideally start with companies you have no desire to actually work for, this should lower the stress &#x2F; stakes of getting it wrong.<p>Wash, rinse, repeat until you start getting offers. Then target companies you actually want to work for.')
