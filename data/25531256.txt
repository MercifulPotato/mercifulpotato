It was just hard to relate to characters who had no interest in work struggling to pay rent in a gentrifying slum while in the present day, people were struggling to pay rent <i>and</i> find a job.<p>I don&#x27;t like the pacing of <i>Wicked</i>, but the staging and performance of <i>Defying Gravity</i> is amazing. I can&#x27;t remember exactly what it was, but there was morality lesson that felt shoehorned in. Maybe Doctor Dillamond was an allegory on racism? I enjoy <i>Wicked</i>, but I felt like it need more work.<p><i>Phantom of the Opera</i> is ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to see it. I&#x27;m also not really an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan.')
