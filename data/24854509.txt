I&#x27;ll touch only one - nationalism. Marie Antoinette was perceived (whether it was real or not) as siding with Austria and against France through her years in France. That is not a way to gain a public support&#x2F;love to say the least. Compare that with the contemporary Russian Empress Catherine the Great who also came to her future motherland as a foreign (German) teenager girl to marry the future Emperor.  Russian history has her as &quot;Great&quot; and her rule as &quot;Golden Age&quot; even though, among the other things, she did put violently down  a large peasant revolt and was overall a tough absolute ruler over highly unequal society - very poor and powerless majority of population under highly privileged aristocracy. Yet  her policies and actions were notably pro-Russian and directed to, and very successfully at that, - using the language of today - making Russia great (especially for the most nationalism related definition of &quot;great&quot; like huge expansion of the Empire in all 4 directions mostly as result of successful application of military power or threat of it). Thus she is a great&#x2F;popular Russian Empress despite her lifetime German accent (which she had despite her eager learning of Russian upon arrival),  her famous promiscuity (be it true or not), &quot;accidental&quot; death of her husband Russian Emperor Peter III during her power taking coupe, etc. - i.e. it would be possible to find a lot of reasons for the hate if it were needed. The nationalism is kind of very primal overpowering force, which can bring extremes of popular love or hate.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Catherine_the_Great" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Catherine_the_Great</a>')
