For example, some non-Corona treatments are happening in much lower numbers than usually; how &quot;should&quot; that affect the number of deaths from the relevant causes and what numbers are actually observed? It&#x27;s not sensible to draw conclusions about Corona from the number of other-cause deaths without also looking at the changes to other-cause reasons and treatments.')
