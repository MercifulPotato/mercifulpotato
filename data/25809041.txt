The correct indentation immediately shows something fishy is going on...” [vanDeursen2014]. Arie van Deursen also argues that code formatting should be done by tools, not by hand, and shows that clearly this code was not routinely formatted automatically.<p>Praise then for languages with significant white space? Using a formatter tool to add the white space and a lint rule in your compiler to catch when it&#x27;s not done is a bandaid for something that should be encoded into the language in my opinion. Leaving this stuff optional to enforce only eats up productivity for no decent upside.')
