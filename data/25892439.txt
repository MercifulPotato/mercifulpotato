That’s wild, I had no idea. I’m glad they didn’t tear it down for McMansions as the article explains was the plan before preservationists intervened. It’s a very cool structure with historical significance. Bell Labs is particularly relevant to this crowd here in HN - it’s arguably the birthplace of our whole industry, and people have tried replicating its magic over the years.<p>To me the architect in the article is too quick to dismiss the premise of Bell Labs — giving researchers privacy and pastoral views. Sounds a lot like early Silicon Valley to me. They claim that it’s actually just the chance encounters that were important. There’s some truth to that — Steve Jobs famously designed the Pixar campus to maximize chance encounters. But I wouldn’t be so quick to discount a degree of space and privacy.<p>That’s kind of central to the whole discussion: the human balance between a need for privacy and a need for community. People want space, and they also want to be able to visit areas of density, and walk around. This used to be the mall, the big box bookstores.<p>I actually think this article was very interesting, and the architect was very articulate about a lot of things. But I’m not sure we’ve actually solved the core question: why did the malls decay? What changed? Was it e commerce? The shrinking middle class? Traffic just getting too snarled with no real solution?')
