But lately it’s been a struggle. I’ve asked myself, why am I still using this OS, which is basically just a pretty skin on top of a bunch of stuff (Mail, Mission Control, Messages ...) that I barely use? The dev experience keeps getting worse, I can’t run 32 bit apps anymore (goodbye, SNESx), system stability after upgrades is not as rock-solid it once was, and meanwhile they keep adding stuff I don’t need or want.<p>There was a thread here the other day about the lack of documentation for SwiftUI that resonated with me along the same lines. Why bother buying this hardware and developing on&#x2F;for it, if the company is just moving further away from the stuff I like to use?')
