That&#x27;s not my experience with Cypress. The Cypress e2e tests on our build server sometimes fail for no discernible reason. Then you run them locally, and <i>different</i> tests fail, sometimes for understandable reasons (but then why didn&#x27;t they fail on the server?) or sometimes also for no clear reason.<p>I&#x27;m spending a lot of time maintaining and fixing our Cypress tests, and the work they add seems far worse than the help they provide. Most of the time, a failing e2e test is not a problem with the code, but a problem with the test.<p>Honestly, I find myself longing for the days of Protractor. Horrible to set up perhaps, but in my memory of it, it was reliable once you got it working.')
