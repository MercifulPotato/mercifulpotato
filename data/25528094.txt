And, to be honest, CarPlay functionality (or similar) is pretty much fundamental - music, maps - and there&#x27;s a clear upside of having it integrated with the car (vs. the driver looking down at the phone while driving) and trivial cost (<i>cheaper</i> that developing own software &amp; OS).<p>The reason I want CarPlay <i>in the first place</i> is because I don&#x27;t trust carmakers to make good software (borne out of experience!).
