It&#x27;s when other people use them and you don&#x27;t know if they have them on or off. That&#x27;s what quietly sets the new beauty standed because everyone sees these retouched photos and assumes they are representative of reality. What I&#x27;d like to see is something in the image metadata that stores what filters were used so apps could display that info. I can&#x27;t see that happening though.')
