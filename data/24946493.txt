It would be cool if feature-extraction (image pre-processing and first network layer(s)) could run on the front-end, and the rest of the network&#x2F;search on the back-end, similar to how distributed speech recognition works. Then I could use a canned lib on the device that integrates w&#x2F;the camera, and get my results via a websocket. (Of course, I could still run everything on the client still as well.)')
