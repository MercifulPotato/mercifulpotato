Perks I&#x27;m over. I really don&#x27;t care, I can buy my own perks with the pay. I&#x27;ve saved up enough to buy quite the lifestyle back in Canada, and I plan to move back before I start a family. I&#x27;m just a few months from getting my green card, and I&#x27;m genuinely over it.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine raising kids in the US. The healthcare, oof. Even having kids, maternal mortality is 4X higher in the US than it is in Canada - among the worst in the OECD, and rising, while the rest of the OECD is falling. [1] Healthcare is just about the worst in the OECD along every major metric, even though it&#x27;s by far the most expensive. [2]<p>The capital was just insurrected, is currently a military encampment, the school shootings&#x2F;drills, the school metal detectors, the homeless, the riots, the lack of community. The general lack of progressivism. My street was looted a few months ago. Every business was walled off in plywood before the <i>election</i>. I mean, America doesn&#x27;t really have a &quot;left,&quot; just a center-right and a far-right, which really doesn&#x27;t align with my personal politics. I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;d explain any of that to my kids.<p>I plan to go back in the next year or two - likely to BC, and I&#x27;ll try to shore up the startup ecosystem there, investing, advising, and raising awareness of principals and practices.<p>After all, I graduated with no student debt. It&#x27;s time to give back.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;12&#x2F;527806002&#x2F;focus-on-infants-during-childbirth-leaves-u-s-moms-in-danger" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;12&#x2F;527806002&#x2F;focus-on-infants-du...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;unitedstates&#x2F;Health-at-a-Glance-2017-Key-Findings-UNITED-STATES.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;unitedstates&#x2F;Health-at-a-Glance-2017-Ke...</a>')
