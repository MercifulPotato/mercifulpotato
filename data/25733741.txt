This is fine to be upset about, but you can&#x27;t say &quot;they have too much control, therefor it&#x27;s illegal for them to do the things they&#x27;re doing&quot;. No, the laws you want haven&#x27;t been written (or repealed).<p>There&#x27;s also a ton of pie-in-the-sky dreaming that if we could just undo the &quot;bad-part&quot; of 230 then magically Twitter would have to host <i>things</i> because <i>reasons</i> which is a gross misunderstanding.<p>TL;dr- HN commenters tend to skew towards &quot;Engineer&quot; understanding and not &quot;Lawyer&quot; understand, and it&#x27;s causing them friction with reality lately.')
