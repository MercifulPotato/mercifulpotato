But again, that doesn&#x27;t mean the bugs don&#x27;t exist, and it doesn&#x27;t mean the game wouldn&#x27;t be better without the bugs. Where are you getting this &quot;the game should be bad for everyone&quot;?<p>If people enjoy this game, then that&#x27;s wonderful. Far be it from me to interfere with someone&#x27;s enjoyment of something. The problem is when people insist &quot;well <i>I</i> haven&#x27;t seen any bugs so the game is perfect and anyone saying otherwise should be ignored!&quot; when that is <i>clearly</i> not the case.')
