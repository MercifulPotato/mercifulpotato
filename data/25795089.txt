Technology and society should be at a state where - assuming you have network connectivity at all - that should be the case.<p>At the same time, I agree that there is practically criminal negligence of the education of people about what makes those techno-social institutions which &quot;just work&quot;, work:<p>* Commercial interests and the role and nature of large corporations in tech and elsewhere;<p>* The massive amount of hard work, expertise, and good will invested by people in public-benefit work (which could be writing FOSS or volunteering in retiree caregiving etc.)<p>* What the machinery of government - and its myriad branches and institutions - does, beyond the political horse race shown on the evening news;<p>and through that, the realization that free lunches get made by someone, and its very important who and how they get made.<p>&gt; Majority will never, ever, even think about it<p>It is a challenge for us to educate people around us about this fact.<p>&gt; I believe that it is time to stop making free products.<p>Software is free by its very nature. It is only state coercion via threats of incarceration and violence that we are deterred from copying software.')
