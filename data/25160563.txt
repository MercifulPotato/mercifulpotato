The sci-fi part is pretty disconnected from the history part.<p>Compare that to time travel in dystopian future in the last bioshock where you have some known elements but you also project fire from your hands to fight a mecha-lincoln. That establishes a parallel universe where anything goes and it doesn&#x27;t matter what you borrow into the story.')
