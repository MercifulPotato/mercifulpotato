Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[24688510, 24689821, 24688495], score=None, time=1601910945, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24687629, text='What&#x27;s the author proposing? That we voluntarily abstain from using electricity during certain times, or the government shut down electricity usage to households during certain times? The former is the equivalent of the government telling people to &quot;turn down your thermostat&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t drive SUVs&quot;. That&#x27;s basically useless because most people don&#x27;t care. The latter wouldn&#x27;t work because most people place high value on continuous electricity, so such a proposal will be political suicide. In the unlikely event that such a proposal does get implemented, most people will either run their own generators or power storage systems (as evidenced by PaulHoule&#x27;s comment), which will be much less efficient than a large scale solution and therefore be a net-negative.')
