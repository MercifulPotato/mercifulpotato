While yes, for certain domains, you&#x27;ll go further faster with Python and its libraries, Racket has got a surprising amount of stuff in it and it&#x27;s well-documented!<p>(I bring up Racket because DrScheme has since become DrRacket, and the aside on the article explains that the astronaut in question was working through How to Design Programs, which uses Racket as it&#x27;s teaching language. Also, this is Shriram Krishnamurthi&#x27;s blog, and he&#x27;s one of Racket&#x27;s principle creators.)')
