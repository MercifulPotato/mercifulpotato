I made accounts for myself and family members on the German host privacytools.io. (I since learned Debian operates two distinct homeservers, on social.debian.org, but cannot tell which is for what.)<p>The UX is pretty good, but certain oddities stand out.<p>1. When visiting rooms, it spends a very great amount of time displaying a spinner instead of postings. It displays a banner offering to scroll back to the last read posting, but forgets that you have already seen later ones. It often displays a banner indicating some bot is operating, but no indication what it is for, or any way to control it or find out more.<p>2. Messages in the scrollback for private rooms are very often replaced with a note, &quot;cannot get key&quot;; and sometimes appear again, much later.<p>3. Element advertises an ability to conduct audio and video calls, but I have not succeeded in getting the other end to ring, in recent months.<p>4. There are supposed to be gateways available to direct Signal and SMS traffic to&#x2F;from one&#x27;s Matrix client, but I did not succeed in getting them to work--probably just because their documentation was wholly inadequate.<p>I spent quite a few months on a subscription to Purism&#x27;s LibremOne homeserver, but abandoned it when it became clear they had no intention ever to maintain it.<p>I have not been able to determine whether 1, 2, or 3 above are the fault of my homeserver, or matrix.org, or the protocol.<p>A Matrix client should be able to work in multiple accounts &#x2F; homeservers at once, as is done with e-mail clients, but I don&#x27;t know of any that can.<p>It seems like it should be possible to run a homeserver on local equipment, tunneling to ports on a cheap VPS, but I have not found anything suggesting how.<p>Enlightenment on any of the above welcome.')
