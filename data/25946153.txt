You have to work a bit harder, have already built the relationships, or simply be secure knowing that you can deliver value to the org and even if people do not see you on a consistent basis that you are valued by the team&#x2F;org. Embrace the change though I think, its certainly worth the tradeoffs in my mind, no commute is pure glory.')
