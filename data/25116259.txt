Item(by='earthboundkid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605556730, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25114605, text='&quot;X in pi&quot; is an interesting thought experiment, but practically speaking, the least efficient way to do anything, since finding a string of N digits in pi will require a search space exponentially much larger than N on average, so it ends up just being an extremely inefficient encoding. A huffman coding + base32&#x2F;base64 is a better &quot;databaseless&quot; short URL system.')
