I have been using Azure for work and it&#x27;s the most frustrating, inconsistent, often-broken, confusing and stress-inducing cloud service that my teammates and I have ever been subjected to. It left such a bad taste that I am quite certain I would flat-out refuse to use it again in the future, or work somewhere that uses it.<p>Take my advice: just don&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s not worth it. Use AWS, use GCP, use Digital Ocean. Use some random cloud provider. Just don&#x27;t use Azure.')
