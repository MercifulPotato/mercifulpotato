Item(by='_dibly', descendants=None, kids=[24672304], score=None, time=1601730525, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671686, text='I&#x27;m not a parent, so I don&#x27;t really have any grounds to argue how someone should raise their children.  The only anecdote I&#x27;ll add is that I would be reluctant to hold someone back from an opportunity to have the normalcy that I couldn&#x27;t have in school.  When I got to high school it was like my ADHD kicked into full gear, I started performing significantly worse and outright failing classes.  My classmates, friends, and even teachers treated me like a lazy burnout.<p>Out of 120 students, I was the only one who didn&#x27;t graduate that year. Sometimes I feel like I have the world&#x27;s worst case of impostor syndrome because of how high school went for me.  I was constantly testing top of the class but most everyone looked at me like an abject failure. I went into college with practically zero note-taking or studying skills and the first couple of years were a nightmare, even with medication.<p>All this is to say that medication can help when you need to feel normal, but it can&#x27;t replace the skills you should have been developing.  Some people can develop those skills and get shit done without medication and I applaud them, but I tried that route and ended up _years_ behind my peers.')
