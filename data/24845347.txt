Every comment that starts with &quot;Im &#x2F; used to be progressive but&quot; is always the same. Decades of neoliberal&#x2F;republican&#x2F;right wing interference,corruption and greed has destroyed your society not &quot;progressive values&quot; (which in other countries without Murdoch et al interference things are far better). They have dug a hole, whilst enriching themselves and their fellow cronies, and then tricked others to jump in. You have been made to think its somehow the progressive lefts fault. You have been made to think its the people who have been the most exploited fault (other countries, poor people, disadvantaged etc). You deserve what is probably coming.')
