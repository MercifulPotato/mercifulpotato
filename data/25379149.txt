The women may not even exist. They may not have been quoted correctly if they even exist. There is no expectation it&#x27;s been fact checked. The article is in the opinion section, which means NY Times doesn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s journalism at all.<p>You misunderstand what the opinion section is for: it&#x27;s not for fiction, it&#x27;s for <i>advocacy</i> [edit: and subjectivity].  A direct condemnation of PornHub or expression of revulsion to them (which I recall the article had) would have been totally inappropriate for the news pages.<p>Nicholas Kristof would be fired if he made all this up.')
