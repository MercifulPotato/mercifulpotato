I learn english for various reasons but leaving the EU is not one of them. The EU has lots of faults and I won&#x27;t deny it, but so does any other place. So what? One day I might leave to retire on a caribbean island, but it won&#x27;t be out of bitterness. If you don&#x27;t feel the same way, be honest and don&#x27;t project it on others.')
