The voice acting, story, and world are beautiful and polished. It&#x27;s clear that they just didn&#x27;t have time to implement like half the gameplay they promised.<p>The result is a big beautiful and empty world with a linear path. There&#x27;s little to do, and really little point to the huge open world. 90% of missions are inside buildings on foot. And the ones that aren&#x27;t uniformly suck because vehicle mechanics and AI just isn&#x27;t there')
