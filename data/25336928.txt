A small annual fee to not have to deal with most of the economic cost if my house burns down or if I get cancer is worth it in how it reduces volatility.<p>Once you have a high net worth, paying for small amounts of insurance becomes more questionable, because variability matters much less and because of the negative expected value of the transaction.<p>This model misses some of the corner cases.  Title insurance and boiler insurance have loss ratios of almost nothing, for instance, but are extremely economically useful.  (The real service they&#x27;re providing is inspection and research to make sure that the risk is negligible before insuring the risk).  Auto insurance has a negative EV, but when my carrier subrogated when someone rear-ended me it was useful and convenient.  Insuring a package so that you don&#x27;t need to investigate shipping calamities from your customers can be useful.')
