Item(by='happyviolinist', descendants=1, kids=[24703223], score=4, time=1602022056, title='My first side project launch was pretty weak. How to make the most of it?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve got no CS background but wanted to build an online business. After a long time of playing around with tutorials and waiting to stumble upon a perfect idea, I decided to just start working on something that I felt I could finish in a reasonable timeframe. Long story short, started working on a Product Hunt style listing where companies could post their affiliate marketing programs and bloggers could search for the most interesting ones.<p>In about two months I learned enough about Django&#x2F;Heroku&#x2F;AWS to get an MVP up and running: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commissiondb.com<p>Now I only needed to find some users. So I did the obvious thing and posted the site on some relevant subreddits (e.g. r&#x2F;affiliatemarketing) and listed it on Product Hunt. To my mild disappointment, I got basically no traffic. Maybe 10 visitors total. The highlight of my launch was when some bot decided to try brute forcing my Django admin panel and kept beating at it for 24 hours straight. :)<p>Despite the lacklustre initial performance I&#x27;m kind of proud that I got this thing up in the first place. However, it is quite obvious that acquiring users is very hard and I&#x27;m not good at it.<p>At this point, lots of questions come to mind:\n- Keep working on it or move on? How do you determine when to quit if there is no initial traction?\n- How to improve the &quot;launch&quot; with future projects? I now realize that most submissions in PH, for example, don&#x27;t ever even make it to the main page. To get there you would probably need to mobilize some critical mass of people to vote for you right after you publish? How do people do this when they&#x27;re just starting out and don&#x27;t have an established audience?\n- What are the alternative ways for user acquisition? For paid services I would imagine direct sales or paid ads, but for a site like this I can only think of content marketing i.e. blogging.\n- How would you gauge interest in something like this before building it?')
