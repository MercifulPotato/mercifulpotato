I&#x27;d bet that the price of oil is not going to go above $80 or so in the next twenty years.<p>Two major reasons, and a bunch of minor ones.<p>1: massive quantities of non-OPEC oil are available in shale and tar sands.   Right now these are only barely profitable, but if the price of oil increases production there will increase, stabilizing prices.<p>2: renewable energy is now just barely cheaper than other forms of energy, but they&#x27;re projected to drop dramatically over the next years, radically transforming the energy market.<p>Some uses of hydrocarbon cannot be easily replaced by renewable electricity but most can.   When a cheaper substitute is available, demand and price drop.<p>The only way the consumer price of oil is going to go up over the next few years is if governments come their senses and put in place a carbon tax or equivalent.   (And that&#x27;s reason #3 -- the environmental movement will demand that the world use fewer hydrocarbons, forcing less demand, forcing prices before the carbon tax to go down.)')
