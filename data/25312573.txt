The plugin could use this API instead of direct calls. Then if MySQL had an option to use a specific environment implementation for a plugin, then testers could drop in their own implementation under test.<p>Getting that sort of support by MySQL is an example of what I think you mean by &quot;cultural challenge.&quot;')
