A better set could have likely avoided the ICCCM etc. but you can do a lot with just reparent+position - WMs are mostly normal clients after all.<p>Compare that to say the practically obligatory &#x27;xdg_wm_base&#x27; specification, you are much more locked down, and the objects to work with are strongly interconnected. If you want to work around that as a 3rd party developer it&#x27;s a political process + waiting for n*m compositors and toolkits to adapt.<p>People tend to miss that Arcan is a Wayland compositor as well, but those clients gets a special path where the WM has to follow extra sets of rules because of it.<p>I see it as a gradient. Neither is entirely Green (Mechanism) or Red (Policy) but if you look at the sets of both sides and position, I doubt you&#x27;ll assign the same colors.')
