The more business you do with a supplier&#x2F;platform, the cheaper your unit costs get.  If you&#x27;re a small business buying 100 widgets, the price per widget is a lot higher than if you&#x27;re a big business buying 100,000.  Same with normal SaaS - try calling Stripe and asking them for a fee discount on your $100 revenue&#x2F;month app vs. asking them for the same discount on your $1,000,000 revenue&#x2F;month app.<p>The reason Apple doesn&#x27;t use this normal model is that the mobile app market is completely screwed up - you get exactly two real choices for distribution if you want to make any money at all as a small developer.')
