That honesty doesn&#x27;t seem to have worked out very well for them politically - I&#x27;m pretty sure that being so upfront about it fuelled a lot of the speculation about herd immunity, which somehow seems to have outlasted the current Europe-wide practical demonstration that yes, lockdown fatigue is real no matter what the British press said at the time - but you certainly can&#x27;t argue that they lied about it like China did.')
