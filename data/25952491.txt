Item(by='ajtjp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611884405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25945675, text='Background: I used Opera Presto as my main browser from 2007-2014, and Vivaldi since 2016 (2015 being a mix of Opera, Firefox, and Vivaldi).  I&#x27;ve used Firefox as my main browser at work for most of the past four years.<p>One big factor for me is the customizability without having to rely on extensions.  I trust Vivaldi (and von Tetzchner), and don&#x27;t have to worry about whether I trust extension makers.  The customization options in Vivaldi tend to work pretty darn well too, which can be more hit-and-miss with third party ones in Firefox.<p>Single-key shortcuts are also a big win for Vivaldi for me.  I got used to these in Opera and they&#x27;re great for efficiency while web browsing.  Maybe I can get them with an extension for Firefox, but it&#x27;s enabling one check box in Vivaldi.  It&#x27;s similar to why some people like vim plugins for browsers, but with less vim expertise required.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen Firefox remove a lot of features over the years.  XUL extensions being the big one, but there are others.  Firefox Hello.  Firefox Panorama, just as I was starting to take a liking to it.  Vivaldi has a philosophy of adding features that let you customize the browser to how you like it, and if only 0.2% of users use that feature but it makes them really happy, that&#x27;s fine.  Firefox will remove features if not enough users adopt it.  Thus my trust that Firefox is going to keep features that I like has been lowered over the years, making me more hesitant to try new Firefox features, and generally more hesitant about Firefox.<p>Although I&#x27;m considering switching part of my home browsing back to Firefox because of its ability to not autoplay videos.  Too many sites have those nowadays (and too often, self-hosted and not as third-party ads that are easily blocked), and Blink-based browsers can&#x27;t stop them, and I&#x27;m getting pretty tired of having to pause&#x2F;hide videos all the time so I can focus on reading articles.')
