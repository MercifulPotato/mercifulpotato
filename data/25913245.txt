For the first time I can remember, people were actually trying to hold the President accountable for something. Now it is true that most of that was driven by the fact that they didn’t like who the President happened to be at the time, so maybe we can get that to work in our favor again.<p>&gt; More specifically, it would be nice if establishment media and political figures didn&#x27;t respond to this distrust with castigation.<p>Well on the one hand I agree with that, but on the other hand this is the result of some complicated interactions (no matter how you view the facts on the ground). If their distrust is actually motivated and harmful then I’m sure its not an act for those establishment types to castigate it. On the other hand such activity is sure to increase distrust. So  we’re stuck again.<p>&gt; Distrusting government would still make sense for me personally. It would be idyllic if people looked towards decentralization, localism and private solutions. Trust in their local institutions or community, while drastically reducing the purview of the federal government. That&#x27;s just my personal preference. I&#x27;m not sure it is applicable in the widespread, pragmatic sense.<p>I agree generally<p>&gt; Some kind of political figure reaching across the aisle, recognizing the concerns of those who feel disenfranchised looks like the pragmatic solution that isn&#x27;t happening. Instead I see actions and accusations that are predictably creating more division.<p>I agree')
