I listen to a ton of music, and after years of hearing a large and broad selection of things, I feel like almost any and every song sounds basically the same as almost any and every other.<p>The few times I hear something that I consider genuinely novel and creative, I get very excited. I still listen to dozens of new albums per month, every month, just to chase that dragon of finding something actually original like that.<p>I don&#x27;t really have an emotional response to music, generally, or even perceive what I&#x27;d think of as an emotional landscape, so that might explain the difference here. I just really enjoy music, and enjoy trying to make it, too.<p>To me it feels like it&#x27;s just something that can be intrinsically pleasurable. Like Jackson Pollock - I feel zero emotion from any of his work, but it&#x27;s extremely intrinsically enjoyable and my favorite visual art that I&#x27;ve seen. My favorite music is exactly like that (and often even shares some structural similarities to Pollock&#x27;s work and techniques). When I look at a Pollock painting or listen to one of my favorite songs, it just feels like wireheading; it feels kind of like a lot of dopamine activity somewhere in my brain, basically. An appreciation of the pure aesthetics and &quot;good&quot;ness, with zero emotional sentiment or perception about it.<p>Out of curiosity, how many previously-unheard albums do you generally listen to every year?')
