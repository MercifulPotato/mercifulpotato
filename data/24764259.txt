A few months ago I discovered a neat little heuristic: the best loop never self-intersect. And a few days ago, I found that there is a definite algorithm that gives a result whose worst case is bounded WRT to the optimal.<p>My question is how do you find all those algorithms? Wikipedia never really feel like a good introductory nor discovery place. In particular, some problems have been perfectly studied by scholars, but you don&#x27;t find them because you have not found the keywords that will direct google in your search. And I am not a researcher, so I don&#x27;t keep a tab on a domain, I&#x27;m a jack of all trades, I work on a wide set of things.')
