Seems like something that would definitely get reported on.<p>In all my time living in low-income housing, I never witnessed something like this. And I had plenty of sleepless nights when neighbors would throw ragers. Some got broken up (mostly when a fight would break out among attendees), and I&#x27;m sure some of the cops weren&#x27;t pleasant. But I never witnessed cops jumping out of their cars with their guns blazing.<p>Although I&#x27;m one piece of anecdotal evidence, so I&#x27;d like to see the evidence you have of this event.')
