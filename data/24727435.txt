A quick search on my past comment shows that was 2016. And I remember checking Xilinx market cap last year and it was ~$30+ B, while AMD was only ~$50 B. I was thinking the chance of that <i>ever</i> happening is going to be very slim. ( I <i>was</i> an AMD Shareholder, but I never thought it would be $100B mark cap company, sold it all last year)  Now AMD is at $100B+, while Xilinx is at Sub $30B. The market is crazy.<p>But things has changed since 2016 - 2018. I used to see the move to FPGA as going offensive attack in the server space, now both AMD, and Intel are doing what ever they can to fence off ARM.')
