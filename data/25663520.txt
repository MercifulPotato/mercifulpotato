If staff switch teams more often than that, teams never reach their full potential.<p>On one hand, I agree with this, as I have been moved quickly between projects in the past, when I was more needed elsewhere. It helped to keep things interesting but I would have liked more stability.<p>On the other hand, there is a risk that people get stuck in one place for a while with no mobility, working on something they don’t like. I have seen this as well. Good people weren’t allowed to move, so they quit. As the team was shrinking, the others had to stay. Needless to say that morale was poor.<p>There is a fine line between the two.')
