Item(by='ftruzzi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610055212, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25676818, text='&gt; Forcing people to spend their time at work is as close to actual slavery as contemporary society allows, so that&#x27;s what they do.<p>I completely agree with this, but I&#x27;m not sure this is necessarily beneficial for companies (compared to potential alternatives). In the end, the quality of their products benefits from happier employees, whatever &quot;happier employees&quot; means.<p>When I switched jobs from contracting at a FAANG to working for a worse company it was mostly due to bad mood in general. The job wasn&#x27;t interesting anymore and I would feel like a well-paid slave. It felt like everything, including the house I was living in, was tied to or revolving around my job. It felt like I didn&#x27;t have anything, except the job and what came with it.<p>Had they offered a part-time option with half the money or so, I probably would have stayed and started making the steps I&#x27;m making now as unemployed towards improving myself (more physical activity, side projects, volunteering, working on my mental health)<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be all the companies though, it can just be a few and then a few more. Gitlab and now Gumtree definitely stand out to me as one of the very few companies I&#x27;d be happy to work with and that&#x27;s because of their approach to work.')
