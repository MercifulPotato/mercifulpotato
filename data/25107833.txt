One of my ex colleagues is a junior dev who has been using elixir for 3 years now and didn&#x27;t need to use those special aspects of BEAM.<p>As a Ruby expert, Elixir is substantially easier, learning BEAM is a joke (and very instructive) compared to learning the entirety of the Ruby object model.<p>I can&#x27;t think of reasons to use Rails nowdays. If you are in the CRUD apps market, use Postgrest or similar products. As for the rest sure, choose any language you want, the framework is way less relevant (arguably: detrimental) at that point.<p>The industry has proven extensively that for non-trivial projects, Rails is damaging due to ActiveRecord.')
