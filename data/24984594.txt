What you had to do was send a CTCP ECHO containing the &quot;+++ATH0&quot; to a channel -- or an individual user, but sending it to an entire channel full of people was a helluva lot more fun!<p>Anyways, I don&#x27;t recall the exact command nowadays but it was<p><pre><code>  &#x2F;CTCP #channel ECHO Goodbye +++ATH0\n</code></pre>\nor something very similar.<p>As long as the &quot;victim&#x27;s&quot; IRC client wasn&#x27;t ignoring those CTCP commands, it would &quot;echo&quot; the text and, as expected, command their modem to hang up.<p>Perhaps it <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> have worked... but I promise you that it absolutely <i>did</i>.<p>(Also, you could do the same thing by putting the &quot;command&quot; into the payload of an (ICMP) &quot;ping&quot; -- and that&#x27;s a completely different thing from the &quot;ping of death&quot; that was discovered in that same era.)<p>--<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Client-to-client_protocol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Client-to-client_protocol</a>')
