I do believe that you shouldn&#x27;t be forced to do business with someone.  And it doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re black, white, disabled, Nazi, Muslim, etc.  But it does matter if the <i>reason</i> you don&#x27;t want to do business with them is because of racism, sexism, agism, etc.  If I all the sudden only want to do business with 100 people and I&#x27;m currently doing business with 200.  I can randomly select 100 people and punt them.  I don&#x27;t need a reason.  I can punt the least profitable.  I can punt them because of alphabetical order.  But it would be unfair and immoral of me to punt them because they are black or disabled.<p>In the case of Facebook, they&#x27;re just offering people a free space to post stuff.  They&#x27;re not obligated to continue to that forever.  They don&#x27;t need a good reason to punt you.  But their are situations where they could have a bad reason.<p>The question is, is this topic a bad reason to punt people?  Given the low obligation that Facebook has to host anything -- I don&#x27;t think so.')
