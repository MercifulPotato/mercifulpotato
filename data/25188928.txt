At least that was my thinking, so I built it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theymadethat.com&#x2F;people&#x2F;s730px&#x2F;emmett-shear" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theymadethat.com&#x2F;people&#x2F;s730px&#x2F;emmett-shear</a><p>If you scroll down, you&#x27;ll see some of the tools (I assumed) he used.<p>If you go to one of his projects (Twitch), you can see what he used for it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theymadethat.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;7da659d8-629f-5c10-9160-7a371fc76a4c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theymadethat.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;7da659d8-629f-5c10-9160-7a...</a><p>That in turn should show up in the main product profile, which results in credit being given like IMDB<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theymadethat.com&#x2F;things&#x2F;wz7&#x2F;twitchtv&#x2F;show_built_with#focus_this" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theymadethat.com&#x2F;things&#x2F;wz7&#x2F;twitchtv&#x2F;show_built_with...</a><p>The problems are two fold:<p>1. It&#x27;s more work to do than a normal resume since it&#x27;s project-centric.  Also unless you&#x27;re constantly tracking this, does everyone remember all the libraries they&#x27;re using? Probably not (There&#x27;s still a lot of work needed on the UX front. It&#x27;s not very optimized for mobile)<p>2. People have to start using it.
