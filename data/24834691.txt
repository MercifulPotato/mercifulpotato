It was essentially wikipedia before there was wikipedia with the upside that it had curated and citable sources and generally a much higher quality of writing.<p>In my eyes, over the years, wikipedia has caught up a lot in terms of quality of writing and wikimedia now has a lot of images and video.<p>I wonder if there is a way to just download the whole wikipedia for easy distribution like encarta.')
