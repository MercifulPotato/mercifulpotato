Also, if beef is a full 1&#x2F;3 of our agricultural emissions (9-10% overall), then that&#x27;s a massive amount so a few people can have their cherished foods, at everyone else&#x27;s expense (tragedy of the commons here).<p>Second, beef is proportionally MUCH worse than all other foods: we can&#x27;t afford to leave a full 1&#x2F;25th of our emissions on the table.<p>Third, you&#x27;re ignoring land use, land degradation, water use, and negative health effects of beef production and consumption. To look solely at &quot;US emissions&quot; in a narrowly defined way misses many of the harms of beef.<p>Fourth, cows are mammalian species who endure great suffering and misery so that your mere 3% of emissions can lead to a relatively smaller number of calories consumed. Is it worth it to cause suffering on a mass scale for the least healthy, most emitting food source?')
