Snowflake.  Snowman.  You&#x27;ve also been putting &quot;Buildings&quot; together.  House.  Castle.  ... And now you&#x27;ve got an igloo.  Where do you put that?  &quot;Things that are sports like&quot;.  You&#x27;ve got a football, a baseball bat... and now a hockey stick.  Does that go in the cold things?  Oh, here&#x27;s a stadium - does that go in the sports area? or the buildings group?  You&#x27;ve been putting round things together - frog eggs, wheels, and this disk with a slash through it.  And now you get things that look like pills... was that thing with a slash through it a pill?  Should you move it over to the pills section? or leave it with the round things?  Or maybe move the pills adjacent to the round things.<p>So on one hand, the game is about organization of things... on the other, it&#x27;s a word and idea game about how you group particular things together.')
