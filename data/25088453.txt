Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[25096745], score=None, time=1605307441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25088221, text='I don&#x27;t see HSR as a good alternative to air travel in a country as spread out as the US. a proper HSR route for the northeast corridor would be great; it&#x27;s kind of ridiculous that a plane is the best way to get from boston to DC. when you start looking at traversing entire coasts, it&#x27;s really hard for a train to compete with air travel. a non-stop flight from seattle to LA takes about two and a half hours, plus all the security nonsense. at 200mph, a train that makes zero stops would take about six hours. once you factor in travel to&#x2F;from the airport and security, that&#x27;s actually not too bad, but nonstop train routes are uncommon. the situation is even worse for cross-country flights. NY to LA is about six hours by plane; it would be about fourteen hours on a (highly unlikely) nonstop train.<p>frankly (as an east-coaster) I would be happy just to see the existing rail lines be price competitive with airlines. I greatly prefer traveling by train, and I would be willing to accept a longer transit time if it were not both slower <i>and</i> more expensive.')
