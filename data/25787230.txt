It makes things a lot clearer.<p>I notice that you mention &quot;Machine Learning Engineer&quot; as a separate role. If in the idealized world, data scientists do analytics and train models, and data engineers take care of data, then what do Machine Leaning Engineers do? Are they, basically, software engineers who specialize in putting other peoples&#x27; models into production?<p>And you are right in sensing my confusion. There seems to be an abundance or data-related titles, which seem to overlap in their functions a lot, but are also very different when you examine them closely. So thank you again for your responses, they are very helpful.')
