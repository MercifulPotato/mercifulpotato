Nice ways to decommoditify and justify price increases, in direct opposition of my goals as a consumer: to reduce food and packaging waste.<p>I&#x27;ll grant them that kids do love things they can squeeze. My 18mo loves the baby food pouches. When we&#x27;re in the store, she&#x27;ll spot them and grab them off the shelves as we&#x27;re wheeling by them. We ended up buying resealable pouches that we stuff with home-made food, to cut down on plastic waste.')
