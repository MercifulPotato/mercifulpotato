Ya it rains, but its a normal 4 season type of thing. Rain most of winter with some snow for like 2 weeks. Light showers mixed with sun in the spring. Pretty warm and sunny during the summer but not hot, then light rains and winds in the fall. People made it out and warned me about &quot;Washington Rain&quot; like it was going to be raining 360 days out of the year at torrential levels, with grey&#x2F;dark skys and the apocalypse. Most of the time the rain is super light and gentle with no wind, and the sky is white if not broken up with blue sky')
