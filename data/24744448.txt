Delivery company lost the tablet, that&#x27;s it. The difference is that I can guarantee Amazon will just refund you after few days if you tell them you never got it, while another retailer(ekhm ekhm...pcworld) would just say that the item shows as delivered so you can get lost. That&#x27;s where the main difference is - Amazon is willing to accept some amount of fraud to offer good experience to legitimate customers experiencing problems.')
