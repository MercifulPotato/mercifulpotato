So that&#x27;s one bit of it. But the other part is that these are implemented on iterators, rather than on the type directly, so usually what happens is &quot;turn that into an iterator, then do map&#x2F;fold&#x2F;filter&#x2F;whatever on the iterator. It is easy to convert the compile-time length array to a run-time length iterator, so it ends up being a uniform interface.')
