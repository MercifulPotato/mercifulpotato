It wasn&#x27;t just some random thing the people of the 1950s made up on the spot.<p>When 4&#x2F;6 of your sons grow to adulthood you can&#x27;t live in the same household as all of them.  You live with one of them (probably the most or least functional one).  2 of the others have their own farms (one probably gets yours, maybe you split your farm between them if it&#x27;s big enough) so you probably pick one of them.  The 4th you never see because he runs a business making cart wheels or something in the next village over.  The 5th left town to get a job in the port by the sea when he was 15 and you haven&#x27;t seen him since.  And of your daughters that survived childhood will all move in with their husbands.  If you run the numbers for them it&#x27;s the same thing.<p>Multi generational households don&#x27;t work at scale simply because of the numbers involved.  Anyone pretending that that&#x27;s how most people lived prior to the industrial revolution doesn&#x27;t understand how many kids people had back then.  At best you might get 10-25% of households having a grandparent around depending on the infant mortality rate at any given time.  The birth rates and life expectancy just don&#x27;t support more.  10-25% certainly isn&#x27;t abnormal, but implying it is the default is Olympic level mental gymnastics.')
