And good luck with it keeping working with future upgrades of both, hardware and software. Heck, even today it is pretty difficult to get things working reliably unless it is a thinkpad or some other Linux friendly brand.<p>A Mac with subpar support for a webcam, energy saving, suspend&#x2F;resume, the trackpad, brightness&#x2F;volume controls, etc is not a laptop, it&#x27;s an expensive paperweight.<p>In my opinion, other than doing it for the sake of learning and the challenge of it, this will lead nowhere in the long term unless you get any kind of commitment or support from Apple. And I hope I&#x27;m wrong but that&#x27;s very, very unlikely to happen any time soon.')
