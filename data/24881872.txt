Item(by='yebyen', descendants=None, kids=[24882069], score=None, time=1603572648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24881642, text='There are fair use rights that are not able to be satisfied without a copy.<p>You can assert all of that, but unless you have some landmark precedent to cite that agrees with what you&#x27;re arguing, I&#x27;d like to hear a court decide on that. Sony Betamax says what I&#x27;m arguing, and archival can be for fair use, too. There is 36 Cinema, which maintains copies of classic kung-fu movies that aren&#x27;t available for purchase anymore, and invites Rza from Wu-Tang Clan on periodically for broadcast viewing with a value-add, Rza&#x27;s commentary. Since the movies are no longer available for sale, there is no impact to marketability. Since commentary is added, transformative. That&#x27;s all fair use, format-shifting. I say youtube-dl is a tool for format shifting, with substantial non-infringing uses that present a compelling value and don&#x27;t impact marketability, exactly in line with the Betamax case. If format-shifting and copy for archival was strictly prohibited as you suggest, those movies could be lost forever whenever a format becomes obsolete. When was the last time you saw a VCR? (CD or DVD player?)<p>That&#x27;s just one of the things that the fair-use rules and exemptions in copyright were written to help resolve positively.<p>You can record anything on TV with a VCR, even if it&#x27;s available separately for purchase on video. There is no technical way I can see in which this scenario differs. You are not obligated to pay for content again and again in every medium, format-shifting is also an allowable kind of fair use. Everything you&#x27;re saying makes sense, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as clearcut as you say, until it has been decided by a court (and appealed, and decided again by a higher court.)')
