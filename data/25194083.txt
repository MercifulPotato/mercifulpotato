It’s a feedback loop,  being poor directly results in worse access to healthcare etc, but also because it’s much harder for sick people to hold down a job etc.<p>Edit: Bottom 5 states  by life expectancy vs their median household income rank (#). West Virginia 74.8 years (#50) Mississippi 74.9 years (#49) Alabama 75.4 years (#44) Kentucky 75.4 years (#43) Arkansas 75.9 years (#48).  It’s not perfectly correlated but the relationship is very strong.<p>PS: Great Britain actually has significantly more ethnic diversity than WV and lower median household income than WV yet life expectancy is more than 5 years longer.')
