Item(by='croissants', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610983875, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25822417, text='My personal response is that it seems like raising your own biological offspring, even with all of the lizard-brain this-will-eventually-pass-on-my-genes bonus, is already hard for a lot of people --- look at all of the internet threads asking if people regret having kids --- so subtracting off the biological offspring bonus and adopting seems like it would be very difficult. Add in the trauma already experienced by children in the foster system, and it gets even harder. Then I wonder if I&#x27;m the kind of person who can love a difficult child, and I wonder how good it is for a child to grow up with a parent who deep-down sees them as an object of responsibility rather than love. Of course, strong bonds between adopted parents and children are certainly possible, but it is in the end harder, right?<p>I admire your pragmatic embrace of working on this problem; I also think chalking up the cost of adoption as &quot;an inconvenience to...daily lives&quot; is...underselling it?')
