Even exams where I thought I did good, I&#x27;d completely bomb.<p>Because oral exams are quite time limited, you really only have one shot at each sub-question. And how good you are, is 100% subjective to the people judging you - and since this is in person, lots of things can influence their judgement. Hell, they may even have some latent bias.<p>And as others have mentioned, it brings a bunch of stress on the candidate.<p>I guess it&#x27;s a very personal preference. I always did better on home exams, the stress-level was pretty much non-existent, compared to the others.')
