Nobody wants to work from the browser.<p>Some do, some quite the opposite. Me personally i want to have as few desktop apps installed as possible. They are warranted only in few special cases - browser, video &amp; music player, Excel. Other than that there really is no need to have any desktop app nowadays.<p>&gt; Both of them were recording it on a desktop, in a desktop application, while having a call over another desktop application.<p>Yeah this can be easily done from browser also<p>&gt; it’s hard to select text, hard to search on a page, hard to have multiple tabs, hard to move data between apps<p>excuse me? It&#x27;s harder to select text or search text in browser than in desktop apps? What? Text search is one ctrl-f away on ANY web page. Switching between tabs in a browser is alt-num.<p>Desktop apps have no tabs and a lot of times you switch between completely different UIs.<p>Moving data between apps depends completely on the app itself. It either offers some kind of data export or does not. It doesn&#x27;t have to do anything with desktop apps or web apps in general<p>&gt; For example, you are adding an event to the calendar. You need to lookup an address for the event in the mail, which has a link that opens a browser.<p>Yeah in a web apps you at least have some unique link to it. Linking to something on your local computer in some desktop app isn&#x27;t even possible<p>&gt; Ability to have multiple windows open at the same time is the desktop’s superpower.<p>You know you can have multiple tabs open in one browser right?<p>I like Nikita&#x27;s articles and if he or anybody prefers desktop over web that&#x27;s fine. Also the library he is starting - great. But the announcement could really omit the nonsensical comparisons and generalisations of web vs desktop')
