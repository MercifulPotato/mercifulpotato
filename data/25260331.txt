Try searching for &quot;site:wsj.com california&quot; on Google and let us know what you get. Dig a little deeper and you&#x27;ll find that what&#x27;s actually happening is the Murdoch&#x27;s are allowing a Fox Newsification of the opinion section, essentially a compromise between the actual journalists there and trash&#x2F;gutter opinion pieces intended to push a narrative. There&#x27;s even news about this news[1]. So no, this isn&#x27;t some game of 19 dimensional chess, its just a stupid false narrative being pushed by people with power, vested interests, massive jealousy, thin skin, and many grudges.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newrepublic.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;159953&#x2F;will-wall-street-journal-destroyed-opinion-section" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newrepublic.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;159953&#x2F;will-wall-street-jour...</a>')
