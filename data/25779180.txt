I think most recognize the importance of persistence in the progenitor of an idea.  What&#x27;s often missed in these discussions is how important the subsequent incremental progress is: working out consequences of a theoretical insight, figuring out what you can build on top of a new tech, etc.<p>- I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion about the optimal amount of &quot;risk,&quot; but I do think making risk existential (as in one would starve without a research breakthrough) would have the opposite effect, because while we all say we like people to take risks, what we really mean is like people to </i>take risks and suceeed<i>.  And yes, too little risk can breed complacency.<p>And yes, convolutions are a specific kind of linear transformation, whereas matrices represent linear transformations on vector spaces.  The specific structure is that convolutions represent linear transformations that are translation-invariant, a property that many types of data (e.g., images) have, at least approximately.<p>(</i>) My perspective as an academic but not a computer scientist.')
