I am more used to the node-express or golang&#x27;s way of working where you start off with the smallest and simplest scaffolding and then add on the bits that you need. Rails and ASP .Net are not something I want to use for my small time projects.<p>Its probably unreasonable for me to expect .Net to be something completely different from what it really is, but I really hope that .Net grows up to enable other way of using it.')
