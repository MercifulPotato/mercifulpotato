Is it just because of legacy systems that handle settlement in periodic (daily?) batches?<p>The legacy systems reason is a big one. There are banks with mainframes built in the 80&#x27;s as part of the critical infrastructure. Another reason is that everyone doesn&#x27;t communicate directly with the main clearing house. e.g. brokers clear with other brokers who then clear with the clearing house etc.<p>&gt; To me, &quot;Your cash can&#x27;t be spent yet because the TSLA sale you just made hasn&#x27;t settled&quot; would seem a lot more understandable than &quot;We&#x27;re halting GME purchases&quot;.<p>There have been interesting solutions to disputes. e.g. I think it was NYMEX that had a rule for floor traders along the lines of &quot;If Trader A and Trader B have a clearing issue, NEITHER of them gets to trade till it is taken care of.&quot; Given that these traders traded with each other multiple times a day coupled with they were making no money during this dispute, both parties were incentivized to come to an agreement.')
