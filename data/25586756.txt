We&#x27;re living in many simulations now. And sometimes we cannot distinguish between reality and simulations. But one thing that stands out is the suffering. It&#x27;s an important concept in Buddhism, Duá¸¥kha. Suffering may be a key to consciousness. Machines can have minds. But they don&#x27;t have bodies. They&#x27;d never understand reality on their own. The danger is more with humans. They may increasingly connect their own sufferings into machines. They become tools and slaves for machines.')
