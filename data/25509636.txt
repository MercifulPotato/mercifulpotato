A farmer with 1000 acres and a herd of cattle may have to spend a day or two searching for a lost head. A drone could methodically surveil the plot, seeing through tree cover and working through the night with IR.<p>I can imagine &quot;cow tippers&quot; of the future being tailed by a drone.<p>The legality of this seems already settled to me. If it is legal to have fixed surveillance cameras anywhere on your private property, why wouldn&#x27;t it be similarly legal for that camera to take flight, assuming it adheres to any applicable FAA regulations?')
