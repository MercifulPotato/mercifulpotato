Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602609864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24766208, text='&gt; I&#x27;m actually really passionate about recruiting and improving the recruiting process anywhere I work, I&#x27;d love you to elaborate on this.<p>Unfortunately this is a really complex topic and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not nearly knowledgeable or experienced enough to give any meaningful advice in a concise way.<p>Say a candidate is to be hired for developing and maintaining a line of business app. In this case it&#x27;s important for them to know the programming environment, frameworks and tools, as well as working with large programs or legacy code if applicable.<p>Start by asking a few &quot;no brainers&quot; sprinkled into a general conversation about their previous work experience and increase the &quot;difficulty level&quot; from there.<p>There will come a point at which the only honest answer will be &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;d have to look that up&quot;, which is the perfect opportunity to just hand them a tablet (or laptop) and let them do so. This is an excellent way to learn how they look-up technical information  (which sites do they use, how long does it take them, do they use meaningful keywords).<p>Another effective way of judging someone&#x27;s skill is asking them to point out problems with a small piece of code or have them discuss required modifications to meet some constraint (e.g. sort a dataset by one of a user-selectable set of criteria, but you can only read each item once and the dataset doesn&#x27;t fit into memory - a common problem with archival data stored on tape).<p>These are just some pointers, but they all have two things in common: they require the interviewer to know what the candidate is going to work on and they need more preparation work than just a checklist that reads &quot;knows how to implement an AVL-tree in Python&quot; or &quot;can tell the arguments of all 6 overloads of std::transform_reduce() in C++17&quot;.')
