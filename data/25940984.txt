But it&#x27;s pretty hard to not start caring when you become a casualty.

You just need enough people who can&#x27;t use or refuse to use a particular platform to trigger a mass exodus.<p>I think it&#x27;s optimistic that we&#x27;ll see that with many of the huge, well-established platforms like Facebook or Twitter.
