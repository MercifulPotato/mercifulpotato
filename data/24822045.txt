Well, in that case you could try what I do: I run my only instance where I&#x27;m the only user; my interactions depends upon only my social graph. This avoids the niche&#x2F;club&#x2F;hobby issue. The only challenge that remains is discovery. But I don&#x27;t discover folks to follow through my instance but through other means.( So not an issue for me.) Though my approach requires committing either time (managing my own infrastructure) or money (having someone else my instance for me) - so perhaps not suitable for everyone. Not so different from having one&#x27;s own domain for conventional email. Either way, my approach is probably not ideal for folks only trying to get a taste of the fediverse.')
