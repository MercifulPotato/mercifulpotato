I don’t know how well it’ll fare for fairly common actions in bash like “here documents” or what the equiv of shopt extglob is in pwsh.<p>My usual cli usage is what i’d call “text manipulation” - slicing and dicing command output or converting csv-like data in some way or another.<p>My toolset is the usual suspects - bash, sed &amp; awk but beyond a certain complexity i’ll switch to python.<p>The key thing for me is i can still use grep, sed, awk and python in pipelines as before but i’m attracted by the easy data access in pwsh.<p>The idea that Get-Process returns an object and i can just query each process’s WSS attribute for example is appealing right now (as opposed to explicitly manipulating text to suit, e.g. grep resident &#x2F;proc&#x2F;*&#x2F;statm or ps -o rss or whatever approach)')
