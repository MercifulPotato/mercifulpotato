It’s not <i>all</i> luxury apartments, not by a long shot, but a surprising number were unusable due to layout mistakes or a complete lack of equipment (on the owners side). The conclusion I came to is that the people who rented these units valued a pretty kitchen as an aesthetic item, not as a usable thing. I presume they must have mostly eaten out for all their meals.<p>Perhaps there’s a similar process at play here. If land is incredibly expensive and one intends to eat most of their meals out, it doesn’t actually make sense to rent a full kitchen. Might as well either cut rent and get a half kitchen, or save that space for activities you’ll actually do.')
