Obviously people don&#x27;t tend to bother counting their groceries as part of their net worth, mostly because they go bad or are consumed quickly and comprise a tiny percentage of most people&#x27;s net worth.<p>But, in general, yes, your net worth is the value of everything you own (minus your debt). It&#x27;s not at all crazy to say that, when you buy something very valuable or transfer money to a foundation which you control, your net worth is not changing much.')
