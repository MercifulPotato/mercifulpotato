If you cannot always get a parking spot where you can charge then from time to time you would end up not being able to change when you absolutely need to. It&#x27;s like parking at work and there&#x27;s no charging available and you have to drive around for 20 minutes and turn up late for work. No, there&#x27;s a need for either always available charging in every single area or a system that is a direct replacement for gas stations (IE. charge in a couple of minutes every week or so).<p>I have lived in an area like it (luckily I moved) and the amount of time I have driven around in circles just to get a parking spot is more than I&#x27;d like to know. If only some of them had charging people with cars would be forced to either move away or drive around in circles for hours on end every day.')
