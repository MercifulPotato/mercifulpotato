This argument makes it seem like anyone can go and earn a living from music and that simply isn’t true. Anyone can make money with music with a little investment in a copyright and BMI id... To make it a career, to live off of, as your sole income source has a lot of musicians having to diversify how, where, they release music.<p>Artists with indie labels are fighting for air time with other artists with indie labels for $3&#x2F;1000 plays.<p>I’m not blaming Spotify outside of the fact that my $9.99&#x2F;mo subscription (minus 10%) should be allocated based on play time to the artists I listen to. This doesn’t seem to be the case.<p>Granted, it’s been over 15 years since I released music. I never “made it” in the traditional pre-diy era. Punk Rock is dead based on listenership. I went into tech.')
