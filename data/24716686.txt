To counter this, you need to compromise on your suspension design (essentially make it stiffer) to stop the thing flopping about.<p>There is some nuance here though: more mass does potentially give you options in lowering the centre of gravity which can certainly help. Putting the batteries in the lowest point is a smart design move from this point of view.<p>In general, I&#x27;m not saying you can&#x27;t make a heavy car have a good ride quality, I&#x27;m saying you can make it ride well <i>in spite of</i> the extra mass it has to deal with. Adding more mass doesn&#x27;t magically let you have a better ride quality.')
