But they&#x27;re the 1%. (To be generous.)<p>And I&#x27;m not sold on any of these platforms as personal income streams as complements to people making money elsewhere. Medium looked attractive for this for a time and then it didn&#x27;t. Personally I write for specific outlets and do the odd thing that doesn&#x27;t fit on my personal blog. (Mostly it&#x27;s connected to my day job.)')
