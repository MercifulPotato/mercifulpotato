It&#x27;s true that these kids might not be playing Mozart but there is nothing wrong with bluegrass, gospel, or whatever, to instill a love of playing music.<p>Maybe listen to &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot; or &quot;Coat Of Many Colors&quot; for inspiration on how people from modest backgrounds can have the same fulfilling experiences as wealthy people.
