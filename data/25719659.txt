The field of control theory has some really simple and really robust methods for getting a system from state A to state B. If you aren&#x27;t trying to learn how the system works simultaneous to your algorithm being deployed, it can be a really a good fit.<p>This book and control theory solve different problems. I&#x27;m just commenting because I sometimes see modern ML folks trying to apply super duper general techniques to problems that are easily solved specifically with simple undergrad-level techniques from the specific fields (including this material to control problems). Also, I just think control theory is really cool and perhaps under-discussed in &quot;cool math&#x2F;eng stuff&quot; circles.')
