Being a party member is just passing a test and paying the membership fee.<p>Not really.  I have a friend who nearly joined in college.  They had several rounds of applications: the first few went to kids with connections (or whose connections put them in a good position, e.g. appointed to be some kind of student government thing).  Once those groups were exhausted, other kids got a chance.  My friend was a very good student, but got a no-so-subtle message from the school official running the process that they wouldn&#x27;t be considered without a bribe.')
