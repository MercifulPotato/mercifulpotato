It&#x27;s just the contents of a file at a point in time.<p>Diffs can have different definitions, and I&#x27;ve never seen a complete rigorous one for whatever git uses, if anything.  Loosely a &quot;diff&quot; is the changes between one version an another.  But to understand what cherry-pick does, we (or maybe just I) need more than a loose definition.<p>Using snapshots makes `rebase` trivial.  The contents of a commit doesn&#x27;t change.  Just the link to its predecessor.  Using a diff model, it requires all kinds of fancy changes.')
