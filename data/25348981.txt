It runs on the Zircon kernel, which is a true microkernel (as I remember, haven&#x27;t been paying attention recently). This is pretty ideal for IoT, since manufacturers should be able to spin up only as much OS as they need on top of the Zircon kernel.<p>Fuchsia specifically is looking to be a full-fledged OS, I think, for devices like Chromebooks or similar. I think they expect to get Fuchsia to a place where it can run Android apps natively, then put out an OS that can run native apps, Android apps, etc, all while being tied in to Google&#x27;s services.<p>This is definitely some speculation, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m seeing so far.')
