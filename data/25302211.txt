OOP had really just broken into the mainstream (with Java, the first OOP to really take off) and would go on to become ubiquitous, spawning tons of little new languages (including Python). There were multiple vendors pushing VB-like products, some arguably better than MS itself, giving high levels of productivity (who some argue have never been achieved since). PCs had dramatically democratized access, now anyone could build their own tools without having to beg for server time, and sysadmin on Windows was so loose that one could typically get away with anything (yes, virus bad etc etc, but it was still a fun ride). Desktops had just become a standard feature of every white-collar job and everyone was busy trying to make sense of them; the smart folks made millions selling line-of-business apps. And then the internet arrived and everything had to be re-done as web-based (hello Perl and ASP), <i>plus</i> tons of intranet portals that were horrible to use but fun to make, so to speak.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because I was 20 back then, but there was a sense of fun and exploration in most computing that is somewhat missing in this age of smart-everything, JS-everywhere, and total surveillance.')
