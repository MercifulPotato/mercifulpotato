It was originally created in Flash by Boštjan Čadež who sold it to InXile. InXile made the versions in Silverlight and the overdone versions on Wii, DS, and PC, but they all flopped and they did nothing with LR for years. And that&#x27;s where I came in: while I was remaking LR in Javascript (intentionally down-to-earth) I brought my friend onto the project and he had a contact at InXile and got us connected with them. We figured out an agreement and eventually (we were novice developers at the time!) got our version (well now it&#x27;s just me, my friend left the project) onto linerider.com. Then InXile gave LR back to Boštjan so now it&#x27;s basically completely indie again!<p>Fun fact: InXile got acquired by Microsoft, and for a brief period of time, Microsoft technically owned LR')
