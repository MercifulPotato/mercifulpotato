This &quot;on Spotify&quot; is really annoying and really summarizes the whole iOS experience. If you dont fully by into their walled garden you will have to deal with a lot of minor annoyances. I was thinking about switching over to Apple Music for a bit to see if I like the whole user experience a bit more even if apple music on its own is inferior.')
