But be aware that even in states that do or did allow for enforcement of non-competes (like Massachusetts that <i>finally</i> significantly weakened them), there has always been a lot of job mobility and even competitors started by people leaving a prior employer. Non-competes&#x2F;not-non-competes are not some binary thing that either lets you make off with all of a company&#x27;s IP or that leaves you chained to a desk for the rest of your career. There are certainly stories of serious non-compete abuse (in my view) and I even know of a couple second hand, but people do routinely move among competitors in states other than California.<p>I don&#x27;t live in California and I&#x27;ve only once had to sign a non-compete and it was narrowly scoped and mostly irrelevant.')
