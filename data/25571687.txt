I think there were still enough older teachers&#x2F;administrators that thought it was BS, that many of the minor issues never resulted in anything extreme. I remember one teacher caught me and another kid in a bit of a scuffle (not <i>really</i> a fight) over a prank gone wrong. Basically, we both apologized to each other and discussed the mistake&#x2F;misunderstanding. We didn&#x27;t even get detention and still remained friends.<p>Granted this was in a rural area, which seems to be a bit slower to adopt those newer policies. I mean, we still had kids bringing their guns to high school in their cars to go hunting in the evening.')
