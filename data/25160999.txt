Researchers did not detect any associations between the vaccines and narcolepsy.<p>Incidence rate study data did not show a rise in the rate of narcolepsy following vaccination except in the one signaling country included (Sweden, which used Pandemrix).\nCase-control analyses for Arepanrix-AS03 did not show evidence of an increased risk of narcolepsy.\nCase-coverage analysis for Pandemrix-ASO3 in children in the Netherlands did not show evidence of an increased risk of narcolepsy, but the number of exposed cases was small (N=7).\nCases-control analysis for Focetria-MF59 did not show evidence of an increased risk of narcolepsy.')
