This is fine if a fork&#x2F;join pattern is useful to you (i.e. issue N async calls and then wait for N completions). This isn&#x27;t proper asynchrony though.<p>- the future is pushed on to a thread that does nothing but poll for completions. This effectively imposes an O(n) inefficiency into your code.')
