Maybe in Britain and US it&#x27;s not important, but in Eastern-Europe we at least are trying to be respectful with other nations by not changing the pronounciation of the brands too much (also we would just laugh at somebody who doesn&#x27;t know how to pronounce Porsche correctly). I&#x27;m not from Romania, but I haven&#x27;t ever heard this brand mispronounced in my country.<p>I personally try to learn a bit of the local language everywhere I travel at least on a very basic level (maybe just a few words), and usually people appreciate it.')
