Not sure where you are but where I live weed edibles are legal and I can ensure that I always take the same dose. Depending on how I feel I consume 2.5 mg of THC every other day and occasionally do a weekend blast with 10mg. Since I do that no more than once per week I can still get high on mere as little as 7.5mg and it gives me a mood boost for a couple of days and if I hit the funk I&#x27;ll microdose with 2.5mg once per day. Been doing this for a few months and it&#x27;s working like a charm. I hope I don&#x27;t build up tolerance and lose the effect over time.')
