I&#x27;ve had a great experience running Ubuntu on it.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that some people have issues with it, but I wonder what percentage of people have issues with it, and how that percentage compares to other laptops.<p>The only issue I had was with the power adapter, it made a very high pitched noise (the laptop does not make a noise and does not have &quot;coil whine&quot;).  Customer service replaced the power adapter without hassle and the new one is fine.<p>Mine came with a year of Pro Support which was free, I don&#x27;t know if that made any difference on the ease of replacement.')
