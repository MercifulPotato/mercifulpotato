Is that license compatible with your company&#x27;s software? Are you complying with the terms of that license, including providing any required attribution? Who gets sued or fired if that copy-pasted code doesn&#x27;t work? What goes into the post-mortem?<p>Similarly, is your company really OK with you just pulling in a dependency and coding onward? Do you review each external dependency&#x27;s license for compatibility with your company&#x27;s software? Do you audit each dependency for security issues, backdoors, and other bugs? What dependencies do your dependencies rely on, and have you reviewed them, too? How do you know the dependency works as you think it should work? What is the maintenance plan for this dependency? How often do you plan to update the dependency, and when you do, do you plan to re-audit it?<p>As someone who has worked on safety-critical marine and aerospace applications, this casual attitude about pulling in dependencies and copy-pasting code is so foreign to me! Is this yolo attitude really how it works in the move-fast-and-break-things universe? No large company I ever worked for would allow any of this without proper vetting and reviewing--even on non-safety-critical programs. Really interesting and scary how best practices are defined in various areas of the software development world!<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;licensing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;licensing</a>')
