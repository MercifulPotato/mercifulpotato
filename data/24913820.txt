Ergonomics and having a correct desk setup up for your needs is incredibly important and something we don&#x27;t value as much as we should.<p>Someone who gets me! Hotdesks sounds like a good idea in theory, but in practice definitely are not. What happens if you show up late and somebody has your seat, do you boot them out? I&#x27;d just rather have a fixed desk, thank you very much.')
