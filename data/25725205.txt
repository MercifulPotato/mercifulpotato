Everyone agrees someone policing who gets to reproduce or not is a bad idea because such policing is impossible to do objectively&#x2F;fairly&#x2F;morally&#x2F;ethically.<p>Why is such policing any easier or less important for political views and discussion? It&#x27;s not. Policing people&#x27;s opinions and silencing, censoring, or removing content is just as impossible. Is some message a very out of taste troll, sarcasm, some inside joke, intentional smearing, discussion of a controversial topic? Well, any sense of objective discussion there goes out of the window because a _human_ has to police it and until we can quantify with exact precision and accuracy through a machine the meaning behind human communication (we can&#x27;t yet(?)) this is an impossible (for now) problem to solve.<p>We cannot even ask Siri&#x2F;Alexa to do complicated tasks.')
