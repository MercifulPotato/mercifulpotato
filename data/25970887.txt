For this they (we) need to decide:<p>- is the &#x27;game plan&#x27; above evidence of that.<p>- when someone posts a screenshot of their position and emojis of rocketships, and a bunch of people respond with This is the way.  and other meme-y jokes, is that manipulation?<p>If the second is true, we&#x27;re in for a rocky road ahead.  We are going to have to decide as a society how far we wish to go.

There are comments there, too.<p>Should we ban all comments and news from non official channels out of fear of getting sued or investigated for securities fraud?<p>A dystopian possibility is Reddit shuts all stock subs.
