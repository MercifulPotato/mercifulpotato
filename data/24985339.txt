Then one day I needed it for a school project, with all its colors due to some graphs.<p>Printed a simple test page with some colors twice, then the colors were back in action. Successfully printed 20 or so color pages after that without issue.<p>So clearly inkjets that doesn&#x27;t dry out was a solved problem, however I realize that doesn&#x27;t exactly drive ink or printer sales so yeah.<p>These days I just have a monochrome laser printer at home for the two-three times a year I need it. Always just works, no fuzz.')
