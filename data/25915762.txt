I see people talking about using Kubernetes for internal applications and I just can&#x27;t figure out why. If it&#x27;s a hobby project and you want to learn Kubernetes, that&#x27;s a different situation, but in the case of making a real application that people will use, it seems like a lot of us can get away with a single DB, a few workers of our app, and maybe a cache.<p>I&#x27;m speaking out of little experience though. I just think that a lot of us can get away with traditional vertical scaling and not think too much about it.')
