The ISS-rated dry cleaning machine would cost at the very least a million dollars to develop, would still require sending ten grand of fresh solvent every so often (maybe once a year?) and would add new fire&#x2F;explosion safety concerns, which they can and do put a price tag on. It would probably take longer than the life of the station for the ISS dry cleaning machine to pay itself off.<p>It&#x27;s just too easy to not bother. For a moon colony or a Mars base, the economics change, but for near earth orbit it just doesn&#x27;t make sense.')
