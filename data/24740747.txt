You do know that private property is a pure construct of the State, that the State was created because there was no other way to enforce private property, and that the State must exist as long private property exists, right?<p>I&#x27;m taking private property to mean any property that you don&#x27;t actively use, so for example intellectual property, stocks, and capital writ large.<p>This is why the State has the right to seize property, because they are guarantor of the concept for property to begin with.<p>Ultimately, it is very valid to disagree with State enforcement of property and for the monopoly of violence, but the only logical conclusion for that is anarchism, in a sense that makes capitalism impossible.')
