An 11-hour wait to vote is absolutely prohibitive to many of the people who most need change, on top of being terrible for everyone else; not that that is anything new for the US. It&#x27;s basically a poll tax, which is one of the most regressively anti-democratic tools, but applied unevenly by location. There is not close to a technical need for this, even if we used completely low-tech voting and had all the necessary COVID-19 safety measures. As Glenn Greenwald tweeted, &quot;Few things function efficiently in Brazil. And yet -- in a country just a little smaller &amp; way poorer than the US -- elections work smoothly. Held on a Sunday, mandatory voting, automatic registration at 16, polls open at 7am, close at 5pm, all votes reliably counted by 8:30 pm.&quot;<p>The article is the election version of &quot;feel-good&quot; stories about people who work into their late 80s or 90s in low-paying jobs and are given some token gift like a car by their boss, in response for years and years of life stolen from them. Infuriating.')
