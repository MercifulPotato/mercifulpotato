But then it makes an odd jump and blames Google for it, and seems to suggest legal action be taken against Google to force it to do better.<p>That&#x27;s... weird.<p>Creating an algorithm, that searches the entirety of the web to find the answers to your questions is not easy. But I honestly believe that this is one thing Google is trying its hardest to do. They want to serve the best possible answers. And they&#x27;re in a battle against an army of content creators who want to game the system.<p>What&#x27;s especially weird about the article&#x27;s anti-Google conclusion is that they acknowledge that it&#x27;s a game of whack-a-mole. Google improves the algorithm. SEO writers find a way to game it. Google improves again. Etc.<p>What, exactly, would they like Google to do differently?<p>There&#x27;s a lot of reasons to criticize Google. But I don&#x27;t think the search engine itself is one of them. If anyone could do better, they would be by now.')
