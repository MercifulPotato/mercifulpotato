In the movie, they view the “source code” of the matrix as vertical columns of scrolling characters. The characters vary in brightness and the scrolling varies in speed, and the whole screen is filled with these characters. Compared to how source code is usually presented, there’s a lot more information on the screen.<p>Has anybody looked into information dense representations of code like that? I’m thinking it might be useful for getting an oversight of a code base or something. Honestly I don’t even know the proper terminology to describe the effect, so if anyone can point me towards relevant literature I’d be grateful.')
