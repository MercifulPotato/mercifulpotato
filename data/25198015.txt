Item(by='throwablePie', descendants=None, kids=[25198309], score=None, time=1606222686, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25197418, text='Absence of the period (aka full stop) after the timestamp appears to indicate that a commenter had previously (perhaps recently) posted a comment which was subsequently flagged. Or that the commenter is new (see below).<p>Here&#x27;s what I did:<p>I used ctrl-f&#x2F;cmd-f on a well-commented post (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25190668" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25190668</a>) looking for the following search terms: &quot;. [–]&quot; and &quot;o [–]&quot;<p>Then I reviewed some of the posters&#x27; recent commenting history. Those that had no period after the time-stamp had recent grayed-out comments. I did not find any commenters with a period who had  recent grayed out posts.<p>For instance, here&#x27;s a page from esteemed commenter buran77&#x27;s profile: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;threads?id=buran77" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;threads?id=buran77</a> . You&#x27;ll notice that not only does buran77 have grayed out posts without the period-after-timestamp feature but so does grayed-out commenter elmo2you.<p>The absence of the period also appears to apply to recently created accounts. See green commenter jn6118 in this thread.<p>This appears to be a subtle indicator designed to be used in HN&#x27;s comment moderation. If so, what can we glean from this quirk of HN&#x27;s comment moderation procedures or policies?')
