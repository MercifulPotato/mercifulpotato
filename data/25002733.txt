Item(by='Sodman', descendants=None, kids=[25027853, 25002827], score=None, time=1604614980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25002209, text='I&#x27;ve recently moved my &quot;personal infrastructure&quot; from a docker-compose setup to a k3s setup, and ultimately I think k3s is better for most cases here.<p>FWIW, my docker-compose setup used <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nginx-proxy&#x2F;nginx-proxy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nginx-proxy&#x2F;nginx-proxy</a> and it&#x27;s letsencrypt companion image, which &quot;automagically&quot; handles adding new apps, new domains, and all ssl cert renewals, which is awesome. It was also relatively easy to start up a brand new fresh machine and re-deploy everything with a few commands.<p>I started down the route of using kubeadm, but then quickly switched to k3s and never looked back. It&#x27;s now trivial to add more horsepower to my infrastructure without having to re-create <i>everything</i> (spin up a new EC2 machine, run one command to install k3s &amp; attach to the cluster as a worker node). There&#x27;s also some redundancy there, as any of my tiny ec2 boxes crashes, the apps will be moved to healthy boxes automatically. I&#x27;m also planning on digging out a few old Raspberry Pi&#x27;s to attach as nodes from home (over a VPN) just for funsies.<p>Ultimately k8s certainly has a well earned reputation for having a steep learning curve, but once you get past that curve, managing a personal cluster using k3s is pretty trivial.')
