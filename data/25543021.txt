In calculus, uncountable sets are just the theater, the real actors are sequences. As long as the theater is a complete metric space, we don&#x27;t really care about its structure. Hence the name, it signifies that we are unconcerned with cardinality above aleph 0. The finite&#x2F;countable&#x2F;uncountable distinction IMHO shows where the focus is.<p>Analogically, in CS, you use infinite sets (integers) but you don&#x27;t really care what the cardinality is. You don&#x27;t care about the axiom of choice.')
