Item(by='jryle70', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607782745, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395909, text='&gt; I think thereâ€™s a pretty clear distinction between having a spell-checker bundled into word, and reproducing the product of a competitor after the fact and bundling it into your office suite as an accessory.<p>I&#x27;m not seeing a clear distinction. Imagine a scenario where Word and Excel aren&#x27;t bundled. Word has always had table functionality. The Word team decides that it&#x27;d be useful if, when creating a table, end user is able to enter @cell1 + 1 to cell two to make it show the incremental value of cell one. Soon enough they&#x27;ll add sort, sum, average. Then they&#x27;ll create a template that creates a document with a table created by default, which looks like a spreadsheet.<p>Should those new functionality be allowed and who get to decide? Any attempt to regulate such product features are futile and inevitably stifle innovation.<p>Apple M1 is universally praised exactly because it&#x27;s a SOC with integrated functions that used to require dedicated chips from multiple vendors. Imagine the inferior product if Apple is legally obliged to use Intel&#x2F;AMD graphic card, in the name of maintaining the competitive landscape?')
