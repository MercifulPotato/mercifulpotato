Not talking about &quot;your stuff doesn&#x27;t work&quot; sort of reports, of course, but the actionable &quot;did X, got Y, was expecting Z&quot; ones.<p>Moreover, if the reporter also helps us with resolving it, i.e. provides logs, stack traces, runs custom builds, etc., then we will always reciprocate with freebies.<p>So seeing that this person is forcing people to pay to report bugs is absolutely wild.<p>I understand that he&#x27;s basically sharing his own tools with others for free and if it works for him that all that he cares about, but the bugs are <i>always</i> on the developer. The least you can do is accept a report and say Thanks. That&#x27;s a complete no-brainer.')
