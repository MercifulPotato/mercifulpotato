We should try to discover what is going on, and work to best educate boys and girls the best way for them. Maybe that means teaching them separately. Maybe teachers just need better training as the article suggests. Obviously there is something widespread here, happening across 60 countries.<p>You seem to want to blame individual male children for the failures of the system. As a person who wants all genders to be treated fairly and equally, that is pretty appalling.')
