Unless they are expecting to trade in the EU. If you trade in the EU, and violate EU law, then you can expect to be fined - wherever you choose to locate your HQ.<p>Incidentally, GDPR is pretty badly flawed. The intrusive cookie popups are an egregious example of unintended consequences - those popups are actually attacking privacy.')
