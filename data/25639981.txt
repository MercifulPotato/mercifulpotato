Item(by='gnicholas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609804517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25639435, text='It would be great if there were a way to ally with multiple &#x27;warlords&#x27; to achieve security without having to trust just one of them. It should be possible since there&#x27;s the hardware level, the OS level, and the application level. At least for computers, it should be possible to build an alliance that doesn&#x27;t require you to put too much trust in any single warlord.<p>Of course on mobile, there&#x27;s so much vertical consolidation (especially on iOS) that you just have to pick one warlord.<p>EDIT: curious about the downvotes â€” what part of this do people disagree with? That it would be good to not be stuck with this dilemma? That mobile is vertically integrated?')
