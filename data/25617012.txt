I suppose that I could choose other unrelated nonfiction subjects, but for some reason that seems more like work again. Though, I do read <i>some</i> nonfiction for personal enjoyment, such as history, pop science, etc.<p>The evolution of my career has been (nonfiction) writer, then (nonfiction) editor, then lawyer, and finally cognitive scientist. Almost all of my adult life has been either writing and reading for study, or writing and reading for work.<p>Reading is still the #1 thing I do on my own time despite it also being the #1 thing I do for work, but, please, make it pretend. :)')
