Gas started rising in 2002, when wind and solar had an invisibly small presence in the US market.<p>It sure sounds like you were arguing that renewable energy had a time-travel effect causing the construction of gas before the renewables were added?<p>People are downvoting because what you&#x27;re saying makes no sense.<p>You realize that the natural gas plants sit mostly idle when renewables are producing enough power, right?  And the more renewable capacity we build, the more often that happens?<p>&gt; Worse, at the current rates, we won&#x27;t get there for decades.<p>So, about the same timespan it took to execute the Messmer plan in France, and at a fraction of the cost?  (The Messmer plan was France&#x27;s big nuclear buildout from the 70s through the 90s.)<p>On a side note, even if we started building reactors today they probably wouldn&#x27;t be operational for a decade or more (including planning time).')
