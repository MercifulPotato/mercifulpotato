England did not exist at all &quot;under Roman rule&quot; and the idea of wave upon wave of conquerors is complete nonsense.<p>The Romans (now there&#x27;s a funky term) found a disparate collection of tribes and petty kingdoms spread across the islands.  You might as well describe everyone living in the south west of modern England as Devonions (Dumnonia - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dumnonia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dumnonia</a>), modern Cornish might take umbrage.<p>In say 300AD there was as now a lot of topography (hills), few roads and a lot of trees and vegetation.  The sea is usually fairly flatter and with wind power easily available and so it is easier to use water to get from A to B if you have a boat.  These isles were not a fortress &quot;protected by the seas&quot;, it was easier to get here than many local routes on land.')
