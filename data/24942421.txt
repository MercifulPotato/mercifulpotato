Especially iPhones.</i><p>And buy what? Google phones? Made in China as well. Plus all the shady stuff they do globally, much worse than Apple. Huawei, Xiaomi and co would probably be no-gos too. Samsung? Is SK is much better? Had been a dictatorship for most post WWII period, and transitioned to a kinda democracy around 2000. And they use Google&#x27;s OS anyway.<p>Companies make hardware. Buy them or not. Don&#x27;t look to Apple or Google for politics.<p>US companies should also play nice by the rules of the country their are in, -- not what the US thinks they should do based on their plans&#x2F;thinking for the country. It&#x27;s not their business to interfere with local politics pro or against.')
