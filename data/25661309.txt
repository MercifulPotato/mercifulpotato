We have to spend the time anyway, we could spend it by being alert, or distracted and drifting off. Being alert feels good and there is some satisfaction from the work being done. Being distracted is mentally draining.\nAlso, it&#x27;s not only the stake holder that is profiting from the work, it&#x27;s society as a whole - we all depend on this work.')
