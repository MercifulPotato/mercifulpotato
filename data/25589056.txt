If you do want to put in the effort, you go where the eyes are and render the animation to video and upload to YouTube.<p>Web platform games very much did replace flash games over time. I&#x27;m not saying that it being bad isn&#x27;t a part of it, of course, but I don&#x27;t think it is the lone factor.')
