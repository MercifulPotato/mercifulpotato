Otherwise it is just too risky to rely on OSM. In particular in harsh climates and if there is no way to get help.<p>I.e., before using OSM, assess the quality of the mapping done by the local community. Anyone can draw lines of a map by looking at satelite images. It doesn&#x27;t mean that such lines are passable.')
