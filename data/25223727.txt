My own assessment is the opposite: that the NYT is highly likely to assume anything an &#x27;oppressed minority&#x27; tells them is true, even if it&#x27;s not, and meanwhile a company is highly likely to be more objective: they have every incentive to investigate complaints yet also not self-flagellate if the complaints are false.<p>That said, I think Popper specifically has done a decent job with tech stories in the past. So I reserve judgement. But only because of him, not because of the NYT.')
