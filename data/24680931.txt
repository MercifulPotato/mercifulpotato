They&#x27;re saying exactly the same thing. Unless you think that the city is pocketing billions in profits from unspent tax money (they aren&#x27;t), it&#x27;s hard to see how they could possibly spend more on infrastructure without majorly cutting other services and&#x2F;or taxing more than the people can afford, which is the premise of the article.<p>&gt; <i>The expensive things are cops and schools and fire and other labor intensive services.</i><p>These costs scale most directly with population, not land area. You&#x27;d have these same expenses if the city were built such that the road infrastructure cost less to maintain, so pointing at them makes no sense.<p>&gt; <i>Like this one pegs Lafayette&#x27;s infrastructure replacement at 32 billion. Yet Lafayette&#x27;s entire budget is only 0.6 billion.</i><p>The article is about how Lafayette cannot keep up with maintenance because it would cost too much. Literally exactly the same thing as what you just said, and yet your conclusion is that they have it wrong? Why?')
