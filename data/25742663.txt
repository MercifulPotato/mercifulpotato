To be clear - their animations (to me) drag on too long (as one might say about iOS), and UI input takes a noticeable amount of time (which is commonly found on Android apps that aren&#x27;t well-written).<p>While this may not be helpful for anyone looking to improve the apps, that&#x27;s kinda more of the same point - nobody is allowed to make a better client, as it&#x27;s against the Wire ToS.  This is why there&#x27;s no Matrix bridge.')
