It means you reached a settlement for far less than you would have gotten if you had actually won a case at trial. Companies generally settle when their legal fees for going to court would exceed the amount of the settlement.That means we can put a theoretical cap on the amount of the settlement. Less legal fees, Sandmann might have walked away with $25,000.<p>As for &quot;most of them dismissed,&quot; 30 of 33 claims against WaPo were dismissed. In other words, Sandmann <i>lost</i> on 30 claims, and settled on 3 of them. Two of his other lawsuits were dismissed by the court, and the only lawsuit still alive is the NBC suit. That&#x27;s not a legal victory; a motion to dismiss at this stage of a lawsuit assumes that everything the plaintiff said is true without taking into consideration any competing facts.')
