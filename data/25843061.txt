It just means there’s some statistical correlation between alarm presence and risk.<p>It could be a case of “people who add aftermarket alarms are more likely to be conscientious about not leaving their vehicle where it’s likely to be broken into in the first place” or “people who go through the expense of adding aftermarket alarms tend to do so because if multiple prior break-ins, and may be doing something (e.g., leaving things in the car) that increase the risk”.')
