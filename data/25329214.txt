It even recently implemented proof of stake rollout so it isn&#x27;t using massive environmental resources for proof of work in the future.<p>Of course Bitcoin was ideal for this but it went off the rails for the banking the unbanked dream when it refused to scale from a blistering 7 transactions per second and the associated high fees.  Ethereum fees aren&#x27;t great either, but my understanding is that massive increases in throughput are coming with sharding etc. in Ethereum 2.0.  Monero would be perfect for this, but I don&#x27;t know if the world is ready for true privacy and fungibility in their e-coin.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitinfocharts.com&#x2F;comparison&#x2F;transactionfees-btc-eth-xmr.html#log&amp;3m" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitinfocharts.com&#x2F;comparison&#x2F;transactionfees-btc-eth...</a>')
