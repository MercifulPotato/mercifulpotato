The only reason we don&#x27;t use such implementations in production is for some non-functional reason (efficiency, resilience, etc.). For example, if we want a key&#x2F;value store we might choose Redis for production, but a HashMap is a perfectly good fake (and you can bet that the language&#x2F;library implementing HashMap has a <i>ton</i> of tests!)')
