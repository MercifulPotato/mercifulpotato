That is incredibly low for a regular cyclist. Frankly, that power is just far lower than what most people can put out. My assumption here is that Strava has very poor estimation for riders without power meters. Or your route has many stoplights and stop signs, which is difficult to account for when calculating average power.<p>Regular recreational cyclists can generally put out 200-250W for well over an hour depending on weight.')
