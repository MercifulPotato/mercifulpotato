Of course, I&#x27;d want my text editor to be able to open files across root file system, if I open it as root - so I can see how quickly a person can want sandboxing, and then also want none - but the less apps with privileged access, the better.<p>That&#x27;s SELinux, if configured well. Files are labeled according to their function and access to these files is whitelisted according to the security label of a process. For example, no security labelled process can access my private ssh keys, that&#x27;s guaranteed.<p>It&#x27;s just a shame that SELinux has such a documentation and UX issue, so almost no one uses it and almost no one uses it well - except for package maintainers and some application developers.')
