They were free for me, and were the ones offered through the kommune (here in trondheim) though I think they cost around 9000kr per 6 weeks. The class was mostly filled with folks with family immigration and folks fleeing bad situations in other countries (at the time, a lot of folks from Syria and Eritrea).<p>We used the books &quot;På vei&quot; and &quot;Stein på stein&quot; the first year. The second year I took &quot;helsenorsk&quot; and we used different materials, but for the general learning we mostly used &quot;Norsk gramatikk&quot;, which, as you guess, concentrates on about a B1-B2 level of grammar. The first year books come with optional audio, which we used in class, and both have workbooks. I used one other book, but I don&#x27;t remember the name. If he&#x27;s determined, he can work through the books but understanding folks is going to be difficult (some dialects are still difficult for me).<p>NTNU offers a free online beginning course: They also offer classes, but those are filled with current students first.<p>I&#x27;ll add that the level of Norwegian he&#x27;ll need depends on what he&#x27;ll be doing here: If he happens to be getting married and is from outside the EU&#x2F;Schengen area, he&#x27;ll probably have classes. If he goes to university, he&#x27;ll need Norwegian for a bachelor degree, but a lot of classes above that are in English. Work really depends on the field, but even in fields with lots of English in the professional realm, knowing some norwegian will help lots.')
