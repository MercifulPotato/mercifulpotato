I started using drone.io for CI early this year and part of the reason was because of their no BS license where anyone making under $1 million could just use it.<p>Unfortunately they got bought by Harness who&#x27;s already slicing it into tiers [1] so it&#x27;ll turn into the same feature roulette crap (like GitLab) that I was trying to avoid.<p>If I had input on the business model of some of these companies I&#x27;d say that every effort should be made to give individuals and small developers a competitive advantage if they choose to use your product and a big part of that is getting rid of tiers for technical features.<p>A really good example of how not to do it is GitLab IMO.  Look at the way they reserve container scanning [2] for their top tier.  Remind me why only large enterprises need security.  The implementation of that feature isn&#x27;t even good IMO.<p>Scanning an image at build time is the wrong time to do it.  It should be more like Harbor [3] where it&#x27;s a scheduled scan by the registry and everyone should have access to it.  The feature tiering could be done via the deployment, traceability, and monitoring of the containers.  As a small developer I can do those things by hand because I know everything that&#x27;s going on and what&#x27;s currently deployed.  I can track it in a spreadsheet if needed.  Large developers need a way for (ex:) a director to log in and get a report for all the vulnerable images running in production.<p>As is, it&#x27;s a checkbox feature, so I can see why it makes sense to have it in an enterprise tier.  At a certain level it&#x27;s about checking the box and covering your ass, so if &#x2F; how it works doesn&#x27;t even matter at that point.  As long as you can claim due diligence that&#x27;s all that matters, right?<p>I mean GitLab is making $0 from me right now, so why not just give away everything until a company has 5 developers or $1 million in revenue or something.  Make it so appealing that it would be stupid for small developers to use anything besides GitLab because it would be impossible to compete in terms of productivity.<p>As it is, I hate dealing with the feature tiers so much that I gave up and switched to Gitea with other self hosted solutions for CI, Registry, etc..  I want to spend my time writing code, not trying to figure out what features I can use with my current plan.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;harness.io&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;harness.io&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.gitlab.com&#x2F;ee&#x2F;user&#x2F;application_security&#x2F;container_scanning&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.gitlab.com&#x2F;ee&#x2F;user&#x2F;application_security&#x2F;contain...</a><p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goharbor.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;2.1.0&#x2F;administration&#x2F;vulnerability-scanning&#x2F;schedule-scans&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goharbor.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;2.1.0&#x2F;administration&#x2F;vulnerability-...</a>')
