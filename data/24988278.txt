There are a few of us who use Scala because of the work we do (Spark).  I have to say that I prefer it over Java, and Spark is great for what we use it for.  The functional features allow you to be concise and require a bit of creativity which makes it fun to work in.  However, I doubt that I would use Scala outside of Spark.  I think it&#x27;s mostly because other typical frameworks that get used are Java-based so I would just code in that.  That seems to be true of most of what I&#x27;ve done professionally: the framework or platform that makes your job easier (or even necessary) usually seems to require some specific language.  (e.g.) When I coded a lot in IOS, it was Objective-C and then Swift (liked them both); a lot of web frameworks use Java or Python; front-end dev : javascript.  At some point, they all just feel the same to me, to be honest.  Some I like more, some I like less.. but the process is usually about the same.  Clearly there seems to be the theme in the industry to move general-purpose development closer to machine-code (away from JVMs and the like).. Go, Rust, Swift, Lua, Dart are some examples. I think this is generally a good thing.  At some point, Spark alternative will appear that will probably be written in Rust, if I had to guess... (Vega? or whatever it&#x27;s called)')
