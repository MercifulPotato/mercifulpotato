You&#x27;re only using one at a time, as long as everything is properly grounded they don&#x27;t get in each other&#x27;s way.<p>It&#x27;s not really about charge time though: any vehicle battery is going to discharge faster than it charges, so it&#x27;s practical to just dump a bunch of current across the pack if you&#x27;re charging using the same circuit.<p>What it does, is takes good care of each individual cell, and if you log some metrics you can detect underperforming cells and replace them.<p>I will say that for most applications, charging off the series wiring, and adding an overvoltage module that shuts off charge to each cell when it&#x27;s topped off, is going to be much simpler and good enough.<p>But it can be done.')
