Item(by='sawjet', descendants=None, kids=[24834673], score=None, time=1603154441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24829252, text='&gt; &gt; are you saying itâ€™s a better strategy to just not comment on it<p>&gt; Yes.<p>&gt; &gt; Seems like a strong denial would go much further here.<p>&gt; &quot;But he would say that, wouldn&#x27;t he? Why would he deny it if it was fake?&quot;<p>That would be much easier to verify in that case. It seems more that the biden admin knows that any refutation of the content of the emails would backfire when they are proven to be true. In that case claiming ignorance is the correct nice.')
