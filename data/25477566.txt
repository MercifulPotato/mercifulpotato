Whilst that might be a genuine phenomenon in some contexts I wasn&#x27;t drawing any firm conclusions about that in my comment above. I&#x27;ve worked with plenty enough engineers who&#x27;ve cut corners over the years to know that we&#x27;re not inherently more virtuous or competent than other professions. We are however just as human and subject to the same foibles and vices so, yes, to everyone reading it: please don&#x27;t over-interpret my earlier comment.')
