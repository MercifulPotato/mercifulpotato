I admit that I only skimmed but his experience seems to me very atypical. He talks very little about his experience with the 250μg dose, almost dismissing it. 250μg is a very strong dose for a first timer. I would be very surprised to get a meh reaction from anyone after such a first experience. He then took only a week for a tolerance break when the recommended amount is 2 weeks. Then for the experiment he ingested 25μg. I took that amount a couple of times (my first experiences) and while it&#x27;s not the classic LSD experience you are in no way unsure if you are drugged or not.<p>I think he just got bad tabs...')
