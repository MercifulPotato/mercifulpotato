First time wth magic links via email. Suddenly your application depends on the mail infrastructure that sometimes is hard to &quot;scale on demand&quot; or even isn&#x27;t under your control.  Second time with OTP via SMS. Both incidents led us to be unreachable for long periods of time, and the SLA provided by our mail provider and telecom weren&#x27;t really known until the incident. We assumed that everything would just work under high load.')
