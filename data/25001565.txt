It&#x27;s fine (I&#x27;m using it currently because my Samsung S9 died) but it&#x27;s definitely no perfect phone. It doesn&#x27;t even have water resistance and the screen to body ratio is pretty bad, IMO.<p>Only upside is the thing is built in such a way that it has barely taken any damage from the years of abuse I put it through.<p>I&#x27;m likely getting an iPhone 12 Pro Max very soon and will continue to only use the iPhone 5S I&#x27;ve had since 2013 as a backup.')
