Those guys are doing things with that data for sure because Robinhood has scale&#x2F;volume in lower skilled investors. It isn&#x27;t cheap, funds has to have a massive cash to even afford the data.<p>Robinhood has PFOF AND low skill investors in volume, so the amount of prediction of moves is a combination of data and their users. They also recommend stocks and market these to users that are less skilled, this is in unison with online forums like wallstreetbets and more. Robinhood can move the market on stocks they want and compare volume&#x2F;direction they are pushing and predict the volume&#x2F;direction from others with that. Robinhood&#x27;s name seems small fish, but they are a whale that other whales feed off of and those whales bring schools of small fish in uniform to them to play off of and eat.<p>Robinhood buyers&#x2F;partners make moves based on all of those data points and the result is almost like stealing candy from kids. This is especially true on stocks they themselves push&#x2F;recommend or are pushing funding to, partner companies or companies also funded by who funded them. It seems like &quot;democratic&quot; markets but is actually so choreographed it is a more authoritarian&#x2F;fixed market due to the sheer volume and type of investor.<p>Since Robinhood only sells data, and so many competitors are popping up, it has to be massively lucrative in more ways than just the first step, but supporting deeper investments is probably a key aspect of the plan.')
