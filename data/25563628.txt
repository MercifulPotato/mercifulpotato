Often that enforcement comes in the form of shaming people who violate the norm.  If non-tech people are willing to continue to get treated poorly in this manner, I guess that&#x27;s up to them, but I would rather work in a field where people show basic respect for each other.  I know we all have a long way to go for that to be a universal thing, but stuff like this is a nice small step.')
