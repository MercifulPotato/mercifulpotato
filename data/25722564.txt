Parler has been around for two years, and the kind of material that got them finally kicked out of places has been there from near the beginning. Parler&#x27;s lack of moderation of user content has been in violation of Apple and Google&#x27;s rules for all that time.<p>I bet if someone had started a service similar to Parler but non-political, where people posted massive amounts of death threats and hate speech but directed at people for non-political reasons and that service utterly failed to moderate, Apple and Google and the rest would not have given them two years.
