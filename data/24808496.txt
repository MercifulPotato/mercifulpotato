What GDPR prevents is hiding the trade or bundling it into other exchanges.<p>So you&#x27;re free to say &quot;this access costs $x, you can sell your data for that much on this other service&quot;. If you learn through that that people actually are not prepared to sell their data, then GDPR achieved its purpose.<p>If you work on the other side, it may seem hard to handle. But if websites can&#x27;t survive without trading user data, I&#x27;m happy for them to die and get replaced by something with better business model. Global data abuse is not worth it.<p>I guess you could also start a business explicitly selling user data to get access to 3rd party services as a replacement of payment. As long as it&#x27;s a separate entity, it could work?')
