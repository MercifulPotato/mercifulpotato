If you give something with lots of side effects and compare it to a placebo with none, people have a good guess of what group they&#x27;re in and behave differently.  This is often considered more reasonable than comparing to a saline injection, and it&#x27;s a reason why lots of drugs now are compared to e.g. ritalin-- something relatively benign with some side effect that feels like it is &quot;doing something&quot;.<p>The half-dose&#x2F;full-dose regimen was a mistake in a clinic administering the trial, though.  A mistake that happened to look more effective than the overall vaccine population, which is a bit troublesome and a primary reason why AstraZeneca has problems now.<p>Now that we have effective COVID vaccines, we can run noninferiority trials-- e.g. comparing Moderna&#x27;s vaccine to a potential new vaccine-- which get around a lot of the problems here.')
