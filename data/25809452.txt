Matrix and Element do not want be the biggest instances or keep things under their control. I can bet that people working on Matrix would be thrilled with the idea of helping people create more instances, and even it would be beneficial for their business.<p>&gt; Matrix is also running on free and so far we have hosted server offerings but no single individual account offer.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;communick.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;communick.com</a>, there you go.')
