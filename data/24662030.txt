I&#x27;m assuming gfonts is because the Hugo theme I&#x27;m using uses a google-provided font and cloudflare CDN is there because it&#x27;s automatically added by gitlab or something; anyone know how you can create a completely tracker-free experience? Do you basically have to stand up your own webserver on a cloud provider (or at home)? I guess without cloudflare or some other CDN you&#x27;d also have to hope your server can handle serving all the traffic directly. Or would a different static site generator like pelican help?')
