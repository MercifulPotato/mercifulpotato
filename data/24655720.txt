Its a large organization.<p>Also, it is very hard to hire quality people at lower salaries, its just the nature of the beast. I work in life sciences and we work primarily in the public health sector (vaccines) and it is amazingly hard to find talented scientists when the larger companies in our area vacuum up the talent pool each year. We&#x27;re not a non-profit, so our salaries are bit higher, but I can imagine how hard it must be hiring for a non-profit. Especially STEM grads. If you&#x27;re a quality dev at FAANG or some-such, how much of a salary hit are you willing to take to work on an open source browser?')
