Thoughtful set of rules that allow a person to either challenge themselves or others. Some of us will always continue to play Starcraft, Counter Strike, Street Fighter or arcade shmups. They don&#x27;t need a &quot;revision&quot; much like Chess doesn&#x27;t need to be modified into a game that isn&#x27;t Chess and soccer doesn&#x27;t need to become handegg.<p>Stadia is to gaming what MTV is to music.')
