Item(by='kldtz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608629548, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504516, text='Online tool for creating fretboard diagrams, mainly for scales. It allows you to create basic fretboard diagrams, highlight notes with colors and edit their labels, to indicate fingerings, for example. The transparent grid of notes for orientation is in standard tuning, but you can toggle it off and assign labels freely, so it can be used for any tuning as long as there are six strings. Written in vanilla JS for myself because the tools I found were a bit unergonomic to use. Maybe it&#x27;s also useful to other people.')
