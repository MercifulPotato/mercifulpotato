I&#x27;ve left dozens of niche subs because they&#x27;ve become inundated with amateurs who think that some blog-spam article they read just before replying is an authoritative source and when they can&#x27;t do that they just virtue signal (in the technical &quot;look I believe what you believe&quot; sense, not in the politically loaded sense of the word).  I would just write this off as becoming old and bitter but I can see formerly dead subs in the same niche get activity from the good content creators as this happens to the popular sub (i.e. people are migrating) so it&#x27;s clearly not just me.')
