Similar to how I did it, you&#x27;d need an ATA box to provide analog service to the phone, and it would talk to your provider over SIP&#x2F;RTP.<p>Another option would be a self-hosted PBX box. Asterisk [1] is the tried and true open-source option, but it does have some sharp edges. 3CX [2] is another option, but it&#x27;s proprietary and has some limitations.<p>Either way, you would need a provider to give you the &#x27;SIP Trunk&#x27; (phone number etc). I think Twilio [3] is the best option for this, but I&#x27;ve been using a hosted service for a while so I don&#x27;t have much recent experience with this and can&#x27;t vouch for costs&#x2F;functionality.<p>---<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asterisk.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asterisk.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.3cx.com&#x2F;free-pbx-edition&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.3cx.com&#x2F;free-pbx-edition&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twilio.com&#x2F;sip-trunking" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twilio.com&#x2F;sip-trunking</a>')
