Despite short-term trends mostly connected to the opioid crisis, over the long term people are living longer and being mentally and physically functional longer, especially at the high tail of the distribution (and when you are talking about elected leaders, its a small group, not the bulk of the population.)<p>&gt; they simply aren&#x27;t capable of doing the job, everyone I know over 60 has highly diminished mental capacities<p>There is a very slight on-average decline of executive function with age past, IIRC, the early 30s. Healthy 60 year olds don&#x27;t have &quot;highly diminished mental capacities&quot; as a rule, so if everyone you know over that age does, that tells more about who you know than it does about over 60 year olds.<p>&gt; I know it&#x27;s a harsh thing to say and I&#x27;m truly sorry to people of said demographic reading this stuff but it&#x27;s a cold hard fact easily backed up by decades of science.<p>No, its not.')
