I own other newer hardware as well (dev kit; Linux box; wife has a modern MacBook I’ve used extensively). It’s not slow.<p>I just don’t run any Chrome junk at all. I still hit 8 hours of battery life and never experience slowdowns - even with Xcode running 24&#x2F;7.<p>If you avoid modern bloat, we’ve had fast computers for quite some time. I’m sure the M1 is still another league, and I’ll likely buy one just to come forward a few years, but otherwise any Mac from the past 5-7 years is still very, very usable IME.<p>Short of that keyboard issue, that is.')
