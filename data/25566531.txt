Generally because the phone screen doesn’t give a good sense of this so the 30 I talked with maybe 5-10 of them could potentially do the job adequately.<p>We only extended an offer to one person and maybe a second if the first declined. If both of those two declined then we wouldn’t have offered to the other 3 detail interviewees.<p>I’d certainly like a better way that uses less time. But it does seem that I need to kiss a lot of frogs.<p>Also, the goal isn’t to get an “adequate” person but to get a really good or great person. I think that a good person can do 5x more than an ok person, maybe even more. So for this position, I’d rather keep looking than just get a body.<p>Again, if I just needed assembly line workers or warm bodies that could bill in a consultant sweatshop, that’s a different story. But I don’t want to be in such a hiring position.')
