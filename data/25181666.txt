Walmart (2x the size of Amazon), eBay, Kroger, Home Depot, Lowes, HEB, Costco, Target, Walgreens, Staples, CVS, Publix, Albertsons, Aldi, Macy&#x27;s, Best Buy, OfficeMax, Nordstrom, Kohl&#x27;s... I can continue if you want. Those are just off the top of my head.<p>&gt;Show me the alternative to YouTube.<p>Netflix, cable, Hulu, Amazon, HBO, Disney, Sling, there&#x27;s a few more. It&#x27;s a very competitive market and it&#x27;s why YouTube hardly makes any money, if they actually make any at all.<p>I think you are making the common error of conflating &quot;big company&quot; with &quot;monopoly&quot;. Amazon doesn&#x27;t control supply in a market like say the USPS with first class mail or your utility with electrical supply.')
