I agree that we have a lot of room to improve on the writing of more complicated JS, as well as large-scale refactors. We are working on bringing git syncing to the cloud (currently it&#x27;s only available on-prem), which&#x27;ll let you edit Retool apps as code. I think that should help a good amount.<p>Anyhow â€” thank you for the feedback! I will send you an email in a few hours too. If you&#x27;d be willing to hop on the phone to  dive into some of this in more detail, it&#x27;d be really appreciated. (I&#x27;ll probably run a few potential solutions by you and see which ones you like.)')
