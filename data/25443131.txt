They probably don&#x27;t ask if any accounts (service accounts, etc..) are excluded from rotation.  People are also taught to not volunteer anything to an auditor.  ... and this does not even get into the subject of ssh keys and ssh CA&#x27;s, which most auditors don&#x27;t even ask about at all.<p>I personally put less value in audits and more value in Red Teams being given full immunity to penetrate every nook and cranny.  I would like to see more companies incentivize and reward in-depth penetration testing in all environments, including production.  For the corporate leaders reading this, there is risk, but the reward is uncovering many future landmines your operations, code deployment teams and internet user base would have stepped on.')
