There is plenty of spectrum left over to double the size of the 2.4Ghz ISM band used for WiFi, but the FCC has let Sprint&#x2F;T-Mobile mispurpose this 2.5Ghz&#x2F;2.6Ghz spectrum that was licensed for educational use only (explicitly for educational institutions to use for educational purposes like inter-building wireless links for campus TV stations).')
