That&#x27;s maybe because I&#x27;m looking from the wrong angle or I&#x27;m just wrong when it comes to physics. In general I see a pretty big car with a rather big front with flat parts and a high wheelbase. So in comparision with a more &#x27;normal&#x27; one that means the user pays extra per mile because of the additional weight and wind resistance?\nSo what makes that extra cost worth it, why does this type of car thrive so well? Is it just looks (I think they&#x27;re ugly but that&#x27;s irrelevant)? Is it the &#x27;everyone has one&#x27; effect? Does it handle better perhaps? More on-topic: will the energy problem come into play when transitioning these cars into the EV-space?<p><i>edit</i> to clarify, seeing the comments regarding hard to reach areas etc, where an SUV does something useful: I&#x27;m talking standard Western European countries here with mild climate, hardly any snow, i.e. no use for 4WD or so.')
