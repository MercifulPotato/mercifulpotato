Item(by='AmericanChopper', descendants=None, kids=[25611526], score=None, time=1609534585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25602387, text='&gt; This is going to sound a bit curmudgeonly, but why should hospitality bend over to some tech middlemen?<p>Because that’s what their customers want, and providing something that their customers want should probably be one of the most important things for a business to do.<p>The only genuine harm that can be caused to these businesses by the delivery companies, is if the delivery company is legitimately impersonating the restaurant. Which as I said, would already be illegal.<p>The actual “harm” that this law addresses is somebody making a profit of providing a service that the restaurants think they deserve a cut of (just because?...). Hilariously, this type of arrangement is the most beneficial thing the restaurants could have. Because they’ll find if they’d try and make one of the arrangements with a company like UberEats, that what actually happens is the delivery company will be demanding a cut of their revenue instead.<p>Criminalizing a type of customer based on whether they intend to on sell the product after purchase is just entirely stupid. It’s one of the many stupid laws we have that only seek to protect dead business models that consumers no longer want. Just like the DMCA and all of the car dealership laws we have.')
