And imagine this timing works fine 9 days out of 10.<p>It&#x27;s reasonable for whoever is doing the cooking to want to know - ideally at 6pm and certainly at 6:30pm - whether their partner is on time, running 5 minutes late, or running an hour late.<p><i>&gt; Healthy relationships do not require &quot;ceding authority over own schedule&quot;</i><p>People do that all the time - A person who has promised their partner they&#x27;ll get home by 6:30pm every evening for dinner has ceded control over their schedule. Nothing unusual about that.<p><i>&gt; I would seen that as a red flag and sign of controlling personality.</i><p>A partner who will have dinner ready when you get home from work doesn&#x27;t seem like a red flag to me.')
