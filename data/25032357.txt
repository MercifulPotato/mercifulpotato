You can&#x27;t share it, use your own software to analyze, shuffle, remix it, etc<p>I&#x27;m a consumer of music, not a creator so I don&#x27;t care that I don&#x27;t own it. There are tons of ways creators can analyze, shuffle, remix or do whatever with it, but as a pure consumer Spotify is simply much better for me than CDs. I never cared about owning Music, CDs were always just a transport Medium so I can listen to the music.<p>&gt; But now there&#x27;s Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, HBO Go, Showtime Anytime, Peacock Premium, etc. Except now instead of one easy to use interface to access it all, it&#x27;s spread out all over the place and inconsistent as hell. And more expensive!<p>They aren&#x27;t though because you can be selective and cancel anytime and resubscribe. And you can watch exactly what you want at any time compared to cable. As a consumer it is way better because there is way more choice and competition at the moment.')
