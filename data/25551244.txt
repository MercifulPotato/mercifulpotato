Currently, she doesn&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m saying. Therefore, I can read whatever I want. Sometimes, I read her technical or scientific articles, adult-level books, etc.<p>I read in a &quot;parentese&quot; style with pauses, higher pitch, and drawn out vowels. I found that I was understanding the material better when I did that. It&#x27;s not efficient because my reading speed slows down. But just the act of read out loud helped in retaining information.<p>Doing things out loud could be some sort of &quot;life-hack&quot; to help learn or problem solve.')
