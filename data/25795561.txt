Item(by='libertine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610740844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25792257, text='Maybe it didn&#x27;t phrase myself right, I mean you don&#x27;t see public display of weapons in the sense of seeing people wielding weapons on the street, you don&#x27;t see weapons in protests, you don&#x27;t see people with carry on, no one has weapons on display on their houses and it&#x27;s not a subject of discussion at a table... it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s rude (unless it&#x27;s a meal of people that hunt).<p>I&#x27;ve grown around hunting weapons, mainly shotguns and rifles since my grandfather was an hunter. But all my education revolving weapons is that they are tools - dangerous tools - to hunt. Everyone of my friends I grew up with had family members that hunted, and some of them became hunters themselves. For sport some shoot plates, but a lot of those places closed own over the years due to polution.<p>The weapons body are made of wood and usually have some sort of carving in the metal accents. Hell, some of them were literally works of art - with duck&#x2F;foxes&#x2F;boars&#x2F;deer&#x2F;flower motives. I dont&#x27; recall seeing anyone who had weapons that were &quot;military&quot; style, neither in shape or even color&#x2F;pattern.<p>Now that I think of it, there was some sort of snob attitude around all of that (like usually only people with a lot of money could buy access to big game properties).<p>At least this is from my life, in my country living on the countryside. Weapons and the subject revolving weapons are limited to specific contexts, so for me it&#x27;s just odd a lot of what happens in the USA.<p>As a kid I found weapons fun, had air pressured rifles to hunt birds and shoot at targets, airsoft guns, etc.')
