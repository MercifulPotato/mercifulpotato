Our partners and team will:<p>1. Educate executives and hiring managers on structured interviewing and blind hiring&#x2F;bias eliminating practices (We believe that <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;Workplace2030.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;Workplace2030.org</a> or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engine.is&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engine.is&#x2F;</a> are great precedents for this aspect of our work)<p>2. Encourage organizations to publicly commit to implementing bias eliminating hiring practices and processes (We believe The Board Challenge (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theboardchallenge.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theboardchallenge.org&#x2F;</a>) and Time to Vote (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maketimetovote.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maketimetovote.org&#x2F;</a>) are great precedents for this aspect of our work)<p>3. Build tools that make blind hiring easier and more effective for organizations of all sizes (One example would be an easy to use free&#x2F;low cost resume redaction tool)')
