However, I&#x27;m not clear on the exact <i>privacy</i> benefit relative to the much easier path of blocking 3rd party cookies in your browser of choice and installing uBlock Origin. What specific tracking is no longer possible using containers that is currently possible if you&#x27;re using one or both of those protections?<p>Is it something about 3rd party scripts that uBlock Origin doesn&#x27;t block by default and that don&#x27;t require 3rd party cookies?<p>I&#x27;m not looking for a general answer about containment or sandboxing or a nice user experience for separating environments or profiles; I&#x27;m looking for a precise attack&#x2F;tracking vector that makes this worth switching browsers for.')
