We have reset all of your licenses to have the same annual renewal date, regardless of when you purchased them.&quot;<p>Me: &quot;We are no longer using these licenses. Free months are just a tactic in hopes that we miss the cancellation window and are forced to pay for another year.&quot;<p>Adobe: &quot;We highly recommend that you accept our generous 3 months free offer.&quot;<p>Me: &quot;That sounds a little ominous. Please cancel the licenses, effective immediately.&quot;<p>This is paraphrased, but follows the essential conversation. Adobe, you disappoint me.')
