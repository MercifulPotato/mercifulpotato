I tell them about the software and get their interest (which is always seemingly high).  They give me the email address of their plastic surgeon.  I email the surgeon with a link to this page while explaining to them that I&#x27;m creating this software but want to validate the idea before putting more time into it.  Nobody responds to my emails.\n2.  The photos are right there in the link, but if you&#x27;re not able to view them, to me it usually generates pictures that are close to indistinguishable from actual photos.  The breasts look like breasts (unless I&#x27;m cramming five on them onto one chest and make them shaped oddly... lol)<p>I just need more pictures.  I also need to apply a different image-to-image translation where I put &quot;static&quot; over JUST the segmented breasts, so as to not remove tattoos, freckles, etc.  I&#x27;ve seen an awesome paper that does this called OASIS, but they&#x27;ve not released code.  I want the synthesized picture to be as close as the original as possible (with the obvious exception of larger breasts).<p>Still I need to build the actual pipeline instead of running the images through my segmentation network and my SPADE network AND I need to maybe programmatically increase the segmented &quot;breast&quot; category to be larger and maybe place the nipple in a more desirable location.')
