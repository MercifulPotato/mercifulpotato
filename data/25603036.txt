Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re safe in any meaningful way because the law says so. At the end of the day you would have to litigate it yourself and that is usually not worth it unless the offense is truly egregious.<p>Against an adversary with deep pockets like a corporation, you can lose even if you win. This is how patent trolls extort companies, litigating a patent suite is usually a seven figure endeavor. And there&#x27;s no guarantee you win. It&#x27;s cheaper to pay the licensing free from the trolls, who are smart enough to make sure it&#x27;s always less than the cost of litigating.')
