Each time the cow is clicked, a point also known as a &quot;click&quot; is awarded; if the player adds friends&#x27; cows to their pasture, they also receive clicks added to their scores when the player clicks their own cow. As in other Facebook games, players are encouraged to post announcements to their news feed whenever they click their cow. A virtual currency known as &quot;Mooney&quot; can be bought with Facebook Credits; it can be used to purchase special &quot;premium&quot; cow designs, and the ability to skip the six-hour time limit that must be waited before the cow can be clicked again.&quot;<p>&quot;Unexpectedly to Bogost, Cow Clicker became a viral phenomenon[...]Although continually disturbed by its popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming and social networking trends;&quot;<p>&quot;&#x27;bovine gods&#x27; eventually revealed that &#x27;Cowpocalypse&#x27; would occur on July 21, 2011 (exactly one year since the original release of the game). From then on, every click made by players would deduct thirty seconds from a countdown clock leading to the Cowpocalypse. However, players could extend the countdown clock by paying to supplicate with Facebook Credits: paying 10 credits would extend the countdown by a single hour, while 4,000 would extend the countdown by an entire month. After $700 worth of extensions, the countdown clock expired on the evening of September 7, 2011. At this point, the game remained playable, but all the cows were replaced by blank spaces and said to have been raptured. Bogost intended the Cowpocalypse event to signal the &quot;end&quot; of the game to players; when addressing a complaint by a fan who felt the game was no longer fun after the cow rapture, Bogost responded that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t very fun before.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cow_Clicker" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cow_Clicker</a>')
