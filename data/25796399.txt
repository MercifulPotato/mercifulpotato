My experience was that Bumble was exactly like Tinder, except that on Bumble I had a lower match rate, but a slightly higher rate of matches resulting in an actual conversation.  I found no difference whatsoever in the &quot;seriousness&quot; of the people involved.  Most people were using Bumble for hookups.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s changed, but I honestly believe the only dating app currently available that&#x27;s actually worth using if you want a relationship and not a hookup is Coffee Meets Bagel.  I had more and higher quality dates, including meeting my now 3+ year girlfriend, on CMB than any other app.')
