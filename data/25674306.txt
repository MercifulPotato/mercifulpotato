Item(by='ColinWright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610041168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25674167, text='Neither &quot;Not Switching&quot; nor &quot;Use None&quot; are viable options, which is why they aren&#x27;t included.  I appreciate that they are the advice you would give, but it would be unhelpful for them.  They need something, and it needs not to be WhatsApp.  That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t include those as options in the poll.<p>But I appreciate (and am sympathetic towards) your stance.')
