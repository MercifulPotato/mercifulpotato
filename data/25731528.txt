If you try to upvote your own comments, have voting rings, etc you&#x27;ll get shadow banned right away. They&#x27;re computer science guys so they have graph algorithms and such to find trolls.<p>What you need to do is post regular top-level comments on rising posts (second page) and you&#x27;ll get easy karma. Get to 500 and you can downvote. After that just lurk and downvote liberal SJW type nonsense. If you comment on a post then your votes on it are nullified so either comment or vote, not both.&quot;')
