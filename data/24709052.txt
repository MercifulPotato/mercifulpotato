That means that Democrats bomb Eastern Europe to show how non-racist they are by killing white people and Republicans bomb the Middle East to show how much they value hard working white(ish) people by killing not (quite) white people.<p>The idea that democrats do any less spying on the American people is laughable. It was Trump that killed the Patriot Act this year after 2 extensions and 3 kind of extensions under Bush and Obama, and he did it because he thought the deep state was after him.')
