I have no &quot;privilege&#x27;s&quot; except being blamed for stuff by my skin color by those who claim to be fighting racism.<p>I have what&#x27;s called &quot;results&quot; of hard work, good decisions and a healthy dose of luck to go from the poor kid of a single mother on government cheese and living on family couches to making a good salary at a good job. I earned my place - I wasn&#x27;t &quot;privileged&quot; into it.<p>The only REAL privilege I have is being an American - and that&#x27;s color blind. The top 1% globally make 30k&#x2F;year and that&#x27;s the vast majority of Americans. And I&#x27;m not ashamed of that... I&#x27;m proud of it - as I should be.<p>Any attempts to place race as a factor is done by what we love to call... racists.')
