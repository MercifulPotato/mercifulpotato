Are you using &quot;inflationary&quot; here to refer to the supply of the currency? If so, then sure, but 1) refers to price inflation&#x2F;deflation, which is not a predictable thing.<p>So you can compare how &quot;inflationary&quot; currencies are by 2 &amp; 3, but not by 1 -- that&#x27;s not a mechanical effect. Even the most stringent monetarist in the world wouldn&#x27;t at a minimum factor in monetary velocity into the value equation. And monetary velocity is a behavioral thing that can be mediated both by availability of current and future capital as well as liquidity preferences of individuals viewed in aggregate.')
