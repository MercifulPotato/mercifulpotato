A good bit of slag builds up in my warm-air humidifier, and the white-dust was noticeable after a few weeks of ultrasonic.<p>Warm-air humidifiers are less efficient: My room is ~25% without any devices running. An ultrasonic would bring it up to 35%+, but Warm-air humidifier only brings it up to 32% or so.<p>Another efficiency test: both units were 1-gallon units. The warm-air humidifier probably goes through the tank in ~12 hours, while the ultrasonic would go through in ~8.')
