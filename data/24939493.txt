Every 2 days in the month , there is this Hindu thing of Ekadasi (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ekadashi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ekadashi</a>). Each of these depending on the month have a presiding deity!\nThe rules are simple , the day before should be a light meal , on Ekadasi dawn to next day dawn (about 36 hours in all) fasting. On Dwadasi , break this fast by first having water , meditation and then a light meal (usually milk+milk products) and community feeding if possible  . Other rules include not sleeping during day and so on. My parents do it still , very few follow this regimen though these days.<p>I think very similar eating&#x2F;fasting habits are pertinent during the lent as well.<p>When i was younger , during Ramadan we used to go to break the fast post dusk.

As a veggie , i would go there and eat :) . Sadly it has become a hog show now ,eating as much during dawn and dusk to keep the day full')
