I also wrote my own regex parsers with fast-forward and rewind tokenizers, because it was so dreadful.  I wouldn&#x27;t normally do that.<p>There&#x27;s also 4 (4!!!) different ways of returning errors in the MWS Feed APIs when used from Java.  Given the number of entities, and the fact that they&#x27;re combinatorial I had to do some of the craziest Scala code I&#x27;ve ever written because duplication was just too bad to handle for how critical that code was.  To do it in a bulletproof way, that error handling for MWS feeds inherently has 2^4 control flows * N entities = 16N code paths at like 100-200 lines a piece if you didn&#x27;t use some higher order abstractions.')
