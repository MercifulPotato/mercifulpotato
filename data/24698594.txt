But realistically these single board computers are more suitable for gaming than for machine learning. If you don&#x27;t have a computer <i>at all</i> then I guess you could use a Jetson for this purpose, but a real computer would be much better and is easily within the budgets of most companies and most software engineers.<p>Is this a developing markets play? I&#x27;ve never heard of someone whose only computer is a Pi&#x2F;Jetson. By the time you add all the necessary peripherals to use it as your only computer, it costs more than a cheap laptop.<p>So the point of a Jetson is .. you only have a cheap laptop with terrible integrated graphics, and for $60 you get a much better GPU with this Jetson, and you remote into it?<p>I think it&#x27;ll do better in gaming.')
