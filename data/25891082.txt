Most of the others will happily let you &quot;sudo pip install&quot; stuff and lead people to think that&#x27;s the correct way to do things.<p>Unfortunately pipx has come too late. Pipx provides a real way for users to install arbitrary python tools, but too many docs out there tell users to use pip. Then you&#x27;ve got all the users who want to &quot;play around&quot; with python and install libraries. Even things like jupyter have crap support for virtualenvs and make it far too easy for users to have all their projects in a single env. It&#x27;s a mess.<p>Regular users should <i>never</i> have been exposed to pip2&#x2F;pip3. They should never have even been interacting with the OS python interpreter. Pip should only exist in a &quot;global&quot; contexy to support bootstrapping virtualenvs and nothing else. Poetry does a lot of this right.')
