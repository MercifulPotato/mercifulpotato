Or realistically had access to college education?&quot;<p>It seems overall the education of the population has risen, although it might not be as high quality. Also, this lower quality can lend itself to higher attainment (eg college entrance exams being more lax). Also, 1945-85 you would have higher number of people who never went to high school because 8th grade was considered sufficient when they were a child. So just through demographic change (sadly, those older people dying off) and an increase in the job market&#x27;s demand for higher credentials we can see the level of education has risen over time, resulting in the most educated populace we&#x27;ve seen.')
