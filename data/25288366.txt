But these past 4 years, this kind of &quot;using public money for private events&quot; are much less common. There is much much tight curb on &quot;dinners&quot; &quot;using government owned cars&quot; &quot;red pockets gifts&quot;. And there is a lot of auditing, approvals, and documentation for doing anything. Source: my cousin works in a governmental department. His co-worker was fired for hosting a expensive dinner for potential collaboration partner. Before, people wanted to get a government position for the &quot;nice Perks&quot;. Nowadays, government position is no longer that &quot;you can do whatever you want job&quot;. There are actually tons of rules for government jobs. Ex: My brother is not allowed to purchase a drink more than 8% alcohol content if the meal is sponsored by government money and there is amount cap per meal. He is mid ranked. And people can report evidence of corruption rules breaking so he is very careful with the rules.')
