Often times in the hiring process I&#x27;ll encounter really promising candidates that excite me, but then I open their Twitter&#x2F;website and their first choice of words to describe themselves are &quot;Jesus lover&quot; or &quot;Follower of Jesus&quot;, and it immediately turns me off.<p>I think religion has its place in the world, but the indications I get from those statements are that this individual ultimately hasn&#x27;t progressed very far intellectually or challenged their beliefs strongly enough. I fear it is a limiting mindset, no matter how impressive their resume is, and that this will translate on the job as well.<p>What&#x27;s your experience with hiring or working with &quot;Jesus lovers&quot;?')
