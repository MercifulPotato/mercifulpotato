Not things where the principals are taking too many risks or where there are unknowables that sink the idea, but situations where the plan from the start is to attract investment, take it, and run away. (Elisabeth Holmes-style &quot;fake it &#x27;til you make it&quot; is sort of in the middle here.)<p>The part that is hard is that it&#x27;s really very hard to do prevent outright scams without a lot of collateral damage. In general, scam artists are better at understanding and applying any rules than the regulators or the police. Successful ones are also better at marketing their scams to ordinary people than non-scam-artists are at marketing their real business proposals. (After all, a successful scam artist <i>only</i> needs to have skills about marketing their proposal, but a team that is building something real has to have those skills <i>and</i> skills that are useful for building something real.)<p>Much like we know from history that bad money drives out the good, we also have overwhelming historical evidence that in a completely unregulated market, the scams and the amount of money they attract will massively overwhelm actual business. The regulations around the financial markets are &quot;scam-driven&quot;, in the same way that FAA regulations are &quot;funeral-driven&quot;. Every line of text exists because someone somewhere managed to steal so much money from so many people, that the victims managed to complain enough about how this shouldn&#x27;t be possible that it became law. The natural progression of rules in both cases is towards <i>less regulation</i>, as everyone is perfectly aware that the regulation that exists is stifling and damaging, so over time the regulations are reduced and enforcement becomes more lax, until something like 737MAX or Madoff happens and regulations need to be tightened again.<p>There is no chance that anyone will ever strike all these regulations down with enough funding and &quot;the right judges&quot;, simply because anyone who understands the space understands that while the regulation we have is bad, the alternative is so, so much worse.')
