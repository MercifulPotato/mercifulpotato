I&#x27;m not against it, but at my old job my coworkers were mostly 10+ years older, married and had children, so they had their own thing going on.<p>There&#x27;s lots of ways to make new friends outside of work, depending on what floats your boat. You can go to industry meetups, join a sports club, take up a hobby, go to live music gigs etc. But to be honest, making friends is just one of those things that happens organically, from random encounters multiplied by time. After university, it takes a bit longer to make friends, since people generally have a well established social circle and spend less time socialising due to work and other responsibilities. It took me a year or two to find my feet and &quot;build a network&quot; of friends.')
