It also makes the results highly auditable since the GPS (and assisted GPS) system is public and well-documented, and open, standards-compliant methods exist in the surveying and DAQ industry for working with GPS data.<p>Laser gates certainly have advantages, but they require more setup and ultimately I am skeptical that they would provide more certainty than GPS results. As mentioned elsewhere a survey GPS receiver can produce raw data which can be processed after the fact as a form of audit, something not really possible with laser gates.')
