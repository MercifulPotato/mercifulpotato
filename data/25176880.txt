I grew up reading forums for hours every day and that habit hasn&#x27;t gone away. HN is my latest addiction.<p>I couldn&#x27;t care less about the &quot;social&quot; side of social media. Fb, instagram etc had their time but ultimately they&#x27;re uninteresting. Twitter is so fluid and open ended that you can always find interesting conversations but it&#x27;s too low signal to noise. Reddit communities can be potentially as good as hn but the company pushes too hard the other way.')
