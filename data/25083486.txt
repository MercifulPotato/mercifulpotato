I don&#x27;t see how this is horrifying at all. I have a tab open for every dependency of every project I do, including one for every component of every electronics project I maintain. I have a tab for every webcomic I follow, a tab for every news page, a tab for every package that&#x27;s on its way to me. It&#x27;s like searchable, zero-effort bookmarks with state (including page scroll location) saved. Of course this is on firefox, and total suspender makes it easy to keep resource usage low. I have many years worth of state here, and if I didn&#x27;t have this I don&#x27;t see why I would even bother using a browser. It&#x27;s like a personal knowledge base. Related tabs are clustered together in the list, I know approximately where things are in the list, I have two different search tools (% search and  Tab Center Redux&#x27; own search box). I don&#x27;t get why people keep trying to tell others that their workflow is bad (&quot;horrifying&quot;) and they should feel bad. I don&#x27;t care, this works, and nothing else compares.')
