If you&#x27;re a minimalist, then great. If you&#x27;re accustomed to what a smartphone can do, not so great.<p>The alternative app stores are full of unimpressive, small scale apps. Dozens of calculators and little games, but no maps apps (of worth), no yelps, no IMDb (which I use often), no Sheets or Photos, the list is huge. I&#x27;m sorry but these apps make a smartphone worthwhile.<p>To avoid such a spartan experience, I ended up just installing microG (an open source replacement for Google&#x27;s Play Services) and Aurora (a replacement Play store client, which allows me to install most apps from the Play store).<p>The problem is that most modern apps  require a mammoth cloud backend, which costs big money to run, which means you&#x27;re going to need a huge company running it. You&#x27;ll never find big scale apps like this on F-droid.')
