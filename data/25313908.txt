Not sure I ever weighed in on their anti-union topics but would have been against them there too.<p>The point is, I&#x27;m not a Google shill.<p>Still, on this case, on a factual level, the only real dispute is whether this exchange:<p>&quot;Do X or I quit&quot;\n&quot;Ok, your final paycheck is in the mail and IT will be in touch to organise equipment returns, effective now&quot;<p>Is &quot;accepting a resignation&quot; or &quot;firing&quot;. Neither side is disputing that this is how it went down.<p>On an ethical level, again, I&#x27;m no fan of Google but Timnit Cebru&#x27;s previous public actions don&#x27;t paint her in a good light while Jeff Dean&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have any notable enough to sway my opinion one way or another on his ethical trustworthiness.<p>So based on that, I (and many others) do end up siding with Google. is that a pro-Google push? is someone co-ordinating this? If they are, they haven&#x27;t contacted me. Don&#x27;t mistake the fact that Google is often unpopular here with the idea that no Google action can be supported here without interference')
