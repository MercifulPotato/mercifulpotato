I have a decent navigation system, voice controls, Android Auto and CarPlay, touch infotainment (not a fan), and lane assist, emergency break assist and several others. A friend of mine bought a BMW 1 which cost 12k more than my car (MSRP) and, excluding the gps navigation, has none of those features.<p>Those aren&#x27;t innovations, those are almost standard in lots of vehicles.')
