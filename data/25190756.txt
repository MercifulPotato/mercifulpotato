Do&#x2F;suggest&#x2F;live-with&#x2F;support what ever is least invasive for your wife&#x2F;partner. I nearly steered my wife into a very invasive surgery due to it having more &quot;real&quot; outcome (she knew I wasn&#x27;t really into implants in general and preferred natural). Honestly, I think she wanted that too - it&#x27;s a hard time that leads you to this type of surgery and something that sounds &quot;normal&quot; is what you will gravitate towards. However, then I came to my senses&#x2F;digested some research and realized how invasive the surgery was and how I didn&#x27;t want her to have to go through it (+risks) and I had to kind of talk her out of it. It was the difference between, quickly adding some implants (couple hour surgery) and a procedure that required re-routing an artery, relocating some stomach muscles, and some other grueling things I don&#x27;t recall (18 hour surgery).<p>After that ordeal, and a C section birth of my son, yah she has some scars. But they become invisible and life moves on and that&#x27;s the best part.')
