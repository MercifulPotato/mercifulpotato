To make sense, AWS would have to be comparable to MacStadium&#x27;s pricing.<p>And don&#x27;t forget the 24-hour minimum. If your duty cycle for a Mac Mini is only 20% per day every weekday, well, you can&#x27;t rent a Mac Mini for less than a 24 hour period, so instead of paying for 20% of a month, you&#x27;ll be paying for 20 work days, 60% of a month. On AWS, that would run you $546&#x2F;month, 4x as much as you&#x27;d pay MacStadium for the entire month.<p>AWS&#x27;s price is only comparable to MacStadium if you need five 24-hour periods per month (or less).<p>And, sure, AWS&#x27;s prices will decline at some point, but I&#x27;m not expecting an 80% price drop this year.')
