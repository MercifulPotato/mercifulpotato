In the US, the lockdowns were under emergency powers of the executive branch, which are supposed to only last a limited time (30 days where I am, for example).  Several of these were challenged and found to be unlawful.<p>* The US lockdowns were originally only mean to prevent hospitals from being overloaded.  We are way <i>way</i> past that point where that was an issue - all the emergency capacity has been dismantled for months.<p>* As sibling comment implies, something like half the states in the US aren&#x27;t under any lockdown now, businesses there aren&#x27;t having issues staying open, and their stats are no worse than the locked-down states.<p>* Speaking of preventable deaths, suicide and overdose are climbing where lockdowns are still in place.')
