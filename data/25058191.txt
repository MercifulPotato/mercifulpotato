Buy a new laptop!&quot;<p>How often do phone users actually upgrade their phones for more power?  I mostly use my computer to develop software, play video games, and edit media, and stream videos.  I mostly use my phone to text, play music, and access the internet.<p>Almost every PC purchase I&#x27;ve ever made was driven by a need for better performance, but I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> upgraded my phone for that reason.  I&#x27;ve upgrade my phone for a better screen, a better camera, a bigger battery, software support, new hardware features (4G, biometrics, USB-C, etc)... but never because I felt like I needed a faster processor or more system memory.')
