I loved the experience of sitting down and solving a book of tactics puzzles. I found it fascinating that the individual movements of each chess piece are quite simple, yet they combine to create really challenging puzzles. With Omnicube I wanted to create a game that had a similar feeling of challenging puzzles derived from simple mechanics. I think it would appeal to a lot of the HN audience!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trykon.itch.io&#x2F;omnicube" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trykon.itch.io&#x2F;omnicube</a>')
