Bloom notoriously hated most fantasy novels - the Harry Potter series in particular - so that&#x27;s a noticeable endorsement.<p>For an older fantasy series, you could also try Mervyn Peake&#x27;s Gormenghast trilogy (starts with Titus Groan), which actually predates the Lord of the Rings and has a crowd that thinks it&#x27;s better written. I think Neil Gaiman has worked on a TV series adaptation.')
