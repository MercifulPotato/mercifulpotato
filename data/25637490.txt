Even at 2 bits per pixel, this is still quite big as raw data, so you typically will want to use compression on top such as RLE, DEFLATE, etc.<p>I’m currently exploring this for my own applications, compressing large 8bit sprite sheet images, and it’s producing much smaller images than most palette based image formats (GIF, WebP, PNG, etc).
