Item(by='cryptoz', descendants=None, kids=[25707346], score=None, time=1610241484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25707200, text='&gt; Massive multinational corporations having this much power over our speech is not healthy.<p>Who has power over my speech? I have iPhone, Android, Ubuntu, Mac and other tech. My speech is not limited in any way.<p>I can write down notes on paper if I want. I can write down content freely today as I could yesterday.<p>What corporation out there has <i>any</i> power over my speech, much less &quot;too much power&quot;?<p>Edit: I seem blocked by HN temporarily (for opposing viewpoints? I don&#x27;t know but I can&#x27;t post any more!) so to respond to the post below me here is an edit:<p>Trump should hold a press conference if he wants to say something. It can easily be streamed on the internet.<p>No president before 2007 had access to Twitter and they could still get the word out online if they wanted to.')
