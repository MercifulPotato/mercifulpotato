Ignoring the context is not useful. Twitter, Facebook, AWS, and others didn’t act ex nihilo.<p>To flip it around, do you think Twitter, Facebook, and AWS would have taken these actions if protesters hadn&#x27;t broken into the Capitol on January 6? I think it&#x27;s unlikely.<p>Twitter and Facebook have taken little action in the past four years even when there were many calls to do so, and Twitter had already come out and said that they&#x27;d subject Trump&#x27;s account to normal TOS review after he leaves office. So <i>something</i> happened that caused them to change their decision. In this case it&#x27;s not hard to see that the proximal and stated cause is sufficient to explain their actions.')
