I take zero supplements. I eat a variety of things over the course of the week, always somewhat balanced (i eat more veggies than the average american i&#x27;d say and perhaps way more fruits). I exercise, with a shirt on (lol). Sometimes for many hours, sometimes for 30min. Totals hours over the course of the week. I take zero supplements normally. I see these as an option or for specific cases rather than &quot;the daily pill&quot; (in fact, the &quot;daily pill&quot; things scare me a bit, I&#x27;d rather not rely on pills - the science don&#x27;t seem clear enough and the things you can buy are definitely unclear)<p>Every now and then i crave specific things like orange juice (ie high vitamin C contents).<p>All that to say best way to know is probably to test, but also, if you go bike 20min shirtless every 3 days and walk 20min a day I assume you don&#x27;t get nearly as much vitamin D as I do, so it kinda makes sense to me. But still depends on the person, how much sun, yada yada.')
