For ssh, you can just stop pretending that it is just like any other program and have actual integration with it (if you still care about serial terminals, just make the mechanism that understands ssh generic). On the remote host you either need your shell executable to run in some “remote” mode like rsync does or you need your shell to be able to generate appropriate bash commands.<p>Take eshell for an example: it connects processes together in emacs and can natively support navigating to places on remote hosts, opening files there, or running (remote) shell commands.<p>I sympathise with you on the pain of terminfo+ssh where the remote host doesn’t have the appropriate files. But I don’t think that further piling on “standards” to terminal escape sequences is a long-term solution to terminal woes.')
