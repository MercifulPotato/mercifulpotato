The rule Apple would like to enforce is very clear, and we know what it was and the review team didn&#x27;t, because the guidelines didn&#x27;t reflect the rule that Apple wanted to enforce (and thus ended up enforcing it inconsistently). A situation where developers have to tell the review team how the guidelines work because they&#x27;re not written down explicitly is a very untenable position and one that needs to change.')
