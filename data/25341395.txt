Trucking is not something I feel qualified to comment on, because I don’t have a sense for the economics. But I know a bunch of R&amp;D is going on here.<p>Most players in the space made investments in driver replacement tech which is multiple years from profitability. I think the places that this kind of tech makes sense is in licensing it to TNCs or operating a fleet of vehicles that you list on a TNC’s network.<p>On the other hand, driver assistance features are the only systems that can generate meaningful revenue today. One of Tesla’s finest selling points is their AP software.<p>In this vein, Comma is the Android to Tesla’s tightly integrated iOS. They are profitable today and ultimately have a larger TAM (new cars vs Tesla owners).')
