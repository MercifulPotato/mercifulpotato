You might misunderstand why I included the word private when talking about trade. In most countries, I can rent a hotel or buy a sandwich using whatever currency we both agree. For government (not private) transactions, I am typically forced to use legal tender. (See the first sentence in the link you shared.) For private transactions, I can often use a different currency provided my trading partner agrees.<p>In most cases where you feel like you are forced to transact in the local currency, you are being forced by your trading partner not by their government.<p>I somewhat regularly use USD currency in countries when that’s not the local legal tender. This is very common in the Caribbean and Central America. It’s commonly accepted (though less frequently done) in Europe. In some cases, shopkeepers have even arranged to offer me currency conversion services (often on their credit card machine) to facilitate their customers&#x27; preference to use a different currency.<p>In some rare cases, even a government demands to transact in a currency that is not the general legal tender. (The Dominican Republic charges tourists an exit fee that is denominated and paid specifically in USD.)')
