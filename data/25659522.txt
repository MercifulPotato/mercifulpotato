I had people at my last position give candidates negative points because they wore a suit and I went $%&amp;#ing ape. In positions that I&#x27;ve held in the past it&#x27;s been the appropriate action to wear a suit due to heavily corporate environments, and I see it as 110% normal that someone puts on a nice suit for an interview. The action of wearing a suit (or tie for that matter) to an interview <i>should never</i> be seen as a &quot;cultural fit&quot; problem - <i>I&#x27;m looking at you SV...</i><p>Sorry that almost happened to you. That&#x27;s some bullshit.<p>---<p>Overall a nice well-fitting button down + a pair of well-fitting dress slacks is what I would recommend. Personally, I wear a slim fit <i>brand new</i> white button-down (ironed), nice dark blue chinos (ironed, not pleated), and not-scuffed brown wing-tips. Often I also wear a tie, but am considering not thanks to a derelict SF &quot;big-wig&quot; grilling me in an interview as to &quot;why are you wearing a tie?&quot; All I wanted to say is &quot;does it matter?&quot; <i>(offender: you&#x27;re reading this don&#x27;t do that again.)</i><p>Also get a solid hair cut, ensure you&#x27;re shaved if male, and yeah - sit up and be confident while you&#x27;re in the chair. Body language <i>does</i> matter, and your interviewer will subconsciously notice regardless if they&#x27;re giving you a &quot;pass&quot; or not.')
