There was this one department that had a huge excel database that was bringing the network to its knees. Around that time I had discovered that you could create a function in excel with the moniker of a null character (alt-255). We had used that for playing pranks on one another. Someone had the bright idea to put a function into the code that invoked a slowly increasing pause. That function was sprinkled all throughout their code and no one knew because you canâ€™t see a null character.<p>A few months later that department was practically begging us to convert their excel document into a database project.')
