But below is <i>also</i> true:<p>&gt; make many immigrant coworkers deeply uncomfortable (especially if they are women)<p>You can also add gay people, trans, etc - and even things like being smart, or stupid, or being a man or woman, or blond or redhead or... etc - to the list who have to endure feeling uncomfortable and unwelcome (and often keeping it to themselves or playing along) in a workplace where &quot;they&quot; are made fun of regularly.<p>I think it&#x27;s because humour and oppression both exist, and actual for real consequences of the latter have been very severe and sometimes still are.  It&#x27;s hard to tell how much of each is really in process at any moment, so of course it&#x27;s uncomfortable, and of course if someone feels they have to fit in to keep in their colleague&#x27;s good books at work, they&#x27;ll tend to keep their discomfort and background to themselves.')
