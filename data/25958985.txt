When you sell short (with some exceptions for market makers), you are obligated to &quot;find&quot; shares to borrow (called &quot;locates&quot;). Usually your broker arranges this; any shares that you borrow cannot be lent to someone else. If you do not have any borrowed shares (as recorded by the broker), that is considered a &quot;naked short sell&quot;.')
