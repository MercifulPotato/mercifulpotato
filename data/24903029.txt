This is not the same as intentionally circumventing a digital rights protection mechanism. In some countries (but not in all) it is illegal to download copyrighted music if it was illegally uploaded. But we don&#x27;t have to assume in the first place that Youtube videos were illegally uploaded. And not to forget that many titles on Youtube are licensed under CC-BY, so in any case they can be legally downloaded and even shared.')
