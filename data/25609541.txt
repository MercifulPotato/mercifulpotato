Item(by='to11mtm', descendants=None, kids=[25620469], score=None, time=1609553146, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25601640, text='&gt; On the other hand, what seems to sell in North America is crappy bikes with full suspension and maximum number of gears.<p>Part of that problem is there&#x27;s a certain cost floor to Derailleur based drivetrains versus Internally geared hubs, and when you&#x27;re an ODM mass producing you&#x27;re at a whole different level of price structure.<p>&gt; Actually IGH canâ€™t shift smoothly under load<p>Ehhhhh..... So The Nexus 8 speed will upshift under load OK, but downshift you typically will have to pause pedaling for at least a moment for the shift to complete. I had one on a tandem at one point and even with two experienced riders it could do the upshifts fine. I think? some other IGH manufacturers have&#x2F;had models that could shift in both directions fine, but they were very expensive models.<p>From my time slinging bikes (which was around when Shimano kicked off their &#x27;Coasting&#x27; program,) where Shimano missed the boat was they didn&#x27;t offer a 5 or 7 speed with shifting capabilities close enough to the Nexus 8. That would have been enough for everyone to be happy.<p>As an aside, It&#x27;s fun to see all the different kinds of shifters Shimano cooked up for their IGHs over the years to sell people on them...<p>I&#x27;m still not sold on Drum brakes, in any case, but I&#x27;m also a Mechancial Disc zealot FWIW.')
