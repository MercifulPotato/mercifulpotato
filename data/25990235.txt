For example pre order of Silver Maples is at $8 above spot. Historically that tends to be more like $2-3 area. Their websites were all crashing from demand over the weekend too. Its not WSB doing that.<p>Edit: Other reason Silver has been trending up is Covid and potential stimulus. Metals are typically a hedge against inflation, and a massive stimulus is likely to cause inflation. The supply tightness has been around for months at this point, but extra bad this week.')
