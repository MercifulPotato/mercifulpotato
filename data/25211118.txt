I mean, if you have logs stating that a specific Apple ID connected from a specific IP address at a specific time, and they know the identity tied to that Apple ID, it seems reasonable that it would strengthen the claim of &quot;the user at this IP address is most likely this person&quot; quite a bit, especially if the same IP shows up regularly with that Apple ID? I&#x27;m not saying they <i>do</i> this currently, but I&#x27;m just drawing attention to the fine line between privacy and security. Vigilance isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, as long as it&#x27;s grounded in the full reality. It&#x27;s always possible that one day, Apple&#x27;s focus in this area may change. When it does, it helps if part of that discussion is already being had.')
