The Google of 2005 was nothing like the Google of 2020.<p>When Google was just a search company, they were purely innovators. Google indexed the internet better than anyone else.<p>But Google now is pretty bloated. Chrome, Android, Gmail, Docs&#x2F;Drive, YouTube. The thing is, your gripes with one product affect your perception of all Google products. If you don’t like Chrome, your YouTube experience might be degraded, and you might resent Google’s increasing influence on web standards.<p>I’m not saying it’s bad that Google has made a lot of useful things work. But Google has lost its magic.<p>The same can be said of Facebook. Young people flocked to it a decade ago. It was new, it was magic. Now it’s bloated too (Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus), and has its own set of unique issues.<p>It’s like how some people prefer bands that haven’t become mainstream yet. I prefer small companies because they are still on their toes trying to make better products. Google and Facebook don’t care about <i>you</i> as a user anymore, they’re too big to care.<p>Apple, Amazon, Microsoft... they too have lost that magic with age and size.<p>They’ve become boring. Boring is a recipe for disruption.')
