And no, it will not &quot;radicalize&quot; us. Radicalize? To what? Being free speech? Being pro-debate? Allowing discussion so people are free to choose for themselves? And youtube is not just allowing for content. They aren&#x27;t a &quot;content allowing&quot; platform. They are creating it, curating it, producing it, etc...\nNo, the ftc needs to regulate them (and all social media, frankly) as a public utility, and then GUARANTEE constitutional rights.<p>The only way to combat &quot;bad&quot; speech is with MORE speech.<p>You don&#x27;t &quot;win the argument&quot; by censoring it. If you&#x27;re censoring content, you&#x27;re a freaking bolshevik, and have no place in a democratic-based constitutional republic. Pure and simple.')
