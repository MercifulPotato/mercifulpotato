But I still think these M1 Macs--as awesome as they undoubtedly are--are not quite yet ready for developers. Virtualization support still looks iffy, and while I really don&#x27;t care much whether my container is Arm or x86, the ecosystems and tooling around those architectures are still at different levels of maturity.<p>The exciting (or depressing, for the 2020 crew) thing is that the fact that these M1 Macs are such a triumph probably does mean that these various rough edges will be smoothed out way faster than even I, a self admitted Apple fan, expected them to be.<p>I was thinking I&#x27;d be waiting until 2022 or 2023 before being ready as a developer to have my primary device be an Apple Silicon laptop. But with the overwhelming success of these chips, <i>every</i> developer wants to be on these things ASAP. I could easily see the ecosystem for Arm being radically improved over the next year.')
