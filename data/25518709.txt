It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating to have to restart it now and again.<p>I have encountered situations where I hit PLAY and nothing happens, or I hit PLAY and it says it&#x27;s playing, but there&#x27;s no audio, or I hit PLAY and the app says it&#x27;s unable to play the track. Restarting the app seems to fix most of these issues.<p>There are also scroll bugs when browsing podcast episodes. The scroll position will just jump to the same spot as you try to scroll down the page, making it impossible to view the episodes in a series.')
