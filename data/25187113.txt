You have a good work ethic. In fact if they only work at 10% and you work at 100%. You&#x27;re 10x those peers. You end up doing 10x the work as your peers because they do nothing.<p>Whereas if you work at a place that has good management, people are motivated to work because they are well respected and not micromanaged. Suddenly if you work 100%, so are your coworkers working 100%. You aren&#x27;t 10x. So you have to work on boosting your coworkers.')
