(&quot;spend $20M to make $3M...&quot; = not healthy) What about ratio of OSS successes vs closed successes, esp w&#x2F; efficiency?<p>e.g., the biggest co there is databricks (and i continue to root for them!), and contrast w&#x2F; snowflake who started in a similar period, grew 10-20X bigger, and started more simply (get a clone of redshift without doing business w&#x2F; aws). worse, databricks took a <i>lot</i> of phd students many years with a lot of big corp funding before the vc&#x27;s got involved: that&#x27;s a high bar an oss co must hit vs not for adjacent high-growth spaces.<p>the good news for oss founders is VC&#x27;s <i>are</i> warming to investing here, and sometimes, even before OSS traction. irrespective of profitability, the founders have a better chance of flipping it to be someone else&#x27;s problem.<p>not necessarily as clear cut for community-minded co&#x27;s though that want to be financially healthy for their community. it seems the bigger and more numerous successes are non-oss, and despite the many oss attempts, the big sustainable oss successes have to doubly succeed at what is already hard. If going OSS increased chance of success -- and didn&#x27;t actively challenge success -- I&#x27;d expect relatively more successes by now. I wish all this wasn&#x27;t so but it&#x27;s hard to unsee...')
