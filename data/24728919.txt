Are you looking for co-founders, early employees or what ?  I suspect most people won&#x27;t have much interest in helping you start a business unless they see how doing so could end up benefiting them.<p>I don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re located but I think most medium-size and larger cities in the US have some communities oriented around tech and encouraging startups, so you might want to look into those sorts of organizations.  It sounds like you&#x27;ll need to expand you circle of acquaintances to find people with more commonality of interest.')
