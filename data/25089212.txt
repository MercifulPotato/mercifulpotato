His fair, thorough, and well-researched explanations of this topic, and others, including his other recent video on just Starship vs Falcon 9 and Heavy, are real eye-openers.<p>And, as others here have said, yeah, hindsight is 20&#x2F;20, given that the SLS will almost certainly be a boondoggle, and barring any major failures on South Padre or something... inconceivable... its utility will likely be obviated before it even launches.<p>But, even as an avid newspace fan for the past 10+ years, I still have to say, it wasn&#x27;t terribly obvious Starship would launch on &quot;Elon Time&quot;... or &quot;Elon Time 2.0.&quot;, even only two years ago when Elon unveiled &quot;Dear Moon&quot;, he hadn&#x27;t even announced he&#x27;d be building Starship out of stainless steel. Yeah, and he builds them like water towers are built, in ring sections, not advanced composites. I shudder to think back even 10 years...<p>Like, since it&#x27;s pretty much fully reusable, yes, both stages, it could cost less than a million dollars to launch 150 metric tons to low earth orbit, which is pretty handy, because they&#x27;re using it to launch a network of thousands of communications satellites in ridiculously low orbits that&#x27;ll probably decay in only a few years and it&#x27;s looking like that&#x27;s actually gonna work really well. Yeah, way better than the one time Motorola tried it.<p>Oh, and if you wanted to get 150 metric tons to GTO, you just need a single orbital refueling launch. The moon, mars, just a couple more orbital pitstops.<p>Oh, and it uses a rocket engine design that&#x27;s never even gotten off the test stand the handful times it was looked into before.<p>Yeah, hindsight&#x27;s a... <i>cough</i><p>Oh, did I mention there&#x27;s a global pandemic? And President Trump got voted out of office. And Apple replaced all their Intel chips with the one they have in their iPads and smart phones, and it wound up being way better. Yeah, Intel&#x27;s in a pretty tough spot, actually. Oh, and try to find as many Pokemon cards as you can, some people have paid their mortgages off that way.<p>Yeah... Time travel&#x27;s gonna be hard to explain. Especially since nobody has DVD burners anymore.')
