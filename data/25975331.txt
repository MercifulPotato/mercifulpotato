When a user would pick up a file, then the program would have access to it, and only it. This apparently worked pretty great for programs which needed only one file. It probably would not have worked as great for programs which do more advanced stuff, like IDEs which need to be able to &quot;search in files&quot;. I think modern Androids can do the same sometimes?<p>But practically, as a person who runs sandboxed browser daily, it there is not &quot;a great deal of convenience and restrictions&quot;. Even before sandbox, I&#x27;d download files to default location and later move some of them elsewhere -- so this is not really changing. A requirement to place files which need to be uploaded into a shared folder is somewhat annoying, but I found out that I don&#x27;t upload that many files from browsers anyway.')
