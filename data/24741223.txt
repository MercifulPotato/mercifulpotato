Moving fluid that has been pumped into motion doesn’t normally have lower pressure than the ambient pressure (i.e. exit pressure). Wikipedia better explains it - they’re using a venturi pump - i.e. there is a construction in the tube that causes the fluid to have faster speed and lower pressure than the exit.')
