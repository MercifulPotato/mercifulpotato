Item(by='asdfasgasdgasdg', descendants=None, kids=[25236332], score=None, time=1606544961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25235493, text='&gt; I am not comfortable with promoting the framing of the article to an automatically established fact.<p>It is a fact claim that has yet to be disputed on the record by anyone who is in position to dispute it. All media outlets have their biases, but the most prominent ones tend not to make up easily refuted lies. In the claim you are referencing, they say three quarters of the black employees left over a six month period. If that&#x27;s a lie, Coinbase can simply say so. But they probably won&#x27;t because it is probably true.<p>The reasons why are more up to interpretation. Probably no way to get a firm answer on this since many of these people have signed NDAs or otherwise won&#x27;t talk on the record. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to claim, without evidence, that the NYT is lying about the proportion of black employees that left over the given time period.')
