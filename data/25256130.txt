Which are its shoddiness, its lack of administrative rigor, and so on.  These objections raise the question: can a welfare state be effective if it&#x27;s administered so poorly?  If the American government is sending money to Swedes, can we trust it to send money to &quot;people who need it&quot;?<p>Does Sweden send welfare checks to Americans who aren&#x27;t Swedish citizens?  If not, perhaps that partly explains why the Swedes are more comfortable with an expansive welfare state than Americans.')
