This is definitely a problem worth solving, but it&#x27;s also not a problem with GraphQL per se -- if you snapshot the usage profile of any high growth tech, you&#x27;ll see that at any given moment in time most of the people using it don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with it, that&#x27;s just what growth looks like.<p>My opinion here is somewhat unusual -- even with the GraphQL world, but I think you can get benefits from using it even at teams of just 1 engineer. But you _definitely_ don&#x27;t need to be anywhere close to FAANG scale for it to be worth the investment.')
