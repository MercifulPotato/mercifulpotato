We used XSLT to transform those into all kinds of things, including physical printed catalogues that would go in their stores. Obviously the XSLT didn&#x27;t actually print catalogues, but we did turn them into some format that I forget now (maybe PDF!) that we could just send straight to the printers.<p>It was pain and suffering developing these style sheets, but once done it worked like a charm.')
