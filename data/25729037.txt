You are correct that dealers have been unable to capitalize on the boom to realize big profits. There&#x27;s plenty of service business but the labor part isn&#x27;t really profitable (in my experience). The ability to sell parts with service can be profitable, but the distributors and manufacturers don&#x27;t have any parts to sell.<p>One positive is that those dealers drowning in older, unsold stock have been able to turn a lot of that into cash. That&#x27;s allowed a few of them to restore some financial health to their business and get out from under some of their debt to vendors and other creditors.<p>But even so, the bike business is so commoditized and the supply chain is so lose that bike shops (and manufacturers as well) have a pretty low ceiling of profitability. Even in the midst of a boom, the economics of the bike business restrict it to a lifestyle business at best. For some shops, this (likely temporary) boom probably presents the best window of opportunity to close their doors.')
