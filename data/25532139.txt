The final fight between Luke and Vader was masterfully executed and I cannot believe that people trash on this movie just because of ewoks and the dancing at the end.<p>Rouge one had the most one dimensional and forgettable villain ever. We like it because it was a very pretty and unusually unique and dark war movie. It&#x27;s not like the story or world building was up to the standards of the original trilogy...')
