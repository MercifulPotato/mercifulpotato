That&#x27;s why I want a CoC, so that the rules are open, known and overall transparent.<p>However, I&#x27;m afraid I fail to see why avoiding vague rules means that there should be no CoC at all. Isn&#x27;t having no written&#x2F;open rules the vaguest of all? Even if there are rules that only the moderators can see, how is that an improvement for the participants? They can&#x27;t know what is acceptable, so neither can the accused argue against an unfair response, nor can a potential victim demand enforcement.<p>And why not have more concrete rules? Surely, they cannot be complete and there will necessarily always be room for intepretation, but I think it is better the more concrete the rules are.')
