The system administrator had to manually enable sharing of their code pages between processes if you wanted that, but they were there.<p>- The indexed files mentioned above were called ISAM. There were also utilities to reindex them, and load and save them to flat files with fixed column sizes; since that was the common way data was held in those days, it would be like having automatic conversion to and from JSON, XML and CSV now. At extra cost, there was a SQL-like query language, just different enough from IBM&#x27;s SQL language not to get sued.<p>- The compilers were far ahead of Unix&#x27;s. The FORTRAN77 had a lot of IBM extensions, so scientists could just compile their existing programs. It also had keyword extensions to work with the ISAM files. Later on, a newer and better Pascal came out, as well as an Ada.<p>- Terminal handling was handled by the kernel, in contrast to Unix where applications went off and read &#x2F;etc&#x2F;termcap and the user had to babysit eval tset in their dotfiles. If a command line program was nonresponsive, the input was queued instead of being half-duplex interleaved with program output as Unix still does it.<p>- The symbolic debugger was far ahead of Unix&#x27;s adb.')
