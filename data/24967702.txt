Sure I could save money bringing all the servers back internally or using cheaper datacenters, but I worked at a company that worked that way. You end up doing a lot of busy work chucking bad drives, making tickets to the infrastructure group and waiting for the UNIX Admin group to add more storage to your server. WIth AWS I can reasonably assume I can spin up as many c5.12xlarge machines as I want, whenever I want with whatever extras I want. It costs an 1&#x2F;8 of a million a year, roughly. I see that 1&#x2F;8 of a million that cuts out a lot of busy work I don’t care about doing and an 1&#x2F;8 of a million that simplifies finding people to do the remaining work I don’t care about doing. The author says money wasted, I see it as money spent so i don’t have to care, and not caring is something I like; hell it isn’t even my money.')
