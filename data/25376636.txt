Item(by='hinkley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607624443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25375845, text='I&#x27;ve bought stuff from two companies I like but seldom patronize this year, and in both cases they started sending me ads every day (usually I say no thanks, so either they didn&#x27;t ask or they used dark patterns to get me to miss it).<p>Normally that&#x27;s okay (it&#x27;s not okay, but I roll my eyes and unsubscribe), but I&#x27;ve discovered that when my order is delayed, due to out of stock in one case, or Black Friday queuing in the other, I&#x27;m really not happy having them prompt me to buy more stuff when they haven&#x27;t given me the stuff I&#x27;ve already paid for. Each email title gives me a jolt of excitement thinking oh, they&#x27;ve finally shipped it! Nope, they want me to buy more stuff.<p>And with large departments running multiple campaigns at once, it&#x27;s not uncommon to get 5 emails in a week, all for different things, which to them makes sense but to me is the titular company acting like a hyperkinetic, needy friend. It is very much the same dynamic that results in every department of a company insisting that they are listed on the company home page, preferably at the top, a common trope for beleaguered UI designers to relate over beers. Not just because of Conway&#x27;s Law, but because of an internal perverse incentive structure to constantly draw attention to your part of the organization. Lookatmelookatmelookatme.<p>I find this whole pattern of behavior exceptionally unattractive in luxury brands, which I expect to be more cool and collected than this. Marketing in these cases is jeopardizing the &#x27;get them to come back&#x27; part of the equation.')
