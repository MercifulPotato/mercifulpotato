Years ago I tried canning italian plums. I didn&#x27;t think anyone else in my househoold will like them, so I decided to experiment.<p>I thought I&#x27;d try for a light syrup so I used 1&#x2F;3 of the sugar - some recipes in the 1939 Kerr canning cookbook that I have called for that, with paraffin on top. Plus, I decided to reuse some of the previously used lids, being too cheap that specific year. They turned out beautiful to look at and went into my pantry<p>Well, about a month later, I was awoken in the middle of the night by explosion from downstairs. 2 jars exploded, most of those jars were fermenting, some had really nasty organic growth scum on it, and the cleanup was quite terrible. I think it was the lack of sugar, not the lids, but lid reuse didn&#x27;t help.<p>Key takeaway - always use the right amount of sugar (1:1, even if it seems like you&#x27;re pouring white death on), and never reuse lids.')
