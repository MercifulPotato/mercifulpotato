The turbines are designed to ramp up gently, work fully loaded and transfer the energy from the hot side to the liquid propellants; the power density is enormous, 100.000 horsepower in the space of a truck engine 100 less powerful. Without an energy sink this immense power is directed at the turbine itself, which spins out of control and will dismantle or shatter when hitting liquid again.<p>Your engine is now full of solid projectiles that take out other parts, fuel lines and injectors, damage film cooling nozzles and coolant canals, and in general transform your precision machine into a smoldering pile of gunk.')
