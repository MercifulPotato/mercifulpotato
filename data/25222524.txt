They thought that iPads would replace computers for most people, but 10 years later it&#x27;s clear that Apple&#x27;s strict control over the iPad will never allow it to be as capable as a laptop.<p>But the biggest mistake Apple made over the last ten years is that they have been holding the Mac back to differentiate it from the iPad.<p>I would love to have always on 4G in my Macbook. I would love to have a touch screen and pen input on my Mac. I don&#x27;t want to buy an iPad so I can draw on PDFs, I just want to do that on my Mac.<p>Microsoft hit it out of the park with their Surface line. I think they made the right call, by understanding that people don&#x27;t want app consoles. People want the power of a desktop, with all the great new tech from mobile devices, like touch screens and 4G.<p>The Surface Studio is what the iMac should have been. It&#x27;s weird to have graphic designers, once Apple&#x27;s core audience, lusting after a Microsoft computer. Apple&#x27;s reluctance to add touch screens to the Mac is really holding them back. Once you&#x27;ve used a surface device with a pen, you really start wondering why you can&#x27;t draw on the screen of your Macbook.<p>My guess is that Apple realized their mistake about a year ago, and they&#x27;ve started on getting iPhone&#x2F;iPad tech back in to the Mac. They started with the processor, and the next step is adding touch displays and 4G &#x2F; 5G to the Mac. Big Sur is obviously already optimized for touch, and I&#x27;m excited to see what the Mac will become if Apple allows it to compete with the iPad.')
