But if any of those were from my wife (who was pregnant at the time) it would vibrate longer and flash for 20 seconds.<p>It was so simple to feel and glance and get the info I needed - no need to squint and try read. It annoys me in meetings when people think they are being subtle reading a full notification from the apple watch or similar. If it is important just get your phone out it will be quicker to read and reply.')
