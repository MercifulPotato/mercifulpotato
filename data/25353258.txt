Bulletproof cars, Air Force One, a gang of bodyguards who are trained to put themselves between you and the bullet.  Sometimes they literally block streets and your right to peacefully move or assemble.  Your tax dollars at work.<p>Why such unfairness?<p>Because the world is full of bad actors and crazies dreaming of killing the POTUS, and it pays off in the long run to not have the president killed off in that fashion.<p>It&#x27;s not exactly black and white.')
