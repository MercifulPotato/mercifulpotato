If people want it, they&#x27;ll come asking you to take their money - if their response is &quot;meh, I&#x27;d try it for free&quot; then I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s misleading to tell that they want it, the most you could say is that they are interested.  I mean, he demoed this stuff to people and none of them seemed to say &quot;wait, can you give me access to this right now? Pretty please, I&#x27;ll be your pilot test user, but I want to have this?&quot; - I can&#x27;t see any evidence that would justify the author claims &quot;Consumers wanted it, doctors wanted it&quot;. The doctors called it &quot;What a fun project!&quot;, the doctors called it &quot;useful&quot;, but none of them wanted it the way they might want a cup of coffee i.e. being willing to give something at all to get the thing they want.<p>[1] the other limitation is whether they can afford to pay you despite wanting it; there are products&#x2F;markets where the target audience is eager to pay but their collective budget is too small for the scale you need.')
