It seems to me that &quot;feminism&quot;, as you put it, may have only been allowed to win, because it was desirable economically.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where the disagreement is there. Yes, one of the reasons women entered the workforce was the increase in income for two-earner households.<p>The point is that both having two earners per household and having good birth rates are beneficial to society as a whole, but we don&#x27;t yet have a system where both are compatible; we just exchanged one for the other, as the negative effects of low birth rates aren&#x27;t immediate.<p>The economic incentive to not have kids is where the problem lies, and it&#x27;s what needs to be tackled. Flexible schedules, paid paternal&#x2F;maternal leave, free education&#x2F;healthcare, access to affordable housing for young couples... There is no silver bullet, it&#x27;s a sea of deal breakers that need to be addressed individually.')
