I actually don&#x27;t think organic is as good as whatever natural methods were used. I would prefer wild or food grown on less &#x27;managed&#x27; land - that would be the gold standard for me.<p>Then you&#x27;d starve on your golden standard, and probably revert to the 30 year life expectancy most of Humanity had prior to the advent of agriculture. Collectively as a Species I don&#x27;t think there is a single thing, maybe making potable water widely available and vaccinations, that has contributed to the advent of Modern Society more than agriculture.<p>Foraging maybe a cute thing for the silver spoon crowds made popular by the guys at Noma&#x2F;Rene Redzepi (I personally met some of the creative Team when they ate at our restaurant last year) but not only would it never scale, but you&#x27;d be screwed for anything to eat for 3-5 months out of the year in most of the World. And with the impact of climate change I doubt you&#x27;d last very long.<p>Organic isn&#x27;t a panacea, its a re-framing of the relationship one has with their food and by extension ourselves as so many diseases are borne from what has been a literally toxic and hostile relationship.<p>I hope we get to see an analysis of Global COVID deaths in relation to heart disease, diabetes as well as a study of them as contributors to those deaths considered COVID related.')
