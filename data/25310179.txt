If anything, the fact that you don&#x27;t posit magically violating pretty much every conservation law in the history of physics (Copenhagen interpretation&#x2F;collapse postulate) or magically duplicating the entire universe (Many worlds interpretation), arguably puts you ahead of most <i>actual</i> quantum physicists (albeit, one hopes, more on the explanation front than the understanding one), although my estimation of that relative to the latter might just be a artifact having a easier time imputing metaphorical status to &quot;illusion&quot; than to &quot;world&quot;. (Copenhagen gets no such excuse, though, so you&#x27;re still ahead of a <i>plurality</i> of actual quantum physicists.)')
