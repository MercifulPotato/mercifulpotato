For me, my insomnia manifests with a difficulty in falling asleep. Completely sleepless nights are not uncommon. 2-4 hours of waiting to fall asleep was the norm.  2-5mg edible thc about 2 hours before bed and 0.5 mg melatonin 20 minutes before bedtime and I am able to quiet the mind and drift off to sleep on about 20 minutes. Keeping the dose low means you don’t get high, (but you still might get some munchies and enjoy some music a bit more than being completely sober) and also means there is no morning hangover.')
