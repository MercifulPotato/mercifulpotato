The blue light they provided was noted as being &quot;similar to a moonless night&quot;, and I&#x27;d bet that it&#x27;s a blue kind of light you get under starlight.<p>Were you there tho? How can you substantiate that they hunted in the way you say? In my experience, humans have very good sight on a moonless night, a full moon is basically daylight and provides no cover, so I think your assertion is false, and you need to spend some time outdoors on moonless nights.')
