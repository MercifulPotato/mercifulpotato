Everything else is pretty much slightly improved current tech (transparent smartphones, better medical tech, practical implants, advanced life support systems).<p>One could even say some things aere kess advanced than one would expect - quite a few autonomous weapons, big rotating space colonies (oneil island 3, standfor torus, clarke wheel, etc) or worldhouses. Also no laser&#x2F;gracer&#x2F;xaser weapons or long range kinetic energy weapons. And no nuclear bomb pumped lasers.')
