With a docker-based CI system, you are forced to have everything specified in code, making it much more maintainable.<p>Additionally, hosted CI allows me to do 100 parallel builds on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Perhaps this is a niche use case, but I saved a lot of time and reduced build times by an order of magnitude by switching from self-hosted CI on Windows and MacOS to a hosted solution.')
