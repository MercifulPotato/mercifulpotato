Definitely recycles a lot of electronics in a good way. On the GPIO pins I would definitely replace the connector! I can tell you from experience that even if the pins straighten out, some random plugging&#x2F;unplugging later and the pin will break off and the next person will end up replacing the connector. This is much easier if you have a setup already for doing the work.<p>This is also a really great way to &quot;pay yourself&quot; to learn to do rework. Buying 200 at £61 and selling the fully restored ones (which appears to &gt; 100) at £9 is at least £900 revenue from the experience. Granted, since you are &quot;learning&quot; that would be slow work at first, but later it would become fairly routine. So something someone in high school could easily do.')
