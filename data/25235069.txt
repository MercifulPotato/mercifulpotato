Coinbase has issued a rebuttal refuting this article. (the refutation is not on the front page, I note) There is no reasonable way for anyone to discern who is &quot;right&quot; in this particular argument based on the data presented.<p>People who see systemic racism everywhere will undoubtedly side with the NYT plaintiffs.  People who are skeptical of the social justice narrative being shoe-horned in to every possible corner will side with Coinbase.<p>The &quot;white patriarchy&quot; will be called out and there will be tptacek and others falling on their white male swords to gain some woke cred and signal their purity.<p>Let&#x27;s stop reading and commenting on this kind of article eh?')
