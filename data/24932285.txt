I love attending conferences just to hear from everyone. This is why inclusivity matters to me- it welcomes a broader slice of people. And virtual conferences have the potential to bring even more people together (world-wide populations that cannot travel internationally, people who cannot travel for a week at a time, etc). I also want to hear people talk honestly and CoC violations like this worry me.<p>The keynote speakers were all great and I&#x27;m excited for them to be posted live, I thought they were supposed to be available at the end of the week.<p>Jeremy&#x27;s was a different keynote than the others- more technically oriented, but nothing struck me at the time as being a CoC violation. I could easily have missed something, clarity from NumFOCUS would be greatly appreciated here if only for future speakers.<p>This was my first virtual conference but the organizers&#x27; overabundance of caution detracted from the experience in some ways- the talks were all in WebEx rooms where only the presenters were visible and the chat messages could only be seen by the presenters. The effect of this was that it felt like you were in an empty room. The explanation for this setup was to prevent trolling, but this was quite a small conference and it seemed to really cut down on attendee chatter.')
