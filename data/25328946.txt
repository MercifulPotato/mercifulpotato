I&#x27;ve seen so many of these &quot;self-hosted live video streaming&quot; sites show up here and this is the first one that show the actual backend code.  Usually they&#x27;re just web frontends to some video streaming website.\nQuestions:<p>-[0] How widely deployed is this stack (specifically nginx rtmp&#x2F;vod) around the live-streaming industry?<p>-[1] You listed under the Feature that it support &quot;Pay-per-view&quot; and &quot;Pay-per-minute&quot; -- how exactly is that enforced if the playback is just regular HLS? (Are you checking every single request for a .TS segment in Django?)<p>-[2] VOD&#x2F;Recording is really cool but has enormous storage costs.  How does BoltStream handle the long-term storage of streams?<p>Edit: re [1]<p>It looks like there&#x27;s a somewhat sophisticated mechanism [here](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benwilber&#x2F;boltstream&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;ansible&#x2F;roles&#x2F;nginx&#x2F;files&#x2F;nginx.conf#L54" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benwilber&#x2F;boltstream&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;ansible&#x2F;...</a>) that&#x27;s just checking the requests for the encryption key instead of every single request for the MPEG-TS segment.<p>This is awesome though.  Thanks for sharing it!')
