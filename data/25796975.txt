(Well, its not s tough, just not a direct nor free transition.)  The default android claendar app doesn&#x27;t connect to a calendar via, say, nextcloud (calDav if i recall correctly)...One has to actually get&#x2F;use a different app. I think the one that most folks recommmend for nextcloud is not free.  (It is not expensive, so that is not the challenge.)  Its fine for me since i am moving away from G apps...but my partner, she is meh-ok with some of their default apps...like the default android calendar app, though she would like to connect that app to our nextcloud cal...Again, nothing major, but just all these little annoyances that exhibit the super tight integration that was built into android with G services. Anyway, yeah calendar is annoying to ween off from G. Yuck!')
