They chose to immigrate to the US and become americans. They didn&#x27;t choose to be canadians. The only reason anyone knows about them is because of what they achieved in america as americans. They couldn&#x27;t choose where they were born, but they could choose where they lived and died. Both chose america.<p>&gt; One of the favorite pastimes Canadians have is that of pointing out Canadians whom people think are Americans.<p>Isn&#x27;t it more like canadians pointing out the people who left canada to become americans?   Isn&#x27;t it rather pointing out canada as a failure and america as a success?')
