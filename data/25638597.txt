Item(by='qeternity', descendants=None, kids=[25639587], score=None, time=1609796667, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25638421, text='&gt; Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong<p>...<p>&gt; I realize this might come close to violating (or even cross the line of) HN guidelines, but that&#x27;s how I see it.<p>Ok, you&#x27;re wrong. And worst of all, you&#x27;ve decided that anyone who doesn&#x27;t share your exact opinion is insane. No wonder you&#x27;ve got it so wrong, you&#x27;ve cut yourself off from any real discussion.<p>What I argued was that lockdowns don&#x27;t work. We have done serious lockdowns across the world, and in the best case all the do is buy a little time. In the worst case, they do nothing. The US printed $4T in 2020...do you really not believe that with that money, we could have a devised a better approach that put tremendous resources into isolating the vulnerable population and accepting the stunningly low risk to the rest of the population?<p>It&#x27;s amazing to me that people on HN, a site dedicated to the constant advancement of the human condition, looks at a failed strategy concocted during panic and says &quot;yeah, that&#x27;s as good as it gets and can&#x27;t be improved&quot;.<p>Jesus, when it comes to covid all I hear are people asking for faster horses.')
