We live in a PRNG.<p>Edit: OOh I have an idea. What if the quantum effect is deterministic but appears random we experience are in fact ripple effects from the previous universes? Has anyone ever tried to measure quantum behavior in multiple simultaneous experiments in a kind of geometrical matrix system to see if there are shapes of correlation?')
