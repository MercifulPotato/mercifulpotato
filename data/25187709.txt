And I think this was a multi-arm study, they&#x27;re testing two variables across two population groups - here&#x27;s the study paperwork:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clinicaltrials.gov&#x2F;ct2&#x2F;show&#x2F;NCT04368728" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clinicaltrials.gov&#x2F;ct2&#x2F;show&#x2F;NCT04368728</a><p>Everybody in all arms (groups) gets a jab, twice, but what exactly what is in the needle varies. The study paperwork doesn&#x27;t say which placebo was used in this trial (the participants would definitely have been told), sometimes vaccine studies use a vaccine for something else that you didn&#x27;t need but is presumably harmless (e.g. think of vaccines you take when going somewhere a bit dubious on holiday). Other times they just use saline. Some other groups got higher doses of vaccine.<p>Anyway, since everybody got stabbed, nobody (as much as possible not even the people giving you a jab) know what&#x27;s in the needle - everybody gets assessed for side effects. One of the very revealing things about all these studies is how many side effects you get for injecting people with saline. Sore arm makes some sense at least, somebody stuck a  tiny needle in your arm - but you&#x27;ll get headaches, dizziness, flu symptoms even. The mind is powerful.')
