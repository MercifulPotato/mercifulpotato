Terraform is declarative rather than procedural like Chef and that&#x27;s far preferred when trying to define what you have. Terraform &amp; Ansible don&#x27;t require me to run a master server or have agents on every machine either.<p>Use tools where they&#x27;re strongest.<p>We used to use Chef years ago and replaced it with Ansible and Terraform and have zero regrets at 10^4 nodes. We also use Terraform for managing CloudFlare and all sorts of other providers. It has been a dream.<p>Ansible does less and less work as time goes on for us and as we&#x27;ve moved to semi-immutable infrastructure.  If we need to change something about a system, we&#x27;d rather replace it.')
