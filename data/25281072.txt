Turns out trying this with an addictive personality isn&#x27;t the greatest idea â€“ appreciate the suggestion though!<p>Also, the balaclava is interesting: I can imagine the benefit is almost similar to that people get from using a gravity blanket. The weight and &quot;hugging&quot; effect might be very comforting.<p>Really sorry to hear about the sleep apnea; that&#x27;s an awful problem to deal with. Hope you&#x27;re able to find a treatment which works for you.')
