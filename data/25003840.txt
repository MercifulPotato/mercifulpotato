For people at the bottom of the American income inequality pyramid, getting documentation might be something they can&#x27;t afford, in terms of the time off work, taxi fares, and the costs of possible legal assistance.<p>Seems to me the <i>good faith</i> solution is just to make sure everyone can get identification easily, but the foundational issue is that voter ID requirements combined with hard-to-get documentation is a bad faith policy choice intended to keep poorer people from voting. Fix the &#x27;bad faith&#x27; problem and everything else is trivial to put into place.')
