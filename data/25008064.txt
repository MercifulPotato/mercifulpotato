Any customer who complained about access was told support had reset their password just now to test123 but in reality every customer&#x27;s password had been reset to that.<p>- Another scenario where some QA values got ran on a production environment and some settings and configs had to be manually restored as it was a third party service it got applied against. Halted nearly whole company.<p>- Bug miscalculates how to charge users and basically drains most people&#x27;s bank accounts.<p>- Accidental DNS rebinding exposing CDN traffic to another company and took them down.<p>- Dev mistake bypassing a endpoints on the CDN for caching and throttling rules. Nearly $1M mistake before anyone even noticed.<p>- Accidentally using another S3 bucket template for another S3 bucket and not noticing it had versioning on. Program that dumped it&#x27;s state for restoring to this versioning bucket had +450TB of state versioned. It didn&#x27;t care about the history of state just the present state for restoring. Noticed only by mistake when cleaning up somethings.<p>And many other stories, things happen, you learn, you improve and it is really a risk vs reward calculation on the business side.')
