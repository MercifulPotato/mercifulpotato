It&#x27;s essentially Make + Docker. You define whatever targets you want (build, test, lint, etc.) and the dependencies between them in a YAML file, and Toast runs them in Docker containers. You can run your jobs on any machine that has Dockerâ€”including CI systems like Travis and GitHub Actions. You aren&#x27;t locked into any CI system, and you can also run your jobs locally.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stepchowfun&#x2F;toast" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stepchowfun&#x2F;toast</a>')
