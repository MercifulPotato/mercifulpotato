The blockchain works as a blockchain is a peer-to-peer based topology that consists of ledger technology. This stores the data allows globally on thousands of servers and accesses them in near-real-time (IoT-technology). This fragmentation is the crucial distinction that makes it difficult for one user to control the network. This sophisticated technology has been developed to avoid any kind of identity falsification.\nNowadays, the safety of IoT-devices has been a rising question mark due to the pandemic of COVID-19. Blockchain technology is one of the increasing standards for verification, security, data sharing, and management of cross border transaction. \nIn laboratories, the topics of blockchain technology have also been increasing a lot when it comes to the safety of stored data. Some laboratory software solutions, like LIMS can be a solution to this problem. For example, [FP]-LIMS, designed by the German company for software development Fink &amp; Partner GmbH, belongs to the upcoming standards for blockchain technology and data integrity. The software engineers at Fink &amp; Partnerâ€™s are developing an interface to store the laboratory data into the blockchain as a hash through the standard tools Hyperledger Indy and Aries.')
