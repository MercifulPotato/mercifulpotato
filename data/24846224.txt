A mention of const pointer practically always means a pointer-to-const: a pointer you can&#x27;t write through. Often you can still &quot;re-bind&quot; such pointer to another object â€“ in both ways the polar opposite of JS const.<p>Of course, in C++ there are const references as well, and in this case const also means you can&#x27;t modify the referenced object (in any case in C++ you can never re-bind a reference).')
