Decriminalization isn&#x27;t about ignoring the issue, it&#x27;s about getting these people out of the criminal justice system. What you are advocating for, to be implemented successfully, would require a reform of the entire police force to treat these people as patients instead of criminals. (I&#x27;m focusing on America here, in your country the police may be less hostile, especially to drug users.)<p>The eventual path that is being set, for which decriminalization would be a first step would then to have hospitals&#x2F;health care provide save alternatives to buying hard drugs&#x2F;needles on the street, which you can then check them into and begin the rehab process there. Essentially forcing people to rehab under threat of punishment isn&#x27;t successful, and the American police force has spent the last 40 years treating drug users as criminals. Depending on the justice system isn&#x27;t likely to work.')
