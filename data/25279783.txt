Commands which have worked for months suddenly stop working.<p>This is my biggest gripe. Whatever magic voodoo ML they use is inconsistent, and it&#x27;s not clear what level of abstraction this inconsistency is happening in.<p>What I want is the reliability of Google Assistant&#x27;s speech to text parsing, combined with a firm, customizable interface.
