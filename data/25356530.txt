Linux and macOS takes the helm for the most Emacs users here. Second most surprising stuff was that the number of people using the Spacemacs configuration was much lower than I expected to it to be as imo it&#x27;s the most polished Emacs experience out there. Also, the results from the question of what was your editor prior to using Emacs caught me off guard as I personally switched from VSCode to Emacs so I thought the majority would be so as well, but it turns out most people actually switched from Vim! That makes me think that the Emacs demographics seems to consist mostly of old-timers who have been programming quite before the appearance of modern hand-holding editors like VSCode or Sublime Text.<p>On a side note, the Emacs community really needs a proper Discourse forum and a Matrix chat channel. Tbh, the r&#x2F;emacs subreddit is the only Emacs &#x27;forum&#x27; I know of. I don&#x27;t hate Reddit but I&#x27;d rather discuss about Emacs somewhere else.')
