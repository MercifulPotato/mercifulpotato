Take vertical centring, for example.  The immediate assumption is that it’s easy; you just find the mid-way point between the top and bottom.  But the top and bottom of <i>what</i>?  The web is a document-based system, with text flowing from top to bottom.  The centre in this context is not the centre of the window, but the centre of the document.<p>Okay, so let’s find the mid-way point between the top and the bottom of the document.  The top is easy, it’s zero.  So where’s the bottom?  Well to find that, you need to know how tall the document is.  How do we do that?  Well, the height of the document is defined by the height of all of its contents.  So let’s render its contents and find the height.  But wait – the thing we are trying to render in the centre is part of the contents, so we’ve got ourselves into an infinite loop.<p>There are various solutions to this – hard-code the height of the document (to what?); take the thing being centred out of consideration when rendering the rest of the document (and now it can’t affect &#x2F; be affected by the rest of the contents), etc.  But which solution is best depends upon the context – and this is how you end up with complexity.  It’s easy to say “just put it in the centre”, but it’s not as easy to figure out what that means exactly or which solution is best for doing so.<p>&gt; Is this why the web is less successful than it might be?<p>The web is one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilisation.  It seems quite odd to talk about it as if it were a flop because you have to think for a moment before centring something.')
