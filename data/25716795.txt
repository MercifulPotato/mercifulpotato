I have zero rational evidence to support these positions, and I&#x27;d be unable in the face of serious scrutiny to even try to support these.<p>Science is a great example of a method which actually works. The whole, entire point of the scientific method is that it is based around being right <i>until it is proved wrong</i>. Every single serious academic ever knows this: they publish a paper with a theory, and they pretty much literally ask their community to shoot it down. Sometimes the theories remain for decades, sometimes they&#x27;re found to be wrong immediately, and then a new paper and theory is published which sets out the latest position, there again until it is proved wrong.<p>The interesting thing in almost all the examples being pored over right now - Twitter and Trump, Parler, Voat - is that the individuals concerned are actually all involved in an echo chamber which self-supports. They are completely unable to rationalise, and if you ever tried jumping onto any of these streams or platforms and providing an alternative point of view then you&#x27;ll see exactly what I mean by this - you&#x27;re almost immediately flamed out of the room. The irony here - that these &quot;free speech&quot; platforms are the least able to support any kind of dissenting opinion - is intense.<p>Ultimately, the person claiming the primacy of &quot;free speech&quot; needs to accept that this freedom has a price: they need to be able to defend their position, and accept that others have alternative positions, and accept that even <i>if</i> their position is &quot;true&quot; now, it may not be &quot;true&quot; when further evidence emerges. This is rarely, I would suggest never, the case in the examples provided here.<p>In terms of this specific thread: I don&#x27;t see Parler as a &quot;platform of free speech&quot;. I see it as &quot;a self-supporting echo chamber of individuals who are completely against free speech&quot;.')
