Privacy-aware users are the kind of users we enjoy serving. Asking questions is always a good idea.<p>As we’ve stated, System1 is interested in Startpage’s anonymous contextual advertising revenue, not in our data. Mainly because we don’t store any.<p>Even if they wanted to change our privacy policies, it wouldn’t be possible. Our co-owners and Surfboard Holding BV still have authority in our company. Our infrastructure is all in the European Union, where the strict GDPR legislation applies and the US Cloud law doesn’t.<p>Maintaining user privacy is our reason for being. We thank you for your curiosity and your vigilance. We hope you continue to ask questions and enjoy Startpage. We are gladly answering all your questions.')
