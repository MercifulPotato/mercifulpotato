Over a hundred years and we still don&#x27;t have a good understanding of dark matter.<p>A red flag to me is how there doesn&#x27;t seem to be large amounts of dark matter in areas closest to us where we can see best. It&#x27;s all this far off enigma. And at least originally the theory existed to explain why the laws of gravitation didn&#x27;t line up with visual evidence.<p>To me &quot;half the matter is invisible&quot; is just as outlandish as &quot;maybe our math is wrong about gravitation&quot;. I don&#x27;t think enough of the community questions the dark matter theory.')
