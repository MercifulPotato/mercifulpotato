The Hedge funds loses their bets, and some retail investors make ton of money of it. This will happen if when the retail investors &quot;cash out&quot;, all the money is coming from the shorters being forced to buy it back at the inflated prices.<p>2. The shorters will be done liquidating their loss, and now more &quot;little guys&quot; will buy the now inflated stock from the earlier retail investors at an inflated price wanting to &quot;get in&quot; on the action. This will result is something more akin to a pyramid scheme and get rich quick scheme.<p>Edit: Well there&#x27;s a 3rd way, though seems less likely to me, which is that the new surge in stock price allows GameStop leverage to somehow become a massively profitable company that actually meets and surpassed the now &quot;apparently&quot; inflated stock price. In which case, all of the &quot;little guys&quot; will win and only the shorters will lose. I guess this is the best case scenario.')
