It’s normal to see about 4-5 hours of productive work in an 8 hour workday. It’s difficult to log more than 5 hours of screen-on time due to meetings, conversations, phone calls, bathroom breaks, lunch, and so on.<p>&gt; I have max. 60% of &quot;productive&quot; time, which means that 60% of time apps like IDE are open. The rest goes to random stuff, like messaging&#x2F;youtube etc.<p>I’ve learned that it’s more important to track time spent in time wasters like YouTube or HN than it is to track productive time. The time wasters can really add up if you’re not careful. Taking breaks and relaxing is fine, but losing multiple hours in the middle of every workday to YouTube is a problem. It’s easy to lose an entire workday each week to wasted time online if you’re not careful. Only 96 minutes per day adds up to an entire lost day each week.<p>In a non-office environment (freelance consulting) I frequently put in 5-10 productive hours per day. It doesn’t come easy at first, but with training anyone can ramp up to similar levels. The key is to realize that it’s an acquired and trained skill, not some innate limitation of our genetics or neurochemistry. Claims that people can only focus for N hours per day should be viewed like claims that people can’t run faster than 8 minute miles. You can change your focus habits if you’re motivated to do so and willing to put in the work.')
