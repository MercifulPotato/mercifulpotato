The simplest option is to use containerd, as the runtime. Installing docker will also install containerd (because docker uses it internally), so nothing much needs to change except a configuration option. docker and k8s can run side by side sharing the same containerd instance, in case you need to do something like build containers inside your k8s cluster.<p>You lose out on things that require access to the docker daemon socket, but ideally any such software should be replaced with something that talks with the kubernetes API instead. (exception is building containers in cluster. If you need that, run docker side by side with the kubelet, or use buildkit with containerd integration). You also lose the ability to interact with containers with the docker cli tool. Use crictl instead, which has most of the same commands, but also includes certain k8s relevant information in output tables.')
