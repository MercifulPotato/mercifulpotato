Stuff like CPU, Network, Memory utilization, is this process running, etc.<p>It&#x27;s used to set alarms that will go off if &quot;process XYZ is not running on server 123&quot; or &quot;CPU Utilization is over 95% for 15 minutes on server 456&quot; that kind of thing, as well as dashboards.<p>The special thing about Solarwinds is that it&#x27;s agentless, meaning you don&#x27;t have to install an agent on the boxes you want to monitor, I think it uses ICMP to ping the instances you&#x27;re monitoring.<p>It&#x27;s terrible software (compared to say, Datadog) and I&#x27;ve been saying I want to short it for a year.  Obviously I should have put my money where my mouth was.')
