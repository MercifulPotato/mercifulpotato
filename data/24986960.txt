You’re looking to achieve a common goal.”<p>Here&#x27;s a crazy idea: IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW YOU MEET PEOPLE! If both are willing, then that&#x27;s that! It sounds like they are ready to raise a family and commit because literally YOLO. There are plenty of people who are old and haven&#x27;t found someone they organically vibe with. In my opinion, this isn&#x27;t any different than an arranged marriage, so I feel like your fear&#x2F;discomfort makes little sense here.')
