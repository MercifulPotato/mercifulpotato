Tim Hortons got bought out by BK, North got bought out by Google. When I first started, this notable design company behind Medium, Teehan+Lax got bought out by Facebook.<p>Basically this. US tech companies are sitting on such stacks of cash seeking for avenues to expand in line with the others that most Canadian or European companies that might make it big and join them just get bought out. \nThe alternative is not selling out and making that money in the long term which doesn&#x27;t seem likely when instead of buying in that big company just forces itself into the market with it&#x27;s cash and clout to destroy your margins.\nOh and then there&#x27;s the success-stories that don&#x27;t get bought out but just move to san francisco for the infrastructure or money and partnerships like gitlab, etc\nWithout some kind of protectionism on this front it won&#x27;t change either.')
