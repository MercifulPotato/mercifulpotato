The fact that making the claims is always less work than debunking them already has the balance of power way off into the claimant end. So anyone moderating anything is going to turn to heuristics; you can see which topics tend to attract people acting in bad faith and at the very least have extra standards on.  I&#x27;ll go back to trans people since Ive personally got the most experience debunking bigotry in that arena,  what are the odds that some random user on an unrelated forum has independently researched something that&#x27;s going to completely flip established science on its head? It&#x27;s fairly low, and allowing argument just creates a false debate. To use examples I would <i>hope</i> get everyone on board, think flat earthers.  There&#x27;s no version of that discussion that doesn&#x27;t end with &quot;here are all the data suggesting a round earth + things you can literally do yourself with a bit of math and a car&quot; vs &quot;that&#x27;s just what the &lt;insert boogieman that&#x27;s a thin metaphor for marginalized group&gt; want you to think&quot;.  Since you know how it ends, just ban it to start.<p>Hell you can see the consequences of not holding a firm line on these sorts of things in this thread. There are people literally &quot;just asking questions&quot; about &quot;men in women&#x27;s sports&quot; as an example of the &quot;terrible reddit censorship&quot;;  as if it&#x27;s not <i>transparently</i> obvious what they&#x27;re doing.<p>So you have to ask yourself, even if you could reliably id anyone who wanted to argue in good faith (i&#x27;d argue this is considerably harder than you&#x27;d think though that&#x27;s more of a gut feeling &#x2F;shrug), if their goals are &quot;convince the world that &lt;race, gender, nationality, sexuality&gt; is causing harm&quot; what is the value of giving that a platform even if you&#x27;re willing to expend the emotional energy to debunk it (over and over and over and over because even if you have some kind of metric, your users don&#x27;t and if allowed someone always feeds the trolls).')
