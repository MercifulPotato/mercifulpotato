California is silly expensive, but comes with a lot of social problems. New York is the same to a large degree. The midwest is cheap, but opportunity is more scarce. Most places in Europe just don&#x27;t pay well, charge way too much tax, and then don&#x27;t provide nearly the quality of social service many Americans believe they do.<p>Nevada is the middle ground of a lot of these places. You have mountains if you like snow, you don&#x27;t have to deal with snow (ever) if you don&#x27;t want to. You have pretty good infrastructure if you want to work remotely, you can fly to LA in 45 minutes if you have to for work. (I&#x27;m convinced there are instances where it&#x27;s faster to commute from Las Vegas to LA than from...outside of LA to LA). Typical commute time in Las Vegas is probably on the order of 15-20 minutes. Under normal traffic conditions you can make it from one end of the city to the other in 45 minutes or less.<p>Socially, there&#x27;s less politics here in general. Less of the NIMBY folks pushing for poor policy and zoning. Less protesting&#x2F;rioting&#x2F;looting. If I had to guess, the average person here owns a firearm, but nobody ever really seems to notice or care. Crime is comparable to California overall but there&#x27;s more places in LA that I would put on my &quot;never go to&quot; list than in Vegas. And, while we definitely have homelessness, it&#x27;s substantially less than when I was recently in LA.<p>With all of that having been said I think the most important thing is cost. My fiance, at 22 (and with no college degree) makes 17&#x2F;hr doing admin work for a local construction company. She just <i>bought her own house</i> and is living comfortably. She did that without any financial assistance from me, or her parents, because it wasn&#x27;t necessary. Her mortgage is under 1k&#x2F;m for 1800(ish?) square feet of a reasonably modern house.')
