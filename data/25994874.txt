I too am an Obsidian user which is really nice for technical documentation. I have to be careful that I don’t confuse the audience: those who want to collect thoughts for writing; and those who organise notes for research (i.e. technical knowledge). I actually do both and there are different needs in each.<p>The only things on your list that I hadn’t considered was latex equations and whether I should offer different design customisations of the cards.<p>I’m glad you picked up on the index card size default. I will offer both full-page notes as well, but there’s another reason why I want them as card sized—so you can lay them out on a virtual workspace to help answer questions from your slip box.<p>Honestly, there’s too many ideas that I can’t do everything. But it’s sure fun working on it and gradually making it better each release.')
