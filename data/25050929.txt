(FWIW I use their hardware because IMHO it sucks less than the alternatives; I&#x27;m no special fan).<p>Actually this part I agree with 100%:<p>&gt; It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re still focused on hardware development and the software is just things users want to do so let&#x27;s have an app only as needed to retain users, ish.<p>And I assume this hardware focus is why their subscription options have been a mixture of mediocre and worthless.<p>But this point, while a common trope (and even with a name, &quot;sherlocked&quot;), I have&#x27;t really seen it much in practice, especially since OS X rolled around:<p>&gt; It really seems like they&#x27;re happy to let someone get popular to identify the niche that needs to be filled, roll an MVP to cover it, and kick out the originators with no real excuses.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen much evidence of this in the real world.   Even in the case of the Sherlock app they made a more powerful tool and still left room for third parties.  They don&#x27;t make much on their own software and their MVPs really are basic.<p>Apart from a few marquee apps in the photo&#x2F;video space they don&#x27;t really have a big app effort as far as I can tell from outside.  I don&#x27;t know how good those apps are either.')
