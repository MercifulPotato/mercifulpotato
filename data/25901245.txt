They are not interested in completing with ICE cars by selling cheap ICE cars, it is all about upping the game to a better product that is BEV.<p>Europe had better watch out.<p>The US can defend their market with tariffs so everyone there drives a truck. But the longer they do that then the more out of touch they will become. It is going to be fun to see how this works out.<p>Tesla make great products but they are not a great market fit for Europe. There&#x27;s so much scope for innovation but even now the Europe BEV efforts are ICE cars with the engine swapped out, therefore not cool.')
