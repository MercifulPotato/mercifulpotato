It was just too many the past month or so - I{ hate when companies come off that desperate - and I never know who to blame.<p>It&#x27;s funny that in Music City, the Guitar Center is one of the few places to actually go and get a selection of gear. I know there are a couple of small places and of course pawn shops and one used gear place that&#x27;s been around a while, but we have lost places over the years that used to offer equipment and lighting. Guitar Center has been the go-to place for me and many others for years - glad their newish store opened when and where it did.<p>If they close that store, we&#x27;ll need something new to pop in and fill the void for sure.')
