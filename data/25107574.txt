There are apparently studies showing that estimates longer than that tend to have much larger errors.  So if it was going to be longer, we had to break it up into pieces until each piece was smaller than three weeks.<p>That could get tedious.  On the other hand, we did do a lot better than normal at hitting our dates.<p>(I believe this shorter-than-three-weeks idea came from Extreme Programming, but I&#x27;m not quite certain of that.)')
