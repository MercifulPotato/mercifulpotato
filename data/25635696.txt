I like the 1 main discord account but I wish I could have 1 &quot;identity&quot; per-server as well. I don&#x27;t love that I am in some discords that I don&#x27;t want tied to my real name and others where I&#x27;ve known these people for over a decade and would see in person multiple times a week (before the pandemic). I know you can set your name per-server but you can&#x27;t hide your discord username (or make it per-server) which sucks.')
