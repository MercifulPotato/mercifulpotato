Quite to the contrary, that is exactly what monarchs do, and exceedinly rich capitalists always tend to eventually become robber-barrons and monarchs.  One only needs to look at the scope of E-bays&#x27; cyberstalking campaign to see the threat companies like Amazon represent.<p>Furthermore, the US and EU governments use antitrust only when there is no other resort for the market and when the companies&#x27; entroachment into government is not sufficient to purchase political favors in order to cement their monopoly which many brand-name companies have done.<p>We need to view income as a form of power and need to cap personal and private equity income as a form of power the same as any law.  You can start with a ridiculous number, say .1% of GDP for a company and .005% of GDP for an individual, which comes out to 200bn annual revenue for a company and .005% for an individual.  For the company, once they hit that number, they get antitrust laws enforced.  For the individual, if they hit that number in net worth\\asset valuation, you impliment an absolute tax (no further income can be acquired, you pay all earnings in tax).  If they want to keep the game going and not pay it to uncle sam they can give it away or just not save that much and instead spend it.<p>This does not have to be rocket science.')
