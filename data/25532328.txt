Item(by='alibarber', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608850815, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25531978, text='&gt; Why can’t people sell and buy vacuums that meet their needs? If I have a need for a 3000 watt vacuum, he EU won’t let me have it, even though I pay not only for the product, but any power it consumes.<p>But you probably always could - seeing as industrial vacuum cleaners are outside the scope of the regulation. Maybe you really want a 3KW ‘domestic’ vacuum but they probably never existed, in the same way that a Smart Car with a truck engine doesn’t. I found this document from the EU itself with a brief search that clarifies this \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;info&#x2F;sites&#x2F;info&#x2F;files&#x2F;commission_guidelines_ecodesign_requirements_for_vacuum_cleaners.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;info&#x2F;sites&#x2F;info&#x2F;files&#x2F;commission_guidel...</a><p>I admit it’s probably more dry than any sensationalist newspaper that wants to sell clicks and yes, the EU could’ve done a lot more to publicise the actual truth around this.')
