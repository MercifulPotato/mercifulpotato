On January 6, the Senate and the House will convene to count the electoral votes and officially declare the winner of the election. The joint session of Congress is required by law to ratify presidential results, but also allows &quot;members to object to the returns from any individual state as they are announced,&quot; according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS).<p>Procedure calls for Vice President Pence to open each state&#x27;s &quot;certificate of ascertainment&quot; — documents prepared by the state after it has completed its vote count and ascertained the official results. He will then present the certificate to four &quot;tellers,&quot; who announce result tallies. Once a candidate reaches 270 electoral college votes, Pence will declare the winner.<p>Lawmakers may object to the results — even if it&#x27;s not their home state — leaving the door open for representatives who support Mr. Trump&#x27;s unproven claims of widespread election fraud to interrupt the typically ceremonial process.<p>According to a Washington Post survey, only 25 congressional Republicans have acknowledged President-elect Biden&#x27;s victory. And 222 Republicans — in the House and Senate — will not say who won the election. Some may lodge their objections during the January 6 session. Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks has already said he would challenge Georgia and Pennsylvania&#x27;s results, claiming flawed election systems, Politico first reported.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;electoral-college-presidential-election-results-trump-challenge&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;electoral-college-presidential-...</a>')
