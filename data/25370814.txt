IE Gov Newsom can&#x27;t declare a state of emergency for COVID, and then force everyone to get TDAP shots (even though it would be beneficial to public health overall), and he can&#x27;t force everyone to wear two left shoes if science and reason don&#x27;t support that helping in the emergency(even if he is personally convinced wearing two left shoes will protect you from COVID). So I believe it is that language in the law that the judge is using to question if the measures are actually associated with the public health emergency.<p>This doc goes into the details a bit in plain language: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emsa.ca.gov&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;71&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;New-EOM-Public-Health-and-Medical-Emergency-Powers-3-15-2019-002.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emsa.ca.gov&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;71&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;New-...</a>')
