They need to stop adding new features for a decade, if that&#x27;s what it takes, in order to fix the security issues. Think of all the ransomware attacks, identity theft, attacks on journalists, and democracy even, that the security issues in this codebase is enabling, and will continue to enable if business-as-usual is the way forward. The stakes are high, and these tech companies must be made to pay a heavy price for each security breach enabled by their negligence, and then the economics will be in favor of prioritizing security over features.')
