Unsupported assertions are entirely useless in this discussion. My argument is very clear and straightforward. If you disagree, you should point out which premise you disagree with and why. Unspecific incredulity does not make an argument.<p>Note that my claim that consciousness supervenes on the dynamics of the EM field generated by the brain does not make it &quot;mysticism&quot;. The EM field is a perfectly kosher physical property of the universe. The core claim of my argument is rather mundane in fact. If you feel compelled to resist the argument at all costs because it strikes you as mysticism, you simply didn&#x27;t understand it.')
