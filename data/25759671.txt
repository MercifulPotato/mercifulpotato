The dependencies become one step removed from their upstream distribution and potentially patched. Tracking what you&#x27;re actually running becomes a harder problem than just looking at package version.<p>With vendoring we&#x27;ll see Debian security bulletins for X-1.2.3 which actually mean that the vendored Y-3.4.5 is vulnerable. And if you&#x27;re monitoring some other vulnerabilities feed, Y will not show up as a package on your system at all.')
