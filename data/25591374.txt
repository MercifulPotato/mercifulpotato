Java runs the game logic, and it does so so slowly that the game skips frames. If you’re claiming that the game logic and the code that runs the graphics are completely untied and run independently that’s wrong. The graphics code cannot paint another frame if it does not know where the objects are because the game logic, written in Java, is lagging behind.<p>C# is much faster than Java. Comparing them in real life performance situations (and not synthetic benchmarks) is almost a joke.')
