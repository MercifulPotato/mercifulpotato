It needs some kind of pattern that is created with the same font. This pattern gets really large if you add a lot of chars (i.e. a-z already makes it huge).<p>I tried this with a really simple example (numbers only, cutting exact frame of pixelated image, same font for pattern) and it didn&#x27;t produce any useful result.<p>TBH that doesn&#x27;t look all that impressive. It&#x27;s not a &quot;throw pixelated image in here and get the unpixelated result&quot; tool.<p>(It&#x27;s still of course valid to make the point that pixelation can be insecure. It&#x27;s of course very much possible that much better such tools - likely by throwing in some ML - are possible and may even exist in the hands of people who won&#x27;t share them on github.)')
