The americans have a very unhealthy situation wrt unions, and i&#x27;m not surprised people with do-it-yourself and can-do attitudes common in tech are soured up to them. And my impressions are relative to polish culture, where unions are traditionally quite strong.<p>I was responsible for selecting several tech conferences for my boss to visit, both in USA and Europe, Middle East, and Asia. Having read most of the documents proffered, I was <i>shocked</i> to find the amount of red tape that was specific to union arrangements in USA, and USA only. Stands, decorations, electrics, cargo large and small. The rider of one american general contractor was the longest document I had to process across 3  continents. We&#x27;re talking &quot;young institutions&quot; - tech conferences, organized mostly by, and for, &quot;do it yourself&quot; kind of people.<p>Were the problems <i>insurmountable</i>? No, certainly they were surmountable.\nDid it have a sour taste and impression of a lot of wasted effort on <i>both</i> sides of the contract? Yes, certainly it did.')
