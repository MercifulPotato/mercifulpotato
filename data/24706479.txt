Why spend the time loading, driving, unloading, cleaning, loading, driving, unloading for a 90 second cycle?<p>I mean I get it when it comes to laundry (at hotel scale), the volume of stuff is much larger, it&#x27;s not fragile so packaging and handling is a lot safer, and they use massive industrial laundry machines. One laundry factory can handle multiple hotels too.')
