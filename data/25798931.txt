As an exercise to make students aware of language variation, he distributed a questionnaire that asked what terms the students used for various concepts. It also asked where the students were from. I was a TA for the course and helped to compile the students’ responses.<p>As I recall, some of the questions were about well-known differences within American English, such as <i>soft drink</i> vs. <i>soda</i> vs. <i>pop</i> or <i>sneakers</i> vs. <i>tennis shoes</i>. But a few were specific to California and were intended to show differences between the dialects of the northern and southern parts of the state.<p>For example, to the question “If you’re going to the city, where are you going?,” most southern Californians responded “to a city” or something similar, while northern Californians responded “to San Francisco.” There might have been one or two East Coasters who answered “to New York City.”<p>Another question was “Name a freeway.” The northern Californians almost invariably gave a number (“101,” “5”), while southern Californians gave a name (“the Harbor Freeway,” “the Golden State”).<p>I moved away from California a couple of years later and have lost track of linguistic trends there. Have southern Californians shifted away from using names for freeways to using numbers?')
