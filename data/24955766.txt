Alternatively, I&#x27;d consider full rewrite as potentially an easier action than untangling individual rights.<p>Imagine a person A worked on a project together with persons B, C..., and over time they all have dependence on each other code. If B, C etc. at some moment changed licensing of their code, but person A didn&#x27;t, 1) A&#x27;s work will become at least partially meaningless, as it depends on B, C... work 2) B, C... would be in violation of previous agreement with A (as at least some of their code depends on A&#x27;s code).<p>Even worse, assume A doesn&#x27;t want to significantly modify the project structure, and starts talking with B, C... asking them not to change the license. While it&#x27;s formally possible to find last modifier for each line, it doesn&#x27;t usually make much sense from programming logic point of view. So, NodeBB seem to get quite lucky getting everybody - at least everybody with complex contribution - simultaneously changing their license terms in accord. I&#x27;d assume in general it could be easier to rewrite all code.')
