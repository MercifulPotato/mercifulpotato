An idea: what if platforms allowed law enforcement (with a warrant) to conduct rainbow table attacks against encrypted content of a specific user? In other words, what if platforms allowed law enforcement to determine <i>whether</i> a specific <i>known</i> object (e.g. a known photo or video) was sent &#x2F; stored by a user rather than <i>decrypting</i> <i>all</i> sent or stored objects?<p>This would allow law enforcement to track the spread of a known piece of content while avoiding breaking encryption. Perhaps it could be a compromise.')
