Of course, it can, if we invest infinity money into it everything can improve.<p>The question is with limited resources make choices about what the best couple of things are that we can invest in. In terms of basic research, some study on hydrogen is appropriate. But it is nowhere close to be the right system for grid storage, in the next 1-2 decade.<p>The problem is this, hydrogen is the older technology compared to these battery systems it has shown a far, far slower improvement curve. And an top of that, the cost improvement curve is even worse. Where should investment go, in places where we are making massive leaps on both the fundamentals and the cost, or to the system that is mostly stagnant.<p>We literally have totally new battery systems go from research to mass deployment while hydrogen with more overall investment has only improved a tiny amount.')
