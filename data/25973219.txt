Maintain build files for bazel (and dealing with other constraints of hermetic execution) is hard time-consuming and it&#x27;s hard to convince many teams it&#x27;s worth the effort.<p>Docker apparently struck a sweet spot in that it&#x27;s easy to explain how to craft linear build steps and it does a half-decent job in actually caching stuff. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work well depending on your workflow but people then have the incentive to read about how to improve the &quot;cacheability&quot; of their dockerfiles (multistage, reorder, dockerignore, ...). As many things in our craft, the human aspect trumps over technical brilliance.')
