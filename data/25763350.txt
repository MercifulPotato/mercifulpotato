My router is just running Linux.  IPTables counters show me bandwidth up and down for each subnet.  Each family member has their own subnet and outbound snat.  I reset the counters monthly.  This is just for info now, as I spent about 45 minutes with their call center negotiating a new plan that does not include that ridiculous cap.  You can also pay them an extra fee per month to avoid the cap if you know you will be going over it and don&#x27;t want to negotiate plans with them.<p>If your router supports having OpenWRT [1] installed, you can monitor bandwidth with bwmon.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openwrt.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guide-user&#x2F;services&#x2F;network_monitoring&#x2F;bwmon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openwrt.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guide-user&#x2F;services&#x2F;network_monitor...</a>')
