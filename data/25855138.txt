Everything else builds upon Google&#x27;s Chromium, including Brave and Edge. If Firefox dies, the Chromium implementation, which is controlled by Google, becomes <i>the</i> web standard, even more than it already is, with all the drawbacks. Of course, you <i>could</i> fork it, but given that all except one competitor have left the scene and the insane amount required to maintain a browser engine, this is not going to happen. We&#x27;re lucky Mozilla has already sunk that cost.<p>[0] Yes, there&#x27;s Lynx and some hobby browsers and yes, there <i>are</i> people who use them as dailys. But you can not reasonably expect anyone to work with them or get a non-technical person to live with those.')
