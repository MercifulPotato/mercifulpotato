If that doesn&#x27;t scream &quot;type error&quot; at you, I don&#x27;t know what would. In fact, that&#x27;s precisely <i>why</i> 0 is a comparatively recent invention. Most list-based problems were solved just fine before then.<p>All these arguments are poor rationalisation for the field&#x27;s inability to move on from the 8-bit era, where the loss of 1&#x2F;256 of your address space mattered and compilers had bigger problems to solve than translating indices to offsets.')
