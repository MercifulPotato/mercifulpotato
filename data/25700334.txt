This left one with a sad, unsatisfying feeling if a session went on too long: the TV studios geared their writing to the LCD. This is absolutely why MTV was so hugely popular before the net.<p>- Go shopping, or window-shopping (famously, to some people, &#x27;the mall&#x27; was a &#x27;third place&#x27;). Ideally, some non-chain store (eg: a specialty book store with foreign&#x2F;obscure books and magazines)<p>- Play&#x2F;practise a musical instrument<p>- Skateboard (something I have not done for aeons now)<p>- Rent, or rewatch, a VHS tape&#x2F;DVD of a movie<p>- Read a book, a magazine, or a newspaper<p>- Start some mini-project (anything from laundry, to creative writing, to tending to a business card collection, to making a tee shirt)<p>- Write letters to friends who had moved away (long distance phone calls were expensive)<p>- Relax with a cup of tea, smoke cigarettes and listen to music. Often while doing this I would re-read my favorite books; easy to browse ones, like art books, old photos etc.<p>- Oh, and program my computer! Just... making programs without a whole lot of collaborative features, obviously.')
