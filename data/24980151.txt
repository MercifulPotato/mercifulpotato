First of all, you&#x27;d need to define &quot;contained in&quot;. The naive choice would be anything reachable by a named ref. However, all pull requests also create a ref in your repository, so you&#x27;d need to exclude those. But that would mean that if you make a PR and then delete the branch the PR is made from, the PR contents aren&#x27;t visible anymore.<p>But even if you have the set of refs that you consider to be in a repository, that means every time an object is requested you&#x27;ll have to walk the whole graph backwards to find if an object is reachable from a ref. That&#x27;s an expensive operation, and Git is usually pretty fast because it tries really hard to avoid this.')
