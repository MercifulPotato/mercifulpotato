And there are not many 5GHz-capable devices or they have the 5GHz band disabled (not sure why - I found this also whilst renting&#x2F;airbnb in other countries, the wifi was bad but the old &quot;admin&#x2F;admin&quot; login worked on the router, so we could switch it to 5GHz).<p>And yes, the install teams are outsourced and the quality varies wildly.')
