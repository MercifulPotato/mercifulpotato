These aren&#x27;t coal miners.  There&#x27;s no factories.<p>The programmers where I work have too much power.  We&#x27;re exploiting the company.  If I don&#x27;t feel like writing code, I just do github stuff and answer questions.  In fact that&#x27;s what I did yesterday and the day before.  No one notices or cares because, among other things, they couldn&#x27;t replace me because there aren&#x27;t thousands of hyper-educated new college grads after my job.  I think many of the Google employees who are unhappy at Google due to &quot;exploitation&quot; would be happier working at a smaller, less famous company.  Of course there&#x27;s a pay cut and you lose that special feeling when everyone instantly recognizes you employer and assumes you&#x27;re a genius.')
