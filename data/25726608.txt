X11 has an ordered event queue and there is no reason an application can&#x27;t process the keystrokes in the correct order.<p>&gt; Another issue is, there&#x27;s no mapping of pid &lt;-&gt; X11 window. It&#x27;s simply impossible with the current design of client-server.<p>What do you need this for? There is _NET_WM_PID [0] which can be set by clients.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;specifications.freedesktop.org&#x2F;wm-spec&#x2F;wm-spec-1.3.html#idm45760170745312" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;specifications.freedesktop.org&#x2F;wm-spec&#x2F;wm-spec-1.3.h...</a>')
