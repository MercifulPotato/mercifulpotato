Top sleep hygiene, running, weights, meet up with peeps and play soccer. Read worldly books like Hesse and find some spiritual centering.<p>Then explore the world, even hiking in a national park nearby. Spur on new thoughts.<p>Then slowly get back into &quot;producing&quot; or whatever you want to do. Maybe go for a masters in something, or just create. Could be useful or just fun.<p>You&#x27;re really lucky. You&#x27;re prob a few years younger than me and have about 90x the money.')
