Unless there is something fundamental to Rust that prevents the creation of what the parent describes as a convenient web library, then not putting in enough effort yet to this point is the only reasonable explanation. And a good explanation at that, as it is understandable why convenient web libraries has not been Rust&#x27;s focus. There are plenty of good tools for that job already. The Rust project seems to be more concerned about creating good tools in areas where good tools are currently lacking.<p>If downvoting was supposed to send some kind of message, I&#x27;m not sure that would explain it. Of course, all downvoting tells is that someone accidentally hit a button when they were trying to scroll through the page, so this is all moot anyway.')
