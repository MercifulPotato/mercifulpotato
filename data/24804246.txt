Item(by='bipson', descendants=None, kids=[24805019], score=None, time=1602877107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800008, text='<i>There is no such thing as high quality chip tuning</i>, unless you are replicating 100% what the manufacturer just disabled for your MCU (e.g. unlocking some kW your motor is in principle capable of outputting). But then again, e.g. BMW uses different, more reliable mechanic parts (camshaft, head, etc.) on motors that have these kWs unlocked, so you are still risking ruining your motor in the long run.<p>Chip tuning always meddles with curves the manufacturer chose after long consideration and extensive tests (let&#x27;s just ignore VW for a moment) - and you are trying to tell me that guy from this shop just &quot;knows better&quot; and &quot;sure, this will be better in every possible aspect&quot;?<p>Are you trying to say a 2019 BMW out of factory will shoot out black smoke while accelerating (quite boringly) from a traffic light?')
