Multi-billion dollar corporations do not want their investments subject to a random person&#x27;s criticism, and from their perspective that makes perfect sense.  It was very prudent and certainly much cheaper to coopt the entire field of media critique: Metacritic is owned by CBSViacom, Rotten Tomatoes is owned by Comcast, IMDB by Amazon.  The old-media reviewers can get drowned out by new-media that is beholden to these corporations for access to interviews, swag, early-access, exclusives, etc.  The corporations that create the media own the algorithms that tell you if the media is good or not.<p>The vast majority of the web has devolved similarly.  Interested in a widget?  If you Google &quot;Widget Reviews&quot; the first page is drowned out by listicles.  Google gets the ad money, the listicle website gets the referral money, Amazon gets the retailer&#x27;s cut plus maybe another Prime membership.  There&#x27;s very little incentive for fair and honest criticism on the web and every incentive for the big players to drown it out.')
