Item(by='matkoniecz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608191590, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25453028, text='&gt; even if he was in fact guilty of attempted murder-for-hire, what&#x27;s a reasonable punishment for that?<p>He was not prosecuted and sentenced for that so life time in prison seems unjust.<p>But such sentence would be reasonable for a serious attempted murder (like for succesfull murder). I see no reason to significantly lower penalty just because someone was incompetent or stopped. 7 years seems clearly too low for that.')
