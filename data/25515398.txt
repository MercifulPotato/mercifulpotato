The correct way to deal with them is to exclusively use real credit cards, and to either threaten or immediately reverse charges from the financial institution&#x27;s side as soon as anywhere near this level of shit is pulled.<p>This wreaks fear into most merchants, not only because fraud policies at banks greatly favor the buyer, but also because too many reversals within a certain period can cause a payment processor to charge higher rates on all transactions indefinitely, sometimes even if the merchant always cooperates.<p>Edit: Also usually works with most check cards, but I&#x27;ve come close to losing with them a couple times, whereas real credit cards are practically bulletproof in my experience unless you&#x27;re just attempting some kind of egregious fraud.')
