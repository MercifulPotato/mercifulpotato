I find it much harder to focus for some reason, even with a dedicated room to work in. When I was working in an office my mind would automatically switch to work mode, and I could be productive for 6+ hours. At home for some reason my mind never quite switches into work mode. I&#x27;ve been trying many things and it has gotten better but still not there. It&#x27;s almost like I&#x27;ve developed mild ADHD. I wonder if anyone has some tips for this, as I&#x27;m running out of ideas.<p>The only thing that has worked for me in the past is to go to coffee shops and despite the noise and general discomfort, my brain instantly goes into work mode and I can focus. But this isn&#x27;t really viable w&#x2F; lockdowns.')
