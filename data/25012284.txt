During less lucrative times in my life I used to ride on Greyhound (and Bolt &amp; Megabus) semi-frequently. It is a good deal if you don&#x27;t mind spending an extra 6 hours waiting around and are willing to risk being decapitated to save ~$50-200 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Killing_of_Tim_McLean" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Killing_of_Tim_McLean</a>). One thing that I will say is that intercity bus travel in North America is much nastier than comparable services in Latin America or East Asia. I feel like this is primarily a socio-economic issue stemming from the fact that middle class Americans do not like to ride a bus so Greyhound is much worse than equivalent services in Mexico. I recall once riding a bus from Texas to California, and the greyhound was being too exceptionally sketchy in terms out the amount of drugs and pornography in use before sundown. In El Paso I transferred to a Mexican bus service to go the rest of the way to LA, and I was very grateful for the massive improvement in hygiene, noise and sanity on the Mexican bus line.')
