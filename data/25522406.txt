I remember the original release ~4 years ago?? That was way before Rust even had async&#x2F;await. I imagine there were quite a few refactors. I mean, so much work, to make a library for asynchronous network service programming? If I needed an event loop and a scheduler I think I would just invest in implementing it myself, tailored to the requirements of my project.')
