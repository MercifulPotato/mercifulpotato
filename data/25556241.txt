Some don&#x27;t like his monotone voice, I love it, each to their own.<p>Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (with David Puder) : He&#x27;s a fantastically empathetic and inquisitive Pyschiatrist who provides a fascinating window into his field. I think there is a lot the layperson can learn about empathy, communication and insight from listening to the experiences of the pros. However as a layperson you may want to skip the ones that go into different pharmaceuticals. I would say his podcast is intended for the medical community but they are very accessible to you and me as well.<p>Sinica : If you are interested in China from the perspective of people who are intimate with the actual perspectives of the Chinese (and not those of the western idea of what China is) then this is the podcast for you. After spending a little time in China, I found the mainstream western media portrayal did not match up with the reality on the ground.<p>Love and Radio (With Nick Van Der Kolk): If you love exploring the fringe, the weird and the exceptional then this one is for you.<p>The Hamish and Andy Podcast: Australian mainstream, but amazing all the same. I hope it exports to you well.')
