I maybe the only one that can answer technical problems I&#x27;m having sometimes with my own faults being the cause. Without a thorough review, tracing back probing to their source I&#x27;d be unable to continue with complex and obscure problems. In short only I have the answers to my problems as many problems are self caused. I use self speech as a way of forcing my brain to put vague notions into words so they can become more like reason and easier to pursue or reject.<p>I grew up alone, I had no one to talk to about things which are interesting to me.<p>I also sometimes have pressured speech, a psychological problem of an unknown origin. But treatment keeps it in check. I have just learned to censor myself when around others.')
