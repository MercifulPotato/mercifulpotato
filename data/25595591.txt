A QA engineer should be able to read the existing process documents from the git history and have confidence in the CI&#x2F;CD. In fact a QA engineer’s job is made easier if a robot is cataloging the process (as human developers are prone to errors and sloppy work).<p>Regarding feedback, a developers dream is to never have to ask for one or give one. Tickets should be well formed and ready for the developer to start work efficiently. A customer service engineer is in the perfect spot to ease the work of the developer. If a developer has question they can ask the customer service engineer which in effect is responsible to document the process.<p>Note that I pick JIRA apart here for no specific reason, it is possible to use GitHub as inefficiently as JIRA and vise versa. However GitHub has developer friendly workflow set up by default, whereas JIRA does not. In fact I’ve never seen a JIRA workflow that is developer friendly.')
