Transferring 2700 megajoules of energy to an f150 via gasoline in a few minutes is very convenient, something that would take a Tesla a few hours. If consumers were concerned with efficiency the same way engineers were, we&#x27;d all be driving electric hummers and cybertrucks.<p>There are 2 types of convenience.<p>- Being able to fuel up quickly on a long trip<p>- Having your fuel tank full at the beginning of every single trip.<p>Hydrogen fuel cells (and combustion engines in general) are better only for the former case. Since most people drive less than 300 miles most of the time, it&#x27;s hard to argue a car optimized for longer trips is more convenient for most drivers.')
