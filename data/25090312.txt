This is purely politics at State-level, not a humanitarian objective (a la &quot;national security&quot; at the federal level). The exchange of this essential good should pay forward to the state-control and security for the North via deforestation is my point.<p>Think: Northern California already would be called Jefferson by now if Southern California pushed for it as well, but they refuse on the basis of Northern water, yet they give no due State power, that is the fundamental hypocrisy of Democracy.')
