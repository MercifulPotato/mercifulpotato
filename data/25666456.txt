An ARM core could probably be reworked into a RISC-V core and vice-versa -- it&#x27;s ultimately &quot;just&quot; an instruction set. It benefits the CPU manufacturer, as they don&#x27;t have to pay licensing fees and can therefore earn a buck more in profit.<p>RISC-V isn&#x27;t really intrinsically more open (from an end user perspective) than many of its competitors -- it does, however, have a lot of hype and social intertia behind it, which may be enough to propel it to greatness.<p>One benefit of RISC-V is it offers a modular instruction set, where a &quot;RISC-V&quot; CPU can implement a subset of functionality and add new instructions in a well defined way. One downside to this is the possibility for the ISA to be splintered in practice if the major vendors end up not supporting a uniform feature set.')
