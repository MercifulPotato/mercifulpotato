I have cerebral palsy that for the most part only affects my left hand. I’ve been programming since 1986 when I was in 6th grade. I type decently fast with one hand and I inadvertently learned to touch type just by spending so much time on a computer.<p>I don’t need any special accommodations. I decided to click “no” at my current job at $BigTech. My interview process was remote, I’ve never met any of my coworkers in person and probably won’t until 2022.<p>My job was always designed to be remote so there is no telling when I’ll need to fly to one of the offices.')
