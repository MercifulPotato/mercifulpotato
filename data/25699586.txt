If you can&#x27;t achieve those economies of scale, then the manufacturing node will never be profitable, and whoever&#x27;s bankrolling it will quickly pull the plug. (GlobalFoundries exiting the 7nm market is the most recent example of this.)<p>If Intel outsources leading edge production to TSMC or Samsung, they will lose operational experience and infrastructure needed to operate fabs at the leading edge, and their fabs will never be competitive for leading edge production again (barring a major misstep by TSMC or Samsung).')
