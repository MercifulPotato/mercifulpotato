I had spent days fighting a segfault in a widely used, mature library. Naturally, me being new to the library, and knowing that it&#x27;s mature and widely used, I assumed I was doing something wrong. No mention of the problem online. Crickets in my StackOverflow question for days. In the end, my last ditch effort was to find some of the devlopers on IRC (I hadn&#x27;t used it for a decade). I was ready for the &quot;RTFM!!!&quot; telling off of my childhood.<p>But no. People were super helpful. Helped me debug and explain what the library was doing. Turns out it was a bug in a little-used corner of the library afterall! It had lingered there unreported for 3 years. 10&#x2F;10, would IRC again!')
