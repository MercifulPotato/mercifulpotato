Oh it&#x27;s 939524096) since this value is only a target it would generally try to hit it, but (in my case) overshoot it regularly. In normal use this isn&#x27;t a problem at all, but I got OSDs restarting under heavy usage. I would be interested in your stability. Can&#x2F;Did you check your logs for OSD restarts? I could imagine that OSD processes died and got restarted by systemd. If not this could just mean that you either have a lower load than me, it could be better in a newer release or my setup could have just sucked :) would be interested to hear back')
