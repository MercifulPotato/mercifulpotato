Second in-orbit cargo transfer and refueling is not a solved problem. Third Starship is not currently flying and it remains to be seen if it holds up to a fraction of Musk&#x27;s claims about it. Fourth space construction is far from a solved problem and remote (Lunar far side) construction isn&#x27;t even a thing, we don&#x27;t even have large scale remote construction on Earth.<p>Building something like a radio telescope on the Moon is <i>not</i> impossible and doesn&#x27;t require any unobtanium. It is however pretty far out in terms practicality. Just about zero of the engineering capability required has been demonstrated.<p>Even if my estimates for a Lunar radio telescope were off by an order of magnitude and it would only cost a <i>billion</i> dollars, that&#x27;s still several FASTs or Arecibos you could build on Earth. The Lunar environment is harsh. Micrometeorites, cosmic rays, and solar flares would wreak havoc on sensitive components of a telescope (radio or otherwise). They&#x27;re much more of a hazard on the Moon than on Earth because the atmosphere and magnetic field protect the surface. A repair or replacement of a component on a terrestrial instrument might be thousands or millions of dollars. For a Lunar instrument would be at <i>least</i> in the millions.<p>There&#x27;s a very weird meme going around that because SpaceX exists doing things in space is suddenly simple and cheap. Space is hard. SpaceX et al are making it less expensive but not by huge divisors. A Falcon 9 reusable is only a little cheaper than a Proton-M for similar capability. It&#x27;s cheaper than ULA rockets by about half.  It&#x27;s a feat for sure but it&#x27;s not like LEO is suddenly as affordable as air freight.')
