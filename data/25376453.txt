Did you lie on your resume? To your co-workers?I would assume not. You were judged on (presumably) the same criteria as anyone else, and found to be at an acceptable level. Maybe other people are better than you, and that&#x27;s fine. But if you weren&#x27;t &quot;good enough&quot;, they probably wouldn&#x27;t keep paying you, and your manager would probably say something. It&#x27;s kind of the point of performance reviews.')
