This will just make police work slower and will let criminal elements flourish.<p>Another thing, if we ban government and the police using it, why not ban it for everybody? Why Google can use it but not the government? At least with the government I can vote them out if they miss use it but what power do we have ver those huge corporates?<p>It seems to me like it it a power grab by those corporates, they want to have this power but not the government which might prevent them from taking over the world while preaching to us how good they are and on &quot;the right side of history&quot;.')
