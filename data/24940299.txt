What if there were pragmatic reasons for providing property protections to certain non-scare resources?<p>I think your argument would be more convincing with some justification as to why scarcity ought to be necessary for property protections.<p>Property can be conceptualized as a social technology, an idea that is useful for solving problems and accomplishing goals.
