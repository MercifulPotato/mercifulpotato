You want to read Hobbes Leviathan? Guess what, the only parts that matter today are a handful of pages. Same with Kant&#x27;s Groundwork, Aristotle&#x27;s Politics, etc.<p>The famous philosophers are (mostly) famous for their essential ideas, not the full lengths of their books.<p>For example: the majority of Hobbes&#x27; Leviathan is coming up with an entire theory of natural law, dealing with religion, etc. But none of that stuff was particularly noteworthy. The part that&#x27;s relevant today was his original thoughts on the social contract, which is a very short part.<p>It&#x27;s far more important to read textbooks, surveys, etc. to understand the ideas and be able to put each philosopher in context of who they were responding to and who responded to them.<p><i>Then</i> if you&#x27;re an academic or going to write a paper or something, sure go to the actual sources.<p>I say this having read <i>tons</i> of Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, Kant, Locke, Rawls, etc. I&#x27;ve needed to for my work, but I would <i>never</i> recommend reading them to someone just casually interested in philosophy. That&#x27;s like telling someone who wants to learn how to program that they should be reading the C compiler source code.')
