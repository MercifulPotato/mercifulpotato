We need to focus on the specifics of what is being asked of us and what that is preventing. Otherwise we&#x27;ll never agree on anything.<p>Mask use is an individual issue in that it protects other individuals around you. Your right to throw punches stops at my nose. Suppose that we did nothing and let it spread. There would inevitably be a whole lot of people going around spreading it to people who don&#x27;t want to be infected. This would be the case regardless of how individuals chose to self-isolate. People would go to the grocery store sick and breathe on everyone else there. This is the normal MO when in Flu season.<p>So it is an individual issue in the sense that as an individual I need to be able to buy food safely, and your choice to spread this unimpeded would infringe on that fundamental right.<p>And at the end of the day we&#x27;re weighing the inconvenience of wearing a mask and staying home when sick for a few months versus the inconvenience of wheeling an oxygen bottle around with you for the rest of your life. If you have a cogent argument for why I should be stricken to save you the inconvenience then I&#x27;ll listen.')
