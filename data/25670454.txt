Around here finding some guns in a parked truck would not be noteworthy. Given that some of these people probably came from well outside of DC, I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised they just drove their truck up with whatever was in it already without a thought.<p>Unfortunately, I also wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to hear that they intentionally brought them just in case some of their buddies forgot their weapons for the coup attempt. That is, sadly, the country we&#x27;ve made for ourselves.')
