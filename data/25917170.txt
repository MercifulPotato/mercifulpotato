(And as a general trend throughout history.)<p>Those who have power in a given domain tend to—at least eventually—wield their power in an unbalanced way. This criticism does not legitimize actual fake news, but does acknowledge that such tools to limit fake news can—and often are—used to also limit undesirable opposition speech.<p>Case in point: Facebook, which tends to favor right-leaning speech, recently banned (and then revoked said ban) of several socialist groups on their platform. While they cite technical reasons, it is feasible that it was a human decision among those in power who wished to limit &quot;opposition&quot; speech. Of course, it could have legitimately been a bug, but it&#x27;s certainly not believed so by those affected.')
