As many others have pointed out here, Google doesn&#x27;t do peer review in the academic sense, they do pre-publication review, almost always on short notice, for the purposes of protecting IP, mainly.<p>So imagine you&#x27;re called in and told to retract your paper on substantive grounds provided by an anonymous reviewer whose feedback is sufficiently bad for you that you don&#x27;t get a chance to amend your paper, it&#x27;s just retracted, full stop.  You can&#x27;t have their written feedback, but after you kick up a fuss, you&#x27;ll be granted a recitation of the feedback that won&#x27;t change anything about the fate of your paper.<p>All this in the context of review that&#x27;s normally a rubber stamp when trade secrets aren&#x27;t involved.<p>Demanding to know who torpedoed your paper in an extraordinary way doesn&#x27;t seem so unreasonable.')
