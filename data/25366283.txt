We sold it as a premium product, and it was hard to get adoption. Which made it hard to actually prove the benefits we claimed should exist.<p>That&#x27;s not proof that we&#x27;d have fared better if we had open-sourced it. We took exactly the opposite route of MongoDB, with very stringent schemas to ensure data quality. That required a large up-front investment in time, and that was a hard sell too. The whole world went in the opposite direction, of schemaless databases and machine learning for &quot;eh, good enough&quot; answers.<p>Still, I&#x27;ll always wonder if we wouldn&#x27;t have failed so spectacularly if we&#x27;d open sourced it. The idea was a pretty good one, and we wrote some remarkable software to make it happen.')
