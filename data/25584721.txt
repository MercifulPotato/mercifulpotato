You could work the traditional 40 hour week M-F, 9 hour days with every other Friday off (9-10), or four 10 hour days with every Friday off. Most people enjoyed the flexible schedules. Since Friday was the one day in flux, everyone knew to avoid scheduling important meetings on Friday. Being young and naive, I assumed most tech employers offered flexible schedules. I now know that this is regrettably not the case. I hope more employers will embrace this in the future. The costs to the firm are negligible, but flexible schedules can be a huge benefit to employees.')
