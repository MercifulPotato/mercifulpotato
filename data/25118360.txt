In the case of migrating from something outside of Cloud SQL into Cloud SQL you could basically do this today. A dump wouldn&#x27;t be recommended in my opinion (having done a lot of migrations across cloud providers including several multi-TB databases).<p>In that case as long as the source has some form of decoding (test decoding plugin or pgoutput) it should work.<p>That a dump is always the best process anything isn&#x27;t really true these days (I know someone will show up with a case of why dump is 100% for what they need in moving data around). But, the combination of logical decoding, and pg_upgrade cover most cases.<p>Admit I was jumping a bit with upgrades, but that is where dump&#x2F;restore does most often come up, not with migrations.')
