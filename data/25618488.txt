For example,<p><pre><code>    if (a &lt; b &lt; c)\n</code></pre>\nis allowed by C, but few C programmers can tell you what it means, and the appearance of it in code is almost always a bug. Instead of educating programmers with &quot;don&#x27;t do that&quot;, D makes it illegal. (If you really want it, you&#x27;d have to write it as: `(a &lt; b) &lt; c`. But notice you have to make an effort to write code that way, it is highly unlikely to be accidentally written.)<p>&gt; Scrutinizing the logic of the code line by line at least 2 times after you&#x27;ve finished writing it.<p>I find it useful to go back through the logic a couple months later. I usually find a lot to improve :-)')
