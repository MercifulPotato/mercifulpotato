And now they have built up the talent, the process, to build different chips and chips that are very large. M1 is not a small chip, it&#x27;s complexity is comparable if not more than intel or amd or Nvidia&#x27;s chips. They also established a sustainable relationship with tsmc. I am sure tsmc have exclusive or volume contracts for apple to be the first adopter to their most dense node. Tsmc allocates a lot more of waffer capacity to apple than other designers. The marginal cost for apple to design and build a large version of m1 is pretty cheap.')
