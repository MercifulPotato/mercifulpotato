I&#x27;m not sure what are you implying with your comment and I hope it&#x27;s not &quot;the company is declining because the company moved talent to countries where developers are cheaper&quot;. I do personally have friends working there and they are top class developers. Living costs don&#x27;t necessarily correlate with talent levels.<p>That said I don&#x27;t hear the best about the company (long working hours, not the highest pay) and have declined a job offer there myself.')
