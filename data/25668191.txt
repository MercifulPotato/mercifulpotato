They also published a graph that showed an increase in capacity over more than 300 charge-discharge cycles. (This increase, however, pales in comparison to the cell&#x27;s at least 23,000-cycle lifespan.)&quot;<p>[...]<p>&gt;&quot;She says their glass electrolyte is a ferroelectric material—a material whose polarization switches back and forth in the presence of an outside field. So charge-discharge cycles are effectively jiggling the electrolyte back and forth and perhaps, over time, finding the ideal configuration of each electromagnetic dipole.<p>“This is what happens as you are charging and discharging,” Braga says. “You are aligning the ferroelectric dipoles.”&quot;')
