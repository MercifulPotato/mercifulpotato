Certain apps are (arguably rightly) only available in certain regions (like banking apps) but Apple&#x27;s poor design means you now have to switch stores to upgrade.<p>So Capital One tells me I have to upgrade my app I need to log out my Apple account, switch the region to USA, type in my address, phone numbers, and a USA credit card (this is for apple), then start the store back up. Sometimes it takes a while for it to switch. I can then download the new version of the Capital One app. Then my MUFG Bank app needs an update so I have to repeat the process to switch back the Japan store.<p>Even funnier, the app store will tell me I need to upgrade but then won&#x27;t upgrade (Because I&#x27;m not on the right store) so it&#x27;s clearly the same store since the upgrade notices flow through the same store app, it&#x27;s just bad design.<p>Why Apple can&#x27;t figure this out is beyond me. They&#x27;re an international company. They must have 1000s of employees that have to deal with this issue. Sure I get it does not affect the majority of users. The same can be said for accessibility features yet they still make them.')
