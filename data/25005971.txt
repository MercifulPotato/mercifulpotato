They&#x27;ll be too busy working on the more acute cases while you&#x27;re waiting.<p>You can certainly pay for your own dentist visits. I do - not because the waiting lines (I could just book my annual check at the same time each year and get the visit roughly annually) - but because I trust my dentist, and I want the same person to do my teeth each time. Most people do, I think, because public dentistry services weren&#x27;t included for adults for decades until 2000&#x27;s or so. So, you would get public dentists till you&#x27;re 18 and then pay for your private dentist after that. That actually worked pretty well in its time but now that everyone is allowed public dentist visits there are queues.<p>You can pay to see a medical doctor as well. There&#x27;s a large number of private medical clinics that will take you in the very same day. Some people use their own money to buy that service but most commonly people use these via their employer&#x27;s healthcare benefit or via private insurance. For example, if you have kids you can buy them a private insurance for 150-200â‚¬ per kid per year and should they acutely need a doctor you can just take them to any private clinic instead of waiting in the emergency reception in a public healthcare center or hospital. But if it&#x27;s something really acute you&#x27;d be taken in anyway, so many people will just use the public service.')
