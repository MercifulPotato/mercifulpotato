Get Organized!\nThe BIG difference between being a software engineer, maybe even a lead&#x2F;senior engineer and a CTO is that you have A LOT MORE to focus on than an engineer. You might need to be juggling thinks like\n     * Code architecture&#x2F;clean code&#x2F;PR reviews\n     * Security audits (i.e. Google API verification)\n     * Interviewing engineers\n     * Translating the ridiculous CEO request into actionable specs\n     * Keeping up the morale of the engineering team\n     * Evaluating technologies&#x2F;platforms&#x2F;services\n     * Attending&#x2F;leading meetings (i.e. project status, planning, etc.)\n     * Keeping up with the industry (i.e. reading HN daily ;-)<p>I&#x27;m probably forgetting things but there&#x27;s a lot that gets throw your way, mostly small things, but a bunch of small things that makes a confusing collage out of a regular day.<p>* 2. Be pessimistic\nI say this not as an emotional state to be or an attitude to adopt but always assume and prepare for the worst case scenario. It is a lot easier to inform the CEO that you where able to manage that migration 2 weeks earlier than promise a delivery date and be 3 weeks late. That really throws out of whack whatever planning the CEO has and screws with the (likely) promises he might have made to investors&#x2F;shareholders&#x2F;board<p>* 3. Keep engineers happy\nThis one is particularly dear to me. I can look back and remember the times my engineers showed initiative and when they got some free time fixed things that needed fixing without me needing to ask, and wow! those are the times that I love my job!\nHappy engineers doesn&#x27;t just happen due to cool tech, interesting problems or free pizza day, it comes (in my opinion and experience) from respect, appreciation and the knowledge that they are making a difference and if they weren&#x27;t present their absence would be deeply felt.<p>As for the rest, we all are making it all up as we go! So don&#x27;t feel discouraged or afraid or even needing to &quot;validate&quot; your ideas based on some perceived &quot;experts&quot;. Read comments, learn from other&#x27;s mistakes but also enjoy the ride! Good luck!')
