There is no doubt in my mind that we could do better, and we should, but also no doubt in my mind that there are fundamental limits on how well remote can ever get.<p>Also, the longer you are &quot;remote only&quot; (as opposed to a temporary remote session because of snowstorm or whatever), the worse the remote option becomes.  Lots of things happen in person that help to strengthen teacher-student understanding, and they gradually atrophy the longer you are remote.<p>Plus, some of what happens at a school is education in dealing with your peers, which is even more deficient in remote mode.<p>That&#x27;s three reasons that remote learning, while a valuable addition, is not a replacement for in person schooling, and I am way more convinced of that now than I was before the pandemic.')
