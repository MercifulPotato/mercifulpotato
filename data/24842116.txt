I recently witnessed someone getting numba based code running on an ARM based system, and they fought llvm package and performance issues for weeks. The code in question was generally working and seemed pretty good on x86, but took up multiple CPU cores at 100% on the ARM platform. Doing a straight forward port of the algorithm to C++ and wrapping it with pybind11 resulted in the same algorithm using 14% of one CPU core. Perhaps the numba implementation could have been made to work eventually, but it seemed pretty difficult to debug due to all the layers involved.')
