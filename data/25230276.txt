Item(by='dghlsakjg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606495963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25230074, text='There are a lot of issues, and densification is certainly happening in the downtown cores, but I don&#x27;t believe it is enough to keep up with the demands put on it by population increases. More anecdata: I live walking distance to Downtown Vancouver, and within a block of 4 bus routes. There is an empty lot next to me that has been in the permitting process for more than two years for a lowrise mixed-use building. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the cost imposed by the permitting process is close to $1mm when you factor in interest, salaries to hire the people who know people at city hall, the cost of the actual permits, etc.<p>Other things that factor heavily are cheap money (interest rates are lower than inflation on mortgages right now, around 1.7%), cultural normalization (buying a home for 10x your yearly income is considered normal), lack of opportunity outside of cities.')
