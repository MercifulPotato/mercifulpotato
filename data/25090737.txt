And judging by the comments I read here it&#x27;s true for MacOS too.<p>FWIW I switched from XP to Vista 1 or 1.5 year after its release date. It has been a great OS for me, I never had a problem with it (except that it&#x27;s then they started with the bullshit telemetry).<p>Of course YMMV, but since late Vista stability isn&#x27;t a major issue anymore.')
