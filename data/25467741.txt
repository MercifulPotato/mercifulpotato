I&#x27;m rotting from the inside out.<p>The only problem I have with the post is that they have the luxury of quitting. People like myself are trapped in the job. They&#x27;re likely making 5x many people&#x27;s salary if they are a principle engineer at a large tech firm.<p>I dream of quitting everyday, but I know I have to deal with this job for the next 2 decades at least (about 9 years in). I&#x27;m miserable and know I&#x27;m wasting my good years, but I have to support a family.')
