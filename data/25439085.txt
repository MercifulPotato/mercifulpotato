I&#x27;ve had like 3 crashes in the 20 hours I&#x27;ve put in yet. I enjoy the game a lot, even with the bugs but what really let me down were the life paths.<p>I started a corpo character, got some fancy tech and a lot of cash 5 minutes in, then I ride a cool flying car around, I felt good and liked my choice. 10 minutes later I&#x27;m in a bar and 2 people come up to me that I have a meaningless dialogue with, they steal the tech and cash and from that point on I&#x27;m just a regular street kid?<p>It made no sense to me, I played on for an hour and then restarted as a street kid.')
