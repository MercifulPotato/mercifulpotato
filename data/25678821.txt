Item(by='skapadia', descendants=None, kids=[25678862], score=None, time=1610060096, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25674964, text='I didn&#x27;t even know about this bank, but based on the comments, seems to have had a major impact on people&#x27;s lives.<p>I essentially do what Simple provides on my own, but realize that takes radical discipline.  Not everyone has that, but sounds like Simple &quot;hacked&quot; people&#x27;s habits towards saving. I consider that a &quot;super power&quot; so I&#x27;m sad to hear they&#x27;re closing.<p>I direct deposit to two HYSA accounts in the same bank. One is my &quot;current expenses&quot; account and represents my projected expenses&#x2F;budget for the month.  The second is my &quot;long term&quot; account that represents savings for long term goals. At the end of each month, if there&#x27;s money left in the current account, I move it over to the long term.  The long term is then invested in brokerage accounts (because I&#x27;ve saved up for an emergency fund and house down payment, which remain liquid).<p>Oh and 401K money is taken out before I ever see it.')
