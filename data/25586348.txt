But that isn&#x27;t how it works, identity is an intrinsic thing and official records describe aspects of it.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t think a blockchain is of any use here. There might be some value in publishing some information in order to establish identities for use in other contexts, but a blockchain isn&#x27;t necessary for that.<p>Even issue cryptographically strong identity cards has a bunch of hard problems. How do you repudiate a card without possessing it, how do you obtain a new one if it breaks, etc., etc.')
