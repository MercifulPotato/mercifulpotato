Either you either end up forking the network into multiple islands or building some crazy complex &quot;negotiation&quot; mechanism where two random clients need to agree on what features they support before they communicate.<p>We saw incompatible islands appear in decentralised systems before (this tends to not be good for users), and we&#x27;ve also seen how any implementation of &quot;protocol&#x2F;feature negotiation&quot; is basically a disaster for security. I don&#x27;t currently see how any truly decentralised system is lowering either of these costs.<p>WhatsApp never used to be e2e for everyone, but they were able to make it universal relatively quickly <i>because</i> it&#x27;s centralised. All of the poster child decentralised protocols (SMTP, XMPP etc.) are <i>still</i> not e2e for everyone despite decades of effort.')
