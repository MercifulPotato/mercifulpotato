I find that in most cases openwrt gives better wireless throughput on the exact same hardware under the same conditions.  My other gripe with Mikrotik is that they pushed their own proprietary protocols like EoIP instead of supporting standards like vxlan (I know this will be available in RouterOS 7, but that is still not really out when I last checked).')
