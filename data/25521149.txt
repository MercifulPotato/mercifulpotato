Totally reminds me of my old pain points as a PM.<p>I’m biased with my workflow, since I built the tool, but my cofounder and I use Amna to manage our work. It’s not really collaborative (yet), but you can group the things you mention by task.<p>So for example, I might make a task called “product packaging”. I click on it. Amna gives a browser. It’s basically chrome, so you do your work normally. Open all the right tabs. E.g, open Gmail, research sellers. And once I’m done, I just leave the task.<p>All the threads and information are saved for next time.<p>To get back, it’s as easy clicking on a task again, and you get back in the flow really fast.<p>Though it doesn’t replace your Google Doc problem, it does reduce all that hopping around with. You don’t need to have a complex organization system, just do you work once in Amna, and you’ll know where it is!<p>You’re welcome to give it a try!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getamna.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getamna.com</a>')
