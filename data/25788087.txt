There&#x27;s probably people in this discussion who have only experienced the latency through Zoom or Skype, and assume it&#x27;s about as good as you can get over the internet. It&#x27;s not even close.<p>If you have special software like Jamulus, non-wireless internet, players geographically close to each other, and an external audio interface, the latency is surprisingly good. If you have most but not all of that, it can still be usable. Our end-to-end latency was around 30 ms, so not as low as parent&#x27;s, but we were still able to play even &quot;jam songs&quot; where just followed each other for chord changes instead of having agreed them beforehand.')
