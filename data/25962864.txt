Our shitty Supreme Court has made &quot;stay silent&quot; a bit of an issue--it&#x27;s safer to demand your lawyer instead.<p>It&#x27;s not even about understanding the system, the presence of the lawyer forces the police to establish &quot;scope&quot;.<p>If I&#x27;m just a witness, then the lawyer can make sure that what I say can&#x27;t later be used against <i>me</i> for something unrelated.<p>If I&#x27;m a suspect, this prevents the police from going on a fishing expedition to just &quot;find anything&quot;.  Once they talk to the lawyer, they have to go hunting for &quot;what they told the lawyer&quot; as opposed to everything in the world.')
