I think its an important issue.<p>So I emailed Cory and asked if I could interview him for a podcast.  He responded almost immediately and said yes. At the time he was doing interviews on major network programs about a new book, and I figured he would never respond.<p>He was basically like you would expect Cory Doctorow to be in person, smart and well spoken, friendly and fired up about computing freedom type issues. We need more public intellectuals like him.')
