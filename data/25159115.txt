This has been used to justify more extreme lockdown measures.<p>There have been estimates of the false positive rate[2] but it is likely to vary widely as the tests are administered by untrained personnel and not stored according to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. Those who test positive in the UK are not usually given confirmatory tests as they are immediately required to isolate, resulting in a large number of current &quot;cases&quot; which may be false positives[3].<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anhinternational.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;is-there-a-waning-pandemic-behind-the-casedemic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anhinternational.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;is-there-a-waning-pand...</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lanres&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS2213-2600(20)30453-7&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lanres&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS2213-2...</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cebm.net&#x2F;covid-19&#x2F;pitfalls-of-repeat-testing-illustrated-with-the-house-of-commons&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cebm.net&#x2F;covid-19&#x2F;pitfalls-of-repeat-testing-ill...</a>')
