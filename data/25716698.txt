Whatever is the minimum needed to get a VPC stood up.<p>1. EC2 as 90%+ of whatever they&#x27;re doing<p>2. S3 for storing lots of stuff and&#x2F;or crossing VPC boundaries for data ingress&#x2F;egress (like seriously, S3 seems to be used more as an alternative to SFTP than for anything else). This makes up usually the rest of the thinking.<p>3. <i>Maybe</i> one other technology that&#x27;s usually from the set of {Lambda, Batch, Redshift, SQS} but <i>rarely</i> any combination of two or more of those.<p>And that&#x27;s it. I know there are teams that go all in. But for the dozen or teams I&#x27;ve personally interacted with this is it. The rest of the stack is usually something stuffed into an EC2 instance instead of using an AWS version and it comes down to one thing: the difficulties in estimating pricing for those pieces. EC2 instances are drop-dead simple to price estimate forward 6 months, 12 months or longer.<p>Amazon is probably leaving billions on the table every year because nobody can figure out how to price things so their department can make their yearly budget requests. The one time somebody tries to use some managed service that goes overbudget by 3000%, and the after action figures out that it would have been within the budget by using &lt;open source technology&gt; in EC2, they just do that instead -- even though it increases the staff cost and maintenance complexity.<p>In fact just this past week a team was looking at using SageMaker in an effort to go all &quot;cloud native&quot;, took one look at the pricing sheet and noped right back to Jupyter and scikit_learn in a few EC2 instances.<p>An entire different group I&#x27;m working with is evaluating cloud management tools and most of them just simplify provisioning EC2 instances and tracking instance costs. They really don&#x27;t do much for tracking costs from almost any of the other services.')
