I think our entire 3D universe is really more like a &#x27;projection&#x27; (onto lower dimensions) of some vastly larger hyperspace in many more dimensions, so we&#x27;re always seeing basically only a sliver of true reality, and if we could see it all (all of reality) it would be vastly more complex, but also a lot of things (like this video) would seem more mechanical than magical.')
