Same for Ghandi and indian independence, to take one contemporary example out of many.<p>Perhaps there is a moral obligation for people with privilege to engage; but it&#x27;s clearly not a practical necessity for change to happen. Given the lack of progress in Black civil rights ever since the 60&#x27;s; as this discourse around &quot;we all must participate!&quot; has strengthened, it is far from clear that it is helpful.<p>I propose that the other way is best. Live your life, respond with genuine outrage when injustice crosses your path, and don&#x27;t feel like media consumption fixes anything.')
