People who understand the context of the statistics and how they translate to real standards of patient care do not think everything is OK right now.<p>Yeah I know that, my best mates girlfriend is a doctor. But that&#x27;s not at all proof of anything. There is a reason that wars aren&#x27;t planned and architected by the foot soldier in the trench. They don&#x27;t have perspective and the task at hand detracts from the bigger picture. I have the utmost respect for our NHS heroes but front line personnel are the last people you should ask. They have been put through hell over the past year and if I were in their shoes I would be ready to keel over. And that&#x27;s exactly why these individuals shouldn&#x27;t be calling the shots...they&#x27;re just seeing one part of the puzzle.')
