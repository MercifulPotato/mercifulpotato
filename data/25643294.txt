He didn&#x27;t say &quot;country full of white people&quot;, he specifically mentioned socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic status generally correlates negatively with criminality. There&#x27;s nothing inherently racist about that statement, it&#x27;s just stating that:<p>- desperate people will do desperate things to survive<p>- oppressed people are bound to lash out<p>- the poor are powerless against authority<p>- people in poorer neighbourhoods are prone to overpolicing<p>- destitute people are more likely to succumb to substance abuse<p>If he said recidivism or crime rates were higher because the population was black&#x2F;hispanic&#x2F;etc, that would obviously be racist.')
