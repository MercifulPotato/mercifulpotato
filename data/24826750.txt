You don&#x27;t need an AI to launch a bunch of drones with payloads. My local middleschool can fly a bunch of drones, and they do it monthly in a nearby parking lot.<p>+ Neither the video nor the website dictates what, exactly the ban is of. &quot;Lethal Autonomous Weapons&quot;, sure, but are we banning like drone motors or FPV cameras or what? How do we not ban &quot;Drone carrying a camera&quot; but do ban &quot;drone carrying homemade explosive&quot; in a way that&#x27;s meaningful beyond making it extra-illegal to do a terrorism?<p>+ The website mostly seems concerned about human-in-the-killchain systems versus automated systems. That&#x27;s a fair distinction to be concerned about, but doesn&#x27;t appear to be related to the theoretical attack they show.')
