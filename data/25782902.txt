I was the technical founder for a data startup that used NLP, elastic and some other stuff for analysis. It&#x27;s still active, growing and approaching profitability, is used by fortune 500 companies and has had some media attention. However, I&#x27;ve never been approached for a related role and have never been invited after applying for similar roles.<p>Maybe my resume is bad, maybe my experience doesn&#x27;t really fit anywhere, but I thought it was an interesting observation in light of this article.')
