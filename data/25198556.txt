Or maybe, even if somehow it still allowed for those things, the mechanical difference was too big so it didn&#x27;t feel the same.<p>In the end I &quot;just&quot; played like 1000 hours in CS:GO and quit the game as there was no real HNS replacement as it used to be. I still played the normal mode for 1k hours as there were a few very nice 24vs24 servers were everyone was using microphone and try-harding.')
