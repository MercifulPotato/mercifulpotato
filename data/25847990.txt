For users like me who usually have 50-800 tabs open across all my browser windows, that <i>really</i> adds up. I also appreciate (err... appreciated) The Great Suspender because I didn&#x27;t want <i>all</i> of those tabs active <i>every</i> time I opened a browser, so I&#x27;d have scores of tabs that never even got loaded, but were ready to go the moment I wanted to return to them.')
