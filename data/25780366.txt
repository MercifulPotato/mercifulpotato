Item(by='Humdeee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610649877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25767122, text='The irony here is your comment alone is more reddit-esque than a common pun train is. Gatekeeping, mass downvoting, flagging, and then verbalizing your personal distaste to how a forum should run in a hostile manner... This is in every big thread. Best to minimize and move on, or simply just leave if this gets you so worked up. But you decided to use the downvote button in place of disagreeing with this very comment; something again, redditors also do not understand.<p>tl;dr (hehe) You&#x27;ll likely be happier if you care less.')
