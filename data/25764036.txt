But Twitter cited that they were being interpreted (as evidenced by replies) as calling for violence. For example, a tweet that said &quot;I will not be at the inauguration&quot; was interpreted as &quot;If you attack the inauguration I won&#x27;t be harmed.&quot;<p>So it&#x27;s not so much a case where something finally crossed the line. And if you look just at the removed content you&#x27;d say &quot;I don&#x27;t see the big deal&quot;. It&#x27;s more the pattern: the sum total of what he said was interpreted as calling for violence -- not reading into it by outsiders, but in the actions and the words of the people taking them. YouTube, Twitter, and others don&#x27;t want to be in the spotlight if future communications are interpreted that way.<p>If there hadn&#x27;t been violence, he&#x27;d still be on these media. But there has been, and what changes suddenly is that people who said &quot;These will cause violence&quot; now say &quot;These did cause violence, and there will be more if you don&#x27;t do something before rather than after the fact&quot;.<p>The content that was removed is readily available if you&#x27;d like to read it, but you&#x27;ll find it underwhelming.')
