Every monitor I own is 1080p, even my laptop screen. My Macbook Pro is the only HiDPI computer screen here.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure what the point of HiDPI is though. It never made a difference for my work as a web developer. I understand it&#x27;s more pixels per inch and less pixelation for high-res images, but if everything is getting scaled up what&#x27;s the difference?<p>My (Windows 10) gaming rig used to be hooked up to a 4K 50&quot; Samsung TV but I think the max I could get was 60Hz. Games and movies look pretty good there, but eventually I switched to a cheap 1080p&#x2F;144hz gaming monitor because I play Rocket League mainly and that is a fast action e-sports game where you want to see as many FPS as possible.')
