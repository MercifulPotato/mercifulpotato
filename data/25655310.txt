Not everyone will be listening with a critical ear. Played back over a phone or injecting a phrase or two in otherwise spoken samples will fool many people.<p>I guarantee you someone will be using this to make their own MLP episodes on YouTube specifically designed to scare children or get them to do awful things.<p>Models presumably get better over time. It really won&#x27;t be too much longer until people will be able to fake celebrities, politicians, exes, authority figures, etc. As a fairly benign example, if I had this in high school you better believe I could have called to excuse some of my absences.<p>I agree, I love the idea of generating some decent voice lines for my own games projects, but this also introduces issues of the rights of the original voice actors.<p>If you train a model to mimic a performance given by an actor, then use that model and fire the actor, isn&#x27;t that potentially really problematic? (Also, it draws parallels to the Luddites who were not anti technology, but wanted to ensure that technology wasn&#x27;t used in a way that reduced worker quality of life.)<p>And yes, I think there are helpful ways this could be deployed. I&#x27;m gender fluid, and I&#x27;d love to be able to adjust my voice digitally, but we need to be thinking about how this could cause harm first.')
