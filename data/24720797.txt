If the architect doesn’t know the survey, then the plans might not be compatible with the features of the land... but he could still try. The builder also doesn’t need the surveyors permission to build on the land, the survey is just a description of the land. Owning the survey &#x2F; API doesn’t do anything to change anyone’s rights.')
