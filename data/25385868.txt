I&#x27;ve sunk many hours into Factorio and Offworld Trading Company on my M1 mini, and if I gave you the same game running side by side on an Intel mac, I&#x27;d bet you could&#x27;t tell which was which without quitting and checking the system profiler.<p>If you meant triple-A gaming, then yeah, without a sizable increase in mac marketshare, it&#x27;s probably lost for the foreseeable future.')
