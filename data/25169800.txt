Item(by='melkael', descendants=0, kids=None, score=9, time=1605967647, title='Ask HN: How do I learn embedded Linux developpement', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I already have a CS training and a good knowledge of C&#x2F;C++. I played a bit with arduino electronics and raspberry pi (always with raspbian). I&#x27;d like to learn things such as buildroot and the device tree.<p>My first goal would be to hook a DPI LCD to a linux board (Lichee Pi nano) using an image I&#x27;d generate through buildroot.<p>Are there comprehensive ressources (free or not) for learning such things, like a book or an online course ? I feel like a lot of the documentation is hardly accessible for plain beginners and it would be perfect to have  a more guided experience.<p>This series : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thirtythreeforty.net&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;mastering-embedded-linux-part-1-concepts&#x2F; was very informative as an introduction but it&#x27;b be nice if I could go more in depth.<p>Many thanks')
