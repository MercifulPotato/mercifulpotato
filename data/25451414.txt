Yes. Will there be some machines that only a computer engineer could operate? Yes. Will there be come cases where being a mechanical engineer make you a better machine operator? Yes. But do you need to be a mechanical engineer to operate most machines? Answer is clearly no.<p>We are at the point where that analogy carries over easily to computer science and coding. Yes, there are many cases where knowing computer science will be essential to extremely helpful. But for 80% of the coding jobs, you don&#x27;t &#x27;need&#x27; to know theoretical computer science.')
