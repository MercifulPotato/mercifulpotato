You may choose to buy from an independent bookseller instead of amazon because you want to support them to stay in business. Or you might have to choose between a <i>cheaper</i> but less convenient option (say with two week delivery time), or a more convenient but more expensive option -- some people at some times will choose cheap, others at other times convenience.<p>Convenience&#x2F;being &quot;easier&quot; doesn&#x27;t <i>always</i> win against other values.<p>This shows that convenience or &quot;easiness&quot; is in fact just one of several values, weighted differently in different contexts.<p>Or are you talking about the fact that it might not be totally conscious and explicit? True, I think the way the OP is thinking about values, they are not always totally conscious and explicit.<p>Compare to other values in OP&#x27;s list -- they aren&#x27;t all &quot;ethical&quot; at all. Values in this context aren&#x27;t about morality or ethics, just about what factors are valued. Say, &quot;stability&quot; or &quot;velocity&quot;.  A software development process doesn&#x27;t necessarily consciously and explicitly acknowledge that they have chosen &quot;velocity&quot; over &quot;approachability&quot;.')
