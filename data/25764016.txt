(I don&#x27;t think downvote is a nudge, because that requires an explanation or direction, but put that aside.)<p>&quot;The other case where I might downvote and not respond is when it&#x27;s a tired debate (usually political, often over diversity&#x2F;equality related topics) and the comment is arguing with common talking points that use incorrect facts or is arguing with common bad faith talking points.&quot;<p>Well, consider that these common bad faith talking points are repeated because nobody bothers to rebut them properly. If other people (not the OP) see these, they might think of them as valid arguments. If you respond to them, you are also explaining to others, why they are not valid. It is a lot more helpful (you can actually convince someone) than just downvoting. And if your counter-argument is really good, it might be picked up by people on your side, too.')
