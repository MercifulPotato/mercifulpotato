Scales are not comparable.<p>Iceland never had an Onsen culture. Japan&#x27;s easy geo spots are already all famous Onsen towns and tapped. Sure it happens, but geothermal cannot pull much weight.<p>As for wind: Japan is unique in being horrible for on shore wind with absurdly steep cliff of a shore line. The coast of Japan gets deep quick. While Europe gets to build their wind farms on bedrock Japan is only now experimenting with floating wind farms. Atleast that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned from talking with people involved with wind in Japan.<p>Thus Japan&#x27;s renewable energy generation is going to be solar. As it happens I only a 300 panel solar power plant as an investment. For myself I want to see hydrogen become viable because it can serve to put a floor on electricity prices. Without a base demand nothing prevents my peak solar production getting sold for free. With a hydrogen economy, all else equa,l atleast I might get 1&#x2F;4 of peek prices.<p>Let me phrase all this a different way: Japan hates oil. Oil is Japan&#x27;s largest import. After 2011 Japan&#x27;s trade balance went massively minus just because of extra energy imports. If Japan had an easy out, they would have taken it.<p>Which leads me to my original &quot;resource poor&quot; comment. Japan is the classic example of the inverse dutch-disease.  Japan has nothing, so they only survive by building high value add industries. Anything less and the island starves.')
