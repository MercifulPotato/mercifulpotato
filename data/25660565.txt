It&#x27;s where everyone talks for better or worse and I&#x27;d rather keep in touch with my siblings and cousins than make a point. It bums me out but my relationships have improved a ton since I&#x27;m in all the group chats.<p>To manage the best I can, I purely use messenger.com and stay out of facebook.com.
