Often when learning something new, the new experience will manifest in my dreams. The more immersive the new experience, the more rapidly the dreams come and the more vivid they are. Most dreams that I remember are almost like mashups of previous experiences. Very often, my dreams have elements of places and experiences from my childhood. I could see this being a manifestation of the brain managing placticity. Perhaps the brain grounds itself in old experiences and mixes in new ones so that things are not forgotten.')
