Which is a lot more than what you can do for a lot of other development tools that only run on Windows and have lackluster or no support on Linux.<p>Also, they might just not have Windows developers or a use case for running the tool on Windows, so even if the cost of adding Windows support was zero, they&#x27;d have to go out of their way to test it. A lot of open source code might run just fine on Cygwin, but most people choose not to support Cygwin because damn near no-one uses it anyway.')
