There are plenty of problems with the operating system, and some of the criticism voiced in this post is valid, but a lot of it could be expressed in a better way, and some I don&#x27;t agree with.<p>E.g. kernel updates requiring updates to various system packages is a legitimate issue of Nix OS. It&#x27;s because upgrading the kernel also upgrades the kernel headers, and a lot of stuff uses those. I think on other distros they just compile packages with older header versions and there is no problem. This issue is not isolated to kernels though, it&#x27;s about anything that communicates over a dynamic boundary. E.g. glibc.<p>I fully agree with the system requirements point, and have to add that keeping a system up to date creates a <i>lot</i> of network and hard disk movement compared to other distros. Downloading and deleting multiple gigabytes per week is normal.<p>The documentation point is spot on, it&#x27;d be really great if it could be improved.<p>I can&#x27;t agree with the criticism about the determinism. It seems he parades an obscure bug around. It&#x27;s not perfect, so? It&#x27;s way better than the alternatives.')
