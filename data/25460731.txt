You can read for yourself in the original paper, but the authors used a pretty sophisticated approach to measuring taxes:<p>&quot; We propose an encompassing\napproach that utilises Bayesian latent variable analysis on a range of different taxes and\nindicators to overcome these problems. This allows us to detect shared variance across 7\nindicators that are commonly used proxies for taxes on the rich (see Table A1 in the\nAppendix)&quot;')
