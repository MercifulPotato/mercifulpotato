If an uncharitable read of your comment is that you are mocking people and trying to gain hipster points by knowing about it before it was popular, then maybe a charitable read is that &quot;we are too quick&quot; is a warning of some hazard or danger that happens if we ooh and aahh about things too quickly which (in some way) objectively haven&#x27;t earned it, by not being first, and that being first is in some way a majorly important criterion. If so, what is it that you are warning about?<p>Again, you are completely misinterpreting my comment. Google is a trillion dollar company. It&#x27;s not impressive that they recreated something a startup was doing 12 years ago.<p>&gt; What exactly is your problem with people being excited or impressed by something that was done before, which makes it worth a comment?<p>For the third time, I&#x27;m not saying people shouldn&#x27;t think the feature is cool. They should just IMHO not be heaping praise on Google for it since it&#x27;s old tech, and perhaps the scrappy startup that did it first a long time ago deserves more of the credit.')
