So now you have all of the struggling people from &quot;Mainstreet usa&quot; moving toward the main cities all at once (over a couple decades) an essentially a burden on them to deal with EVERYONES homeless problem instead of historically their own.<p>This problem was working much better in the 70s and 80s when their was a national framework for it.  While SF and LA&#x27;s government is flawed, this blame state&#x2F;city is like blaming the individual ushers when the fans run on the field after a football upset.  It was more of a structural failure than a local.')
