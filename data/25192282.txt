He dealt with these debilitating headaches for a long time, basically unable to function as a normal human. This is in the US, and he is a former small business owner (retired), with money, and was able to see numerous specialists, attempted many treatments, all of which were unsuccessful. I&#x27;m not sure how he figured out that Psilocybin is an option.<p>Psilocybin is the only thing that relieves his cluster headaches for months at a time. I believe he doses 3ish grams of dried mushrooms, once a day for 2 days. I hope this gets more attention now that some states are decriminalizing Psilocybin. I suspect that other substituted tryptamines would be helpful as well, without needing to digest lots of mushroom fiber (which can be hard on the gut unless you fast for a period of time before consuming them). 4-HO-MET and 4-AcO-DMT comes to mind.')
