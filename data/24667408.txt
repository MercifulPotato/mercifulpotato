WordPress does it well. I then want to self-host it quickly on a server. Again, WP has tons of support with webhosts that I can just install it without hassles (even though I like to get into nginx, php-fpm etc myself just because of the geek I am).<p>2nd, WordPress comes with a huge community and theme&#x2F;plugin ecosystem. Yes, thats where WP can get bad too but if you don&#x27;t abuse the themes&#x2F;plugins, you can achieve quite a lot with WP without a lot of extra work.<p>As a professional though who provides websites to clients who then want to manage the content themselves, WordPress is the best CMS by far. Yes it can have issues with performance and security compared to say JamStack but again, if you know what you are doing and don&#x27;t abuse WP, you will do fine. I cannot tell clients to use JamStack so that gets ruled out for any CMS needs for which WordPress is really really popular for.<p>If we want to kill WordPress (they came , they tried, they failed), we have to figure out a way to create the same ecosystem, CMS capabilities that WordPress created.')
