Item(by='m0zg', descendants=None, kids=[25182646], score=None, time=1606092770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25182235, text='&gt;  ICE approaches you to buy your service, you suspect it might be used in the family separation program<p>I could buy that, but <i>only</i> if these same companies refuse to do business with ICE under the Biden administration. Which they most definitely won&#x27;t, just like they didn&#x27;t refuse to work with ICE when it did record numbers of deportations and <i>created</i> &quot;family separation&quot; under Obama. TL;DR: it&#x27;s hyperpartisan horseshit and virtue signaling.<p>It&#x27;s the dependence of the stance on issues on who&#x27;s the president that I find particularly repugnant and immoral. I can buy only two stances: &quot;we do business with ICE as long as they are following the US law&quot;, &quot;we don&#x27;t do business with ICE because we believe the United States should have uncontrolled mass migration across its southern border&quot;.  Both are well defined political (but not <i>partisan</i>) positions. Once you start adding &quot;ifs&quot; and &quot;buts&quot; to this, you lose the moral high ground.<p>And no, @runarberg, I&#x27;m not the one &quot;deralining the topic&quot; here. You&#x27;re derailing it by conflating <i>political</i> and <i>partisan</i> stances.')
