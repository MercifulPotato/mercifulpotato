The majority of Republicans face zero social penalty for admitting their support for Trump because most of their friends, family, neighbors and coworkers are also voting for Trump. The 0.1% of Trump voters who live in Silicon Valley are wildly overrepresented on HN, which is why you see so many people whining about being too oppressed by their lefty coworkers to admit that they are Trump supporters, but that is not representative of the actual lived experience of most Trump voters.')
