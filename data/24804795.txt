They merely want it to be.<p>If you have a good number of people disagreeing on it, take it as a humble suggestion that norms differ across geos, industries, culture, etc. Don&#x27;t insist on it, because it will come across as an imposition.<p>Unrelated to the content in my comment above, I look at this from the same lens I look at products in my engineering world. We don&#x27;t find a need to credit Claude Shannon, John Von Neumann, Tony Hoare, etc in all our products. I find this to be OK.')
