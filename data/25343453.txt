That&#x27;s hard to avoid in shooters, where you need that behind-the-scenes information to reduce perceived latency. But games that don&#x27;t have that low-latency-hungry &quot;twitch&quot; element, like strategy games, turn-based, etc., can make do without information that would enable hacking (and they usually don&#x27;t benefit from input hacking either). I&#x27;m currently working on a pvp strategy game that uses an exaggerated input delay as a game mechanic, which also gets rid of the need to send information that the player shouldn&#x27;t have: ground-truth is computed server-side and after pruning and transforming according to each player&#x27;s perception, streamed to the clients. That&#x27;s unhackable in the game hacking sense.')
