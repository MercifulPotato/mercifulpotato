I love it, but I really wish a competitor was built with a focus purely on speed, security, and reliability (plus the roam innovative linked references and tagging). I suspect a large % of users are over served by all the intricate features and many just want something basic with bi directional links that’s fast, secure and reliable, which is exactly the disruption-ripe scenario Christensen describes.<p>Every time I use roam I have a slight fear in the back of my head it’s going to lose some of my notes or have a data breach.')
