I recorded myself playing the game, added sensors to detect walls, enemies, powrups around the player&#x27;s ship and the output was any combination of &quot;throttle, rotate left, rotate right, shoot&quot;.<p>The AI analyzed hours of my recorded games and decided the best strategy is to constantly hold the throttle and do nothing else :)')
