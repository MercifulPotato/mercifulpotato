When it gets to Burisma, though, it falls off a cliff:<p>&gt; But that claim [that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired so his replacement would better fight corruption] does not even pass the laugh test. The U.S. and its European allies are not opposed to corruption by their puppet regimes. They are allies with the most corrupt regimes on the planet, from Riyadh to Cairo, and always have been. Since when does the U.S. devote itself to ensuring good government in the nations it is trying to control? If anything, allowing corruption to flourish has been a key tool in enabling the U.S. to exert power in other countries and to open up their markets to U.S. companies.<p>I don’t even know what to say other than that that’s an absurd caricature of US foreign policy.  Yes, the US sometimes allies itself with corrupt regimes.  That doesn’t mean it’s not interested in fighting corruption, especially in a potential future NATO member.')
