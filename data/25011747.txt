There is no arguing that. And for small to medium networks, JSON is fine. However, when you are monitoring multiple 100 Gb links and you produce hundreds of GB of logs a day, JSON is the wrong format. Especially if you want to search in a reasonable period of time.<p>Zeek can output JSON as well (in addition to plaintext). I&#x27;ve done comparisons. Using jq to search zeek JSON is five times slower than using the C++ simdjson library (fastest JSON parser known to humankind). And simdjson is three times slower than bro-cut on the plaintext logs. This may not sound like a lot, but it is extremely important when monitoring multiple 100Gb links and you have 40 GB JSON conn logs every hour and you need queries to run in a reasonable period of time.')
