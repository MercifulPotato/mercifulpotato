Since the pandemic, I&#x27;ve been using kettlebells and <i>really</i> been enjoying them, specifically kettlebell front squats. The weight being offset forward allows you to stay very upright and it destroys your upper back and core. Feels so good, the way I imagine squatting feels for people who are naturally good at squatting. I feel like I&#x27;m able to power through the sticking point at the bottom instead of wondering if I&#x27;ll be crushed under the weight.')
