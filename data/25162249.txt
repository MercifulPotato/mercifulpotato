Item(by='Wicher', descendants=None, kids=[25162276], score=None, time=1605891223, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25149177, text='At 2:54, the commentator says &quot;[...] as little as half of the 2750 sacks of ammonium nitrate&quot;.<p>At 6:06, the commentator says &quot;The 2750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate [...]&quot;.<p>There is a possibility that they&#x27;re describing 1 tonne sacks, but I&#x27;m left wondering whether they meant to say something else. An image search for ammonium nitrate packaging shows many 25-50 kg range sacks, and a 500kg industrial sack, leaving me a) wondering whether the report has sacks&#x2F;tonnes confused and b) on many watchlists.<p>edit: A bit further on they show leaked in-warehouse pictures of sacks of ammonium nitrate that must weigh a tonne (with the number 1000 printed on them). Likely no mistake then.')
