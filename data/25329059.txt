And I think that probably maps onto society... So there&#x27;s a vague guess how many will test positive with PCR.<p>Unfortunately a PCR result at a 35 cycle threshold (which the vast majority of tests in the U.S. are) does not prove that a person was infected and has immunity, only that there was exposure that is detectable. It may never even have entered the bloodstream.<p>Only antibody testing will show if there was a immune response and if there is immune memory. We&#x27;re not doing that at scale.')
