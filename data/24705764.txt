I had notebooks for every subject, I went over them every so often just to be sure I don&#x27;t forget stuff etc. I was living in a 19th century time-frame and hoped to be one of those autodidacts, Renaissance men, polymaths who knew everything there was to know about the world they were living in. Romantic and vain dreams, that don&#x27;t match our times.<p>I grew out of it and the truth is similar to Sturgeon&#x27;s Law: 90% of everything is crap! So, why waste my time on trying to memorize stuff I don&#x27;t really need, just to satisfy my own superiority complex and to feel like an erudite man? Now I&#x27;m using Just-In-Time approach: If I don&#x27;t know or can&#x27;t remember something, I will look it up.')
