Item(by='mrwnmonm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602262806, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24731045, text='&gt; There is a common attitude among Arabs (evident in this poster&#x27;s comments in this thread) that everything bad in Arab countries is due to some combination of the US and Israel. One of my teachers, a Jordanian, told me how his father would poke fun at this attitude: when something in the house would break, his father would ironically blame Israel for it.<p>To prove that your arrogant comment is wrong: I didn&#x27;t mention that Israel is responsible for anything, I was mainly talking about the US. And I didn&#x27;t say that all of the problems caused by them.')
