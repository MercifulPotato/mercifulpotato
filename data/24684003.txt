Item(by='djmips', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601864924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24682119, text='I&#x27;m sure this comment won&#x27;t get noticed but my thesis is that it won&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a lottery, the kids who attend will still succeed; it&#x27;s still self selecting. It&#x27;s more about the education. From my anecdata the International Community School in Kirkland Washington is also a lottery school and has a very good track record of success from it&#x27;s alumni. It&#x27;s notable that sports are extra curricular only and are not a focus at this school. I guess I just wish there were more schools like that.')
