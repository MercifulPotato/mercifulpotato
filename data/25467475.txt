From people who prefer not to sift through egregious amounts of bigotry&#x2F;spam, to people who are at very real risk of having their physical safety or livelihoods damaged by online abuse (e.g. children), there are plenty of reasons to avoid those communities--reasons  why those platforms are often ghost towns or toxic echo chambers.<p>Like, this isn&#x27;t a &quot;think of the children&quot; argument that those communities shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to exist. Of course they should. But don&#x27;t be surprised when people prefer more centralized and &quot;censored&quot; (policed&#x2F;moderated) communities. For the vast majority of people, that is a feature, not a bug--and they tend to realize that and boomerang back to Twitter etc. when they try out decentralized&#x2F;anticensorship-oriented alternatives.')
