Models like GPT are using the text as a specific instance of the latent relationships that make up our language. The text is an example of english to learn from, it&#x27;s not a creative work being extended.<p>Training a language model, I would argue, is equivalent (in terms of being derivative) to generating a list of the top ten words in a corpus of text. Not really a derived work.')
