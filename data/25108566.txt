US life expectancy as of 2018 is 78.9 years. That is, approximately half the people who are dying of this would die anyway that same year.<p>This argument is nonsense.<p>Say there was a person with a gun, who pulled people out of a crowd, made sure their median age was 78, and then shot all of them. Approximately half the people who are dying of this would die anyway that same year.<p>The death <i>rate</i> is important.<p>&gt; and the likes of Iran or Russia (which have nowhere near the medicine the US has) report one half and one third that correspondingly.<p>I assume you actually do realise why this is, right? Places are doing <i>hard</i> lockdowns and it is working.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also ridiculously difficult to track down this median age number for the US, by the way. I wonder why that is.<p>Do you mean the median COVID death age?<p>The CDC is publishing this which should help: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid_weekly&#x2F;index.htm#AgeAndSex" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid_weekly&#x2F;index.htm#Ag...</a><p>Not sure what you are implying by &quot;I wonder why that is&quot;')
