So I think I&#x27;d agree with you but with an exception for pure-virtual classes.<p>&gt; Also, while iostream is a bit of a mess, having it be strongly typed means that it&#x27;s, in my opinion, well worth using over cstdio.<p>Orthodox C++ would ban this but you can have both printf-style with type safety with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fmtlib&#x2F;fmt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fmtlib&#x2F;fmt</a><p>Which inspired C++20&#x27;s std::format: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.cppreference.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;cpp&#x2F;utility&#x2F;format" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.cppreference.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;cpp&#x2F;utility&#x2F;format</a><p>Which is also banned by Orthodox C++')
