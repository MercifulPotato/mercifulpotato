The NYTimes is a centrist liberal publication that is widely reviled by anyone on the left.<p>It&#x27;s amazing to me that the media (not just Fox-news and co) has constructed this bizarre bogey-man of the left as some control hungry liberals. Those people certainly exist, but they aren&#x27;t, by anyone who is engage in leftist politics and theory, remotely left.<p>Believe it or not people on the left have been critical of the growing role that corporations have in setting public policy for decades. Sure, centrist liberals my be cheering, but nobody on the left wants to see corporations be the unchecked regulators of society.<p>However, equally surprising to me, is the number of pro-big tech company HN people who are suddenly deeply concerned about unchecked corporate power. People who two weeks ago would claim that companies should drive out employees who disagree with them, now wish these companies were subject to the will of the people. You can&#x27;t spend a lifetime fighting to reduce the power of the federal government and then be surprised at all that large corporations are the ones deciding our public policy.<p>The entire fact that the will of the people has no direct power over corporate action is exactly why the left doesn&#x27;t like the perpetual growth of corporate power and of its deregulation.<p>The unfortunate conclusion of all this confusion for me is that this is clearly not political in the slightest. Right-wingers (conservatives haven&#x27;t existed for decades now) aren&#x27;t <i>political</i> because they don&#x27;t have a value system at all. It&#x27;s just confused rage at a world they don&#x27;t understand and they feel is crushing them.')
