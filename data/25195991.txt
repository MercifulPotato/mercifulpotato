An NN AI that happens to score based on age, gender, gender preference, religion, disability status, and ethnicity, but buried among other factors  and not explicitly exposed?  Perfectly fine!  (At least until you can hire stats PhDs to prove statistically significant bias.)<p>Bad news?  The engineers have no idea why (or when) the model gives bad results.  It&#x27;s answers without insight.')
