And that the natural human instinct when meeting strange human groups is to mate, not fight. Her main argument for why that is obviously true was &#x27;just look at all the screwing going on in youth hostels&#x27;. Having had the pleasure of growing up in a town that had, let&#x27;s say, &#x27;territoriality&#x27; as an integral part of its youth culture, I begged to differ.')
