Netlify is <i>absolutely</i> guilty of hyping the holy heck out of this thing as though it&#x27;s the silver bullet that&#x27;ll solve all of the world&#x27;s problems.  And sure, maybe they&#x27;re trying to build a brand around it.<p>But I fail to see how any of this is so nefarious as to qualify as attempted &quot;lock-in&quot;.')
