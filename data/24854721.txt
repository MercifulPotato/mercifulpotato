She clearly was unable to perform in the role of arguing for the french people. She was utterly divorced from their problems due to wealth disparity.<p>She was one of the people who was arguing for the reform of the French taxation system under the idea that maybe, <i>just maybe</i>, the clergy and the aristocrats ought to pay some taxes instead of levying it all on the peasantry. Truly a more despotic individual has never walked the Earth.<p>Pre-Revolution, a lot of the ire directed at her was driven by the fact that she was a woman who was actively engaging in politics as opposed to being a dandy who just looked pretty, hosted parties, and made babies. She was also criticized for being too extravagant with the public purse, though, so she might well have been complained about even if she did the proper societal role befitting a queen. Post-Revolution, the criticism shifts to the fact that she sided with foreign countries against Republicanism. In large part, she was made the solitary scapegoat of the failures of the ancien r√©gime to help bolster support for the abolition of the monarchy, as she was already unpopular before the Revolution.')
