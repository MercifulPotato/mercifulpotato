No regulator is going to fine you massively if you miss some data in an edge case like this. Worst case scenario, they&#x27;ll tell you to do better in future.<p>I do see your point though, the intersection with phishing attacks is not something I&#x27;d considered in the context of GDPR.<p>However, as long as you provide a way for users with an account to download their data, you&#x27;re 90% of the way towards compliance.<p>Again, unless you are FB or Google, the regulators will cut you some slack (just look at the lack of bankruptcies caused by GDPR).')
