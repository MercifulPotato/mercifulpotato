I was in the same boat as you - I don&#x27;t quite believe in alternative therapies, but when you&#x27;re driven to desperation, you don&#x27;t mind giving anything a shot.<p>One reason I actually tried it is because it&#x27;s helped my mom a lot with her frozen shoulder. She couldn&#x27;t lift her hands over her head for months, and after 8-10 acupuncture sessions, she is 80% better. I don&#x27;t know if it helps with permanent recovery, but anything resembling normalcy is better than the alternative.')
