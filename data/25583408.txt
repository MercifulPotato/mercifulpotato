This had a few unexpected consequences:<p>1. I accumulate less junk and produce less waste.<p>2. I buy less stuff and end up spending <i>less</i> money in the long run, since there&#x27;s only so much you can save up for at once.<p>3. My purchases bring me <i>much</i> more pleasure; the anticipation and research heightens the joy of actually getting the thing.<p>Number 3 was the most surprising to me, most likely because I have a rather strong anti-materialism streak.  I&#x27;m not the kind of person who &quot;goes shopping&quot;, but even I must admit that deliberately saving up for something makes its purchase a bit more meaningful, and loads more satisfying.<p>Oh, and I basically don&#x27;t experience buyer&#x27;s remorse anymore, which is nice.')
