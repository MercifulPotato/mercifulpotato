The durability flags ensure both message and queue survive a restart, while the high availability policy on the queue ensures that each node in the cluster has a copy.  And I&#x27;m sure there are a few similar patterns that would garner the same desired behavior.<p>I&#x27;m not taking a position on whether this is an acceptable level of complexity for the desired feature, of course, just pointing out how one might accomplish it if Rabbit is otherwise desirable.')
