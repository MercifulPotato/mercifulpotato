You&#x27;ve got a drop in commuters, and a lot of office space going empty and not using a lot of energy. But now people are staying home all day, so they&#x27;re still using electricity, just in their homes and not the office. According to the article, the demand for electricity only dropped 2%, the 10% drop in power plant emissions was largely due to the continued transition to renewables. And while a lot of people stopped commuting and traveling, there was plenty of shipping (including a big bump in deliveries) which is a substantial source of emissions.<p>I&#x27;m still optimistic. Just replacing coal with renewable power would put emission levels back to like the 1960s (maybe 1970s, trying to find that damn statistic), and that&#x27;s likely to happen in the US in a few decades just by market forces.')
