When we circle back to<p>&gt; Property rights and other natural rights cannot be infringed upon for any reason<p>I am not squaring the circle. If we don&#x27;t allow someone to build a nuke with materials they purchased, we are infringing on their property rights. If we say you can build a nuke only for mining a mountain we are infringing on their property rights. Which in my mind is a good thing. Property rights are not absolute, we just are just arguing about where to set that line. But as long as we decide to not let individual&#x27;s own nukes I am fine with pretending property rights are absolute.')
