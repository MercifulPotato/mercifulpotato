In C++, you can overload &quot;operator[]&quot;. But it can&#x27;t take more than one argument. Why?<p>Because of the C &quot;comma operator&quot;. In C, the comma operator evaluates both operands and discards the first result. It&#x27;s an ancient hack used mostly with preprocessor defines.<p>In C and C++,<p><pre><code>    foo(a,b)\n</code></pre>\nis a call with two arguments. But<p><pre><code>    foo[a,b]\n</code></pre>\ninvokes the comma operator and presents one value to &quot;[]&quot; You have to dig through the C++ specification to find this.<p>So I asked the question, could anyone find an example of the comma operator used in C or C++ inside square brackets in any production code. I couldn&#x27;t. I got someone at IBM Almaden to search IBM&#x27;s code archive and they couldn&#x27;t. But there was the concern that somewhere, someone had used that misfeature for something.<p>So, no 2D array syntax for you.')
