I&#x27;m a 25 year old student on F1 Visa (OPTX) that expires in 7 months. I work as a software engineer at a tech company. The company will sponsor me in applying for the H1B visa. I&#x27;m also working on a startup with a US citizen. We plan to have the startup sponsor me as well for the H1B visa. Hopefully applying for a concurrent H1B visa (source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.am22tech.com&#x2F;concurrent-h1b-multiple-jobs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.am22tech.com&#x2F;concurrent-h1b-multiple-jobs&#x2F;</a>) will help improve my chances of getting picked during the lottery. I&#x27;m also considering a US O-1 visa and EB-1 visa, but might not have the right credentials. I have a Master of Sciences in Computer Engineering with Master Thesis in Machine Learning. I&#x27;ve built sophisticated logistics tools that generated $500k+ of annual recurring revenue in my role as a software engineer. The startup I&#x27;m working is launching soon and will be a B2B SaaS that should generate good cash flow. For who have been through similar situations or with immigration knowledge, your feedback and advice would be greatly appreciated:\n1. What are my best options for staying in the US?<p>2. What other options do I have for staying in the US?<p>3. For an H1B visa, is there any downside to applying through multiple employers for different positions at different companies?<p>4. Do I have a shot for the O-1 or EB-1 visa?<p>5. Is it worth exploring options in Canada? If so, what is recommended for my situation?')
