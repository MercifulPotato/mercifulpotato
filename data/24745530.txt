It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all (since I know what it is, it&#x27;s rather comforting and brings back good memories) but never considered that it might bother people who have no idea what it is (I&#x27;ve heard it as far as 20mi&#x2F;30km away from a shipping lane in the US.) I live about 1mi&#x2F;2km from a canal that regularly has barge traffic late at night. I&#x27;ll see if I can find a mic or equipment that can pick up the hum, then do a little study. It&#x27;ll be fun and also make it easy to reproduce around the world.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve also considered that the frequency could be a resonant frequency in the human body for some people, making it seem unnaturally loud. My wife can&#x27;t hear it.')
