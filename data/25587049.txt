It was flash banner ads.<p>Lots of badly written flash content would (even on desktop) completely peg a CPU core. And it would do that even when the content wasn&#x27;t visible (for background tabs, or if you&#x27;d scrolled past the ad).<p>This is bad enough on desktop, worse on a laptop (where you care more about battery and thermals) but it was a disaster on the very low power phones we had at the time. It made the iphone&#x27;s browser feel extremely janky and unresponsive, and your phone would warm up in your hand. People had no idea that the problem was that &quot;punch the monkey&quot; banner ad they had already scrolled past. The website operator didn&#x27;t know what ads were being served. Everyone just had a bad time.<p>Steve Jobs was asked about it in an interview once and he said he&#x27;d never seen flash managing to work smoothly on a mobile device. He said if Adobe could show it working well, he&#x27;d reconsider. But as far as I could tell, Adobe never rose to the challenge. I think android had flash working for awhile, but they eventually dropped it too. (Probably for the same reason.)<p>On desktop, I remember having an option in chrome to make flash not play by default. That way flash banner ads just wouldn&#x27;t get loaded. I imagine they could have done the same for mobile safari - but that sort of thing was never Apple&#x27;s aesthetic.')
