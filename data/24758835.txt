I could not have done it 15 years ago with small children.  For those in dense cities with small living spaces and multiple flatmates or family, I can understand the need to go back to the office as a better alternative.  But if we were able to setup a proper home working environment (as offices tend to make reasonable effort to be proper work environments), then I bet a lot of people would choose remote first.')
