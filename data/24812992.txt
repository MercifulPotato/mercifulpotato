It was snark and flamebait, which broke several of the site guidelines, so the users who flagged it were correct.<p>Would you mind reviewing <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>? We&#x27;d appreciate it. Note this one:<p>&quot;<i>Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.</i>&quot;<p>Edit: you&#x27;ve unfortunately been posting in the flamewar style a lot. We&#x27;re trying for something different than that here, which gets destroyed when people go into flame mode, so if you could please take the guidelines and the intended spirit of the site more to heart, we&#x27;d be grateful.')
