On one hand, this article seems like a response to the hundreds of other articles, instagram posts, blogs, etc we&#x27;ve seen over the past several months that endlessly romanticize these actions. The vast majority of people that I know that have done this, have done so with an attitude moreso that COVID is an opportunity for vacation than anything else. They bought vans and celebrated with gaudy influencer-esque Instagram posts, and then were dismayed when not everyone celebrated with them.<p>Though the problems like &quot;someone was judgemental about wifi at a campground&quot; are mundane, it can be quite a jarring wake-up-call to encounter if your attitude up to that point was that everyone will think you are some kind of fabulous unicorn for being a nomad. So from that perspective, I am slightly tempted to be sympathetic. And if this article discourages even one person from going on these ridiculous &quot;we bought a van!! aren&#x27;t we so cool? follow us on instagram!&quot; escapades, I&#x27;ll be happy.<p>But on the other hand, while the rest of us were struggling with real problems like being laid off, ill friends and families, and the soul crushing weight of responsibly <i>not</i> traveling, these assholes were out frolicking and potentially making things worse. And now this article makes it seem like they want our sympathy that there wasn&#x27;t a pot of gold at the end of their rainbow? Come off it.')
