Back then, for Google&#x27;s size, their ad business was basically printing money. Today, given their size, Google Cloud and the rest of their non-ad businesses are barely significantâ€”over 80% of their total revenue still comes from ads, and that is only very slowly shifting. Maybe in another 13 years, Google Cloud (or another venture) will catch up to the ad business (though I&#x27;m skeptical), but <i>today</i>, that&#x27;s nowhere near being true, and they still largely depend on that single source of revenue. So are they <i>more</i> diversified than they used to be? Sure. But to say that they have found a second hose that&#x27;s anywhere near as profitable as advertising is misleading at best, or blatantly false at worst, at least as it stands today.')
