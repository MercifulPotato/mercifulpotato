Even at the highest application level developers should be concerned about their runtime dependencies. The bigger issues, imho, is that (docker at least) doesnâ€™t make it easy to separate build vs runtime dependencies in any systematic way, and makes it very difficult to build minimal runtime images while providing access to developer tools during development. Bazel and Spring both have ways to address this, but they require knowledge of + _n_ tools on top of the native build too chain.')
