The best DSP coprocessors generally use a VLIW instruction set and no amount of extensions will turn RISC-V into that.  The best graphics coprocessors use a SIMT instruction set and no extension will make RISC-V into that.  The best media decoding and encryption corpocessors use a fixed function pipieline without any instructions at all and so there&#x27;s no way they could have one ISA or another.<p>In software you can have very low development cost by using existing open source tools hidden behind nice abstraction layers.  Hardware design doesn&#x27;t have such nice abstraction layers and while IP blocks exist designing one has a certain irreducable cost which won&#x27;t be reduced that much by using a RISC-V design.  But the performance penalties of trying to use a general purpose ISA, even one with extensions, are very real and won&#x27;t be enough to make the savings worthwhile.')
