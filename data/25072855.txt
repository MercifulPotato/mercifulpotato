Solar might work if your plant is consistently in direct sunlight, but you need to keep some amount of charge to keep at least the RTC running so that&#x27;s a hurdle you&#x27;ll have to ponder.<p>I don&#x27;t have any estimates of battery runtime or anything, but I&#x27;ll note that WiFi is battery-expensive and takes a few seconds to actually connect to the desired network so you&#x27;ll want to wake WiFi as little as possible. Meanwhile, actually doing sensor readings can be done pretty often. So it&#x27;s entirely feasible that you might do a bunch of sensor readings and then upload them all in one go to save power. From there on out it&#x27;s a question of how much power a sensor draws, how much power the device draws, and how often you want to wake it.')
