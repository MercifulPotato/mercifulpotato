But CoreMark is not a meaningful benchmark outside of embedded devices.<p>From your linked article: &quot;CoreMark focuses solely on the core pipeline functions of a CPU, including basic read&#x2F;write, integer, and control operations. This specifically avoids most effects of system differences in memory, I&#x2F;O, and so forth.&quot;<p>Memory &amp; I&#x2F;O are integral to CPU design, which is why AMD&#x27;s own marketing material emphasizes it so much.')
