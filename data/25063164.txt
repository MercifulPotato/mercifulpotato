For user code, as long as they keep referencing only to Dockerhub images, nothing needs to be changed (edit: except Gitlab CI configurations using docker:dind, which needs to be informed about the mirror).<p>The only downside is, as said, that it can&#x27;t cache third party repos (quay.io comes to mind for people involved in k8s). For these, one has to mess with the resolv.conf and self-signed HTTPS certs for the Docker registry mirror.')
