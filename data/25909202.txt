Communication tool to tell others in the organization (or even outside) what you&#x27;re planning to build.<p>2. A framework for your product and&#x2F;or engineering team that helps you prioritize the work.<p>This article obviously focuses on the latter. One of the most common mistakes however is that PMs try to use a single deliverable for both.<p>Yes, there are interesting tools trying to address this but my advice is to study different frameworks to help you think about what your main challenges are - then stand up the process in a spreadsheet as you&#x27;ll need a lot of flexibility to get to something that works in your specific case. Only then look for dedicated products and choose the one that works best for the process you ended up with.')
