If you’re inactive for X time, they send an email letting you know your account, and all associated data, will be deleted if you don’t log back in. Probably sending a few such emails to be safe, but ensuring there’s some sort of automated inactive account cleanup.<p>So many people have defunct accounts, filled with personal data just waiting to be hacked. I’d be totally up for legislation to enforce “must automatically delete inactive accounts”, it’d reduce the efficacy of hacking shitty old services with bad security, who are probably storing your password in plain text or md5ed.')
