Item(by='juergbi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602239416, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24724490, text='This is incorrect, to the best of my knowledge. 3900X and 3950X both have a 142W package power limit (PPT, 35% above TDP) at stock, with a properly working motherboard. As I understand it, not even short boosts are allowed to use more power than the PPT.<p>The limit can be lifted in the BIOS (or e.g. Ryzen Master) but that would no longer be stock operation. And there was a defect in the initial BIOS of ASRock X570 and maybe other motherboards, which broke PPT but that was running the CPU out of spec, not stock operation.')
