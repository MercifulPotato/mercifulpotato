Item(by='igammarays', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607353970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25310779, text='None of the top comments here address the most obvious reason for homelessness (for those without addiction&#x2F;mental issues): the ridiculous of cost of housing in the West. I moved from Toronto, Canada to Kiev, Ukraine last year. There&#x27;s far less homelessness here, despite the lack of social safety nets, and it&#x27;s obvious and palpable (much safer streets - I feel completely safe walking around at night). Simple reason? If you speak the local language (Russian&#x2F;Ukrainian), you can find a basic apartment for $200 &#x2F; month, or a room-sharing agreement for much less. A university dorm room sharing with 3 people costs about $30&#x2F;month. Yep, $30. It&#x27;s not subsidized.<p>Although salaries are much lower here too (average $500&#x2F;month), rent is still so affordable that any basic wage labourer or taxi driver can afford to put a roof over their heads for themselves and a partner (even 1 kid). No wonder there&#x27;s so little homelessness, and even my taxi driver is happily married with kids.<p>There&#x27;s something wrong with Western society when you need to work multiple minimum-wage jobs just to pay rent.')
