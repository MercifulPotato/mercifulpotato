So AQI definitely improves when they are run.<p>My house basically has a natural set point that the exchanger runs at per season.  Much like my thermostat I can basically leave it at a setting for a season and it works well.<p>There are a few days I may have to slightly adjust things, usually when there&#x27;s a big temp swing, so if it were more automated that&#x27;d be better but in general I have to maintain conditioned air in both the winter and summer to keep the house stable... and the house seems happier for it.')
