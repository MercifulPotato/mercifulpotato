As an Indian, I accept there&#x27;s a lot of cultural problems and crap in the country but to the degree that people will prostrate before the Western elite reminds me of our colonial days. Like, literally everything in that paragraph could be written about literally any part of the world cause humans are just that shitty. In this particular case, the person making the video made it in Hindi so it very specifically created a spike from Indian users<p>I wish my fellow Indians would stop this constant self flagellation and appeasement and have some goddamn pride')
