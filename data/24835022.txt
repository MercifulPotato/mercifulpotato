GDPR is mostly irrelevant to me for that reason.<p>The unfortunate result is that the goddamn GDPR warnings keep popping up, because ironically, the way those websites remember that you either &quot;accepted&quot; or &quot;denied&quot; the tracking request is to leave a cookie, and I don&#x27;t allow or want to allow that cookie.<p>EDIT: Separately, there are many websites that only have an &quot;accept&quot; button and no &quot;decline&quot; button. By blocking the modal dialog boxes, I never actually &quot;accepted&quot;, and therefore they never got my permission to track. Ha!')
