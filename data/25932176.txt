What you&#x27;re thinking is a QR code with the credentials encodes in it that anyone can read and use. New versions of Android instead implement WiFi Easy Connect (technically called Device Provisioning Protocol) that makes one-time codes to create a secure P2P connection betweem two devices, then transmits the credentials securely. It&#x27;s pretty much exactly what Apple&#x27;s thing seems to be doing, only they&#x27;re doing it over Bluetooth instead of ad-hoc WiFi.')
