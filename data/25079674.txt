I can use F-Droid reproducible builds where possible and fall back to Play Store (or Amazon App Store) apps for apps I don&#x27;t care that Google (or Amazon) knows I&#x27;m running. I get to choose where I want to make the trade-off between privacy and convenience. If I want convenience, it lets me go further than any Apple product, and if I want privacy, it also lets me go further than any Apple product in that direction also.')
