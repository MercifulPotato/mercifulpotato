I see several reasons:<p>- External keyboards are super cheap, there is wide variety of designs to choose based on personal preferences, while when integrated in computer you are stuck with one design.<p>- Keyboards are vulnerable to destruction by toppled cup of tea, so it make sense to not put full computer inside.<p>- It is easier to manipulate with keyboard when there is only one cable coming from it instead of 5+ cables.<p>- When moving between places, it is easier to take smaller brick than keyboard-sized computer, while keyboards are interchangable and widespread enough to get one at destination.')
