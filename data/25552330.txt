If you live in a country for 10+ years, it is impractical to not have a local bank account. You can&#x27;t even get a rental contract easily without a bank account.<p>Buying property exposes you to capital gains tax, which is essentially double taxation, because the UK taxes the buyer unlike the US.<p>GILTI tax is limited to company ownership. Which is what hit me. I realize that won&#x27;t affect a lot of people, but for those in the IT field it is very common in London to have a one man or small group consultancy. Because of this, I was essentially retroactively taxed on all company revenues despite not having access to that money (since it&#x27;s in the company, obviously). Truly insane. Then to pay the retroactive tax, you have to withdraw money from your company which obviously incurs local taxes. Massive double taxation.<p>This is all the tip of the iceberg. There are many ways to get screwed as an American abroad.')
