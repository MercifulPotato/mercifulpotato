Avenues for non-professional investors to continue buying shares were cut off.  They were still allowed to sell shares as desired.<p>I don&#x27;t really have an opinion on whether the GME thing is a pump and dump scam, or a real opportunity to enforce a classic &quot;The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent&quot; lesson to those shorting these stocks.<p>But I do have a real issue with removing just the &quot;buy&quot; side of the equation.  Price is always a function of supply and demand, and I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could justify halting just buy orders.  The obvious impact of artificially reduced demand is that the price will drop.<p>Further - if this price drop was designed to protect these firms from possible losses (and I don&#x27;t really care whether that loss was by allowing unvetted shorts by investors who don&#x27;t have the capital to cover, or whether it was collusion to protect other parties) then I still don&#x27;t see how you can reasonably come to a conclusion that looks good for these firms here - They&#x27;re manipulating stock prices to avoid losses.')
