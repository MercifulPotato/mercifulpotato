The fat sticks to the cell, merges with the cell membrane and the mRNA pokes into the cell. It&#x27;s not a modified virus, it&#x27;s a much simpler structure but it has a similar mechanism. It&#x27;s much simpler in that it can&#x27;t replicate itself or do much else. It&#x27;s literally just the code for a protein that&#x27;s found on the surface of the covid virus, in a blob of fat.<p>That&#x27;s for the BioNTech&#x2F;Pfizer vaccine. Other vaccines, such as the Oxford&#x2F;AstraZeneca one do use a modified virus.')
