Item(by='yourapostasy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604223900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957489, text='<i>&gt; Then covered with concrete using less than 10% what was ordered.</i><p>I&#x27;m curious about the logistics of this scam. Does this mean the concrete delivery would show up on the books of the concrete company as two orders, one for the 10%, and one (or more orders) for the remaining 90%? Or was the concrete company in on the scam for a kickback so nothing would show up on their books nor the contractors&#x27; books?<p>With so much being automated and tracked these days, is it squeezing out these scams?')
