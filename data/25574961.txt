The old 420 km section via Tomtor was largely unmaintained; the 200 km section between Tomtor and Kadykchan was completely abandoned.[6] This section is known as the Old Summer Road, and has fallen into disrepair, with washed-out bridges and sections of road reclaimed by streams in summer. During winter, frozen rivers may assist river crossings. Old Summer Road remains one of the great challenges for adventuring motorcyclists and 4WDers.\n</code></pre>\nA picture with an explanation:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.newsapi.com.au&#x2F;image&#x2F;v1&#x2F;481952e93a2fed32c94a09bde57bd5d5?width=650" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.newsapi.com.au&#x2F;image&#x2F;v1&#x2F;481952e93a2fed32c94a09bd...</a>')
