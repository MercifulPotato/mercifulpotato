I also find it odd that people who had contributed meaningfully to OSS would suggest a numerical bound on PRs as a measure of meaningful contributions.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m missing something here, but I honestly don&#x27;t think this was particularly well designed to begin with. The &quot;bad actors&quot; are assholes, sure, but I think you also need to revise <i>your</i> concepts about meaningful OSS contributions.')
