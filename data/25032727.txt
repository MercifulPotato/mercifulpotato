Reason being is that they are picked when they are green and they &quot;ripen&quot; by the time they get to the store shelf.<p>This is done because tomatoes are almost impossible to transfer safely in large quantities, because when they are ripe they are softer, bruise easily and they tend to go bad quickly.<p>So, grow your own tomatoes - it&#x27;s surpisingly easy - and the taste is amazing.')
