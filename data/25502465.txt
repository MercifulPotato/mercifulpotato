There is no hard and fast top down enforced rules. Aside from natural Hack bias at FB, you can use any language you want. People develop tools in Rust, D, C++, bash, etc.<p>As far as libraries go, there is a mandate to use in-house patched versions of various sdks and libraries, for security&#x2F;customization reasons. Otherwise, go nuts.<p>People write a whole lot of in-house software at FB, some of which is later open sourced.<p>&gt; That just doesn&#x27;t happen at Amazon<p>Oh please. We had a mandate to use Apollo.<p>PHP is banned at Amazon (whatever your view of PHP is, that is a top down directive).<p>The only freedom we actually had at Amazon was to use whatever open source software we could without contributing back to it (I&#x27;m sure there are examples where we did,  ut not at the scale of FB).<p>And lastly, Amazon was all about telling me what to do.
