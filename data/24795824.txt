No one in Minneapolis or Kenosha died as a direct result of looting&#x2F;civil unrest, and no one invaded any personal dwellings. In both cities, the only deaths were protesters killed by non-protesters.<p>And from personal experience - I live in Minneapolis, and at no point during the unrest did I fear for my personal safety or my property. Well, except when the police with machine guns rolled through my city yelling and shooting &quot;less-lethal&quot; ammunition at anyone who dared peek out their front door.')
