Search space for the next billion or so years was likely around mutations in well-defined genetic space (4 nucleic acids as building blocks, 20 amino acids as building blocks).

There are probably many such abstraction layers, including like you mention, copying&#x2F;pasting of entire organisms, environments, biospheres...')
