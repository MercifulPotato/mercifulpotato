Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602145138, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24714136, text='I&#x27;m afraid these sentences are weird, and the English translation is awkward.<p>A verb in the dictionary form, like 剃る(soru), when it&#x27;s used as such in a sentence, either refers to a future action (someone will shave), or to a habitual action (someone shaves habitually, not necessarily now). The latter interpretation needs to be confirmed by the presence of some habitual time like 毎日 (mainichi, everyday).<p>４月の朝に髭を剃る is a weird sentence which basically means something like &quot;On an April morning, I will shave my beard&quot;. ４月の朝 doesn&#x27;t establish a habitual time, so the future tense interpretation applies. To say something like &quot;On April mornings, I shave my beard&quot; (habitual action taking place throughout every April) would be ４月の毎朝髭を剃る.')
