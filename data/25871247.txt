Actually, since I use NixOS even basic things like `hostnamectl` or `timedatectl` are &quot;disabled&quot; (they work in read-only mode since those configs are managed by NixOS). But I do use `systemd-bootd` (so I can get boot information from the early UEFI until user space, try doing the same thing with GRUB+sysVinit).<p>The only two components that I know it can&#x27;t be disabled in systemd is the init part and journalctl (because all the other parts of systemd depends on it).')
