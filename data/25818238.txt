Checks and balances, multiple branches of government, rotating people out every so often, pesky votes and confirmations to decide anything.  “Getting things done” was never the goal.  The fact that everyone wants the government to be the one to get things done, and then acts surprised and frustrated when it can’t just shows...I don’t know, that we didn’t pay attention in school when the basics of the constitution were taught?<p>I mean, can you imagine if Trump (or whichever president you hate) had been in charge of some well oiled “gets things done” government for the last 4 years?
