And in the majority case can also be referred to simultaneously as &quot;Jocks&quot;. The separation between &quot;nerds&quot; and &quot;jocks&quot; into two ends of a (lunch table) spectrum is the biggest culture shock to me. The words that separate &quot;nerds&quot; and &quot;jocks&quot; don&#x27;t exist in my native language&#x27;s vocabulary even.<p>For the longest time, I believed that intelligence is a broadly applicable trait, that translates well to rapid spatial reasoning(sports), abstract reasoning(academics) and emotional awareness(social). I haven&#x27;t seen even a single exception to the rule while going through the Indian school system.<p>While there is some truth to it. IMHO, it has to do with cultural ideals that &quot;adults&quot; adhere to. Academic achievement isn&#x27;t celebrated culturally in US (relatively speaking).<p>I say that while also simultaneously acknowledging that the current Indian definition of academic achievement is disastrously narrow and breeds a culture of arrogance and intellectual insecurity.')
