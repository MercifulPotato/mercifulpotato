And it&#x27;s dirt cheap, I think I got it for 4€ ? (though that&#x27;s because Google subsidizes it).<p>I did have some issues recently with being unable to pair it with specific Samsung phones, but it&#x27;s a combination of it getting old and I assume issues with Google killing software (I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> your Google Home !).<p>In a way I have worse issues with my Pebble Time… which Google now owns, to my displeasure. (But it is probably more open, so I have better chances fixing the issues myself in the long term…)')
