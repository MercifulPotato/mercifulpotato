Modern ways of euthansizing people seems peaceful compared to the prisons in most parts of the world. Why imprison a person for life in such places? What does anyone gain from it?<p>I guess a court ruling could be turned later but why not give criminals the option to choose between life imprisonment and death sentence?<p>If the person believed they were innocent, they can opt for life imprisonment.<p>A motivating factor could be giving money to the family for cost of inmate in prison up to his life expectancy or re-shifting the savings back into societal reforms to stop these crimes by working on to remove poverty.<p>Another plan that could work is building a separate island for prisoners with life time sentences.')
