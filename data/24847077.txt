I had coded a simulation in Python which was slow (would have taken days for the whole thing to run). This version did not use Numpy. Then I coded it in Python so that I could use Numpy. Just to be able to use Numpy I had to use arrays, where it did <i>not</i> seem natural for the problem I was solving. The numpy version gave me a 5 times speed up compared to the original Python version. I then coded it in C, which was about 20 times faster than the numpy version (and 100 times faster than the original version). Then I coded it in Julia, which was much easier to code in than coding it in C as well as Numpy. I could use loops where they felt more natural to me. It was essentially like the C code, but using many high level functions that Julia provides. Not a least bit difficult than the original Python version, would even say that it was a bit easier. The Julia code ran just as fast as C.<p>Other benefits (not over Python, but I believe worthwhile when choosing a language): very friendly community to beginners. You ask simple questions and get answers without any attitude. As I noted above, many high level functions that make dealing with data much easier.<p>If you are going to try it out, I would recommend using the Long term support release, rather than the current stable release. With the latter, I have had issues where some packages often don&#x27;t work for me. With the LTS release, I have yet to experience that. Maybe I am doing something wrong, but for me LTS release works great.')
