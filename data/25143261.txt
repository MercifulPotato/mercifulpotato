Two objects of the same mass but different internal composition would add the same mass to the hole, but would be described by different information. So the hole can&#x27;t store in the value of its mass which of the two objects fell in.<p>More generally, a hole of, say, ten Solar masses could have gotten that mass by an infinite number of possible combinations of things falling in. The mass itself can&#x27;t distinguish between any of those possibilities; all it can tell you is that ten Solar masses total of stuff fell in.')
