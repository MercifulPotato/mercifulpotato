There are so many libraries in many languages. Some require structures so that help screens can be autogenerated. Some allow grouping of options `tar xvzf`, some don&#x27;t require a dash, some have one-dash for short and two dashes for long options. Some require `=` between parameter and value, some (like mbed, npm, yarn and git) have subcommands and sub-subcommands.<p>It is truly fascinating the number of ways command-line parameters have been handled over the last 40 years.<p>I think someone on HN should write a blog post covering the history of CLI options. Wait, I bet there are 50 if I googled...')
