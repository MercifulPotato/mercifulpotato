Modern C++ toolchains will do both. Linker choosing one of the copies for inline function is means of dealing with multiple definition problem, deduplicating identical functions is size optimization. Here an example GCC deduplicating can_zero_in_permitted_state and can_fast_zero_in_permitted_state by inserting jump from one to another <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;godbolt.org&#x2F;z&#x2F;7xYrxG" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;godbolt.org&#x2F;z&#x2F;7xYrxG</a>.
