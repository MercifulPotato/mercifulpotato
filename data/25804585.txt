Brought me back to Mac from my X1 carbon 6th gen running Linux (arch btw).<p>The machine itself?<p><pre><code>     - Faster than blue blazes\n     - Dead silent\n     - Cold to the touch (even when cranking)\n     - Has excellent screen and keyboard\n     - No touchbar\n     - Has bonkers battery life\n     - Comes with tiny a&#x2F;c adapter that charges it quickly\n</code></pre>\nWhen I say fast I mean desktop processor fast. It hauls ass.<p>I do all of my development remotely via ssh and local forwards so the different platform doesn’t affect me at all.<p>Kinda bummed that I can only hook one LG5k display in at a time but whatever, that is kind of a fringe desire anyway. If there was a 14&#x2F;16&quot; version I&#x27;d throw money at Apple again.<p>Once I compared zoom using 120% cpu on my intel Mac to 30% cpu on my apple silicon Mac it was game over. The processors are just more efficient in so many ways. I&#x27;ve been pretty jaded on hardware recently but this made me sit up and go &quot;holy crap&quot; everything else just became obsolete.<p>Unless you have something x86 specific you need to be doing locally or need a huge screen do not hesitate to buy this machine. Apple has knocked it out of the park.')
