Item(by='Timpy', descendants=None, kids=[24800529, 24801900], score=None, time=1602852388, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24799542, text='I don&#x27;t want to make presumptions about your experience so I&#x27;ll try to speak broadly, and if this contradicts your experience I&#x27;d be happy to have you expand my view.<p>I think there&#x27;s two categories of drugs and it&#x27;s harmful to ignore the distinction.  I don&#x27;t know enough about the specifics of all drugs to nail down the definitions precisely but a description will suffice.  One category is &quot;psychedelic&quot;, the other is opiate.  Marijuana is a federal schedule 1 drug in the US, right next to heroin.  If we don&#x27;t train society to differentiate between these two then unsuspecting young people who experiment with marijuana illicitly will say &quot;all those warnings were over something harmless.  I&#x27;ll try heroin next.&quot;  The war on drugs is perpetuating weed as a gateway to more dangerous drugs.  The THC and psilocybin family has its risks in the same way that alcohol and nicotine have their risks; the opiate and methamphetamine family should not be confused or taken lightly by anybody.')
