Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608070034, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25435029, text='I was distinguishing between &quot;rating films&quot; with &quot;restricting access&quot;, but yeah, the content of the films doesn&#x27;t matter--it&#x27;s censorship whether the content is LGBT+ or Al Qaeda beheadings. The pertinent question is whether a third party is obligated to show you that content. As it relates to social media companies, my position is that if a company is exercising the right to censor (effectively to curate content) then they must also take responsibility when they curate illegal content, such as child pornography or intellectual property--they don&#x27;t get to have it both ways.<p>Similarly, I don&#x27;t think your local theater&#x27;s prohibition on minors viewing &#x27;adult&#x27; content compares favorably to a large social media company which steers and manipulates so much communication that it can unilaterally sway national elections. The latter is an issue of national sovereignty.')
