As far as I know, Sam Harris has defended the right of Lauren Southern to express herself on Patreon by raising funds to attack ships in the Mediterranean, but has <i>not</i> defended the rights of sex workers to express themselves on Patreon by posting &quot;NSFW&quot; (a misnomer, because Patreon is not usually a workplace tool) content.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure if Sam Harris is an alt-right taboo character, but I would claim that <i>he</i> is politically biased in what sort of speech rights he defends.')
