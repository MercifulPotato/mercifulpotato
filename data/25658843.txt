I think the key is that Americans love to dream of themselves as wealthy philanthropists (no matter how poor they actually are).<p>I&#x27;m not sure I see the irony either. if I&#x27;m understanding correctly, your friends pooled their own money together to help someone they knew and cared about. how is this similar to socialized healthcare at scale?')
