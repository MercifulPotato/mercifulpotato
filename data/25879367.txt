The two are not identical sets though - relatively little overlap actually.<p>The pushing myself towards a goal or exceeding some benchmark wasn&#x27;t generally stressful ... it was exhausting sure, but more thrilling than stressful. Other times when I&#x27;ve been stressed I haven&#x27;t really enjoyed it as much as the pushing. I suppose one aspect is intrinsic motivation versus external factors.<p>The post uses mountains as an imagery to indicate pushing yourself. Even in exactly that endeavour, I&#x27;ve had physical struggle, but have not felt stressed but more in tune with the climb (not a pro level by any stretch) and enjoying it at the bottom of it all.<p>Any others who think we may be confusing &quot;stress&quot; with &quot;pushing yourself&quot;?')
