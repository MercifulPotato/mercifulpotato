If you want to do a thru hike but don&#x27;t know which one - do this one. It&#x27;s fairly easy with lots of stops along the way. It&#x27;s easy to navigate. There are many many people on the trail. But, most importantly, it&#x27;ll get you mentally ready for uncertainty of being on the trail and just winging things every day. It doesn&#x27;t come nearly as close to more serious thru hikes such as the Continental Divide, but it&#x27;s a good way to get introduced to the world of thru hiking.')
