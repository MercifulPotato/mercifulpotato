A unified update tool for Valve&#x27;s games. It was pretty cool that all my Valve games were managed in one place! &quot;I wish every company did this!&quot;. While it was nice that there was really only one primary place for games (Steam) for a while. And it&#x27;s really nice when most games can be acquired in one or two places. I think the landscape has changed and &quot;download managers&quot; and their glorified counter part &quot;app stores&quot; are much more common... at least the worst case scenario is what I once wished... &quot;Every company&#x2F;publisher has their own App Store&quot;<p>Just my two cents.')
