Nowadays v6 is a touch faster&#x2F;more reliable than v4, not very much. If that difference widens much and most users have v6 anyway, then v4 might get the axe. Otherwise... I don&#x27;t think so.<p>FWIW I already operate some v6-only services. Not for the general audience. An SSH bastion host, a backup service, that kind of thing, not web sites for the general audience. I&#x27;m not in the least surprised if some warez topsite is v6-only already.')
