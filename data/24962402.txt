The ability to critique sources is utterly missing from a lot of people&#x27;s education, and it took the internet to expose it.<p>It&#x27;s also one of the most frustrating things to explain to someone when their &quot;research&quot; is wrong:<p>&quot;Yes, I know he&#x27;s called doctor in those early papers, he was struck off the register. No, it doesn&#x27;t cause autism, that was made up. No, I&#x27;m not a doctor, but I&#x27;m not the one making the claims.&quot;<p>All those rebuttals require a diversion that wouldn&#x27;t be necessary to explain if people were educated in how to assess sources.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to do about it, because it manifests as a dubious presentation of crappy sources, but the explanation of what makes a credible source itself is a long and somewhat vague story:<p>- Other credible sources support it<p>- Independent sources support it<p>- Connects with existing models of the world<p>- History of being credible<p>- Incentives align, no obvious conflicts<p>All of those are things for which you can create an alternate universe. Your own network of outlets that support each other, your own flat-earth physics and lizardmen politics, and your own history.')
