The author has done a huge amount of work here, I am surprised that it&#x27;s being given away for free, and not being monetized (it should be).<p>I often hear folks complain that Kubernetes is complex, and hard to understand. We&#x27;ve done a lot of work to make the experience of deploying functions simple on K8s, with very little to manage. But it still costs you a K8s cluster - most of our users don&#x27;t mind that, because they have one anyway.<p>But, for everyone else we created a new of openfaas called &quot;faasd&quot; which can run very well somewhere like DO or Hetzner for 3 EUR &#x2F; mo. It doesn&#x27;t include clustering, but is likely to be suitable for a lot of folks, who don&#x27;t want to get deep into IAM territory.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openfaas&#x2F;faasd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openfaas&#x2F;faasd</a><p>The REST API for OpenFaaS has a terraform provider that works with either version - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ewilde&#x2F;terraform-provider-openfaas" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ewilde&#x2F;terraform-provider-openfaas</a><p>And there&#x27;s a guide on setting up faasd with TLS on DigitalOcean, it took about 30 seconds to launch, and makes building functions much simpler than Lambda. &quot;faas-cli up&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openfaas.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;faasd-tls-terraform&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openfaas.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;faasd-tls-terraform&#x2F;</a><p>If I were going to use Lambda, the author&#x27;s examples are probably what I would turn to, but there are other ways and it needn&#x27;t be this complex.')
