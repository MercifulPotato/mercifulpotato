Item(by='yellowapple', descendants=None, kids=[25326389], score=None, time=1607228929, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320922, text='&gt; But I don’t agree that property rights ought to be snatched from owners.<p>Nobody&#x27;s calling for any snatching of property rights.  What&#x27;s being called for is for landowners to internalize the opportunity costs they&#x27;ve externalized on the rest of society (and, indeed, the planet).<p>&gt; I also don’t think we could keep on increasing the world population when we have clearly crossed carrying capacity.<p>As much as I agree, unfortunately humans happen to enjoy making more humans (and indeed, arguably have a biological drive to do so), so barring either the ability to move humans off Earth or some Malthusian catastrophe, global population will continue to increase whether we like it or not.<p>&gt; Half the planet needs to be uninhabitated and rewilded for species and habitat preservation, conservation and restoration.<p>Which is a lot easier when people are penalized for contributing to suburban and rural sprawl.')
