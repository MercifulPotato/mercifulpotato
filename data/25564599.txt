Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609198234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563268, text='If all that works for you, that&#x27;s mostly fine, and for the most part I don&#x27;t think you should feel like you have to defend yourself.  But two things:<p>1) Not all of us are like that.  Admittedly I&#x27;m very far in the other camp: I run Linux as a desktop OS, and have done so for most of the past 20 years.  For much of that I even ran Linux on Apple hardware (because I really did love their hardware), but a few years ago finally gave up due to the increasing frequency of undocumented things that don&#x27;t work.  But there are many of us (less extreme than I am, who would otherwise be content to run macOS and iOS) who absolutely do not buy in to a world where they don&#x27;t truly own their devices.<p>2) There&#x27;s a pervasive worry around here that Apple&#x27;s approach will catch on, the end result being that full control over your own hardware and software will be a near impossibility.  (Or, you&#x27;ll be able to have it, but then be denied access to things like streaming media, and government and financial apps, a trade off people shouldn&#x27;t have to make.)  I think that&#x27;s a very real possibility in the longer term, and I think the end result of that is total surveillance and a world where corporations decide what we&#x27;re allowed to do with technology.  And I think for this reason there can be a bit of hostility toward people such as yourself who are happy in the Apple walled garden and seem unconcerned about the future implications of this kind of computing model.<p>As an aside, I also reject the idea that it&#x27;s necessary that the user give up agency over their devices in order to be protected from malware.  A walled garden -- no matter how far away the walls are -- is not a requirement to keep bad stuff out.')
