We only need something like the GDPR in the first place because so many companies hoover up PII and tracking information without consent, using and selling it as they want, and not even taking sane measures to secure it.<p>If you want to capture and process PII, you <i>should</i> legally have to first gain consent, and you <i>should</i> have to take care to secure it. If you can&#x27;t comply with that, you&#x27;re not responsible enough to hold such information.')
