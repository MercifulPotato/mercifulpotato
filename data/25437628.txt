Government can outright put anti-brutality right in the contract. When a brutality event occurs, the government is happy to investigate and punish the brutality.<p>I&#x27;ve been saying this for more than a decade.  Sure you can (and probably should0 have prosecutors or detectives and special cases to be be state run, whatever, that doesn&#x27;t really matter because those guys weren&#x27;t the problem.  The officers who are just standing around securing street corners or on patrol (i.e the officers who are the bulk of the department&#x27;s man-hours) need to be replaced with private security that is deputized by the municipality they are working for for the time they are clocked in.  Sure you can still have policing for revenue or other BS but those will have to be done at the behest of the municipality but making the police replaceable at least puts pressure on them to satisfy the terms of their contract and give the municipalities an avenue for wholesale replacement if they really screw up.  The big municipalities can even hedge their bets by contracting with multiple providers.  Policing is no different that street sweeping or trash pickup.  Having them be &quot;just contractors&quot; also moves things a step back toward civilian police forces.  It&#x27;s just another municipal service.  We need to treat it like one.')
