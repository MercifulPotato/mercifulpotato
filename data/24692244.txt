Both these approaches have the effect of politicising the matter. In England, the legal system has its own (somewhat arcane) solution for appointing judges.<p>Personally I strongly favour this approach. Judges should not be overtly political, and the process for their appointment should be closer to the way we certify doctors than to the way we choose politicians.<p>The English system doesn&#x27;t provide an ironclad guarantee against   political meddling, but there&#x27;s always a tradeoff there: we want both accountability and independence, and these are opposing.
