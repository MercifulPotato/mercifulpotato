Former mac native developer here, moving to a new company. My new corp gave me the option of a thinkpad running windows or a Mac, and I chose the mac just so I could have a sane terminal experience, UNIX-like tools, etc.<p>I would vastly prefer to use Linux, but unfortunately that&#x27;s just not an option for a company-issued machine at this juncture--and in my experience it&#x27;s easier to spin up a VM on a Mac than a Windows box.<p>Being a Mac native dev, I&#x27;m very acutely aware of the pain other devs go through with Apple and their APIs, but unfortunately Macs remain a better platform to write code on in my personal experience.')
