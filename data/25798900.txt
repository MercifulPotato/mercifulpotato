We know when it might be unsafe, and if a bus is approaching and you tell me to go, I wouldn&#x27;t. But it might help a lot to actually reach the right street&#x2F;find the second inaccessible traffic light&#x2F;etc. You could also make sure that you describe the potential route to be taken, which might make it safer still. Sometimes a &quot;A little left&quot; or &quot;You&#x27;re turning onto another road&quot; can be very helpful, which I assume was more or less the case. :)')
