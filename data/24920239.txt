We&#x27;re in a pandemic; pandemics push the market around. But they also end.<p>But mechanically, yes. The Fed can&#x27;t collapse while it&#x27;s the controlling institution of the dollar. The dollar is the world&#x27;s reserve currency. It&#x27;s the denomination unit for paying IMF loans. It&#x27;s the unit of money other countries shove under a big ol&#x27; mattress (with scary-looking guards around it) to backstop a collapse of <i>their</i> national currency. The dollar is so deeply baked into international economics that only global shocks can fundamentally shake its value as a currency.<p>If that changes, the Fed&#x27;s power base becomes heavily disrupted, but most of us in the US won&#x27;t notice because we&#x27;ll be too busy riding in gangs with our fellow War Boyz hunting down the last reserves of Go Juice for our Death Rigz under a burning sky. ;)')
