Yes, some shows knock it out of the park in season 1.  Other shows take a few seasons to really hit their stride.<p>It appears Netflix is taking a SV&#x2F;VC approach to shows.  Spend big, fail fast, and count on a small number of massive hits to succeed.  While this may pad revenue in the short term, I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s the best long-term play.  If subscribers get annoyed at short production runs and inconsistent programming, they leave and go to Disney or Hulu or Amazon.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m not in the industry at all, so I could be wrong.  But, as a consumer, it is annoying to have Netflix push a few shows really hard, only to have them cancelled after 8 episodes.')
