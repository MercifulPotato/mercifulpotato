I saw a video of a doctor(?) streaming a video alone in his own home in Germany, when armed police stormed his home and arrested him for objecting to the narrative. That&#x27;s not science. Anyway, can we really blame the common man for distrusting &quot;science&quot; when so much of it has become a shallow tool for political&#x2F;social activism in recent years?<p>Nobody is refusing vaccines without reason. That you think it is without reason is either disingenuous or uninformed. And I&#x27;d add that the idea that people should accept an injection simply because they can&#x27;t present a satisfactory reason for refusal is pernicious. The burden is not on them.<p>There are some who believe in wide scale fraud without evidence, I suppose, but that&#x27;s a small minority. Most are simply unsatisfied by the evidence in favour, and sensibly don&#x27;t take the prospect of a mysterious injection lightly. Regardless, I would argue there are far more people who believe in large scale competent benevolence with no evidence (or even evidence to the contrary).')
