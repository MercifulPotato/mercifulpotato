The &quot;aligned&quot; environment is available in MathJax too. The &quot;aligned&quot; environment is meant to be a part of a larger displayed math block, i.e., it goes between \\[ and \\] or $$ and $$. The &quot;align&quot; environment, on the other hand, is a standalone environment that can be used outside displayed math block.<p>While the &quot;aligned&quot; environment is supported by both MathJax and KaTeX, the &quot;align&quot; environment is supported by MathJax only.')
