That would cause a lot of noise while filming, and they usually record sound too. They rather use &quot;electronic shutter&quot; while filming, which is just another name for ignoring some exposure time. So it would count as one click, or maybe less.<p>&gt; can you completely avoid using a battery with a power line adapter?<p>This is going to depend on the particular camera. I just tested a mirrorless camera, doesn&#x27;t work without a battery, and doesn&#x27;t use the DC power while on.')
