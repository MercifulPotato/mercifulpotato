You don&#x27;t want to put something of unknown effect into your body. You especially don&#x27;t want to put something unknown into everyone&#x27;s body all at once. It&#x27;s not &quot;good vs. bad&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;safe vs. not safe&quot;.

It would be  pretty shocking if there wasn&#x27;t an inflection point at which we see some heavy consequences for humans as well in terms of plastic concentration. Maybe we won&#x27;t reach that level practically for a long time, maybe we will. I lean towards thinking we won&#x27;t see too drastic of a consequence in the next 200 years (not backed up by anything) but I&#x27;d still say it&#x27;s definitively a problem.')
