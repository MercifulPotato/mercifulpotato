Repeat 30-40 times. It is circular and continuous, you don&#x27;t pause. Then exhale all the way out after your 35th cycle. Hold until you feel the intense urge to breath. Then inhale and hold for 15 seconds.<p>Repeat above 4-5 times. Optional: On the last rep, see how many push ups you can do when you fully exhale. Most people can do 30 to 50% past their max.')
