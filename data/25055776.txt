Or blaming the users. In case you are, I&#x27;ll share two of my personal experiences.<p>I hot fixed the VVPAT for my poll site&#x27;s touchscreen. The cheap bent metal got warped, preventing correct operation. Imagine you had to change the thermal paper for a cash register made by lowest bid contractor designed by grifters who&#x27;ve never seen a cash register.

So they swamped parts and cards until they got it to work. Deemed a success. In truth, the only thing proven was that one of their printers could make marks on paper, given enough fiddling.')
