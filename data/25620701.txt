The U.S. gov&#x27;t? Assume they do, what is to stop Apple from moving operations overseas to evade the breakup. That would be a huge loss to the engineering talent in Cupertino.<p>Also I have noticed this narrative increasing online. A size-able company&#x2F;mega corp does something the public assumes is done with malice and the ONLY solution is to &quot;break up&quot; the company. I think this narrative is misguided.')
