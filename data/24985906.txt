I think of the HBO show Rome where Pompey is moaning to other characters about how all his actions in battle were &quot;perfectly correct&quot; and he couldn&#x27;t believe he had been defeated despite what was perfectly correct.<p>Managers, nominal leaders, in other words, focus on doing what they perceive they are supposed to do.  Contrast that with true leaders who focus on doing what actually matters - i.e. the right things.<p>If you are interested in results, you have to pursue what actually matters and not just what conventional wisdom says, or what people say.  You also have to be willing to risk &quot;doing things wrong&quot;.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s a platitude.  Maybe it&#x27;s a useful heuristic for some people to ask &quot;Am I trying to do the right thing, or am I trying to do things right?&quot;  Probably depends on what your prior beliefs and attitudes are.')
