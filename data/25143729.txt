Of those, many made it to the front page with 10+ votes.<p>I contacted Dang and he was clear it was users censoring it, further that some users were also &quot;vouching&quot; for my posts. It&#x27;s to the point, people don&#x27;t want to know.<p>I feel I&#x27;m fairly even handed in my discussion. Here&#x27;s a couple of my posts (who knows if I&#x27;ll get flagged):<p>- Public Safety Announcement: The 2020 Election is Not Over (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;austingwalters.com&#x2F;public-safety-announcement-the-2020-election-is-not-over-as-of-nov-11-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;austingwalters.com&#x2F;public-safety-announcement-the-20...</a>)<p>- Firearms by the Numbers (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;austingwalters.com&#x2F;firearms-by-the-numbers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;austingwalters.com&#x2F;firearms-by-the-numbers&#x2F;</a>)<p>- Update: The Dead Vote In Michigan â€“ Voter Database Being Modified (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;austingwalters.com&#x2F;update-the-dead-vote-in-michigan&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;austingwalters.com&#x2F;update-the-dead-vote-in-michigan&#x2F;</a>)<p>NOTE: I make no real claims in there, simply state the counter argument to the main media narrative. I have a blog post itself there.<p>I&#x27;m SERIOUSLY concerned about the fact both sides of the political spectrum have no idea what the other is claiming. I&#x27;m desperately trying to get my social circle to understand.')
