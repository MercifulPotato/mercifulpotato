I meant in general prematurely optimizing by using Go’s concurrency primitives. It’s so easy to goroutine-ize a simple for loop with a waitgroup, but it can quickly get complicated with stop channels, cancellations, error handling&#x2F;propagating, graceful shutdown which is then a source of bugs.')
