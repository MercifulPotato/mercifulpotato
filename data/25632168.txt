You&#x27;re talking about enforcing perpetual conditions on the future of the product&#x2F;license for your free labor.  This is the reason why projects like MAME have contributor agreements now.<p>Even if through some process the license changes in the future, your contributions were still to an open source license and that version of the code will remain open forever.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen anyone discouraged from contributing to OSS-licensed projects that are not GPL unless they are an extreme ideologue.  I myself generally prefer to license my work with something like MIT or Apache (read: the ISC license, generally) and that choice is absolutely fine.')
