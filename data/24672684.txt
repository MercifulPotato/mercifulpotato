The question of &quot;compatability&quot; (sic) is not even addressed.<p>&gt; I didnt say it was THE unification theory of QM and GR, you somehow inferred that<p>I did not. Here&#x27;s what I wrote: &quot;This is not unification of QM and GR, it&#x27;s a classical construction&quot;. Not the absence of any &quot;THE&quot;, whether capitalized or not.<p>&gt; I could add that quote and it would change nothing as far as I&#x27;m concerned what the authors stance is<p>Because you do not understand what the author is saying. He&#x27;s presenting a purely classical model which displays some features (in particular charge quantization) also seen in quantum mechanical ones. That does not make it a quantum theory, any more than the discrete eigenfrequencies of a vibrating classical string make a classical model of vibrating strings a quantum theory.')
