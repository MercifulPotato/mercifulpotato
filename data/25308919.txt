The relevant MW definition is &quot;a false threat or claim intended to deter or deceive someone.&quot; So in this context, it&#x27;s a claim you won&#x27;t really leave if you don&#x27;t get your way. But the other party may decide to get rid of you anyway based on the bluff. (Thinking about it, it&#x27;s probably reasonable to call it a bluff but that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t consequences if the other party calls you on it.)')
