Item(by='ltr_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601911744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24683897, text='&gt; Did you continue to feel that way after the episode?<p>yes, but not without effort,its like that episode taught me how to make connections more easily, or be aware of them more consciously. I remember it wasn&#x27;t rare to be told on my work: - how the hell did you know it was that? when i was asked to take a look into a problem&#x2F;tools&#x2F;frameworks even areas not related at all to what I was doing, my answer often was, i don&#x27;t know. it happened to me so often that i thought that the information was there and the connections were made without being conscious.<p>Also happen that is extremely hard to express my self or explain things that i know i can handle in my mind, but i guess im just shy.<p>&gt; When things connect or we&#x27;re making progress, we tend to feel happy&#x2F;euphoric. So what is the reason that the doctor recognized the above as bipolar type 2?<p>I guess i was very talky,remember commenting him that I memorized&#x2F;learned a bunch of stuff and i was able to recall it at will, I was very exited, too much I guess. he told me &quot;a little bit more.. and you are going to think you can fly and jump off a building&quot;, so he told me to call him every day that week to report, I was delusional. Also, the diagnosis made me think of the past, and saw a very clear pattern of ups and downs. I don&#x27;t feel depressed when I&#x27;m down, I just become apathetic, bored, angry and results in frustration , the energy is there,and its too much, but I&#x27;m there paralyzed. also my ability to express ideas, opinions or just the use of the words degrade substantially.<p>&gt; When does &quot;feeling optimistic&quot; end and where does &quot;bipolar&quot; start?<p>In my experience with states of hypomania: the optimism is just not proportional to the achievements I guess, but you aren&#x27;t going to be aware of that. you become another person, your confidence go to the roof, and your anxiety to 0, you feel at the top of the world, you can easily become a con artist if you want. that is when you start to do things that puts you in danger, physically, monetary , sexually,etc...<p>*sorry for my English, not native speaker.\nedit: new line')
