Floats and weights in the right places, together with the tide going up and down ought to be able to turn it over.  It wouldn&#x27;t be too expensive either because all work could be done above the waterline at low tide.<p>When it&#x27;s the right way up, industrial diesel powered pumps could pump it out enough to float and reuse.<p>Perhaps there were political reasons? (ie. if the ship is refloated, the original owner would own it, whereas if its scrapped the port authority can take the collected &#x27;litter&#x27; as payment for the work)')
