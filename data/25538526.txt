Item(by='ptx', descendants=None, kids=[25539246], score=None, time=1608925315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25538138, text='&gt; I have no idea what the point is.<p>As a lone developer, it lets you easily snapshot the state of your code at appropriate points and then compare those to the current state to find out what you broke. Of course, you can also do this by making copies manually, but that gets complicated if the program consists of more than file.<p>The real benefit is when you have more than one developer working on the program. If you make some changes on your machine, and I make some changes on my machine, and when we&#x27;re done we want a single unified version of the program (with both your changes and mine) in order to deploy it, what should that look like? If all we can see is that line 123 in some file is different in your version and my version, how do we know which version of that line we want?<p>Git keeps track of (in the form of a graph structure) the fact than your version 1 is a descendant of our original version, your version 2 descends from your version 1, my version 1 descends from the original version, and so on ... and when we merge our versions, we get a final version that descends both from your latest version and mine.<p>You could do all this bookkeeping manually and figure out what to diff against what, but git gives you tools to work with.')
