He doesn&#x27;t look all that young. I&#x27;m surprised that he has chosen to do his MSc now, <i>assuming it will be a MSc related to computer science</i>. Somehow, I&#x27;ve always been under the impression that, when it comes to comp sci, because it&#x27;s so close to mathematics in nature, you either get all the way to PhD blazingly fast, or you never get past Bachelor&#x27;s degree. Although, of course, I don&#x27;t have any data to back that up.<p>EDIT: I just looked at the blog post again. It&#x27;s linked to another one where he says it will be a MSc Digital and Technology Specialist, so maybe it won&#x27;t be very mathematics heavy.')
