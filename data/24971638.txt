And instead of a jailbreak, you decide to do your own brake job on your car.<p>&quot;And after you do your own brake job on your Honda and cause an injury accident, who&#x27;s to know? Just say you didn&#x27;t, and it was Honda&#x27;s defect.&quot;<p>This applies to any kind of thing you do to your own car. There&#x27;s always some chance that something can go wrong and cause a huge wreck. There&#x27;s always a part that can go bad, and there&#x27;s always going to be someone who lies to cover up or blames the manufacturer.<p>You could drive your wheel into a curb, damage your suspension, and then have it fall off a week later and crash into oncoming traffic. And still blame the manufacturer for it.<p>The point is, you don&#x27;t need to modify a car, or jailbreak it, or anything for these lawsuits to happen.')
