Item(by='istorical', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610049668, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25671450, text='The idea of buying art that would seem to have not been created with specific intent or meaning but instead was created with randomness or through imitation or some set of rules may seem kind of strange, because a lot of what art is about is the meaning behind the piece, whether the meaning the artist meant to impart or the meaning the observer finds in the piece.<p>But with any current &quot;AI&quot; or procedurally generated thing, rather than thinking of the &quot;AI&quot; as the artist, the artist is the one who created the rule set, the algorithm, the bounds of the creation, the way the &quot;AI&quot; determines what to make. So we can think of the meaning or decisions of the artist in this case not as ideas or meaning or decisions of the AI generating these pieces but rather the ideas or meaning or reasons for the creator or implementer of these algorithms to shape this &quot;AI&quot; the way they did.<p>Still perhaps not to the taste of everyone, or even most, but in a world where tools and mediums continue to evolve towards complexity and being more hands-off, the artistic choices change but until we have hard AI or AI with consciousness, there will still be a hand that ultimately set the thing in motion even if one more step removed.<p>That being said, in this case the artist who created the rules for creation here may be a good artist in one&#x27;s taste or a bad artist in one&#x27;s taste, and all of the above is not to defend or criticize this particular website or body of work, but to simply help anyone else feeling a bit annoyed by this work or the price on it to take a step back and consider that the idea of art made by an &quot;AI&quot; can still be meaningful or of interest, when viewed through the lens of the human behind the machine and what may have inspired or influenced them.')
