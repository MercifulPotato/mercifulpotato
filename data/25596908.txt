I personally wonder whether our challenges with conspiracies are related to the hole we&#x27;re left with as religious belief starts to deteriorate. So I&#x27;m wondering if spirituality is still needed, if only as a rubber plug until we learn again how to use shared stories to more intentionally chart collective directions. Maybe a new form of spirituality will be the new plug in the end. But imho we need shared stories that occupy the evolutionary holes that religion previously filled, rather than dissolving the old plug only to have it re-colonized by cultural noise (like conspiracy)<p>I mean, civics is a quasi-religion in my thinking, it&#x27;s just kinda weak. Not sure if we need something strongly to hold societies together :)')
