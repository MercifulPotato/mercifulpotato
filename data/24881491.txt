I was referring to Youtube&#x27;s license with the RIAA, since Youtube doesn&#x27;t provide a copyright license to its users for content licensed from third parties.<p>If the license between the RIAA (or other licensor) and Youtube allowed visitors to make permanent copies of Youtube streams, then downloading a Youtube video would not be a copyright violation. But generally, having entered into streaming <i>and</i> downloading licensing agreements with the RIAA before, I would be extremely surprised if the RIAA would enter into such a license with Youtube, as it would kill sales of digital music downloads if people could just download permanent copies of Youtube videos instead for free.<p>If you own the copyright and upload a video to Youtube, then it wouldn&#x27;t be a copyright violation to download that video from Youtube.')
