After watching 10 (just the beginning) I no longer think that&#x27;s right (but it still might be a component).<p>As another commenter mentioned the criminals in the news stories all seem to be black men. There are also news stories at the end too, at least on some. The &quot;actual&quot; or purported content doesn&#x27;t even seem to be trailers necessarily so much as random clips from the movie or show. It&#x27;s not edited together like a trailer, at least from the ones I watched.<p>Someone has a large collection of news reports to find a variety of violent black criminals. That probably means they are putting these together manually?  Mental illness? Strange.')
