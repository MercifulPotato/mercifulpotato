Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611302647, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25869297, text='&gt; A paradox is when two contradictory things are true at the same time.<p>&gt; The grandfather problem is a paradox if time travel is possible. If it isnâ€™t possible then it is simply an impossibility.<p>It&#x27;s only a paradox if you&#x27;re making certain assumptions about how time travel works.<p>You need to admit that these are assumptions.<p>Consider the airplane on a treadmill paradox.  There is a hidden assumption that it&#x27;s possible to accelerate the treadmill in isolation to match the wheel speed, but the logic fails because the speed of the treadmill is entwined with the speed of the wheels on the plane.<p>&gt; So you agree that time travel is impossible. Great... we agree.<p>No, that&#x27;s not what I said.<p>&gt; I was demonstrating how their theory gives rise to paradoxical scenarios.<p>It doesn&#x27;t.<p>You&#x27;re assuming you can choose your actions independently from the time travel.  The theory says that every choice is entwined with the fabric of the universe, so that by the time you see that an instance of time travel exists, the critical non-paradox-causing choices are already set in stone.')
