I doubt any criminal organization just trust the platform for encrypting their data, they do it themselves using well known algorithms that have no backdoors. \nPeople who seriously want to encrypt will always be able to do it, you can hide data in pictures, files whatever and have a custom algorithm to reassemble it if you want.\nThe only one who will lose is the user who do not really care, being now more weak to man in the middle attack. That is the majority with data that cause no threat.')
