Most cloud providers will even give you $50k to $100k in credits for 1 year if you are a startup from a good incubator&#x2F;investor. It gives you incentives to not to care about how much you&#x27;re spending. By the 1 year mark you&#x27;re probably making some money, raising another series, and attempting to dramatically scale up your business so now you don&#x27;t have the time to clean up the tech debt you&#x27;ve created to lower costs. They are absolutely making a bunch of money this way.')
