It makes sense for the people who liked her management style to be supportive and vocal about her, and those that were not happy to not say a thing. Especially in the cancel-culture that we now live in and the economic-uncertainty.<p>(2) I don&#x27;t understand how someone can make public accusations without providing the full picture. Maybe she is legally constrained, but then she shouldn&#x27;t have said anything and handle the whole situation legally first and then write what she wants to write about it. Google might be wrong here, but we definitely cannot see that.<p>P.S. It seems to me that the only person who handled &quot;firing&quot; professionally was the most ridiculously dressed person on the planet who goes by the pseudonym Dr. Disrespect. So much drama going on around nowadays.')
