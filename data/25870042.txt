Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25870777], score=None, time=1611308276, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25869967, text='&gt;<i>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the iphone cameras have had a billion dollars of development invested in them</i><p>Which is neither here, nor there. There are tons of dirt cheap (often cheaper) compact cameras on the market with better quality that most webcams, and have been for years. Including equally small as webcam options.<p>There are also tons of dirt cheap Android phones with far better camera quality in an even more constrained space (for the camera module) than a webcam.<p>There are also embedded laptop cameras with better quality than most $100 and plus webcams.<p>As a sibling comment said: &quot;I use OBS Studio&#x27;s output as virtual camera - and among the inputs I use cheap old Android tablets with DroidCam OBS over IP on Wi-Fi... They cost less than a USB webcam and deliver much better image quality.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s absolutely no reason webcam makers couldn&#x27;t build a better product using components found in 5+ year old phones...<p>Even if it was expensive, the problem is there&#x27;s not even an expensive $300 or $500 webcam with quality compared to a years old Android or iPhone smartphone of equal price, or a compact camera.<p>Heck, webcams sold as $1000 and $2000 &quot;enterprise&quot; webcams, in bulky enclosures to sit on a desk or large TV, have some more conveniences (to fit the enterpise moniker), but same (crap) image quality.')
