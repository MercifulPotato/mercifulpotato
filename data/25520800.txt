I have two YouTube accounts in different languages. One has great recommendations. One is terrible.<p>I wonder for the one with terrible recommendations if I fell into a particular failure spiral: YouTube tried to give me some new stuff for a period, but I happened to not like any of it. The AI noted I was just clicking suggestions from my subscriptions. It eventually tried different recommendations. I didn&#x27;t like those either, and clicked videos I&#x27;d seen before from my subscriptions. Eventually the AI decided I only like watching videos for channels I&#x27;m subscribed to, and now doesn&#x27;t recommend me stuff outside of that. Even when I branch out into a new area, it no longer suggests related channels or anything like that.')
