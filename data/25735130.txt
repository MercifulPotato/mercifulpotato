I&#x27;ll throw some thoughts to get a conversation started:<p>I would happily pay for big tech company services - if I&#x27;m worth $30 a month in advertising revenues, I&#x27;m willing to pay $30 to subscribe to the same services in exchange for privacy. I&#x27;m convinced that I&#x27;m not the only person who thinks like this. I am waiting for a product to come around and service this market.<p>&lt;Shut_up_and_take_my_money.jpeg&gt;')
