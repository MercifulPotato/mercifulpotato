I&#x27;m sure older guys can go back even earlier and remember &#x27;the impending A.I revolution&#x27;. Sweet money in that hyped narrative.<p>If you think that &quot;this time it will be different&quot; - congrats they got into your brain, and they do not care that they have done it just 10 years prior. \nWith enough repetition of the same information, and the way the human memory works - it doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>You will help them every time by reliably assuming that someone else cared enough to check history before saying that something is &quot;historical&quot;, &quot;first time&quot;, &quot;never before in millions of years of human civilization&quot;. They haven&#x27;t, and it doesn&#x27;t matter for their goals.<p>One of these times something will eventually happen. Until then PR money, clickbaits, VC money, startups.. the whole classical techno-utopian centrifuge.')
