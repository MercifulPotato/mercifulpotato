It just smells like Microsoft.<p>But I love love LOVE how much it is used in commercial&#x2F;enterprise software!!! I can fire up ILSpy&#x2F;dnSpy and get an easily readable csharp disassembly from basically anything. It makes reverse engineering such a joy! For this reason dotnet has become my #2 language over the past few years.')
