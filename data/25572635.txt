I was talking with some people in NYC about our 5 bedroom home that we bought for $120,000 and how most of the houses for sale in our town are about half that price. The people from NYC couldn&#x27;t imagine such a thing. One said, &quot;So does that mean that no one needs to take out a loan to buy their home?&quot; I explained that the people in my town weren&#x27;t making NY level wages either.<p>The idea that there were parts of the US where you could buy a house for $60k was just as foreign as the idea of someone making $25k per year.  They simply had no frame of reference for what wages and cost of living look like in places that weren&#x27;t big cities.')
