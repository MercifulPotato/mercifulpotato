I saw all of it and it helped me understand a lot of the history of how the current gang of eh..  er, about how Putin got to where he is today. I really recommend watching it.<p>After these 4-5 days, it has 74M views. The view count is at the moment <i>still</i> growing at ~0.7M views <i>per hour</i> - I just had to edit that view count. 70% of those views are from russian IPs, as per the Navalny people.
