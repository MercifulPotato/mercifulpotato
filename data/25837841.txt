Item(by='Bluestein', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611085282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837840, text='&quot;In a nutshell, the problem for users of centralized digital asset exchanges — as well as custodians, loan platforms and other &#x27;service providers&#x27; that custody digital assets on behalf of their users — is that they are required to place great trust in the exchange without formalized and available mechanisms of trust and transparency.<p>Back-of-the-napkin calculations for the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, assuming that exchanges hold a conservative 10% of those assets, would mean that exchanges currently custody about $16B-$20B worth of crypto. Again, with little to no meaningful transparency.<p>The solution: give exchanges a way to provide independent validation and proof that they have adequate reserves of a given digital asset to meet the &#x27;IOUs&#x27; to their customers. We call it a &#x27;proof of reserves assessment.&#x27;&quot;')
