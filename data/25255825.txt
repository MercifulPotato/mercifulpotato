Item(by='_greim_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606755129, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25255027, text='My understanding is these vaccines either inject RNA into the cell (Pfizer), where it&#x27;s executed like machine code causing growth of proteins which trigger an immune response, or it injects DNA into the cell <i>nucleus</i> (Moderna), where it triggers creation of RNA, which does the same. So, in a sense it kind of does &quot;hack or mix&quot; DNA. Really strikes me as a sci-fi kind of thing.<p>[edit] To clarify, it doesn&#x27;t alter DNA, so much as co-opt DNA&#x2F;RNA replication mechanisms. Does this cross some kind of &quot;trans-human&quot; threshold? I think so, but I also think clothing, reading glasses, and cell phones do the same. I see no reason to draw some kind of line in the sand here.')
