I first learned C in order to customize the dwm tiling window manager on Linux. Over time, my priority became simplicity and overall cohesive design over customization, though still in an entirely impractical way (I moved to BSD and briefly Plan 9&#x2F;9front). Now I’ve settled on a dead-stock macOS setup and spend zero mental bandwidth on customization, but I think going down the customization rabbit hole taught me a lot about software design, UI&#x2F;UX, and even philosophy in a weird way.')
