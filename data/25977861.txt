Even some of the ones shipped with the OS, made by Microsoft, not to mention third-party apps. Linux with KDE works better than Windows here[1].<p>I&#x27;ve also read the opposite opinion about macOS - namely, that it&#x27;s the platform that does it best. I&#x27;ve ordered my first Mac (mini). It&#x27;s arriving in 2 weeks. Will see then.<p>Overall, poor HiDPI support on Windows is one of the main reasons why I decided that I don&#x27;t want to switch to Windows as my main driver and instead try macOS.<p>[1]: GNOME on the other hand is terrible. It&#x27;s possible to get i3 to work with HiDPI, but there&#x27;s no end to the work you need to perform to do that.')
