A person can only spend so much; consumption inequality is much less dramatic than wealth or income inequality. So the vast majority of &quot;income&quot; at this level is unrealized capital gain, not taxable at all.<p>When someone like this does need liquidity, the top marginal tax rate on capital gain is 20%, not 37% like it is for wage income. But cheaper still is interest. He can pledge the shares as collateral and take out a loan at something like 2%&#x2F;year (probably less).<p>Progressive taxation is only for wage workers. A FAANG senior engineer is &quot;the 1%&quot; within the progressive tax system, and getting hit as hard as it is possible to get hit. But his founder-CEO lives outside the progressive tax scheme (c.f. Steve Jobs and his $1 salary), barely has a foot in <i>any</i> tax scheme (most gains unrealized), and is paying almost nothing in percentage terms.')
