And it is even easier to convince oneself that that&#x27;s actually what is going on if instead of trying to explain why the mirror &quot;flips&quot; the image of a person, one try to explain why the mirror &quot;flips&quot; a written word.<p>Take a piece of paper, write a word onto it, and turn it towards the mirror. Now observe the word. Is it flipped left to right? If so, it&#x27;s because when turning it towards the mirror _you_ turned it around the vertical axis. Do this again, this time rotating the paper around the horizontal axis and voil√†, the word is now flipped upside down.<p>IIRC that&#x27;s Feynman who have written somewhere that mirrors do not flip things right to left, nor top to bottom. They flip things front to back.')
