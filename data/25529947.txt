We have casual dress code at work so I would love a classy EFF-themed T-shirt. Most of these have that juvenile meme-y&#x2F;merch-ey&#x2F;joke style though so that&#x27;s a pass.<p>Plain &quot;EFF&quot; like on the &quot;EFF Label Pin&quot; on a grey fabric would have been nice. Doesn&#x27;t have to be &quot;cool&quot; (?) just because it&#x27;s on a T-shirt.<p>Edit: Actually just give me the Onesie design on a T-shirt (not black) and I&#x27;m good')
