I just got over COVID-19, I had it for around 26 days with very mild symptoms after the first 2 days where my temp never went above 101.5.<p>However I still have &#x27;post-COVID&#x27; symptoms. I&#x27;m in my 40s and was very healthy prior:\n- Unexplained fatigue that happens 12-24 hours after exercise. I have to shut my eyes for 30 minutes, almost like narcolepsy or similar.\n- Random muscle aches that seem to be slowly going away.\n- Minor heart palpitations, slowly getting better.\n- Rare cases where I feel I need to take several deep breaths, maybe twice per day.\n- Continued GI issues.<p>Finally, everybody I know over 40 who has had COVID-19, approximately 7 people, have reported these symptoms, some of them marathon runners who can no longer run a mile.  Please set your doubts at rest, this is a real thing, not an anomaly, and will have major health impacts to many people over time.')
