The Signal backend server is run by Signal Messenger LLC. As far as I understand, you can&#x27;t run your own backend server, there&#x27;s some restriction there.\nSignal&#x27;s encryption is open and audited&#x2F;auditable, and is convenient however it&#x27;s not widely implemented in a public manner (Whatsapp and some other sites apparently use it; have consulted with Signal.)<p>I know PGP has flaws, the other replyee posted a link even.\nBut in less than 5 minutes, for free, and without violating my privacy to captchas or barbaric service terms, I can:<p>- Sign up for a brand new email address from a privacy respective service, on (almost) any device&#x2F;system<p>- Generate a PGP keypair on (almost) any device&#x2F;system<p>- Share the pubkey with a receiver<p>- Instantly send encrypted content<p>Is it more inconvenient than installing Signal? Yes, but it&#x27;s far more flexible.<p>And I agree with the other replyee, this reply sounds more like a dislike of SHA-1, which is fine, rather than &quot;don&#x27;t use PGP&quot;.<p>Anyway, yes everyone who uses proprietary or anti-user messaging platforms should move to Signal&#x2F;Matrix.')
