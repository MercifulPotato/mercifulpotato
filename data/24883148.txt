Item(by='nl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603588819, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24878808, text='&gt; Even state polling in 2016 was pretty good, historically. The reason to think otherwise is that there was a specific error (non-college white voters swinging to R) that happened not to be tracked well (those voters don&#x27;t respond as well to polling) nor accounted for (most pollsters didn&#x27;t weight for education). And it happened to be most concentrated in a few states in the upper midwest that were close to the tipping point. AND it happened to be JUST ENOUGH to have predicted a very narrow (sub 1% in PA&#x2F;WI&#x2F;MI) win incorrectly.<p>Yes, this is a good summary, and I&#x27;m well aware of what went wrong. I ran a prediction project for a few years so I realise how hard this job is.<p>But just because it&#x27;s hard doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t recognize the issues.<p>My argument is that historically state level polls have always had issues but have rarely mattered.<p>&gt; Remember that in 2012 the polls were &quot;wrong&quot; in the opposite direction (undercounting Obama votes by a bit) and no one cared.<p>Exactly my point!<p>If you look at the data on this, the state level polls had even worse accuracy. The <i>average</i> error was 1.6%, compared to 0.8% for national polls.<p>As you note, no one really cared.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;2009&#x2F;06&#x2F;25&#x2F;perils-of-polling-in-election-08&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;2009&#x2F;06&#x2F;25&#x2F;perils-of-polling-in-...</a>')
