Buttplug is both a floor cleaner AND a dessert topping, and that can really be detrimental to the initial developer experience.<p>There&#x27;s a dichotomy in this project that&#x27;s difficult to resolve:<p>- Community wants sex toy access because there isn&#x27;t much else out there that does this.<p>- I wanna learn new stuff and also have a weird &quot;LET&#x27;S PUT DOOM ON IT&quot; mentality of having the library support everywhere.<p>So we end up with support for lots of toys, but it&#x27;s on top of a complicated, violently async rust library that is in some cases compiled to WASM, which is a whole stack of technologies not a lot of people are familiar with.<p>To torture another metaphor, I&#x27;ve ended up building the hulking game engine for sex toys, when a lot of people would be fine with some Atari 2600 games that vibrate. Lots of people are going to have 1 toy they want to control with 1 simple interface, where my interest lies in &quot;how does someone release a game on Steam that seamlessly supports whatever the user shows up with&quot;.<p>The updated developer guide (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io</a>) is my first crack at trying to cater to all audiences, but it&#x27;s got a long way to go, and the only way to test documentation is to hopefully wait for feedback from people who read it.<p>But that&#x27;s why try to I keep both the protocol and reverse engineering documentation up to date. I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> people to have to go and reimplement things, but if it has to happen, I want to make it as easy on them as possible.')
