I don’t like mail-in voting, at least as it exists today, because it opens up extraordinarily easy avenues for voting fraud.  In the run up to the 2020 election, Democrats at the state level (where most election regulations are actually decided) opened the mail-in voting laws so far and wide that anyone with a pen could send in as many votes as they wanted in different names and nobody would have any proof of which were valid and which weren’t.<p>Note that I am not saying that widespread fraud actually occurred in this election...there was no evidence of it, in large part because the laws were setup so that there wouldn’t be.  But that isn’t really the point.  It <i>could</i> have occurred and nobody could ever prove it, short of the perpetrators themselves coming forward to admit what they did.<p>Unless something changes before 2024, there is no longer any point in bothering to cast your vote.  When anyone can vote without having to prove that they are eligible, and can do it remotely, it renders all votes meaningless.')
