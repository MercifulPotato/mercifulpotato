We really, really suck at diversity. Weâ€™re getting better, but we have a long way to go. Most of the industry chases the same candidates and assesses them in the same way.<p>What about neurodiversity and hiring neuroatypicals? &quot;Culture fit&quot; is often a euphemism for discrimination against them and others with poor social skills.<p>Also, call me cynical, but I&#x27;ve come to view blogposts like this as little more than marketing for the author and whatever company they started&#x2F;work for. They&#x27;re always vague, self-congratulatory, studiously avoid saying anything genuinely controversial, and to the extent that they&#x27;re critical, it&#x27;s often just as a way of contrasting themselves with the competition.')
