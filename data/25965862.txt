And while I have 0 desire to go back to Windows at all (I do run a VM to do bits of work on .net framework) sometimes the pain of linux can be frustrating. It can be so fiddly and trying to get things working can be hours of hair pulling.<p>My latest issue is a clean install of Ubuntu 20.04, 20.10, 18.04, all have screen flickering. Which doesn’t occur in other distros. (Not screen tearing)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;Yfs4cXb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;Yfs4cXb</a><p>But if I try mint, it has random UI freezing. Pop_OS! Has random things that won’t install because the distro name is pop and not ubuntu. Kubuntu runs flawlessly but then I can’t sign into vscode sync out of the box.<p>But when it works, it’s awesome.')
