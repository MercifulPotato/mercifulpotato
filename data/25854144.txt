However, every time I get into a dialogue like this there isn&#x27;t any proof in the pudding. I&#x27;m sure Brave is a decent browser, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any real reason to switch. I&#x27;ve been using Firefox for more than a decade, it&#x27;s open-source, from a non-profit, great community, frequently updated, on-par with Chrome in-terms of performance&#x2F;speed.<p>Everything I hear is just hollow words- &quot;I just disagree with some of Mozilla&#x27;s business decisions&quot; &#x2F; &quot;it&#x27;s more privacy-focused than Mozilla Firefox&quot; &#x2F; &quot;it&#x27;s less politically focused than Mozilla Firefox&quot; &#x2F; &quot;Brave seems to be a little bit better in some aspects&quot;')
