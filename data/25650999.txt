I was concerned we had a business model that treated success stories as failures (folks feeling better unsubscribing) and failures as successes. While we had some early success with folks, the overall direction we were going was getting worse, not better. It felt naive to assume that the forces of the business model wouldn&#x27;t drive future us (or potentially people we hired) towards doing more bad than good, even though that wasn&#x27;t what we wanted to do then. And so while we still had absolute control of the company and weren&#x27;t blinded by a survival instinct, we pivoted.')
