Huge customers that buy intel chips at datacenter scale are pandered to and treated like royalty by both intel and amd.  Companies are courted in the earliest stages of cutting edge technical development and product development and given rates so low (granted for huge volume) that most consumers would not even believe.  The fact that companies like Serve The Home exist proves this - for those who don&#x27;t know, the realy business model of Serve The Home is to give enterprise clients the ability to play around with a whole data center of leading edge tech, Serve The Home is simply a marketing &quot;edge api&quot; of sorts for the operation.  Sure it might look like intel isn&#x27;t &quot;competitive&quot; but many of the intel V amd flame wars in the server space for un released tech have already had their bidding wars settled years ago for this very tech.<p>One thing to also consider is why amazon hugely prioritizes using their &quot;services&quot; and not deploying on bare metal is likely because they can execute their &quot;services&quot; on cheapo arm hardware.  Bare metal boxes and VM&#x27;s give the impression that customer&#x27;s software will perform in an x86 esque matter.  For amazon, the cost of the underlying compute per core is irrelevant since they&#x27;ve already solved the issue of using blazing fast network links to mesh their hardware together - in this way, the ball is heavily in Arm&#x27;s court for the future of Amazon data centers, although banking and gov clients will likely not move away from X86 any time soon.')
