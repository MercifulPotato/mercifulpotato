I&#x27;ve liked a few anime. GITS, Death Note, I believe that&#x27;s about it. I would need to search for the solution. Now, you may argue that is no problem for visitors of an anime board, but I believe its going to scare new visitors away. Due to this, websites would be less inclusive.<p>My guess about the future path is as follows: your government ID allows you to authenticate to generate a keypair you can use online for services such as Google and Facebook. It would include things such as a nickname, and an e-mail address as a derived public&#x2F;private keypair you are able to use, including a scope (domain). Then, only such authenticated logins get full access (they are not going to phase this in like a wrecking ball, it would be slowly). Its perhaps a tad dystopian, but it has its pros and cons, and websites like GAB will continue to exist on darknet.')
