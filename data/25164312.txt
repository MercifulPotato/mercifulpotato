It would&#x27;ve taken you less time type &quot;hello world gtk javascript&quot; into a search engine and copy and paste the snippet into a file than writing out that bad faith argument.<p>&gt; Keep in mind that with Electron&#x2F;nw.js I download the toolkit binary and then simply declare an arbitrary webpage or js file filled with arbitrary modern HTML5 to be my &quot;main&quot; page&#x2F;script.<p>I don&#x27;t know why you assume that GJS is any different.  Well, actually it <i>is</i> different: you don&#x27;t have to &quot;declare&quot; any file.  You can open up a file hello.js, write your code, and... there it is, in a dozen SLOC.  (If you really wanted to, you <i>could</i> write an entire app in that one file.)<p>Not that any of this is even relevant, because you totally misread my comment.  It was not about how GJS is better than Electron and the Electron folks just won&#x27;t admit it.  It was about how Electron is better than whatever the JS-hating GTK developers wanted, but they were too shortsighted to see the future we were going to end up in with or without their endorsement.  So your kneejerk defense of your tribe is off the mark.')
