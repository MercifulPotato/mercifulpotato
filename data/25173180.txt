To me the obvious example is a website that requires you to set up a very strong password and link a phone number. A user account is a two way street, the website should give you the tools for good protection, and you should use them if it matters. If it doesn&#x27;t matter to me let me use a weak password. If it doesn&#x27;t matter to me let someone hack my account, what do I care. And if the user doesn&#x27;t care why does the website owner? Why should hackernews care more about my user account than myself for example? It could be argued this position of security maximalism is due to cutting costs on customer support, for account recovery, but as I understand it Google doesn&#x27;t have customer support already.')
