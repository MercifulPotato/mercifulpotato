I have a lot of outdoorsy types in my family and we&#x27;ve been doing long, multi-day backpacking trips most summers since 1998. On my first trip I bought a cheap sleeping bag, pad, and backpack and relied on the more experienced people in the group for everything else. The shoes I wore were terrible and by the time we got back to the car on the end of the 4th day I could barely walk my feet were so blistered. For the next summer I saved up and bought a really nice pair of boots which I still have. They&#x27;re the most expensive footwear I&#x27;ve purchased in my life and worth every penny.<p>I can&#x27;t recommend enough finding a group of experienced people to start with. You&#x27;ll make plenty of mistakes and they&#x27;ll help keep it from turning into a catastrophe. You&#x27;ll pick up a lot from them while also figuring out what does&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t work for you.  Probably five years after starting backpacking with my family I was the &#x27;experienced one&#x27; leading a group of friends on a hike through the Smokey Mountains on the Appalachian Trail.')
