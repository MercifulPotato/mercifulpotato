The actual AI good on its own, but their barks did an -amazing- job telegraphing their behaviors. Like if they shout &quot;flank him!&quot; and then flank, you know because they announced it that the AI made the conscious decision to flank and it wasn&#x27;t just some NPC incidentally wandering into a flanking position.')
