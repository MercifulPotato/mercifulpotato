In the fullness of time, it is revealed that case was just a pretext that doesn&#x27;t really occur.  But the genie is out of the bottle then.<p>The means is that TV&#x2F;media play up edge case as if it was important.  Once the justification is accepted, the freedom is taken and does NOT come back.<p>(Media, in case you haven&#x27;t been paying attention is part of the governance system - driving what is acceptable to think about on a daily basis.  No, propaganda is not to be found in China, Russia only - in fact the Western societies are far worse; we are propagandised from cradle to grave.)<p>Have any of the pre-9&#x2F;11 freedoms we lost, come back?  Travel restrictions, water bottles on planes, etc?  They have not.  So, an event occurs, this is played up to the n-th degree to justify the loss of control in our lives, and slowly slowly we tip-toe into overt control and domination by the system.  In a way you can say that humanity&#x27;s well-meaning nature - the wanting to do the right thing - leaves us open to these sorts of attacks - ie our good natures are weaponised against us.')
