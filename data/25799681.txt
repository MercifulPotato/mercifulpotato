It is identical to whatsapp in how it works and what features it has&#x2F;lacks. Whatsapp has big daddy FB to pay the bills (which would be massive for such an app). I doubt Signal can survive on donations from a few privacy conscious users.<p>For a free service, intended to survive with very small amounts of donated money, you need a fundamentally different architecture. Whatsapp was not built for this, and since Signal copied them, neither is Signal.<p>Even if Signal is able to survive on meagre donations, I would think it is a better use of that money to be spent on resilient, distributed architecture than AWS bills. A good architecture ensures sustainability, a large AWS bill just makes Bezos richer.')
