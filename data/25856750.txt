Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=[25857365], score=None, time=1611217938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25856257, text='All employees have radically different ideas about how to organise for success, ranging from free market capitalism to the government literally seizing control of this specific company. The skill range is from &quot;needs constant supervision&quot; to &quot;good at a very limited range of activities&quot;. Any specific manager has 40 hours a week, which gets eaten up very quickly (10 reports = 4 hrs each to figure out if you like what they are doing assuming no actual work the manager needs to do or surprises that mean they can&#x27;t work to schedule).<p>The issue isn&#x27;t that anyone believes that metric-driven management is a good option, it is that at the scale of 2,000+ people there are not a lot of alternatives. I could easily design a system that works at large scale ... but only by the employees and owners being the same people. Apart from that, the erratic us-them nature of stockholders and employees makes all the good structures untenable.<p>Lay out an org chart for 2k people then ask how long the manager has to work out what their reports are doing. Expand the hierarchy far enough that everyone has time to do a good job and then ask what the odds are that all the people in positions of importance agree on how things should be done by whom. To settle the number of disputes that arise in a big tree-like org structure there isn&#x27;t have much of a plan B apart from metrics.<p>It would be nice to see more governmental support for limited liability cooperative business models. The organisational opportunities that would open up could allow for so much. Not to mention maybe workers could earning more.')
