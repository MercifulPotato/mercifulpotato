Item(by='Varriount', descendants=None, kids=[25926503], score=None, time=1611743026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926313, text='I would say most pieces of furniture sold these days are made of engineered wood [0], if that&#x27;s what you mean by &quot;composite materials&quot;. Aside from easier sourcing, I presume that a big driver of it&#x27;s use is the fact that it is easier to shape and produce - no having to figure out how it will be assembled using the various sizes of timber available.<p>The actual solid-wood furniture I have seen is either quite expensive, or (somewhat ironically) unfinished.<p>All this being said, if you do have the money to spare, spending a bit on quality or better labor practices is good. For example, I bought my bed frame from a company in the UK[1], and was quite happy with the finished product (despite some unfortunate luck with a part of the frame, which I put down to the fact that I ordered during the holidays).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Engineered_wood" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Engineered_wood</a> \n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getlaidbeds.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getlaidbeds.com&#x2F;</a>')
