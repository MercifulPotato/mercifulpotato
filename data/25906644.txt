The name of the game is: long-term thinking.<p>I&#x27;ve built several products over the past decade outside of my day job, including non-software products. Most of them failed financially, but that&#x27;s the reality of it. For every successful story you hear, there will be 100s of failures you never hear about.<p>After talking with many founders who &quot;made it&quot;, most of the time those successes came after years of struggle, and continuously learning and re-inventing the product. Once the success comes, the media will tell a very glamorous story, inspiring lots of new founders too.<p>What has worked really well for me: &quot;scratch your own itch&quot;. Build something you wish existed, it&#x27;s much easier to stay motivated and know what to build when you are your own customer.<p>No list of startup ideas can give you this, be observant and constantly get out of your comfort zone for inspiration. &quot;Comfort&quot; is a bubble which blinds you from the problems that need solving. I mean, it&#x27;s right there in the word: comfort = problem-less :)<p>It also makes answering this question easier: &quot;would you pay for the product yourself&quot;? By scratching your own itch, you&#x27;re also putting yourself in the shoes of your potential customers when it comes to evaluating the value you get from the product.<p>Also, if you want to escape the 9-5 grind, don&#x27;t build something just for the money, it won&#x27;t be fulfilling down the road either. Once it&#x27;s financially successful, the last thing you want is to dread waking up each day to run your company.<p>Regarding your point on finding time, I personally work about 2 hours per day on my projects. It&#x27;s surprising how much you can get done when you are in your best shape (physically and mentally). Look out for quiet spots too, I&#x27;m most productive when there&#x27;s not much else going on, either early in the morning or late at night.<p>The most important thing: give yourself time to relax after work, last thing you want is to burn out. Enjoy time with your family, and friends (once the COVID situation is better of course). When youâ€™re not working on your project, be present (stop thinking about what you will do next). Really take a break from it. I cannot stress how important this is, and I made this mistake far too many times.<p>In short: build a sustainable model for yourself that you can stick to for the long-term. If things get complicated, cut scope. If things aren&#x27;t working out, pivot or move on to another project. Above all, prioritize your wellness and quality time with your loved ones. Time is your currency, you will never get it back.')
