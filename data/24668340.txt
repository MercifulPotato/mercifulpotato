Some divisions are clearly innovative. For example, they make the best camera sensors bar none and camera sensors are cutting edge and hard to design and manufacture. Nobody comes close to Sony from my understanding from some camera experts that I work with. They are also working on sensor like this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;5&#x2F;14&#x2F;21258403&#x2F;sony-image-sensor-integrated-ai-chip-imx500-specs-price" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;5&#x2F;14&#x2F;21258403&#x2F;sony-image-senso...</a>, which if it works could be huge for the AV industry. There could be a lack of innovation in japan as a whole, but could that be because you just aren&#x27;t aware of it? Both Honda and Toyota manufacture fuel cell cars, something that always seemed 10 years out, then all of a sudden it popped up for sale. So it seems strange to say that Toyota isn&#x27;t innovative, simply because they aren&#x27;t a leader in one specific area that they were previously. It could be that they aren&#x27;t experts in CG, but I highly doubt a country can be a world leader in every single field in technology.')
