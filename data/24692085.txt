Who fixes those?<p>Or pay a company to host your chat system, but use an open source server and just have them manage your instance. If something goes wrong, you email them and they can quickly fix the issue. Because it&#x27;s a simple system and they know the problem exists on your node.<p>Besides, I don&#x27;t need it 24&#x2F;7. There&#x27;s always email for that. I need chat during working hours. Slack is currently not fulfilling that need, and even if I could get ahold of someone there, that person wouldn&#x27;t be able to fix my problem. Their system is too complex.')
