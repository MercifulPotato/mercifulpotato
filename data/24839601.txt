The ops team may have a different theory, but I think it&#x27;s when they die! We still have 15k 4TB HGST drives in our fleet that are crushing the game, and have been for years. That said, we&#x27;ll eventually migrate off of them to get more density, but so long as we&#x27;re not cramped for space, we tend to keep high-performing drives in our fleet for as long as we can. There is a math equation that flips after a certain point where we can get a lot more density by replacing those smaller-capacity drives - so that tends to be the other main driver for migrating the fleet.<p>*Edit -&gt; For giggles here&#x27;s an OLD post where we dissect drive failure and talk about migration a bit -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;3tb-hard-drive-failure&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;3tb-hard-drive-failure&#x2F;</a>')
