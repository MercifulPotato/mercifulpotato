That way every language only needs to provide a connection to an intermediate specification, and it can connect to any language supporting that same specification.<p>My somewhat limited understanding is that the WASM interface types proposal is hoping to serve that sort of role. Note that in this case, the &quot;web&quot; part of &quot;web assembly&quot; is kind of a red herring; as I understand it, this proposal doesn&#x27;t really have anything to do with the web and is more of an attempt to utilize WASM to create a sort of &quot;universal ABI&quot; that can replace the current de facto choice of using the C ABI everywhere.')
