Defeating mitigations remains a matter of building a sufficiently powerful weird machine. Concretely, Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) meant I could no longer take the popular direct shortcut to a very powerful weird machine via trivial program counter control and ROP or JOP. Instead I built a remote arbitrary memory read and write primitive which in practise is just as powerful and something which the current implementation of PAC, which focuses almost exclusively on restricting control-flow, wasn&#x27;t designed to mitigate.<p>Signed pointers are just a mitigation. With enough time to find other primitives&#x2F;constructs (from less severe but more common bugs) you will work around them.')
