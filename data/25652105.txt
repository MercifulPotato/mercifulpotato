Yes, I suspect that this is informally how it often works for people taking the worst of the brunt. What&#x27;s a little irking though is that it&#x27;s not formalized in any way, so only the people willing to go out of their way to be the squeaky wheel would get the benefit. Everyone else just swallows the extra hours.<p>I know that&#x27;s how a lot of the world works, but it&#x27;s not very satisfying.')
