They didn&#x27;t declare it during Charlie Hebdo, but rather the Paris and Saint Denis attacks. It was likely to going to expire but they extended the measure until after the election. So France had been under &#x27;state of emergency&#x27; for years and there just so happens to be a fresh terrorist attack each time they needed to extend the state of emergency.<p>The election was very unusual as well. Very unusual results that certainly appears like election fraud. No worries though, he was running against Hitler and the Nazi party. Dont worry the governments thoroughly investigated her for various crimes during the election and even demanded she be put in confinement to answer for the charges in front of the court.<p>With that majority he could let the state of emergency lapse. Oh right I forgot, they only let it lapse because they created anti-terror legislation. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-41493707" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-41493707</a><p>Basically the police can walk into any house in France without warrant and search it. Thousands of searches a year and only single digit charges. Oh don&#x27;t forget that virtually everyone&#x27;s internet can be monitored anytime by French police. Or how about the:<p>&gt;One measure will allow the Interior Ministry, without approval from a judge, to set up large security perimeters in case of an identified threat, restricting movement of people and vehicles and with power to carry out searches inside the area.<p>The very clear violation of human rights for years the yellow vests formed to protest the government. It wasn&#x27;t just the human rights, tons of bullshit by the government.<p>In response to the yellow vests the army was deployed. France&#x27;s state propaganda even wrote about it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.france24.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;20190322-france-macron-risky-plan-army-streets-yellow-vests-protests-sentinelle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.france24.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;20190322-france-macron-risky-pla...</a> That was March 23rd 2019.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yellow_vests_movement#16_March:_%22Act_XVIII%22" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yellow_vests_movement#16_March...</a><p>The reason the yellow vests didn&#x27;t really have any updates after March 16th was because France arrested all the yellow vest leaders. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.yahoo.com&#x2F;yellow-vest-leader-eric-drouet-arrested-220652802.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.yahoo.com&#x2F;yellow-vest-leader-eric-drouet-arrest...</a><p>Also notice the September wiki entry that &#x27;a new wave of protests&#x27; and &#x27;demonstrators taken into custody&#x27;<p>Then covid hit and the government went much further. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnesty.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;france-thousands-of-protesters-wrongly-punished-under-draconian-laws-in-pre-and-post-covid19-crackdown&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnesty.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;france-thousa...</a><p>&quot;It also finds that long before the pandemic, first aiders, journalists and human rights observers were among those targeted under vague laws during nationwide protest movements that began in late 2018.&quot;<p>&quot;Between November 2018 and July 2019, 11,203 Yellow Vests protesters were placed in pre-charge detention.&quot;<p>&quot;Frédéric, a trade union organiser, has been arrested and prosecuted several times over the past two years for his peaceful activities and fined five times for participating in what the authorities considered ‘banned protests’.&quot;<p>In 2019, 20,280 people were convicted of “contempt of public officials”, including protesters. This vaguely defined offence covers anything deemed to “affect the personal dignity or the respect owed to a public official” and is punishable with up to a year in jail and a fine of up to €15,000.<p>The amazing thing is that the French people aren&#x27;t even aware they are under martial law and their human rights are gone. That this happened before Covid even was a thing.<p>In this case it&#x27;s just a new measure to restrict journalists from revealing the reality of their martial law.')
