The point is when all levels of government align under one party, which has leaders, it becomes more like a dictatorship.  I don’t care how bad you personally consider the Republican party, there are those who consider Democrats the same way. That polar mindset is the problem. It’s not as black and white as you make it out to be and many people often agree with various positions on both sides, but when one side becomes to strong you are forced to essentially agree with all positions of that dominant side.')
