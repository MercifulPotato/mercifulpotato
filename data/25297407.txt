Squeezing someone through a pair of rollers is particularly evocative.)<p>Although you do see &quot;nerve-wracking&quot; or &quot;wracking&quot; (i.e. wrecking) one&#x27;s brain, the more traditional &quot;racking&quot; (literally to torture by stretching on a medieval rack) seems more appropriate (although the term &quot;nervous wreck&quot; is common.) Shakespeare may have exploited the pun of &quot;wrack&quot; vs. &quot;rack,&quot; so perhaps we can also.<p>&quot;Security breaches&quot; and &quot;security breeches&quot; sound alike but have somewhat dissimilar meanings. Network and system administrators might consider donning the latter in preparation for the former.')
