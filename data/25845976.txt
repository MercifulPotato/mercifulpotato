You can undermine any reasonable assumption by invoking Descartes daemon, at that point you&#x27;re just gaslighting people.<p>&gt; See Cyrus Janssen&#x27;s blog<p>from that post:<p><pre><code>  In China it’s always important to remain (低调 Dīdiào) or “low-key”.\n\n  There is not much he can say after being chastened for thinking he is above the greater good. A little humbling is good for an inflated ego.\n</code></pre>\nWhat&#x27;s missing is an explanation for these. A &quot;cultural&quot; reason implies <i>mere</i> social influence, and self-imposed behaviour. But it doesn&#x27;t explicitly say that - given the topic of discussion, that&#x27;s pretty suspicious.<p>The question is; what happens when people ignore the &quot;greater good&quot;, and refuses to remain low-key?<p>And <i>who</i> is chastising Jack Ma?')
