As it says in the article: &quot;Unions are a prominent presence at Amazon in Europe, but the company for years successfully fought off labor organizing efforts in the U.S.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s sad that Amazon, along with FB and Google, etc. have managed to squash unions so completely here in the US. There&#x27;s a lot of propaganda around unions that helps prevent them from every gaining much power.
