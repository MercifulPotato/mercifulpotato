Some talk about the time it takes to render one frame of every pass sequentially, some talk about more about the time of the hero render or the longest dependency chain, since that is the latency to turn around a single frame. Core hours is usually separate because most of the time you want to know if something will be done overnight or if broken frames can be rendered during the day.<p>24 hours of wall clock time is excessive and the reality is that anything over 2 hours starts to get painful.  If you can&#x27;t render reliably over night, your iterations slow down to molasses and the more iterations you can do the better something will look.  These times are usually inflated in articles.  I would never accept 24 hours to turn around a typical frame as being necessary. If I saw people working with that, my top priority would be to figure out what is going on, because with zero doubt there would be a huge amount of nonsense under the hood.')
