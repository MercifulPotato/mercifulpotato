They allow wheels to be perfectly balanced when negotiating corners.  That <i>can</i> be done with independent electric motors, but never perfectly.  Lot of little factors have to be considered in the software.  For instance, as a car corners weight shifts, this causes the diameters of pneumatic tires to change slightly.  A mechanical differential handles this tiny effect seamlessly.  Independent motors on each wheel would have to sense, calculate and react to this via software. \n That is just one effect.  There are also uneven road surfaces to deal with.  Any slight error would result in one wheel dragging or trying to accelerate, resulting in instability or at least chewing through tire rubber.<p>Differentials are cheap and reliable, most going for the lifetime of a car without any issue or even real servicing.  They are likely the cheaper option than running multiple motors.')
