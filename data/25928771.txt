Totalitarian Capitalism?<p>&quot;wiggle room&quot; Exactly right.<p>I liken it to a control that you can turn to the left or the right. There are an infinite number of degrees in between.<p>My life experience seems to indicate that the control must be continuously tweaked, like a servo control, to keep a country working.  Lock it one place and the system runs out of control.<p>Side bar hypothesis: \nPerhaps democracy works merely by chance in that it jerks the control back and forth never allowing a stationary position.
