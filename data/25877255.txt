I would assume Github pages work something like &quot;compile to HTML, push to a CDN&quot; whereas Github itself queries a bunch of data from a database, reads the Git repo itself, etc. -- it&#x27;s not a static page that can be served from a CDN, the page is generated by an application.  Therefore, in the repo case it is easy to check authorization among the other things the page generation code does, whereas for static pages, there is currently no application code that runs for every request, and so no place to put an authorization check.<p>Obviously you could make the Github Page load a dynamic page that checks auth, but I guess they wanted scalability more than they wanted features, and that&#x27;s what we arrived with.<p>TL;DR: I&#x27;m not that baffled.  If a feature isn&#x27;t in the spec, you shouldn&#x27;t expect an implementation that makes it easy to add that feature.')
