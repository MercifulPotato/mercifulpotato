It fills me with a joy I haven&#x27;t felt since I first learned HyperCard or Photoshop. It&#x27;s just marvelous. In fact, it&#x27;s <i>so</i> good that it makes it harder for me to finish music since I keep tinkering on things. But I can just sink hours into it without noticing the time pass.<p>It&#x27;s so easy to get jaded with software these days because of freemium apps, dark patterns, social media apps hijacking human psychology to drive up engagement, etc. Ableton Live reminds me that software can be beautiful and empowering, and how good and natural it feels to just pay money for a well-crafted product.')
