I don&#x27;t write Metal shader code though, instead I write GLSL and cross-compile to MSL via SPIRVTool + SPIRVCross (HLSL to MSL would work too, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s as well supported as GLSL to MSL).<p>Ideally I&#x27;d want to see shader compilers merged into regular compilers, so that &quot;CPU code&quot; and &quot;GPU code&quot; can be mixed in the same source file and share the same data structures (at least their declarations). Actually, the latter (sharing struct declarations via shared headers) works in Metal + MSL though.')
