It seems very durable and I wanted to get one for my son.  I can&#x27;t find the brand, so I suspect it has changed.<p>When I search for anything these days,  I always get tons of affiliate sites.  I would much rather find a forum to review kids toys, a forum that has been around for years.<p>In general I would love to know if there is a list of lists of the best forums out there.  Does such a list exist?')
