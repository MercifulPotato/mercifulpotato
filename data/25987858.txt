It&#x27;s the uncertainty of &quot;have I bought the right thing? Will it work with tools I already know how to use, or am I going to need to learn a whole bunch more stuff? Do I need to figure out a new docs ecosystem?&quot; and all that jazz.<p>There&#x27;s one point I&#x27;m unsure of, though, and that&#x27;s how to make it clear that when people see failures with the simple-onramp system, that those failures would be fixed by moving to different tooling, and not just replaced with new problems to occupy one&#x27;s brain with.')
