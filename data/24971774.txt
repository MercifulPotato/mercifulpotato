I know with one provider I had in the deep past the allowable packet size was smaller than what most devices default to and they weren&#x27;t correctly sending the maximum size their routers supported in the appropriate ICMP requests. Eventually I figured out that I could force my router to a smaller allowed packet size and that at least decreased packet loss substantially going upstream, even if whatever misconfiguration of the ISP was still confusing and eating downstream packets.')
