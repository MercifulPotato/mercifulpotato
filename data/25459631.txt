If you&#x27;re sequencing molecules over &gt;200bp, being able to eject the molecule in the first ~10bp could be a very big speedup.<p>Our lab already has sub-1 day processing times for this type of analysis, but I believe the traditional sequencer machine we use (an Illumina MiSeq) is likely more expensive and more cumbersome than the portable solution described here.')
