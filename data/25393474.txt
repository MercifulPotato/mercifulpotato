There are two issues, the power and the temperature.  The power is easy(ish) - just put enough resistors in there, and you&#x27;re good.  (If you physically <i>can</i> put enough resistors in that space, which... I don&#x27;t know.)<p>But you also want to run it at reactor temperatures.  I don&#x27;t know what that is, but finding resistors that won&#x27;t melt may be anywhere from difficult to impossible.')
