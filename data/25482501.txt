One argument I have for that crowd is that there&#x27;s nothing stopping Google from coming seeking rent in the future (like they&#x27;re currently doing with Photos), once they successfully kill off all viable competition by offering their products at a loss, which they can afford to do but a lot of companies who only do one thing (like e.g. email) can&#x27;t.<p>But yeah I also don&#x27;t think Nextcloud or other alternatives will really take over unless security&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;ethics become a higher priority than cost for most people, which seems unlikely to me.<p>Edit: Typo (of -&gt; off)')
