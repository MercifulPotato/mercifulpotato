The pulseaudio drama was redhat drama. The glibc drama was redhat drama. This is redhat drama. It&#x27;s not all redhat drama, sometimes it&#x27;s Microsoft drama or Gnome drama, but it&#x27;s funny: all of the sources have really good relationships with each other and commingle their drama until it&#x27;s nearly indistinguishable.
