Item(by='tigger0jk', descendants=None, kids=[25117860], score=None, time=1605561321, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115066, text='To be clear, the reason I was presenting that is that the OP says the opposite, essentially &quot;You have to fear being blackmailed, even if you have done nothing wrong&quot;. I&#x27;m suggesting that non-repudiation is actually a good defense against blackmail for people who have &quot;done nothing wrong&quot;. thinkharderdev provides a more concrete example of one of the problems that arises in the police state, in that &quot;wrong&quot;-ness is not consistent, and you could be persecuted for things you say or who you are based on a backwards interpretation of what is &quot;wrong&quot;.<p>Personally I am fine with the idea (as represented in this comment <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25115654" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25115654</a>) that email is providing something similar to a &quot;paper trail&quot;, and when you send an email you can expect that people can prove you sent it, should they get their hands on the email. However, I totally understand the position that private secure messaging is important and that email should default to that.<p>In the authoritarian argument, &quot;you&#x27;ve got nothing to hide&quot;, is followed by &quot;you are now forced to reveal all&quot;, in my execution it would be &quot;you are accountable for all emails you send, forever, should they be released&quot;. I am ok with that specific lack of privacy in that context, but I can understand the position that non-repudiability should be opt-in, and privacy the default.')
