Summarising why I agree with 1.): With UTC (or whatever other time zone you&#x27;d standardise on), you &quot;know&quot; what time it is everywhere (because it&#x27;s the same everywhere), but if you actually want to know what that <i>means</i> for people elsewhere (i.e. are they likely working&#x2F;sleeping&#x2F;eating&#x2F;...), you&#x27;d still have to look it up, just like you need to look up time zones today.<p>At the same time though, because time loses its relation to the solar day, any mention of time you read or hear about in some article&#x2F;piece of news&#x2F;story&#x2F;novel&#x2F;... a) becomes completely meaningless without being tied to a concrete geographic location and b) if it&#x27;s elsewhere, remains meaningless without looking up which bit of the solar day that time actually corresponds to at that location.<p>3. At the price of creating the International Date Line, the current system has the very useful property that the local calendar date changes at a time when most people are asleep or otherwise don&#x27;t really care about it. With a single global time zone on the other hand, no matter what meridian you choose, 00:00 will happen right in the middle of the waking hours of a significant fraction of the planet. Having the calendar date change in the middle of the calendar is incredibly confusing and would necessitate using unwieldy double dates (&quot;today is the 14th&#x2F;15th&quot;) to make things unambiguous again. Public holidays and suchlike would have to be specified with starting and ending hours instead of being able to rely on the sensible default of midnight <i>local</i> time (and doing so would effectively reintroduce some sort of time zones through the back door, which calendar software would have to be able to handle, too â€“ unless you want to force half of the world having their holidays starting and ending during typical waking hours)<p>Right now this is only a common problem when having to coordinate things with people in significantly differing time zones, but under your proposal, those unlucky people that are <i>not</i> living near the meridian will have to deal with it constantly when dealing with their local time (which for most people will be <i>much more</i> frequently that having to schedule a meeting with someone on the opposite site of the planet).')
