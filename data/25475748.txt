Inflation is the devaluation of currency. A UBI just moves it from one person to another. So one person buys a $60,000 Mercedes instead of a $90,000 Maserati, then three other people buy a $30,000 Model 3 instead of a $20,000 Focus. It&#x27;s not inflation, you&#x27;re paying more money in order to get more valuable stuff. You&#x27;re not bidding on a finite supply of $30,000 cars, if people have more money then they&#x27;ll just make more of those cars, and more food and restaurants and whatever else people buy.<p>There are very few things in the world that are genuinely scarce and have completely inelastic supply. And for those things, the price might increase. But that&#x27;s not <i>inflation</i>, it&#x27;s just supply and demand. You get the same result if the economy improves and wages rise or the unemployment rate goes down. You get the same result from any reduction in income inequality.')
