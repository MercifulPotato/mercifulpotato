This is something that has always bugged me about Linux, other unix like OSs and Windows. You shouldn&#x27;t need root or administrator access to install apps that don&#x27;t need it. Plus apps should be containerized by default. Granted there are in roads being made in Linux with things like AppImage and Flatpak but most current package systems still require root to install software without jumping through hoops. While this isn&#x27;t too much of an issue with vetted apps distributed through official repositories, 3rd party packages pose serious security and stability issues in Linux. And Windows needs administrator access for seemingly everything. I shouldn&#x27;t have to give up control of my OS to install something like a game.')
