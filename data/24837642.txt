To say nothing of the obscure industries we wouldn&#x27;t normally think of (Luxxotica with glasses) that are monopolized. There&#x27;s probably others for obscure things I&#x27;m not even thinking of.<p>And even within tech, I wouldn&#x27;t even rank Google ahead of Amazon, and I&#x27;m not 100% that I would rank them ahead of Facebook either.<p>And, if that&#x27;s not all, I think Google at least serves as a check on the other Frightful Five, and subtracting Google will serve to further consolidate tech. And if that&#x27;s not enough, I feel that the tech industry has served as a useful check against other entrenched industries. Their clash with cable, and occasional work to protect an open internet are a healthy counterbalance to voices of other monopolized industries.')
