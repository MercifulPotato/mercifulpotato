It would have been a disaster for workers in most if not all affected businesses; it had to start with dozens of exemptions, and AB 2257 a few months ago added a dozen more. But because AB 5 was written towards the well-meaning progressive goal of good pay and benefits for workers, it&#x27;s most likely going to stay there, and &quot;lobby the legislature for an AB 5 exemption&quot; will just become part of the cost for building a new industry sector in California.')
