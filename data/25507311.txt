I started with one monitor and then got the Eizo. The difference in picture quality and eye comfort was absolutely jaw-dropping. Dell looked and felt like a complete junk in comparison.<p>Make what you will of this, but it&#x27;s not just a panel <i>per se</i>, it&#x27;s also how it&#x27;s integrated and used in the whole product.')
