A domain must be cancelled 3 days before the expiry date to avoid renewal. ... If the reseller cannot reach the registrant, or if the registrant refuses to pay, refuses to sign the form, or claims not to have heard of the reseller, a Domain Withdrawal can be processed. To process this withdrawal, the reseller will have to contact OpenSRS support. They can state &quot;I can not reach the registrant, please give the domain back to the registry&quot;.  Once OpenSRS support processes the withdrawal the registry will no longer point the domain at OpenSRS.  The registry will take over and contact the registrant.  If the registrant is still unresponsive, the domain is deleted by the registry.</i>')
