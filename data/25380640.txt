The people that can&#x27;t afford to save are still not saving, but the people who had a surplus now have a bigger one.<p>&gt; People have received thousands of dollars in stimulus checks.<p>No, people have (per person) received a maximum of either $500 (to their parent, for children under 17) or $1,200 (for adults) in stimulus checks.<p>&gt; Thanks to extra $600&#x2F;$300 that the feds have added to federal unemployment, those that lost their jobs received in many cases significantly more that they were originally making<p>Yes, when the $600 boost was active, that was true mostly for people making <i>below the average state minimum wage</i> because they live in low-CoL, low-minimum-wage states, because the additional amount was designed to move the <i>average</i> unemployment check nationally approximately up to full replacement. That’s true of even fewer people with the $300 boost which replaced it months ago.<p>&gt; No, shoplifting is not increasing because people lack cash.  Rather, people do it because they can, as the justice system declines to prosecute and punish people for it.<p>If people had equal or better ability to afford food but were just taking advantage of a law enforcement withdrawal to shoplift more food, you’d expect surveys of food insecurity, charity food lines, and other indicia of actual hunger to be unmoved and the food shoplifting to stand alone. And you would not have expected a spike when the $600 unemployment boost ended, since available money is not the issue. But those expectations would all be wrong, suggesting that money actually is the issue:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;25&#x2F;long-food-lines-signal-need-for-more-coronavirus-stimulus-aid.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;25&#x2F;long-food-lines-signal-need-...</a>')
