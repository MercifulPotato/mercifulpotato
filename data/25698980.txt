It&#x27;s debatable whether any small group truly needs it.</i><p>Laws - and hierarchy, generally - evolve with the size of the group that tries to live together. Small tribes of a hundred people didn&#x27;t need them, but past that number people organically develop structures.<p>But that&#x27;s irrelevant to first people living in space. They are not an <i>independent</i> small group, merely a long arm of the large (and increasingly global) society that sent them there. They do not own the ship on which they came, or the station on which they reside. Every artifact they use has investments and expectations of other people embedded in it. Their very presence in space is something commanded by the people back on Earth.<p>Situation may change if there are space settlements large enough to require their own layer of internal governance (say, 100+ astronauts). These may start pushing towards increased self-governance over time, especially as they maintain and build their own infrastructure and eventually start having children. Of course, existing power structures will be reluctant to let them go, so any independence movement will be of the usual &quot;might makes right&quot; type. But we&#x27;re very far from that point. Definitely more than 50 years.')
