Robust encapsulation is simply not possible when abstractions are leaky or ill-fitting for the domain -- including an incomplete model of the domain. The latter point -- needing a complete &amp; consistent model of the domain -- is IMHO commonly under-appreciated; a lot of software is based on poorly understood partial abstractions for their respective domains.<p>Bits of information leaking through faulty abstractions are exactly what make conduits for <i>&quot;side-channel&quot;</i> attacks.')
