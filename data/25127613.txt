Likewise much of below is based on that original mis-read.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that going from 16GB to 32GB is going to be a huge instant performance boost for a lot of developers. If I was given the choice right now between getting one of these machines with 16GB and getting an Intel with 32GB, I&#x27;d probably go with the M1 with 16GB. Everything I&#x27;ve seen around them suggests the trade-offs are worth it.<p>Obviously we have more choices than that though. For most of us, the best choice is just waiting 6-12 months to get the 32GB version of the M? series CPU.')
