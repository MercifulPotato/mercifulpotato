At least the mid-range bikes in this category are already out of carbon. It&#x27;s far more common than exocitic nowadays.<p>The price of 4500$ actually doesn&#x27;t feel too excessive, given that a Specialized Diverge with similar components is 3900$ (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.specialized.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;diverge-comp-carbon&#x2F;p&#x2F;175285" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.specialized.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;diverge-comp-carbon&#x2F;p&#x2F;1752...</a>) - without a motor. But ok - Specialized is also one of the most expensive brands.<p>I bought a gravel bike this year (Trek Checkpoint), and I&#x27;m very happy with it. If I would have a strong use-case for an e-bike - like a longer commute - I would definitely consider something like that Prolog.')
