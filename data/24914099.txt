They should have at least created a Windows&#x2F;Linux (or web) viewer. They don&#x27;t need edit functionality but nearly always someone in the approval&#x2F;feedback process of a mockup will not be on Mac.<p>It&#x27;s just not realistic at larger orgs (or IMO smaller ones too) to expect everyone to be on a Mac.<p>Then came Figma which solved this problem completely.')
