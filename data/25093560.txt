The roots of military history within the education systems of the elites is important, it promoted so much focus on military history as a way to teach future military leaders how to win future wars, not to understand the past.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know if it can, as a discipline, break away from some of the problems that it has been saddled with. There is a lot of bad military history out there, and specifically a lot of REALLY popular bad military history.<p>A lot of people don&#x27;t want critical and expansive (beyond the battlefield) military history. They want either good guys vs bad guys narratives or deep rivet-counting&#x2F;platoon-chasing level histories that ignore anything beyond a very narrow focus on specific actions on the battlefield.')
