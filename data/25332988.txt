Examples include the Superprotect incident, Flow, and the rebranding (in which the WMF sought community feedback, and then proceeded to ignore it and do the exact opposite of the overwhelming consensus). I trust Wales more than someone nominated via the vague &quot;community nomination process&quot;. This looks to me like a takeover by certain members of the Board who believe they know better than the community.')
