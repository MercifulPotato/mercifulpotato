Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25106163], score=None, time=1605455095, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25098291, text='&gt; Corporate tax rates can be lower, ideally at 0, but I doubt our current system incentivizes corporations retaining profits.<p>Multinational corporations commonly avoid taxes by keeping profits offshore in a low tax jurisdiction. In order to pay the money to shareholders they have to repatriate them and pay corporate income tax on the money, and then the shareholder has to pay tax again on the dividend or the capital gain from the buyback.<p>Or they can leave the money where it is, not pay any of those taxes and invest it in some index fund from there. But then the money is stuck inside the corporation, and gets invested in some index fund instead of potentially going to some higher risk&#x2F;reward investments that some of the original shareholders would have chosen.<p>&gt; On the contrary, recently many needed to be bailed out because they paid out too much to shareholders instead of saving enough for a rainy day.<p>COVID-19 isn&#x27;t a rainy day, it&#x27;s a once in a century pandemic. Most companies have never made enough money to be able to survive it, and the ones that did still shouldn&#x27;t be hoarding it just in case. Systemic problems get solved through systemic actions, e.g. lowering interest rates or sending stimulus checks. To expect companies to have saved enough money to survive rare systemic events without that is to penalize and destroy any company lean enough to have been unable to save it to begin with.<p>&gt; Making a better product also doesn&#x27;t necessarily lead to profits.<p>Making a worse product in a competitive market has a strong relationship with going out of business.<p>&gt;  There&#x27;s a far greater correlation between monopoly power and profit.<p>But that&#x27;s an independent problem. The solution there isn&#x27;t to raise taxes, it&#x27;s to break up monopolies.')
