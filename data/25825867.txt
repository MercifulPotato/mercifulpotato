My experience ranged from 1&#x2F;10 (like denying emergency care until I fought for it) to 10&#x2F;10 (same-day treatment after diagnosis). Even from the supply side, I have little power on how to help even my own patients navigate the system unless it&#x27;s an urgent&#x2F;emergent need.  It is important to hear the system is working well for some; we should focus on improving it for more people.')
