But in the US, summer tires are sold as &quot;all season,&quot; and handle poorly in snow. We&#x27;re not required to use snow tires in our region, and they salt the roads heavily, to the detriment of my bicycle.<p>Over the past few decades of living in this region, folks have pretty much settled on &quot;needing&quot; AWD to drive in snow, and then gaining relatively little benefit, while insisting that &quot;all season&quot; means that they don&#x27;t need snow tires.<p>I asked my mechanic about it. His take: &quot;They should stop salting the roads, folks should get snow tires and learn how to drive.&quot;')
