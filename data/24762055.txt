I think it is indeed incredibly wasteful to buy something you will only use rarely. I myself am a minimalist; everything I own fits in my car, and if it doesn&#x27;t, then I start throwing things away. I think this lifestyle is motivated by the fact that I&#x27;m young, single.<p>That said, I think people who have money have the right to spend it on whatever they want. It is totally valid to purchase something for the <i>option</i> to use it on-demand, regardless of the cadence of that demand. Why should I be discouraged from purchasing a cottage that I&#x27;ll only use for one week a year to give my family a great vacation experience?<p>I think there&#x27;s an idea here, though -- we should encourage re-use and renting things we own, but not force it. If sharing was <i>as easy as possible</i> wouldn&#x27;t people... share more? Think about that.')
