I can&#x27;t say I know much about the definition of Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, but employment agreements commonly stipulate that the employee can only access information to the extent needed for his or her job. So defining this as unauthorized use wouldn&#x27;t at all be surprising given how that term is used in practice.<p>The article then goes on to defend web scraping which is very different because (1) the person in question accessed data manually, (2) the person in question had access to confidential information, (3) the person in question used the data in a way he must have agreed not to as part of his employment. It&#x27;s hard to see how someone could connect whatever precedent this case sets to web scraping.')
