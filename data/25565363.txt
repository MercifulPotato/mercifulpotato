I&#x27;m tired of my friends being forced to move. I&#x27;m tired of people living in their cars until they can find some place to crash. In a land of great wealth, this <i>is</i> horrifying. We put people, with jobs, playing their part in society, through a damned meatgrinder just so some assholes don&#x27;t have to see a new building. I&#x27;m not typically a fan of journalism that&#x27;s driven by personal stories, but in the case of housing it&#x27;s really important to pay attention to them because the stats alone don&#x27;t tell the story of what it means to get evicted and to have your entire life upturned because the zeitgeist demands that rents MUST GO UP rather than somebody somewhere pay for a condo and subsidize below-market-rent for somebody else.<p>Calling the state of housing the Bay Area anything less than &quot;horrifying&quot; is sugar-coating it, and I would thank you not to tone-police others.')
