What you&#x27;re suggesting is that the news companies form a cartel.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s reasonable, then, for the EU and the news industry to seek to remove Google&#x27;s monopoly advantages.<p>Yes, it is. But this legislation does <i>nothing</i> to attempt to break Google&#x27;s monopoly, while at the same time granting very weird and very specific privileges to the very rich, very well-connected, very corrupt news company owners.<p>Google is absolutely a monopoly and is absolutely abusing that position. We should stop the monopoly situation, not introduce very weird stuff that <i>just so happens</i> to favor people with no reasonable claims whatsoever except &quot;I&#x27;m friends with the regulator&quot;.')
