It has never been observed to occur naturally as a result of infection.<p>In other words, the &quot;natural herd immunity solution&quot; is simply not something most of the scientific community believes to be an option right now.  Instead the prevailing theory is that if we let it &quot;run its course&quot; it would in fact continue circulating endlessly, gradually mutating.<p>Epidemiologists do perform calculations to estimate how natural herd immunity might arise, but it has never yet been observed to actually happen, and the calculations are intrinsically rather unreliable.<p>From &quot;The false promise of herd immunity for COVID-19&quot; (21st October 2020, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02948-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02948-4</a>):<p>&gt; <i>never before have we reached herd immunity via natural infection</i><p>Also maybe relevant, if herd immunity could occur naturally, then the calculations done around it lead to:<p>&gt; <i>proposals to largely let the virus run its course [...] could bring “untold death and suffering”</i>')
