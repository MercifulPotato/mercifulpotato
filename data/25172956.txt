Handling files has 2 costs associated to it: One is a fixed setup cost, which includes looking up the file metadata, creating connections between all the services that make it possible to access the file, and starting the read&#x2F;write. The other part is actually transferring the file content.<p>For small files the fixed cost will be the most important factor. The &quot;transfer time&quot; after this &quot;first byte latency&quot; might actually be 0, since all the data could be transferred within a single write call on each node.')
