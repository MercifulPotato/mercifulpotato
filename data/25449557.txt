I also heavily appreciate attempts to make crypto more usable for general software devs.<p>For some more insight (as someone else was asking), i replied with a bit more depth here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25449538" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25449538</a><p>Thanks for the awesome looking library.
