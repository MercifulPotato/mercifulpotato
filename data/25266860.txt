I hope they&#x27;ll eventually make either a 4&quot; 125mm size or a flip phone, because that would be exactly what I would want to use. It&#x27;s for the same reason that I&#x27;m also holding on to my old iPhone SE because the new SE is too large.<p>Like this, it&#x27;s sadly more like &quot;Linux that almost would have fit into your pocket&quot;.')
