It&#x27;s basically a generational event. And even Perot couldn&#x27;t convert two third-places into anything lasting, what&#x27;s the point of getting matching funds for the next election if you&#x27;re only going to waste the money again except worse?<p>2. the candidate must agree to very strict spending limits, putting them at a large disadvantage for actually achieving their 5%; worse, while the federal limit is rather high it&#x27;s really an expenditure limit <i>per state</i> based entirely on the state&#x27;s population, no focusing on states where you have a chance to make an impact<p>3. it&#x27;s <i>only</i> matching funds, it&#x27;s not a magic purse of money<p>4. no matter how you slice it, the spoiler effect is, well, in effect<p>That 5% line would be way more useful and relevant if you guys fixed your presidential election system first, both the voting system, and everything that&#x27;s around (the funding, the PACs, etcâ€¦).<p>Third-party candidates are not viable under FPTP, third-party candidates are <i>even less</i> viable when the main two candidate literally spend <i>hundreds of millions</i>.')
