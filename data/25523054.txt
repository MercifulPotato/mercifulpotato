It included signing emails with &quot;wise sayings&quot;, fortunes, and platitudes like &quot;let your inner light shine the way for others&quot; and other nonsense, long rambling speeches about how we&#x27;re all each other&#x27;s brother, and a bizarre need to try to protect the worst performing employees from even minimal levels of accountability.<p>In practice he was pure chaos to work with and never contributed anything meaningful to our work despite having a great looking resume (including stints at some FAANGs and top schools). When cornered about actual technical work he was supposed to be doing he just became annoyingly evasive and tried to redirect the conversation into some kind of drum-circle feelings session.<p>It was like a cheap con-artist, a yoga class, and a fortune cookie had a baby.')
