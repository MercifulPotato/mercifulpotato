The argument is the state and city government remuneration model of defined benefit pensions and other post employment benefits such as retiree healthcare results in a situation where voters of today, politicians, and higher ranking government employees especially in positions of power with the unions are all incentivized to dump the cost of today&#x27;s labor onto taxpayers decades into the future.<p>I&#x27;m sure everyone is in agreement for giving everyone an awesome life.  The problem is no one wants to pay for it.  The proof is that voters won&#x27;t vote for a politician who would compensate government employees a cash amount in their 401k equivalent to the defined benefit pension, because that would require increased taxes compared to a politician that pushes those costs into the future via defined benefit pensions. And taxpayer funded defined benefit pensions and retiree healthcare are a proven vehicle for corruption where costs are shifted from today to tomorrow.<p>And unless the government has the power to print money, they should not be in the business of promising people money decades in the future. That&#x27;s the only way I see to prevent a repeat of IL&#x2F;Chicago&#x2F;Detroit&#x2F;NJ&#x2F;CT&#x2F;RI&#x2F;KY&#x2F;CA&#x2F;San Diego, and the list goes on and on.')
