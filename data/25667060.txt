That is the solution here. If my friend spouts hateful speech, I can mute them. If I want to have Facebook hide content on my behalf, no problem give users settings for that.<p>I don&#x27;t see the benefit to social networks or the people on them to make these decisions unilaterally. Basically people seem to talk about this issue like there are two options: (1) moderation (2) no moderation. But the third is (3) more user controls.<p>I strongly dislike Trump but I do believe  moderation is a form of speech, and should be done sparingly.')
