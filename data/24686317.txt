You start with a coarse grit and progressively move onto finer grits. Lapping is just the finest &quot;grit&quot; possible. Even Whitsworth probably scraped his plates flat using a &quot;poor&quot; reference plate and only then did he start lapping.<p>If you can find a flat piece of glass then use that as your starting point and then apply the 3 plates method.')
