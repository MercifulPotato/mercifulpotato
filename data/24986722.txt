One proposed system getting this scrutiny isn&#x27;t an argument that neither should get the same scrutiny.<p>It is a statement about the bias of the linked piece though, which is quite clearly right-wing.<p>&gt; One thing I would love to see adopted in the US is a public transportation tolling system like they have in Japan where you pay for distance traveled and the cost of your commute in general.<p>Roads also work like this in Japan. But I wouldn&#x27;t call the Japanese system much better; Japan allows companies to subsidize 1000USD per month for each employee, in a manner similar to how American employers subsidize healthcare. This has the effect of making travel relatively pricey in general (because people with subsidy can afford to pay more), and also the effect of concentrating employment in major urban areas, because if you live in a small city with low transportation costs you are essentially leaving most of that 1000USD off the table.<p>In the West we treat travel as a public good, but it&#x27;s really only an American thing that we tilt so much funding in favor of just the car.<p>&gt; the only public transportation which will ever serve my home and my neighborhood is likely to be a bus (this is not too dissimilar to the reason why Beacon Hill will also not benefit).<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with buses. The major problem is that Seattle has relied too much on buses; pre-COVID, public transit funds were being unspent because the ability to allocate money to transit has exceeded the capability to actually spend it for such a purpose. They literally could not find enough drivers to run the service already being funded because of how tight the employment market was.<p>One major reason why light rail is being pushed so heavily is because it is both more labor efficient in general (a driver can either operate a 40&#x2F;60 foot bus or a 380 foot train), and because the major speed and reliability increases of the rail system will allow less vehicles to serve the same frequency. The long-term plan (at least before COVID took a sledgehammer to public finances) was to redirect bus resources from long, infrequent commuter routes to short, frequent feeder routes to Link.<p>Also your comment about Beacon Hill is strange, because Beacon Hill <i>does</i> have a light rail stop, today. Even if you&#x27;re not next to it, the 36 bus runs straight through Beacon Ave every ten minutes throughout the day.')
