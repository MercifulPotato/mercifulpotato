I&#x27;m not too concerned about hacks or losing my password database.  For me, it&#x27;s more about the sense of independence, and being able to log in to my accounts using just my noggin.  I might be able to remember one or two strong passwords, but not dozens, which is kind of the selling point of a password manager.<p>I use KeePassXC with a password and key file.  I sync the database, but not the file, using Syncthing.  On the whole a satisfied customer, although the browser integration isn&#x27;t perfect.')
