Item(by='bentcorner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610481824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25746389, text='I&#x27;ve tried <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xeals&#x2F;signal-back" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xeals&#x2F;signal-back</a> and it&#x27;s 95% of the way there but could use more attention - maybe it&#x27;s my backup but the xml-formatted convos were formatted differently than the ones that the sms backup&#x2F;restore app emitted.  I compared just to sanity check it would import correctly but currently I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s a good idea.<p>FWIW it&#x27;s nice to have a plain text backup anyway, and a lot better than nothing.  Maybe it works fine but I&#x27;d rather not import a backup that has &quot;weird&quot; results.')
