The correct term would be terabyte, though: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Terabyte" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Terabyte</a><p>In old Britain[1], a trillion was a million million million, which would&#x27;ve been 10^18. But back then they were bites, not bytes, and they were involved in food processing for storage. I&#x27;ve never heard anyone refer to a trilobite as meaning an old British trillion bites, though.<p>In Urban Dictionary, a trilobite is also defined as &quot;a great word for Trekkies or others who will live in their mother&#x27;s basement until retirement.&quot;[2]<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trillion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trillion</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urbandictionary.com&#x2F;define.php?term=trilobite" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urbandictionary.com&#x2F;define.php?term=trilobite</a>')
