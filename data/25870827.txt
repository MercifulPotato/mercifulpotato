Encoding a timestamp in some of the bits is not random. Sure, you could argue these could have been randomly generated by chance, so any such UUID is not invalid, strictly speaking. Still, a collection of these v4 UUIDs don&#x27;t have the properties that you would expect of random UUIDs.<p>As specificed, the scheme satisfies neither of these two requirements.')
