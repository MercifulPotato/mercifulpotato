There might be regional differences in these experiences and that is... an interesting question? Towards the answering of that question, this study would be... a useful part?<p>The limited population who received the survey is a function of the surveys being sent exclusively to recipients of the One Fair Wage Emergency Fund, which is not a nationwide thing. I am sure the principals involved would be delighted to have the resources involved to study more and to help more people. I assume&#x2F;hope similar work is being done by other groups in other parts of the country (those <i>monsters</i>) and similar surveys are being conducted as well.')
