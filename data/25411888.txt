I work with German speakers and they do it all the time. From the small amount of German I know, it feels like there might be some parallel with “als”.<p>I‘m a native German.<p>It was certainly not „als“ as this translates to either „than“ as in „more than“ or „when“ as in „when I came home“.<p>My guess is that the original German text used „falls“ for „if“ and „sonst“ for „else“:<p>„falls A &gt; 0 dann X“<p>„sonst Y“')
