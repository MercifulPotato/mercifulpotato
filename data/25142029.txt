Similar in spirit to Hawking&#x27;s original approach, which she did mention.<p>She seems to have a beef with extrapolating (even well-accepted) math, rather than doing experiments. But this kind of work clarifies where the theories clash and break down, how they can work together, maybe even testable predictions.<p>I wonder if she would have been critical of the Casimir effect, back when it was thought to be untestable.')
