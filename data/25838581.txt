But I think this line right here is also why reddit is becoming unusable and going downhill fast.<p>Basically, moderators are given way too much power and users have no recourse against mod abuse really. Users can&#x27;t vote a moderator out for example. Many times, mod abuse is also hidden, so you can&#x27;t see a log of what they have been removing and hiding. Both of these things would show clear mod abuse in the open, but reddit seems to want to hide this.<p>Moderators should really only have the power to remove illegal stuff or have clear rules linked for each removal or ban.<p>Mods should not be able to turn on &quot;filter&quot; features that auto hide or auto delete posts, as they regularly just use it to target posters or topics they don&#x27;t like, even if it is still on topic and popular in the subreddit.<p>Also, mods are more and more removing or locking posts mainly because they politically disagree with them. They use excuses or hide this corrupting behavior all the time. Many times a lock posts will be done with a claim &quot;its too hard to keep moderating this post&quot;, when reality is they were just removing posts that didn&#x27;t break rules and were posts the mod simply disagreed with.<p>Add all the above and more and combine it with clear corrupt interests, and you basically ruin what reddit once was. Which was a place to go to free discussion on many topics. It is not longer  that. It is just a place where mods basically abuse their power on most subreddits and astroturfing is more and more the norm.<p>Its almost like people forgot their was a an upvote and downvote button. The mods really have no reason removing posts, outside of clear violating posts that may break laws, since the users can choose what they want to see with the upvote and downvote button.')
