To the extent that it&#x27;s a Gold Standard version 2.0, though, it should be pointed out that the kind of mainstream economists who actually run economic policy would usually view it as a specifically <i>discredited</i> theory: 100% of all gold-standard currencies have failed and been replaced with non-gold-standard.<p>In any case, though, the notion that someone with an alternative economic theory is so threatening to your profession that you need to send Deep State Operativesâ„¢ to shut everything down is Hollywood fantasy at best and Qanon idiocy at worst.')
