What the whole &quot;control disinformation&quot; argument boils down to, in my opinion, is an attempt to stifle people&#x27;s own faculty of reason and deliberation by restricting their access to information. Who is to decide what information is relevant to you? Why is it that some people want to do that because you did not come to the conclusion they think you ought to?')
