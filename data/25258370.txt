I said it’s <i>like</i> fiat in that there’s no store of physical value behind it like the gold standard had. Bitcoin has a value of $x because the market says it has a value of $x. And the USD has a value of $y because the government says it has a value of $y. But on the gold standard, a $20 bill corresponded to a <i>literal</i> $20 of gold - a backing currency.<p>Despite what Bitcoin proponents want to believe, there is no <i>intrinsic</i> value in Bitcoin - hence why its “exchange rate” fluctuates so much. When a new block is mined, ~$20k of gold don’t magically get added to a vault - because there’s <i>no</i> backing currency.')
