Which are shipping in volume, or at least volume-enough for the likes of Dell to put the 10nm CPUs in most of their lineup including the XPS series. Which is about where TSMC&#x27;s 7nm was 2 years ago, too.<p>And TSMC&#x27;s 170MTr&#x2F;mm^2 is still restricted to a single vendor and hasn&#x27;t ramped up beyond that yet. You can&#x27;t simultaneously claim Intel is restricted to what their bulk volume lineup is and then use TSMC&#x27;s non-volume lineup. The bulk of TSMC is still 7nm which is 100MTr&#x2F;mm^2.')
