Every country has one, in the US it is the FDA.<p>Please don&#x27;t try to shoehorn open source principles everywhere in life. It becomes a chore and a burden for a common citizen to verify the hazards of Baked Beans. Citizens offload this to a regulatory agency. You don&#x27;t have the time to verify a fucking can of baked beans like a million other things in life.<p>If you buy a measuring tape, do you ask for a NIST certificate? Where does the chain of trust end? Somewhere at the measurement standards in the pyramid of trust. Your personal role in this chain ends at the brand name &quot;STANLEY&quot;, because you trust them to make a measuring tape that measures within specified tolerance.<p>The whole movement around &quot;I don&#x27;t trust unless the information is freely available&quot; is a pipe dream. It grinds the society to a halt.<p>I urge you to look around 99% things in life that you just blindly trust. We need better mechanisms for building trust than &quot;Don&#x27;t trust unless verified&quot;. It is applicable in high risk situations, but the society pays a huge price for such an inefficient way to live.')
