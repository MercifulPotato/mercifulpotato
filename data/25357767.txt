One thing none artists probably don&#x27;t know is that a large part of traditional artist training is doing exercises under artificially constrained conditions in order to improve technique (source - I originally trained as a painter - 3 years vocational art and design qualification and 3 year degree). For example you might be given a continual line assignment (draw an entire picture without taking your pen off the paper), or to do life drawings without taking your eyes off the subject (so no looking at what you&#x27;re drawing). These exercises are the equivalent of doing &quot;scales&quot; For musicians. They&#x27;re largely boring, and often frustrating but dedicating time to them and doing them consistently over the course of years pays off. Early pixel art is amazing to me because there are so many constraints - in the tools (seriously drawing with joysticks!), the color pallets, the limited resomution and the exploiting of rendering and display artificats. Anyway, just some random thoughts.')
