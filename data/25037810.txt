This is partially because I&#x27;ve been programming Haskell professionally for 5+ years so I&#x27;m over the learning curve and well into the realm of efficiency gains.<p>The GHC RTS is akin to the Lua layer and handles all the high-level logic. For storage and compute-intensive things, we can drop to lower-level primitives for performance and then easily hook into them in our scripting layer. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if fleshing out this domain hints at future useful GHC extensions as well.<p>I like Rust a lot, but I honestly think the ability to do highly-abstract programming is worth having to deal with a non-literal compilation pipeline. For gamedev at least.<p>I honestly think it will be astounding what scale of game a single developer will be able to build in Haskell in 3-5 years once all the pioneering is out of the way. Programming a game the size Blasphemous could easily be managed by a single Haskeller I&#x27;m pretty sure - leaving resources to focus on art, sound, and storytelling. And that&#x27;s an easy call - it&#x27;ll be fun to see just how big and complicated of game logic we can make cheap thanks to good abstractions.')
