Which free software has its <i>documentation</i> in a proprietary book? A textbook is not documentation². ROS, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Julia, Python, Emacs, you name it, all have free online documentation as well as non-free textbooks to learn those tools. Not sure about non-programming tools like Gimp or Blender. If the only way to learn how your software works is a print book, that&#x27;s the issue, not the fact that this textbook is non-free.<p>²To me, documentation is a boring but exhaustive description of all the features in your software. A textbook is a nice introduction to the software in a linear fashion which doesn&#x27;t necessarily aim to tell the whole story. After going through the textbook the user should be comfortable enough to look at the doc for the complete story.<p>It&#x27;s ok to want to profit from publishing a textbook for free software IMHO, just as you can build a consultancy on free software (see Red Hat, Savoir-faire Linux). It&#x27;s merely charging for your expertise and time. Somehow saying that these book should be made available for free online takes away from that. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you say that it&#x27;s ok to pay for the print version.')
