While there are exceptions, for the most part, police look at all this data after they know about a crime.<p>They have most of what they need to use the info to discover crime and automatically cite people.  As a simple example, ANPR in two places could issue a speeding ticket if the time elasped between two scans is low enough.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s happening somewhere, maybe a toll road.  The difference would be when it&#x27;s widespread.')
