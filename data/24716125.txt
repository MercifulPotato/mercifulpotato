They are a fervent advocate of “holistic admissions”, which is modern activist speak for “process involving discrimination, most often against Asian races”. Take a look at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.admissions.caltech.edu&#x2F;apply&#x2F;first-year-freshman-applicants&#x2F;holistic-review" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.admissions.caltech.edu&#x2F;apply&#x2F;first-year-freshman-...</a>, which says “We have always reviewed students within the context of the opportunities available to them, and we will hold true to that practice.”<p>Unlike Caltech, public schools in California are not permitted to discriminate and have different student demographics from private schools for this reason. Prop 209 from 1996, which banned affirmative action in CA, is unfortunately on the current ballot for a potential repeal as part of Prop 16.')
