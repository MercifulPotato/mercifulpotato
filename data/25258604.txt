Choose from a selection of preloaded race types or create a custom race event. ⏱<p>2. Add virtual opponents in the form of ghost-racers that&#x27;ll run or ride at a speed you choose.<p>3. Add your personal best times or previous race results to race against yourself.<p>4. Race!<p>5. Hear audio prompts on your race progress while you run or ride: \n• &quot;You&#x27;ve over taken your personal best to take 1st place.&quot;\n• &quot;That&#x27;s 30 mins. You&#x27;ve completed 5.3km.&quot;<p>6. Win!  Get faster and fitter.<p>7. Review your race with  maps,  graphs, and  export to Strava or  Apple Health.<p>I’d love for you to give Forrest a go and let me know what you think.')
