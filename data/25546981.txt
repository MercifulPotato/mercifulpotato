Often there is no command to uninstall again, and even if, can you trust that it works and really uninstalls stuff cleanly? What if there is an error in one half of the execution? Scripts are not a good way to install software. Do everything with declarative schemes if you can. Then have the runtime deal with partial installs&#x2F;uninstalls etc.<p>This is less of a security issue and more of a conventions issue. Also, install scripts often run as root instead of the compiling user.')
