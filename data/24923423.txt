The frontend is filled with an incredible amount of ux papercuts, performance issues and silent breakage that make me resent having to edit dashboards at all. It&#x27;s a perpetual state of being scared my next click will trigger &quot;a script is not responding&quot; or randomly break something I won&#x27;t know how to fix.<p>It feels like Grafana Labs is stepping into the same &quot;if it doesn&#x27;t help sales tick checkboxes it&#x27;s not getting development time&quot; trap so many B2B companies hit as they grow and it&#x27;s a shame. I wish there was something else I could switch to.')
