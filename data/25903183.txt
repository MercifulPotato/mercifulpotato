With all jobs I&#x27;ve had (stacking shelves, software dev) the lack of diversity hasn&#x27;t been something I&#x27;ve at least recognised as the faults of the team &#x2F; company.  The reason the product hasn&#x27;t achieved the deadline &#x2F; high-praise is usually down to bad management, bad technical decisions, over promising, etc.  Now if we had more women on the team, or more non-whites that could have changed things, but I&#x27;m still left a little sceptical that would have made a big enough difference.<p>The other problem is the what I call the &quot;sports-team&quot; problem (sorry if this has an actual name): when picking players for a football (soccer) team to, lets say, compete in the World Cup, you pick the best players you can get hold of - regardless of their &quot;identity&quot;.  If a diverse player doesn&#x27;t want to join your team because of all the whites, then offer them more money if you think they are worth it.  Why shouldn&#x27;t this translate to software teams?  Do you just end up with all the 10x &quot;bros&quot; and a bad product?<p>I get that more diverse = more moral.  But does that mean your competition will be able to out-compete you?  If that&#x27;s the case then there&#x27;s no hope if &quot;go woke, go broke&quot;.')
