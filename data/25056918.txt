Czechs didn&#x27;t have this same experience and were more &quot;integrated&quot; into Germanic and Habsburg Europe, Czechia wasn&#x27;t completely razed during WW2, and the Soviets were, shall we say, less harsh on them than on the Poles.<p>In short, communism simultaneously increased Czech tradition  religious apatheticism <i>and</i> Polish Catholicism.')
