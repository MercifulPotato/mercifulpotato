I&#x27;m presently developing a C library for exact real and complex numbers (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fredrikj.net&#x2F;calcium&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fredrikj.net&#x2F;calcium&#x2F;</a>) that goes much further to make equality decidable even in complicated cases while also enabling efficient computations. Still working on implementing functionality and writing up a formal paper.')
