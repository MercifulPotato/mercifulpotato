It&#x27;s not being applied against against cash balance. In large part negative rates drain money out of fixed asset funds that are typically people&#x27;s retirement funds.<p>Negative rates will in majority be harming the boomers reducing their pensions. They are legally forced to be in these investment systems. Boomers who don&#x27;t even think they can quite retire are going to watch their investments shrink. Why is that happening? Because they didnt invest enough and have been believing they will live off the younger generations. They ran up huge debts and expect the millennials to pay.<p>That&#x27;s literally impossible. Intergenerational debt is not possible and the boomers now sit there wondering why they cant retire when they planned to do so; despite not saving enough for retirement.')
