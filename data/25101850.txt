Hard to imagine an upside.<p>But there are almost 500 comments and thus far no one has mentioned Dave Troy&#x27;s unbelievable thread res arching how Parler got started. He very much points out that coverage like NPR gives here, reviewing it as it wants to be seen, carries water for the team, fails a necessary obligation to report on just how shady &amp; murky the founding &amp; running of Parler is.<p>Until someone gathers better research, this is, by far, the most important write up on Parler. A company with strong ties to russia, trying loudly to undermine the safe harbor &amp; free speech protections we enjoy, &amp; as a company a gathering place for political swindlers &amp; ultrapartisans. This kind of intel on who Parler is is extremely important, at least as much so as who joins &amp; goes there.<p>The amazing Dave Troy: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threadreaderapp.com&#x2F;thread&#x2F;1327259427481800704.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threadreaderapp.com&#x2F;thread&#x2F;1327259427481800704.html</a>')
