We don&#x27;t know what all the data is used for or why it&#x27;s taken. As long as we don&#x27;t know we lack the ability to judge. We don&#x27;t have the power to make a strong rhetorical argument without shared knowledge.<p>Colbert&#x27;s white house correspondent&#x27;s address covered it. Politicians don&#x27;t talk about super depressing stuff like guantonomo bay and journalists have the courtesy to not try and find out.. We don&#x27;t talk about data collection in any serious manner.<p>I think the weakness of data collection is when it gets in the average joe&#x27;s way and it hasn&#x27;t done that yet in a big way. The more we hammer home that it must facilitate movement through life and not hinder it, the better the middle ground will be.. maybe.<p>There is a requirement that both sides get really good at eviscerating lies and liars. Neither side of the fence wants fake data or betrayal.')
