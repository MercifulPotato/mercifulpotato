Because of this decades-long misunderstanding, they&#x27;ve developed a weird culture of isolation with the west; far more-so than other Japanese game developers like PlayStation, who have a REALLY strong western corporate presence.<p>Though, I&#x27;d argue Nintendo&#x27;s interactions with the west are really similar to another Japanese developer, From Software. They both have a massive, rabid western fanbase who orgasm at every bit of news these eastern companies hand out. Well, in the end, they give out very little, and a lot of their game releases follow a pattern of &quot;we&#x27;re making new game, here&#x27;s a teaser trailer&quot; (three years pass with literally nothing) &quot;ok, game is out today, have fun&quot;. Contrast that to Cyberpunk and other western developers, which more follow a pattern of constant community engagement, developer diaries, release dates promised a year in advance, then missed, playable demos, marketing deal with Doritos, sponsored twitch streams, etc.<p>Its a rather interesting case study in how game companies <i>should</i> communicate with their base. You&#x27;d initially think that more communication is always better, but there&#x27;s <i>so much</i> evidence to the contrary (Nintendo, From, Valve, and Team Cherry immediately come to mind). By rarely communicating these companies exempt themselves from a lot of criticism; obviously this exemption applies to the games they&#x27;re developing, but it really does extend to everything they do.')
