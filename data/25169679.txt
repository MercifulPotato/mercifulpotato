It&#x27;s not up to you to imagine a way for this to happen. Anyone can imagine a way to increase their own wealth by creating value for other people.<p>Increasing income does not have to be increasing the number of dollars you make either. What if you made the same money, but it went a longer way? Like you could get cheaper healthcare, but good food for less, or have any other show up at your doorstep in two business days?<p>I&#x27;m not saying our system is perfect, and I actually agree that this is probably a good time to look at redistribution of wealth. But I think limiting others&#x27; creativity because of our own lack of imagination is a terrible idea that makes us all worse off.')
