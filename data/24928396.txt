Seen from notepad, they were mostly gibberish, but there had to be order in that chaos. 12-year-old me knew that, although he didn&#x27;t quite know how or where to dig to make sense of it all.<p>Glad I wasn&#x27;t the only one! When I was a kid, I had tried several times to somehow create executables myself, without knowing how to program. Long after the failures I had suffered from, I discovered I could make an executable using so-called &quot;programming&quot;. I still can&#x27;t forget the time I created a Hello World executable for the first time. It was a gorgeous experience. Good times.')
