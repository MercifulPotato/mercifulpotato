Item(by='rconti', descendants=None, kids=[25690637], score=None, time=1610051146, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25671655, text='I do a lot of power training on the Peloton (had it for 4 years now, been doing power training for.. 2.5?)<p>I agree that &quot;serious outdoor riders are not really Peloton&#x27;s market&quot;, and it comes across in literally every piece of snobbery about how a spin bike can&#x27;t simulate real road feel and you&#x27;ll never get your proper position and couldn&#x27;t possibly train the same muscles and so on. I just smile and nod. The bike world is full of snobbery.<p>The older Pelotons do NOT adjust their resistance dynamically, you&#x27;re right. I wouldn&#x27;t call it baffling. I only change my resistance a handful of times (okay maybe 10, including little tweaks) during a class. Honestly it&#x27;s kind of nice having those micro-steps. What else are you doing? It&#x27;s sort of like people who can&#x27;t be bothered to use their turn signal. I&#x27;m just sitting there pedaling away. I might as well turn a knob from time to time.')
