The clever bit is that the introduction server uses wireguard tunnels to find your endpoint information, then shares it out via DNS. Of course it still requires you to be able to run custom code on all of the endpoints, which requires supporting many different platforms.<p>I&#x27;m still looking for a FLOSS mesh network built on top of wireguard that can do NAT traversal between nodes and fall back to tunnelling traffic for the annoying cases where this fails. I don&#x27;t really want to use Tailscale because (1) their server is not open (though this should not matter a ton for trust) and (2) they require a Google account or similar to sign up.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jordanwhited.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;wireguard-endpoint-discovery-nat-traversal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jordanwhited.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;wireguard-endpoint-discov...</a>')
