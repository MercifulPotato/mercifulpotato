And while I was at school nobody enjoyed that either. (FWIW in the 90s I used a PIM database that looked like a calculator and allowed me to store formulas I was too lazy to memorize ;)) At university math no calculator is required anyways and everything can be done on paper. And when going to the supermarket with a constrained budget, you definitely don&#x27;t want to stand in front of the products and summing up the items using a calculator (or smartphone for that matter) but rather use your hopefully developed numeric intuition to stay within your budget')
