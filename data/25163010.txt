The students can simply answer online. It takes care of the &quot;right to left&quot; ordering of text inputs as well.<p>I created this for my brother&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s school because I was tired of printing her math assignments. The teachers can see all the answers in one place against the original sheet so it makes life easy for them rather than scanning the answers sent by parents via email. If you know teachers&#x2F;parents please send this to them.<p>I could add more features like annotating answers etc but I want to know if this is useful.<p>The link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathsheetmaker.com&#x2F;')
