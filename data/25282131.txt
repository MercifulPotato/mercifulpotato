Such short-sidedness is a bad trait in an employee.<p>Second, their protest is laudable. But their decision was consciously: &quot;the legal department of this $xxx billion company (that spends $xx million maintaining this employment contract template) will bend to my will, or I will {quit OR relent}&quot;. If they&#x27;d quit? Job well done. If they&#x27;d relent? Then why try? You&#x27;re screaming into a void, and if you didn&#x27;t recognize this prior to redlining, you have a bad trait for an employee.<p>All scenarios point to a competent red-liner achieving their desired outcome -- an ethical win in whatever case. Only an incompetent&#x2F;shortsighted&#x2F;kneejerk&#x2F;low-critical-thinking red-liner would achieve an undesired outcome, because they didn&#x27;t consider the game before playing.')
