The problem with the discussed solutions in TFA (which is great btw) is the lack of discoverability, and CSS generally solving for the wrong 20% of use cases, bringing unsustainable technical debt for displaying our docs going forward for generations to come. I really would appreciate an attempt to specify CSS behavior, even a subset of it, as a constraint-based formulation or other formal spec; easier said than done, though.')
