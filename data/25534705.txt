The candidate experience is (was?) top-notch.<p>The opt-out public profile thing was a bad idea, but I think they handled it as well as they could have after the fact.<p>My company did stop using TripleByte after a period of success, not because they&#x27;re expensive, but because we found that the candidates we were seeing straight-up couldn&#x27;t program. I can&#x27;t see how that happened, given the rigor involved in the process, but it&#x27;s what we experienced. That was a disappointment to me because I&#x27;m a huge fan of the concept and I had such a positive experience as a candidate.')
