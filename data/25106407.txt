Assuming we can go in and just start blindly messing around and do better seems like an extreme level of arrogance that&#x27;s going to end up blowing up in our faces.<p>Balance is something humans project on the world. There is no balance, there is only the status quo that can change in an instant.<p>Nature only seems balanced because we can only view a tiny slice of time. Extinction events in the geological record show us there is no balance and 90% of life can easily be obliterated.')
