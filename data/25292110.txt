Crappy graphics, a low power CPU (and only 2 cores), not as much drive space, etc. Even if I get the highest spec laptop available, for the same money a desktop will blow it out of the water.<p>Maybe if you&#x27;re traveling a LOT it&#x27;d make sense but I have to imagine for the vast majority of people, they&#x27;re in one spot most of the time. That could be a desk in an office or a fixed spot somewhere at home.')
