If any bacteria eats the wood, the CO2 gasses should remain trapped there.<p>The expectation that permaculture is actually the best carbon-capture strategy is... strange. Trees eventually die, and at that point: their captured carbon is eaten by bacteria, turned back into CO2 and released into the atmosphere. There is a degree of carbon-capture with natural forests, but they aren&#x27;t explicitly designed for carbon capture.<p>--------<p>Now if you think there are other benefits of permaculture, then of course, that&#x27;s to be discussed. Maybe it&#x27;d be more beneficial to the wildlife (more room for predators &#x2F; prey to roam the lands), and possibly beneficial for other reasons in the long run.<p>But if we have a specific goal (ie: carbon capture), that&#x27;s easily measured and easily quantified, then frankly... modern science is the best approach forward. We should measure various methodologies, and then compare them. And then incrementally engineer a solution over the years based on the target quantifier.')
