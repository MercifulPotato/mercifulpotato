E.g. in some Linux compositors inputs are latched with the refresh, apps themselves may render in sync, and the compositor also draws in sync; the GPU driver would also introduce at least a frame of latency typically.<p>Another factor is that some (many?) 60 Hz displays buffer a whole frame themselves, and often don&#x27;t have quick response times. If you go from a 10 ms response time IPS screen with a frame buffer to a 120 Hz gaming screen with 2-3 ms response time, you already got a difference of about 25 ms just in the screen itself.<p>8 ms is hard to notice. 50 ms less so.<p>The difference is pretty huge, even on systems that are much better tuned than Linux desktops (e.g. Windows 10).<p>That being said, while it is very nice and feels nice, it&#x27;s not necessary for development work; I spend most of my days developing on a system over a VNC connection through a VPN, so the basic input lag of that setup is around 200-300 ms. Gnarly yes, but not particularly bad for text input. You get used to just do everything very slowly with the mouse.')
