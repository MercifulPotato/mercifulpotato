The problem stem from lack of driver support in the kernel for the devices on your machine.<p>If that is the case, then your machine maker obviously does not support linux. So, it&#x27;s no surprise that your machine had problems with linux.<p>If you buy a machine that supports linux, you would not see those problems. Nothing to do with linux, mostly to do with interaction of linux and your machine manufacturer.')
