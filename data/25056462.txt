Potentially being also put together with other kids in similar situations, which eventually reinforce each other, maybe fall into a rabbit hole of petty crimes, state&#x2F;police interactions, early institutionalisation, and basically put in a never ending spiral which lead to a maladjusted adult in the best scenario, and a criminal in the worse one.')
