Item(by='bayindirh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611840712, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941142, text='Disclaimer: This is my experience from many short travels to EU countries and having a lot of friends due to job network (my work promotes a lot of friendly work connections from many EU countries. As a whole, we work hard, we play hard).<p>Europe has a philosophy of &quot;feeling peaceful&quot;. Police, intelligence, surveillance, etc. is not done openly, on your face. Instead it flows just beneath the surface.<p>There are a lot of civilian officers around and police officers are not very visible. Same for borders and higher security places like airports.<p>If there&#x27;s something suspicious happening, the concentration is increased invisibly. If something really happens, the area is silently surrounded like a python <i>death hugs</i> its prey, and it&#x27;s over.<p>This is possible with intelligence and surveillance, communications sniffing, etc. If you increase encryption, <i>there&#x27;s a risk</i> of blinding security services. You may need more overt operations are much more manpower to keep tabs on everything.<p>I&#x27;m an encryption proponent. I support it with all my being. Also, I&#x27;m aware that being able to see everything can and is being abused.<p>However, I need to be a realist here: We&#x27;re addressing the wrong problem here. Is encryption required? Undebatably yes. Do everyone has a right to privacy? Undebatably yes. Do we want to be secure and need security services? Possibly yes.<p>So, we need to solve the problem of security with the presence of encryption. I.E. Security in a past-encryption era. The no-encryption ship has sailed. Trying to bring it back with the force of law is a last ditch effort. We need another solution to allow security services to their job with the presence of encryption, and without weakening it.<p>I do not accept someone can just read my office messages or conversations with my family just because somebody may be trying to make a bomb or planning an uprising.')
