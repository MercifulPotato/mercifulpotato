But, when you think of them, you&#x27;re thinking way too small. You need to think in terms of, like, literally doubling the number of apartments available, and they may then be in reach of normal people once more.<p>You also need to get yourself together and reverse that trend where your transit system has carried fewer people more slowly for more money since the eighties. (The bus-rapid-transit corridors are a good start, as they&#x27;re much more transiting for much less money than new subways, but you&#x27;re still thinking too small, and need to 10x your ambitions.)')
