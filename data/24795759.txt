And if it ever breaks (can&#x27;t be found, or returns something in a different numeric format) then just notify me to visit it and see what&#x27;s up.<p>Command-line is one way to do it (can be the canonical version), but then a browser extension makes it even easier. You&#x27;ll need a headless browser even from the command-line in any case, since the product info isn&#x27;t always in the HTML at all.')
