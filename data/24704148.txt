The use case was (relatively) simple, (relatively) predictable, and (relatively) self-contained.<p>Crucially, equality in general is still undecidable (it wouldn&#x27;t play nice with Collections), and it&#x27;s not obvious that numerical algorithms would in general play nice with it.\nI&#x27;m also not really convinced that having random functions that could either terminate or not in your API is really more intuitive than floating points, but <i>de gustibus non disputandum est</i>.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue of performance in non-toy examples. With the world going more and more the route of ML, efficiency of numerical algorithms is not a secondary concern.')
