I&#x27;ve been struggling with that on a web app I&#x27;ve been working on.<p>Part of the problem is a new twist on the old problem. I don&#x27;t have to develop for Mac and Windows and Linux, I have to develop for Desktop PCs, Tablets, and Phones. My options are to create a GUI for each of them or use something like Bootstrap to build one that runs on them all, and that has limits and trade offs, but it&#x27;s still pretty good.<p>One of the things I&#x27;ve done with this upgrade is provide a way for the user to store their data in the CouchDB native app running on their desktop PC. It&#x27;s a &quot;local-first&quot; and &quot;offline-first&quot; web app so once it&#x27;s installed it doesn&#x27;t need or use an internet connection and while I have no way of making a comparison it appears to me to run pretty close to native app speeds.<p>When CouchDB is installed on the user&#x27;s desktop PC any web app configured to use it can use it. It only requires the user fills out a simple web form to set up a user and database for the app.<p>Taken together, a modern web browser and CouchDB come pretty close to fully featured client side runtime environment for desktop PC web apps. It wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to create a web app that looks and feels very much like a native app when running full screen on a Mac and Windows.<p>A client side runtime for web apps is something I&#x27;ve been thinking we need since I built my first web app and that was before they were even called &quot;web apps&quot;. I&#x27;m not the guy to make that, but I think we need it. CouchDB and a web browser come pretty close.')
