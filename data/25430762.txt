While there&#x27;s no denying the natural beauty of Hawaii, saying that it has perfect weather is a matter of personal taste.<p>&gt; The 50 square miles of SF has perfect weather, if you&#x27;re not put off by cold and clingy fog.<p>What does this even mean? SF is 7 miles in diameter, and the various foggy microclimates don&#x27;t reach far beyond the city&#x27;s perimeter (and most of the time they don&#x27;t even reach Potrero Hill). Describing this as a 50 mile perimeter would imply that Palo Alto has a lot of fog, which couldn&#x27;t be more wrong.<p>The land between San Diego and SF in the N-S direction and the I5 and the ocean in the E-W direction has what most people would describe as the perfect climate, with just enough variation to suit individual styles. If you prefer a slightly higher temperature you go further south within that area, and otherwise a bit further north. And if you really like the chill air, you step over from San Mateo to Daly City.<p>We can argue about all sorts of issues that negatively affect California (eg: taxes), but the weather is clearly a huge upside to living there.')
