Sometimes it&#x27;s nice to go to places where people say what they mean rather than try to be polite and&#x2F;or politically correct.<p>Pubs and websites are different from each other. I probably wouldn&#x27;t go to a pub that refused to throw out rude patrons because there would be a relatively high chance of physical violence occurring at such a pub. Online, assuming that my use of a website would have no consequences like doxxing that could get back to the rest of my life, that wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.<p>Also, it&#x27;s hard to ignore loud people at a pub. On the other hand, it&#x27;s easy to ignore annoying people on a website.')
