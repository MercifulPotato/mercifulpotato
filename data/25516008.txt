Burn the heretic! [1]<p>The real reason we don’t use tables for layout (and only for the occasional tabular data) is because a table layout doesn’t work really well on the screen of an iPhone or Android phone, especially when they are vertically aligned.  So, the workaround is to use media selectors: Desktops, laptops, and tablets get a table layout; phones get a simpler one-column layout.<p>I believe grid and flex layouts allow one to use a single design which will appropriately scale from a phone screen to an ultrawide monitor, but I use a two-layout or three-layout design for my web pages.<p>[1] In the days when the CSS Zen Garden was new, all of the web design blogs and comments felt using &lt;table&gt; for anything <i>at all</i> was heresy, since abusing &lt;table&gt; resulted in really ugly and hard to maintain webpages during the dot-com days of the late 1990s.  It would be an extended discussion whether it was OK to even use &lt;table&gt; for clearly tabular data.')
