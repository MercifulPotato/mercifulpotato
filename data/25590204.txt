But some of it was misunderstood, or perhaps I used the wrong words. Most of what you said is truthful to my original comment.<p>Let me share a bit more from my experience living in China for 20 years. In China, taking street people (mostly beggars or orphans who were used by gangs as pick-pockets or whatnot) into custody is systematic for as long as I can remember. (There&#x27;s news that this system is to be abolished in 2021 by a new law amendment.) It&#x27;s systematic as there are full-time employees who job is to do this. It is considered &quot;help&quot; by the general society (but there could be abuses by bad actors for sure), the system has good intentions.   Because they are not criminals, it&#x27;s not exactly like prison but it is true that they are taken by force to go through a &quot;program&quot; where they need to listen to propaganda, be educated or trained for a certain skills (mostly factory jobs such as making toys, shoes etc.) and be forced to work at a given place for a certain period.  The system is not perfect, it is outright offensive to &quot;individual freedom&quot; (where you are &quot;free&quot; to be just like the US homeless drug addicts). But it is net positive for the society by sacrificing some of these people who are unwilling to go through it.')
