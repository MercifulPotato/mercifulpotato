There is definitely a difference between indirect&#x2F;preventable deaths and direct deaths due to war&#x2F;murder. If you died of cancer tomorrow because you couldn&#x27;t afford treatment, it would be different than if I straight up shot you in the head. The cumulative deaths caused by motor accidents also outnumbers the Kosovo casualty count (by a lot), and yet we do not consider the former to be worse than the latter. Also, drug overdose deaths, while sad, are less devastating to society than war and genocide.<p>2. Even if indirect&#x2F;preventable deaths were somehow comparable to war&#x2F;revolution&#x2F;genocide, this is pretty much unique to the US, whose government inefficiently allocates welfare. Canada, Germany, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Taiwan, Belgium, Netherlands etc etc etc all rely on the private sector to deliver the majority of their goods &amp; services. The fact that the US has an inefficient welfare system is somewhat orthogonal to the issue at hand: whether the (peaceful) creative destruction yields more efficient outcomes than structural rigidity and institutional sclerosis.<p>If the US instituted a UBI or more efficiently allocated its public health spending to include those that may be unable to afford healthcare, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that in the majority of liberal democracies that rely predominately on the private sector, structural change doesn&#x27;t need to be brought about through violence, even if the governments and their institutions remain rigid.')
