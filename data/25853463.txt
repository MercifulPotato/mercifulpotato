My Oracle Linux licenses expired several years ago, and I don&#x27;t see any point in renewing them.<p>I have had to use alternate Oracle CSI support to fix some of their own self-inflicted brain damage. Oracle managed to disable microcode updates in the UEKR4, killing spectre&#x2F;meltdown remediation. They would not listen to me on the forums, and insisted that I file an SR, so I used a general corporate CSI to get that fixed (and it still took several months).')
