I moved the encrypted git repos to private GitHub repos, which was fine for what I was doing. I never used the chat much. I couldn&#x27;t get anyone in my circle interested in it so there wasn&#x27;t a lot of value for me.<p>I feel like Keybase missed a lot of money prior the acquihire. I would&#x27;ve spent $xx&#x2F;month or year for some of the capabilities or increased storage in KBFS. Additionally, it didn&#x27;t integrate well with other environments (especially mobile) and applications. Dropbox and others expose their contents to other applications on mobile OSes. If Keybase had done that for KBFS, it would&#x27;ve been <i>fantastic</i> for me. I had been keeping a lot of org files in KBFS (still have them there, but backed up to other locations). Being able to pair something like beorg + KBFS would&#x27;ve been very convenient. Or KBFS + textastic.<p>But I had to open the files inside a plaintext viewer inside the Keybase app. And that&#x27;s just one possible UX improvement. If they&#x27;d been willing to take customer money for some of the things, they could&#x27;ve afforded to work on those kinds of enhancements.')
