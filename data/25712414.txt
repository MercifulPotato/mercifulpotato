That&#x27;s not good. Second, the theory is not not widely accepted, and did receive criticism. It&#x27;s certainly not an established fact.  Third, the statement&#x27;s prominent place, and lack of further qualification, suggests that human parents should take care of the amount care men and women invest in parenting, but that&#x27;s not at all what the theory is about. The article linked explains that very clearly.<p>Why it was placed there is a mystery, but it&#x27;s not been a neutral, well-informed edit.')
