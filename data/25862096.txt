They started promulgating this absurd notion that Bitcoin was a &quot;store of value&quot; exclusively: that is to say, was not intended to be &quot;peer to peer electronic cash&quot; (as Satoshi obviously intended) and that its value was purely related to &quot;how much the other guy was willing to pay for your Bitcoin&quot;. So they turned it into this purely speculative thing.<p>The whole fallacy of the &quot;store of value&quot; thing is two-fold:<p>(1) Bitcoin&#x27;s success and utility as a currency gives it a stable point to base its value around. For example, the value would be related to the net amount of transactions occurring (on the darknet usually) and the velocity of money, which would create a sort of natural equilibrium price where people are buying bitcoin as they need it, rather than hodling it to speculate.<p>(2) Bitcoin, like any asset, <i>is</i> a store of value, but its ability to store value is the same whether it&#x27;s worth $.0001 per coin or $40,000 per coin.<p>So they basically turned it into a purely speculative instrument.<p>---<p>The takeover of Bitcoin from within was a big red-pill moment for me. It was an attack vector I should have seen coming but didn&#x27;t. I strongly belief that any cryptocurrency community where 99% of users are speculators who view the thing as a stock ticker and nothing more, basically dooms a cryptocurrency to failure.<p>Anyway, Bitcoin Core as a whole and Blockstream as a company are very malicious actors who destroyed the beauty and elegance of Bitcoin so that they could build a company around exploiting the delta between what the tx fees should be and what they were. And beyond the unjustifiable censorship &#x2F; suppression, they advanced tons of bogus arguments such as the notion that increasing the block size would ruin the decentralization of the bitcoin network.<p>---<p>Oh, and lastly there will be a great need for public blockchain cryptos like Bitcoin: for example, if I donate to a non-profit I&#x27;d want all their transactions to be publicly viewable. But for normal usage-as-a-currency, I am a huge believer in XMR (monero), which masks who you&#x27;re sending money to, how much money you sent, and how much money you have. It also has a lot of neat tech like adaptive block size limits, etc that avoided the transaction fee debacle of BTC.')
