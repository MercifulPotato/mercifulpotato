Difficult?<p>We are in a pandemic. How we handle this does not change how we govern ourselves outside of a pandemic. It doesn&#x27;t even change how we govern ourselves during a pandemic. We aren&#x27;t talking about forming a world government. We aren&#x27;t talking about expanding the federal government&#x27;s powers. We aren&#x27;t talking about Hunter Biden, the pee tape, the impeachment, chem trails, or mega churches. Put that out of your mind. Try to think like this isn&#x27;t US politics because that&#x27;s clearly clouding your judgement.<p>A centralized entity coordinating a nation-wide effort to distribute the vaccine, testing supplies, and PPE is normal. What exactly would go wrong there that the states couldn&#x27;t mess up. By your logic, the FDA and the CDC shouldn&#x27;t have been approving the vaccines. It should be left up to each state, no? Because what if the FDA got it wrong. Better let 50*2 smaller, less well funded agencies decide individually than one well funded agency, right?<p>How could the states possibly do better than a national strategy for handling the pandemic.<p>Note: national strategy != central government. National strategy does not expand any powers. The federal government already has all the powers it needs. No new laws would need to be passed. No new powers granted. It&#x27;s literally using the resources already there for what they are meant to be used for: responding to an emergency. Why do you thing agencies like FEMA exist?<p>I&#x27;m done with this topic because it really seems there is a number of people here willing to bend over backwards and give themselves a cranial colonoscopy just to not blame the current admin for its utter failure to do its most basic job. If you really think this is going better than the ebola outbreak, a disease much deadlier and more contagious than COVID, then I can&#x27;t do anything to pull you out of your alternative reality. That is on you.')
