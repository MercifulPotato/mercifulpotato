Not so much that it never happened, but more that it was something that some data scientist said was a good idea, but never actually works I practice, and so UPS drivers don&#x27;t actually follow this. Maybe it&#x27;s a policy. I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t have a list of UPS policies handy at the moment. But of the (admittedly small) sample size I&#x27;ve discussed it with, every single one says they do not follow that policy, or is it something they were instructed to do.<p>Which makes me kind of roll my eyes whenever I see these articles or podcasts or what-have-you. They pop up fairly frequently, but... it <i>feels</i> more like clever marketing by UPS than an actual policy.')
