I very explicitly showed the opposite.<p>I’ve worked at companies that ingest petabytes of data, processing it would just not be possible without hadoop and sister tech (chiefly hdfs). Hundreds of developers working on a common codebase that would not have been possible without modern ci&#x2F;cd solutions. Data pipelines whose reliability would be 0 without a modern rpc system like thrift to ensure system interfaces are well defined and consistent.<p>There are very real and practical use cases for these technologies. Just because you haven’t experienced them doesn’t mean that they’re overkill. Just because enterprise engineers like to overengineer using these tools does not mean that everyone does. There are very real scenarios where these tools have helped smaller companies and startups to punch beyond their weight.')
