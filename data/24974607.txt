The older stations in NYC are cramped and _dangerous_ because they&#x27;re too small to handle the foot traffic heading through on a good day without delays.  The new 2nd avenue subway stations are similarly large, and I can personally attest that this scale, which seems frivolous to you, makes life tangibly better for the commuters who rely on this infrastructure every day.')
