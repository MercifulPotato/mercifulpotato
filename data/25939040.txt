The economy has become so toxic that an army of retail investors has to yolo their money to try to realize an economic advantage in their lives. When retail investors finally do find a crack in the economic system and make some money, the regulatory body that never cared about the banks and their fraud in 2008, and the corporate enterprises that didn’t broadcast occupy Wall Street, all turn around and try to stop the momentum of WSB.
