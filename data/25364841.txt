Publisher is curated content with arbitrary censorship and heavy responsibility over the content.<p>As a voter, I&#x27;d expect to be able to use the platform&#x2F;publisher spectrum to determine how much censorship a service should have. If a service has censorship capabilities different from what a large enough part of the population thinks they should have then the law should be changed to rectify this.<p>My questions to you (and anyone else):<p>Where does YouTube lie on this idealized platform&#x2F;publisher perspective? How much censorship ability should they have? To what degree does your expectations of their censorship ability differ from their actual censorship ability according to the law?')
