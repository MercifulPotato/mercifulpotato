One section of the book was about stretching. One piece of advice on stretching was &quot;go until you&#x27;re slightly uncomfortable, and then try to relax&quot;. Don&#x27;t go until it hurts and you need to summon reservoirs of willpower to grit it out -- go until it&#x27;s a little tough, and slowly let yourself see that it isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> tough. Over time, the point at which it becomes tough changes. I&#x27;ve found this to be pretty useful applied to new experiences in general.')
