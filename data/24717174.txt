These applications are easy to develop and are highly performant out of the box. Golang has inbuilt support for HTTP&#x2F;2. Golang has good compatibility and support for various databases such as MYSQL, ElasticSerach, MongoDB.\nTo serve content over the web you don&#x27;t require 3rd party web servers like Apache, Nginx, Tomcat, etc. You can create a web server using Golang itself and it is far more performant then 3rd party web servers.')
