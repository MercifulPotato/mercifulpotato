Just a very fancy architecture.<p>Correct me if I’m wrong, but the only number that I can find is a guarantee that you do not exceed 500 us of latency when handling a request. And it’s not clear if this is a guarantee at all, since you say just that the system will throw a traceback in case of latency spikes.<p>I would have liked to see the how latency varies under load, how much throughput you can achieve, how the latency long tail looks like on a long-running production load, and comparisons with off-the-shelf systems tuned reasonably.')
