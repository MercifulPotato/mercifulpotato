There&#x27;s a cultural myth that people who struggle are weak and less than people who are successful. Depression can really amplify that story. When I&#x27;m in that place I need to scale back expectations, find something (anything) I can do that&#x27;s healthy, and cut myself some slack. The truth is we all struggle and success has many dimensions.<p>The &quot;just power through&quot; line isn&#x27;t wrong, in fact, it&#x27;s exactly what I need to hear sometimes. But it can also be exactly the wrong thing. I think it  needs a heavy dose of empathy and compassion along with it.')
