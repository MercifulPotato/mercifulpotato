Finance would do their best in the beginning of the year to negotiate discounts &amp; teams would do their best to keep costs low w&#x2F; reserved instances, etc.<p>Even though $1k is indeed a rounding error where I work vs. what we pay each month, it&#x27;s becoming annoying how granular the billing for new setups is becoming. When I&#x27;m asked to compare TCO of an on-prem solution vs. a hosted one that includes all-of-the-above, I feel like I&#x27;m playing actuary and not cloud engineer.')
