That game is bascially Shadowrun without the dragons and magic and orcs. And Shadowrun went even farther, in that you&#x27;d literally die if you swapped out all your meat for robotics.<p>PS: I agree with the article. Even on meat-body point as far as cyberpunk the genre is concerned. But my feeling is that the dice game shouldn&#x27;t have had it. Not that CDPR shouldn&#x27;t have borrowed it.')
