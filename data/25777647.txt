Most users will give up after they have failed with the first client they found, especially if alternatives like WhatsApp etc. are easier to use.<p>That&#x27;s the first time I see this client mentioned. Maybe in a few years, the dust will have settled and there&#x27;ll be a prominent Matrix client that&#x27;s the obvious choice for most users.
