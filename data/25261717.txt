Josesph Fourier discovered the heat transference problem, also known as the green house gas effect in modern times. Also related to the codon problem (the DNA and RNA protein or chicken or egg problem).<p>Energy, power, and information, metabolism all fundamentally &quot;do work&quot; differently depending on context.  Man has good enough physics developed to solve for huge classes of solutions of earth models, but all of the shared spaces, including all natural resources, must be viewed intrinsically as a global problem. We&#x27;ve never been good at what we can&#x27;t physical intuit or sharing resources (or intuiting over non-trivial side efects). Luckily, since it seems to more an asymptotic issue (in control theory parlance) now, so various policy forcings and incentivization changes will be tried till the glitch is fixed.')
