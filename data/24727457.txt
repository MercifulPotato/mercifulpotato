Didn&#x27;t Intel do something like that?

It&#x27;s easier to just, say, learn CUDA and use a GPU than it is to have HDL folks work with SW.  I have no doubt a system like that would be useful, but it would probably be expensive and limited to specialized, low-volume applications(like big FPGAs are now).')
