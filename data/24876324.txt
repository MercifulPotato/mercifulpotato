CMake is a freaking mess, but its won, so most non-header-only libraries are setup for CMake. I&#x27;ve tried to learn CMake a number of times and have written non-trivial CMake configs. I spent a lot of time on it that I could have spent on my actual project instead and in the end it was still not quite right (breaking after moving to a different system and trying to compile there). I made multiple attempts to try and learn how to do it and failed.<p>So I gave up, I have better (more fun, more productive) things to spend my time on. Life is too short to waste on such things.')
