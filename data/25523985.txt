I&#x27;m still glad I failed &quot;cursive&quot; writing in elementary school - talk about a skill I have never and <i>will</i> never use.<p>Since others are talking about what notebooks they use I will too.  I second the observation that caring too much about a special kind of notebook or how you use it is a waste of time.  I just use blank printer paper and a felt tip architectural pen - I scan notes that I think are relevant and organize them in with a tool I wrote. (parents were architects so I&#x27;m forever addicted to this kind of pen - <i>fuck</i> ballpoint anything other than Pilot G2&#x27;s).')
