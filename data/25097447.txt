I say that despite the fact that my practice of mindfulness has been pretty poor, but I keep working on it.<p>I don&#x27;t subscribe to what I would call woo woo thinking or philosophy, so I was pretty skeptical at first. However, the fact that this book was written by a medical doctor helped me overcome my skepticism. My initial attempts at mindfulness meditation, however unskilled it was, sealed the deal.<p>It has been incredibly helpful (beyond what I originally thought was possible) to use the techniques of mindfulness to be able to notice the thoughts and emotions I was experiencing, without judgement, and then gently, and purposely direct my attention towards something more positive or peaceful. I use the techniques, even if just a little bit, every day. It&#x27;s helped my emotional self-regulation, my relationships, and my ability to focus on work. It&#x27;s helped me cope with pain, and maintain resilience even when I was feeling particularly low.<p>There are lots of wonderful books on this subject. Another great one is &quot;Happiness&quot; by Matthieu Ricard (another scientist). Sam Harris talks about mindfulness extensively, so you might check his work, and his app (although the app is a paid service).')
