Prevents the vast majority of buggy client behaviour and gives you good flexibility to change how you do things over time.<p>---<p>My company ended up with a simple KSUID implementation of our own - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cuvva.com&#x2F;product-updates&#x2F;showing-off-our-fancy-new-k-sortable-ids" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cuvva.com&#x2F;product-updates&#x2F;showing-off-our-fancy-...</a> (having originally used UUIDs and Mongo ObjectIDs)<p>For us, a big part of it was usability with cursor selection etc - in addition to it being immediately obvious what the ID was for.<p>Once we finally had that rolled out everywhere, we ended up collecting up every other ID we&#x27;d ever used and mapped it to its KSUID resource equivalent, so now all our IDs work standalone without type&#x2F;context info, even across environments (and thankfully we&#x27;d never had any collisions on the old IDs)<p>---<p>Going back to the typing - the most difficult part of migrating our IDs actually was converting them all to string types. With Postgres this is a little slow but ultimately fine, but with Mongo you have to actually remove and reinsert every document - you cannot (or at least could not) update IDs in place.')
