While blowout games are easy at first, optimization and learning the balance of money vs actions will start trimming turns off your games.<p>Another factor is that with experience, your opponent will either recognize  what you’re doing and defend by buying the cards you’re wanting, or get their own engine going to beat you if they learn from their mistakes.<p>Most games are won by buying out the provinces, yes, but the three stacks win is there for a reason and is great for catching opponents off guard when the kingdom’s right.')
