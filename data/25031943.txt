Already exist in various forms, for the purposes of voting.<p>2. See #1.<p>3. When people vote by mail, they get ticked off in #1. This doesn&#x27;t happen immediately, because mail-in ballots can be claimed lost or found to be spoiled (with opportunity for correction), and because they have to be cross-referenced against in-person votes - which is why it takes days or weeks for <i>all</i> ballots to be tallied.<p>People running elections aren&#x27;t stupid. They&#x27;ve already thought of all this.<p>Unfortunately, the barrier to making false or completely unsubstantiated allegations about wide-spread voter fraud is zero, so every Tom, Dick, and Harry is currently throwing in their two cents on the matter. (Bonus points if they don&#x27;t actually understand, or actively pretend to mis-understand how the process currently works.)<p>I&#x27;d give those claims the time of day when their proponents are ready to put some skin in the game, and swear on them under penalty of perjury.')
