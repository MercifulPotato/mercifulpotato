I, like several thousand of others, duely filled in the form - only for Ryanair to change their tune a couple of weeks later. My guess was they&#x27;d sought legal advice, and found some loophole they thought would allow them to get away with it.<p>They went several weeks at a time with no general customer communications, and weren&#x27;t replying to emails - on the rare occasions they did, it was to say they&#x27;d process refunds &quot;later&quot;. Some weeks later, they sent out a general customer email, saying they&#x27;d only be issuing (short-lived!) credit notes instead of refunds, and anyone who declined would have to apply <i>again</i>, and would then have to wait until the pandemic was over for a refund. This whole (illegal!) debacle was <i>very</i> widely reported in the British media.')
