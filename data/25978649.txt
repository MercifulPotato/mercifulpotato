Nano&#x27;s tps is uncapped and limited only by hardware.*<p>It&#x27;s very easy to fix. Just increase the maximum block size. There is a fork that does that and a fork that use smaller transactions in a secondary chain.<p>&gt; <i>Bitcoin miners will inflate its supply until the year 2140.</i><p>The Nano foundation got 7M&#x2F;133M = 5% of the initial coins for a &quot;developer found&quot;. Did they spend&#x2F;distribute all of it or it is still saved?<p>Miners will get 2.4M&#x2F;21.0M, that is a 11% inflation. And they have to spend most of it in the mining. Just call this 11% a developer found, and the difference is not so much.<p>&gt; <i>Nano is fully distributed.</i><p>I still don&#x27;t understand how is Nano protected of double spending without PoW or PoS or centralization.')
