Not a chance&quot;<p>Sure it was.<p>This is how a &#x27;coup&#x27; works - the objective is not to &#x27;take control of the country&#x27; by force, but of the political system.<p>If that violent mob was successful in &#x27;stopping the count&#x27; - then it very seriously threatens the legitimacy of Biden being president.<p>Why do you think that Congress <i>reconvened right after the violence</i> and very quickly pushed through the vote? And didn&#x27;t wait a few days?<p>If the vote confirmation doesn&#x27;t take place, someone takes the case to SCOTUS wherein they might rule the process was not complete and &#x27;now you have two Presidents&#x27; - and very ugly ambiguous situation that could spiral out of control very quickly.<p>The fact that SCOTUS could have ruled &#x27;incomplete process&#x27; may embolden millions of &#x27;hard Constitutionalists&#x27; to one side.<p>This stuff happens all over the world, all the time. These things are fragile.<p>It was a nice little lesson in how actually fragile &#x27;even the USA is&#x27; and that this is serious stuff.')
