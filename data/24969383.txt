But the white SUV crossover is merging into the truck and the truck has nowhere to go...so it pushed back. What would you have done? Decelerated rapidly? Physical contact was made no matter what the black truck driver did.<p>As for the driver bragging about it, so what? He did slam into the vehicle trying to push him off the road.<p>All the Trump vehicles were stopped in the video you linked.
