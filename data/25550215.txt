Item(by='rav', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609066390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545543, text='&gt; Non-Boolean logics are rare, and relations more general than partial order are almost never useful.<p>That&#x27;s a bold claim! In set theory, a relation is just some set of pairs made from some base set of elements. I guess the sentence should say &quot;orderings more exotic than the partial order&quot; instead or something, to be more specific.<p>For example, if I&#x27;m implementing a Sokoban engine, I might define a &quot;step&quot; relation on game states, informally saying that two game states are &quot;step&quot;-related if you can get from one state to the other in a single move. From another perspective, this is just an implicit definition of the edges in a large or infinite graph of game states. That&#x27;s because the concept of a set-theoretic relation is in a sense isomorphic to the concept of a graph-theoretic edge set: A relation is a subset of the possible pairs of elements, just like an edge set is a subset of the possible pairs of vertices. And just like a relation can be symmetric (&quot;for all a,b, if a is related to b, then b is related to a&quot;), so can an edge set be symmetric or undirected.')
