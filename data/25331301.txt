What could be the reason, it is not used on a broader base? I assume also lack of libaries, etc.?\nI mean, there are millions of free and open C and C++ libaries around for allmost any usecase, I assume this is not the case with ADA?<p>edit: about ADA<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electronicdesign.com&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;iot&#x2F;article&#x2F;21801203&#x2F;comparing-ada-and-c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electronicdesign.com&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;iot&#x2F;article&#x2F;21...</a><p>is a good comparison of C and Ada, I found.<p>Basically with ADA, you develope much slower (and performance is usually lower). But if you want reliability, it does sound good.')
