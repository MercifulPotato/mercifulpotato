That is why you need to browse around on the map to judge data quality, and even then you might nor see all that is there.<p>The data is usually there if you live in europe, it&#x27;s just hard to search. There are two related things that make it hard, bad tagging of the data and the extreme diversity of data. E.g. this winter I&#x27;ve used osmand to find fire pits, it was a great way to use the data but there seems to lots of ways to tag firepits so a search might not find all of them.')
