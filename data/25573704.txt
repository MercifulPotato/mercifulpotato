You have to account for snow banks, slipperiness, lidar obstruction, and control itself - which is much harder.<p>How many thousands of miles of snow driving data does Tesla possess, compared to the #2 player?<p>Tesla’s approach of vision based, AP disengagement-led training will scale better, precisely due to what you’re looking at in this article - yeah, this is an unimpressive demo - but winter driving, rainy driving, dirt road driving are all <i>general cases</i> for Tesla, while they’re <i>special cases</i> for other companies (from what’s been revealed; Comma might be an exception).<p>Most people drive in the place they live, and drive on the highway to visit their friends and parents. It’s easy to be deceived into thinking driving is a small problem space of stop signs and lane changes. But even within just North America, there is enormous variety.<p>There is massive risk involved - these folks are pushing NNs further than any application I’ve seen, but with the last few releases, it suddenly doesn’t look all that crazy.<p>Secondly, combining rules based systems and neural networks is difficult. You end up with the N * M problem, and inevitably end up missing cases. It makes sense to do the absolute basic safety features as rules, and Tesla might be doing this, but all it takes for Tesla’s NN approach to pay off is one leap in explainability. There is an entire industry working on this - and Tesla will be the single biggest benefactor.<p>I don’t know who will win L5 - but I’m putting my bets on Tesla for L4.')
