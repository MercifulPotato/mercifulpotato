You (currently) double click the background to create new nodes. There are reasons for this but I may need to rethink it.<p>I will also think again about having input output nodes on the canvas as it does solve some issues. I however prefer the visual metaphor of having them floating at the edge of the screen.<p>I am considering making it zoomable &#x2F; pan able but in someways I like the restriction on complexity. I want to encourage people to create &quot;sub-graphs&quot; instead of add more nodes.<p>I know its not far from perfect yet but EtcH is designed from the ground up to be a &quot;language&quot; rather than a way to wire together pre-defined nodes. Im glad its those innovative  parts that you like :)')
