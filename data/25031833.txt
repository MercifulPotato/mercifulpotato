I don&#x27;t have a good spider-sense for this kind of number crunching so I&#x27;d have to do some math.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re not paying attention, but way less fine to build a narrative about voter fraud based on it.<p>I have not been claiming there is anything to this theory, but it is fun to argue about. And I&#x27;m definitely not happy to see this argument get personal, but from my perspective, it is least fine of all to gaslight people with a nonsense fairy-tale that corruption and fraud do not exist.')
