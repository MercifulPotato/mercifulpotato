They expect the market, more specifically individuals to train themselves so the company can just go outside and shake a tree and get 20 people to apply who have trained themselves without a guarantee that they will be employed. So people pick the better odds for themselves, and the priority for diversified labor is not matching what these greedy companies want. So they&#x27;ll have to train people up to change the individual&#x27;s incentives.')
