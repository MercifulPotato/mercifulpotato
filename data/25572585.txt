The UK left the UK on 31st January 2020 and negotiations on this agreement didn&#x27;t start (and couldn&#x27;t legally begin) until then. The negotiations around the &quot;withdrawal agreement&quot; were a completely different thing and were solely about what the EU &#x2F; UK relationship would be during the transition period which ends at midnight on 31st December this year. As part of that withdrawal agreement the UK government specifically negotiated a short transition period (off the top of my head the initial EU offer was five years), presumably because they thought that the increased time pressure on the EU would work to their advantage. Whether that has worked out as Boris and co hoped I&#x27;ll leave as an exercise for the reader.')
