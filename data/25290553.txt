There is no factual basis to it at all.  This is literally a fantasy.<p>“App Store rules, policy conformance, release restrictions, and Apple tax impose a huge overhead on everyone.”<p>Only in a world where these things are not part of <i>why</i> Apple is successful.<p>These are not problems, they are <i>solutions</i> to the complex problem of creating a market in which consumers are willing to spend money on software.<p>This is not conjecture.  It is a <i>fact</i> borne out by the huge amounts of money people do in fact spend on Apps.<p>We wouldn’t be having this discussion of Apple hadn’t created a marketplace people trust.<p>Believe it or not, I actually want a parallel universe where Apple isn’t the only trusted platform, and I want the alternative to be open, not just another giant corporation.<p>However, the only way to make that happen is is if we build the technologies to enable it.<p>We won’t be able to do that if the government regulates software distribution.')
