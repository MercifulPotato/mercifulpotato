Or you need a particular subsystem to have immediate priority <i>NOW</i>.<p>It&#x27;s quite irritating that everybody wants to complicate something which is basically &quot;1) call this init function&quot; &quot;2) call that function every n ms on a timer&quot;.<p>The problem in programming (and this is true even for desktop stuff) is that everybody wants to own the event loop.<p>No.  No no no no no no no.  Bad programmer.  No biscuit.<p>Two systems that want to own the event loop can&#x27;t compose.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m running a CANOpen and a BLE stack.  Both want to own <i>everything</i>.  Well, sometimes that CAN system emits an event that I <i>MUST</i> not ignore (human proximity alert on a robot--for example).  And I have to spend a not insignificant amount of time <i>getting the bloody BLE stack out of the way</i> so that I can focus solely on the CAN system for the moment.')
