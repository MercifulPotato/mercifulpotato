But I do believe the bulk of Trump voters are voting against their self interests, because they are gullible. Why else would most Trump voters come from rural areas? If they had legit reasons to support Trump why aren&#x27;t the voters spread equally among urban&#x2F;educated and rural&#x2F;uneducated people? Which of Trump&#x27;s policies are only helping rural&#x2F;uneducated people?')
