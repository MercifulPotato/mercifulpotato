[1] They&#x27;re hashtags. We can&#x27;t kick people out of a hashtag, and it&#x27;s not even clear what ideas fall under a given hashtag.<p>We could have productive discussion about ideas themselves:<p>* Should the government subsidize dairy?<p>* Should the government pay for maternity leave? Should employers?<p>We can talk about what works in Europe, whether money is really fungible, and how to provide welfare without distorting the market or accidentally causing hiring discrimination.<p>But it&#x27;s less productive to discuss people:<p>* Is Contrapoints right?<p>* Is Joaquin Phoenix right?<p>You get sidetracked with &quot;Remember that time she hired Buck Angel? Remember that time Joaquin starred in Joker?&quot; That&#x27;s not discussion. That&#x27;s a fan-made tabloid.<p>And it&#x27;s useless to discuss hashtags:<p>* Does feminism??<p>* Is veganism???<p>&quot;Remember that blog that said hetero sex is inherently bad? Remember that time a PETA employee killed someone&#x27;s pet dog?&quot;<p>Now we&#x27;re 2 cuils from changing minds.<p>I am guessing this is a problem on HN, because it&#x27;s a problem everywhere.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Granfalloon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Granfalloon</a><p>Edit: Formatting trouble.
