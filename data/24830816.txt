I have personal discords, work discords, side project-based discords, and community discords.<p>I want different handles for them, I want DMs to be grouped by discord - not into a single giant bucket, I want notification emails to go to different emails.<p>The biggest blocker to me enjoying discord is that it assumes I&#x27;m the same person across all the groups.')
