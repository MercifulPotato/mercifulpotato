Your career shouldn&#x27;t define you. It should be a byproduct of who <i>you</i> are. Not the defining trait. It&#x27;s hard to realize this at the beginning when you are trying to climb the ladder but after 20 years you begin to realize:<p>In the end you die, if you didn&#x27;t live a life you want, it&#x27;s your fault. Open your heart, get in touch with that inner kid, do hobbies and things that excite you.  It&#x27;s ok to change.')
