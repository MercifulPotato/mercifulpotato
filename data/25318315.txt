Now the taller the building is, the smaller the portion of the taxable value derives from the land itself.<p>The fact of the matter is single family suburbia is a scourge, and we need redevelopment not more development. We can subsidize affordable housing, or we can structure the taxes such that the only economical thing to do is massively denser buildings immediately. The latter is better because it is simpler and less subject to regulatory capture.')
