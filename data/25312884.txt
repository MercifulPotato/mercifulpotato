The desire for ephemeral real-time discussion is what really drove the idea... As for the name (lol), at the time I was trying to think of something that represented what it was about, and came across the word &quot;squawk&quot;. That name is pretty common but I liked the play on it &quot;sqwok&quot; because it&#x27;s 5 characters, easy to spell &amp; remember. I decided to roll with it, but have a backup just in case!')
