Such law can only exist on paper, because the corporations still have the de-facto power and users don&#x27;t.<p>Normal people can&#x27;t host content themselves. In theory they may, but their home Internet connection does not have public IP because of cgNAT, and they need to bow down to DNS registrar to make their website work. Attacking web hosters (e.g. AWS) and DNS registrars is the primary way to silence free speech, yet this bill does nothing about that.<p>If Polish really need freedom speech on Internet, they have to mandate public IP addresses and  disallow non-commerce clauses for all ISPs. And shield DNS registrars from responsibility for actions of their clients. <i>Those</i> things would be enforceable. This law isn&#x27;t.')
