I use strings for json front &#x2F; back communication as much as possible. A string (or hash) is a unique metric. I have a real-life example where I was working with a junior C # backend developer who was creating code with a lot of errors, and we doubled our progress when we stopped discussing json types. Another good lesson when the frontend code of the code thinks &quot;with its own head&quot; and checks each json input parameter for safety and fewer errors, and strings have less opportunity to check and validate if (!!s) and clean  i=parseInt(res.i), parseBool(..), parseObjA(..) looks like typed programming and newcomers to projects can learn the code better.')
