You even said yourself it was a product release that happened months after he made the comments. Was he supposed to understand what changes Intel made to AVX512 before they announced it? Also, he’s not even talking about clock downscaling. He’s saying that AVX512 is the wrong way to get significantly more performance vs the amount of space and power it consumes (definitely true for most applications and 100% true for kernel work) and that Intel would be better served focused on general perf (which isn’t wrong given how they’ve been trounced by AMD and Apple).<p>Consider also that Linus worked at Transmetta for a relatively long time trying to build a CPU company. I would trust his opinions on chip ISA design more than most software developers.<p>You’ve basically taken his post out of context, misinterpreted it to be saying something he isn’t, and claiming it’s wrong because some details have changed on the ground <i>after</i> he made it.<p>This is the problem with expert opinion. It’s so easy to misinterpret. It’s also possible to get some details wrong without invalidating the larger point. Figuring out when the expert is wrong is hard, but claiming that Linus doesn’t understand chip design just factually doesn’t understand the context of Linus’ perspective and his actual professional experience.')
