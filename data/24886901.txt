On some level, I guess it&#x27;s a no-brainer: if it&#x27;s not reproducible, it&#x27;s not science, right? And on a practical level, I think there are a lot of good things about making your analysis reproducible,&quot;<p>It does not say making research reproducible is not worth it - it just wants one exception - about the figure layout (fonts, colors, etc) and then it argues against using version control which is orthogonal. I don&#x27;t agree with him that version control is too complicated - but I agree that version control is not really needed for reproducibility.')
