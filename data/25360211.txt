I think he&#x27;s more interested in rockets than cars these days.  I bet he&#x27;s frustrated that he believes he is a better capital deployer than the state of CA - which is probably true if measured by returns on capital - however that isn&#x27;t what government is for.  Government is, ostensibly, to support the well being of entire populations over generations.<p>To answer some other questions why people like Elon but not other billionaires.  He thinks about things more engineer like, doesn&#x27;t accept things on face value, has a libertarian bent, doesn&#x27;t seem to value traditional things that the wealthy are attributed to (read: expansive homes [anymore], yachts, fancy collectibles) and is an unbelievable producer.<p>It seems any capital he does accumulate he deploys directly into his next venture - which creates jobs, products and tax benefits for states.')
