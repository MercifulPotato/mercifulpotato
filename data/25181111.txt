Item(by='Kalium', descendants=None, kids=[25181353], score=None, time=1606079166, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25180947, text='&gt; It was insane for Twitter to open their HQ in the middle of SF&#x27;s skid row.<p>I remember SF city government going out of their way to try to get actual businesses in there. Clearly Twitter made the egregious error of trying to play ball with the city government.<p>&gt; Have you asked, &quot;What can do to gain welcome?&quot;<p>Yes.<p>The answers ranged from &quot;fuck you&quot; to &quot;sell all your stuff, give all your money to charity, give your job to a QTPOC, and leave&quot;. None of them included kindness, compassion, or being a decent human being. None of them actually allowed for the possibility of welcome.<p>&gt; Okay if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting from SFians you are hanging out with the WRONG SFians<p>I don&#x27;t hang out with them if I can help it. I just meet the ones who lambast millions of dollars to charity as bad (when it&#x27;s people they dislike) and characterize SF&#x27;s xenophobic policies as love. Who obsess over SF&#x27;s supposed weirdness while resenting people who don&#x27;t conform to their expectations. Who make excuses for treating migrants with hostility, and expect them to understand as they refuse to return the favor.<p>I cut them out of  my life as quickly as I can, because I have very little tolerance for that kind of hypocritical xenophobia.<p>The old skool SF types seem to like me. I&#x27;ve got a kind of weird they appreciate. The new skool, on the other hand...<p>----<p>But I&#x27;ll play along. What can I do to gain a welcome?')
