And yet...within a span of just one year we have seen institutions crumble or at least weaken.. industry, financial institutions, news and media, education and dare I say, democracy. All man made institutions. Let’s include armies, marriage institution, family units, country borders, political parties&#x2F;philosophies etc.<p>From a broader perspective, what are all the man made institutions we have relied on to be pillars of civilization? Let’s make a list. I am not talking about natural institutions...and by which, I mean those that follow the second law of thermodynamics and entropy before it perishes. Like the aging human body or a tree of forests etc.<p>Only religion has survived. Abrahamic monotheistic faiths for 2000 and Hinduism for 5000 and offshoots of Hinduism like Buddhism etc for slightly lesser periods. All man made. They have not only thrived but also as a viral meme spread fast. And haven’t evolved much(little changes in ritual or practices doesn’t count as evolution)<p>And many other man made religious institutions have come and gone. So many cults exists, but some have more staying power than others.')
