From a distributors point of view, I get why you dont want to solve all these problems.  From a user point of view, there is no good reason why I should learn more then one package manager.<p>Itsa a dilemma.  A similar thing is happening with ~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;<p>When I started with Linux 25 years ago, it was totally normal to know and do the configure&#x2F;make&#x2F;make install dance.  10 years later, most of what I wanted to use was available as a packge.  And if it wasn&#x27;t, I actually built one.\nThese days, I have a 3G ~&#x2F;.local&#x2F; directory.  It has become normal again to build stuff locally and just drop it into ~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;.  And in fact, sometimes it is way easier to do so then to try and find a current version packaged by your distribution.')
