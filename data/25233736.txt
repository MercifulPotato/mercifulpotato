I&#x27;ve been wondering for a while how they&#x27;ve managed to get multithreaded x86 emulation working fast. I had heard mentions of &quot;kernel support&quot;, but hadn&#x27;t really looked into it much. It turns out that what I had guessed was correct, and that they simply added intel&#x27;s memory ordering as an optional mode to their processor; &quot;When running translated x86 code, they switch the mode of the CPU to conform to Intel&#x27;s memory ordering.&quot;')
