Reports obviously differ, but many concluded that the actions of the police, in attacking the protestors, are what escalated the situation to violence. Compare from [1], and I think this &quot;who is escalating&quot; question becomes clear and relevant.<p>Which is to say that while the protest ended violently, I think you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find widespread intent that it be violent from the start.[2]<p>So again I&#x27;ll ask: do you believe that the protesting in Minneapolis was formed <i>with the intention</i> of committing violence against police officers?<p>On the other hand, do you believe the insurrection at the capitol, which had participants openly advocating for violence for days, was formed, with the intention of committing violence against elected officials?<p>I find the attempt to draw a parallel between a situation where it took 3 days of getting teargassed for protestors to become violent and one where it took...a speech from the President.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;LiteraryMouse&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347873482550468609" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;LiteraryMouse&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347873482550468609</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;police-response-black-lives-matter-protest-us-capitol&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;police-response-black-live...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apmreports.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;30&#x2F;what-happened-at-minneapolis-3rd-precinct" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apmreports.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;30&#x2F;what-happened-at...</a> is my source for the timeline, which appears to be a fairly evenhanded account, noting that some city council members had <i>already</i> proposed abandoning the precinct for more than a day before it ultimately was.')
