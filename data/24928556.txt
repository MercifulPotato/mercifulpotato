It was mainly jokes about women.  The community was primarily of young males, and that did stop as more women got involved.  However, I should state for completeness that none of it was anything that anyone should have been banned over; sometimes a joke was just a joke, before humour was effectively outlawed lest anyone get even slightly offended.')
