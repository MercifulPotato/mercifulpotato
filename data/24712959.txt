Tesla will frequently send a technician to a customer&#x27;s home or place of work and fix issues on the spot. Even when I&#x27;ve had to go to a service center in person, they&#x27;ve included free rideshare credits for quick repairs so that I don&#x27;t have to wait around, or free loaner cars for longer repairs.<p>Back in the old days when I lived far away from a service center, they once drove hundreds of miles with a flatbed to come pick up my car, and dropped off a free loaner at my house while my car was in the shop, then came back and returned my car and picked up the loaner a few days later. (The loaner was also a nicer Tesla than the one I owned.) They really do go above and beyond to resolve issues as pleasantly and conveniently as possible.')
