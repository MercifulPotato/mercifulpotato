Please get yours this season so we can help reduce the spread of yet another deadly respiratory virus that kills thousands of people each year.<p>It turns out that masks are <i>far</i> more effective than flu shots, so no, I&#x27;m not going to get a flu shot.  Anyway, IIRC, &quot;kills thousands of people each year&quot; is a statistical projection that doesn&#x27;t actually stand up to scrutiny.  Certainly, it&#x27;s nothing like COVID-19.<p>&gt;There was a lot of debate about masks.<p>There was a lot of misinformation spread because of the failure to stockpile PPE.  That misinformation is still doing harm now because the MAGA folks are running around saying &quot;masks don&#x27;t work&quot;<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re implying by the phrase &#x27;argument by authority,&#x27; but we&#x27;re talking about people who have spent their entire careers in the field of medicine. Normally we call those people &#x27;scientists&#x27; and &#x27;experts.&#x27;<p>Unfortunately, medical experts credibility is now shot by  spreading false information about masks, and by downplaying the risk of COVID-19 in January and February by telling everybody to get a flu shot.  Then I wonder how many people died on ventilators when intubated on MAX ..<p>As a group you&#x27;re weren&#x27;t operating at the level of Dennis Richie or Donald Knuth, so you have work to do to regain credibility.<p>In fact, you&#x27;re still not now.  You should focus less on evidence-based medicine and more on risk asymmetry.  Mask wearing (even of cloth masks) had very little downside and a potentially huge upside.  But we had to wait for evidence.  The same is true of vitamin-D now.  Look for low-risk interventions.  If we don&#x27;t have the resources to mass test the at-risk population, we should encourage those on poor diets to take 1000IU a daythis winter.  But we will have to wait until next year for evidence.')
