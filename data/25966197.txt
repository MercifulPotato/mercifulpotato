I can type at ~150WPM for long periods of time without any strain or tiredness, can reach 200+ in short bursts, and have done over 50WPM with only the left hand.<p>However, one thing I&#x27;ve found that really affects typing speed and comfort is the key travel and actuation force; I think a &quot;light, spongy, bouncy&quot; feel is best. A light force reduces strain, sponginess is a good cushion, and the bounce helps speed up the return stroke. You can type a lot faster once you train yourself to not try to await any tactile feedback, but just &quot;trust&quot; that you&#x27;ve hit the keys and they&#x27;ve actuated.')
