It would be the Apple equivalent of the Microsoft Surface, one which I was initially excited about, but which Microsoft hasn&#x27;t updated in design since the Surface Pro 3 days.<p>macOS is already moving towards touch, if you notice the pattern of bigger icons, more space between buttons, and larger padding. It&#x27;s clear that macOS and iPadOS will converge. You can already run iPhone and iPad apps on M1 now. You could even have something like the Magic keyboard having its own battery like the Surface Book, and instead of the Book&#x27;s docking mechanism, with the Magic Keyboard you could wirelessly charge from the keyboard to the iPad with the iPhone 12&#x27;s new wireless charging mechanism.<p>Then I could just buy one device rather than two.
