What if it&#x27;s a cold storage wallet that is 2of3 signature protected and signatories are in different countries? What if you go on several weeks vacation? What if it&#x27;s in a vault along with your gold, are you going to walk to the bank every week, open the vault, load the keys, then export them to some other cold storage? What if you have a virus that makes you have to restore large chunks of your infrastructure from backups that takes longer than a week? This is simply ridiculous.  What you propose is just not realistic, no one who deals with crypto often will ever think that this is a solution.<p>&gt; We can even automate the process for you if you trust us enough to give us your wallet keys.<p>Haha seriously? Your solution is that people give their private keys to the government? You must have no experience with crypto or what it&#x27;s about it all. Nor really experience with how the government works and how often it gets corrupt. A corrupt clerk now is a small nuissance, a corrupt clerk in your proposed scenario means that thousands of addresses get stolen of all of their tokens. There is zero chance that this scenario will ever be implemented in any meaningful way.')
