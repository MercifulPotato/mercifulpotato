Schultz was sacrificed at the altar to calm the public. The superdelegate system, too. The political establishments (Dem and Rep) have been given a taste of how much their constituencies resent them. If they want to maintain power, primaries can only become less democratic going forward.<p>I&#x27;m worried that insurgent candidate like those in &#x27;the squad&#x27; were only allowed to succeed as an olive branch to the left-populists for the purposes of maintaining a coherent anti-trump coalition.<p>The Republicans ran a reasonably clean primary in 2016, and got Trump, a demagogue completely dismissive of the party&#x27;s interests, who catered to his base, and only helped the Republicans in circumstances of mutual interests. I don&#x27;t think the party&#x27;s leadership will be willing to risk something like that again, if the behavior of the Bush-era cabinet appointees he had is any indicator.')
