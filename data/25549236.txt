The article makes no allegations that she stepped on Newsom&#x27;s toes, but it sure seems like it. She deserves a medal, not to be fired. The article doesn&#x27;t say who hired her in the first place, just:<p>&gt; Stebbins was hired as the agency’s executive director in February 2018 to bring fresh scrutiny to its finances and operations.<p>Who hired her?<p>Also:<p>&gt; “I find this outrageous!” Batjer wrote to her old colleague. “I’m terribly worried. Thanks much for any advice&#x2F;help you can get before this gets much worse.”<p>&gt; “Let’s get together and figure this out!” Lee responded. “We will help you fix, don’t stress.”<p>I can count on zero fingers the number of times I&#x27;ve used an exclamation mark professionally. Batjer then proceeds to essentially conspire with other board members to fire her, breaking the law in so doing.')
