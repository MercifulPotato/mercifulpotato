Item(by='squarefoot', descendants=None, kids=[25286450], score=None, time=1606965801, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25283848, text='From early in the article:<p>&quot;Let me start by making one thing clear – the current Pine Store isn’t going away and the pricing in the Pine Store will remain unchanged.&quot;<p>Then near the end:<p>&quot;The Pine Store, in its current form, isn’t going anytime soon and the current community-oriented price point will not change.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t want to nitpick, but I believe some further clarification would be needed; those &quot;in its current form&quot; and &quot;anytime soon&quot; can make a world of difference.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I totally support the move, although I&#x27;m not sure bumping the price to $299 for a device that isn&#x27;t 100% ready yet would be a good move, especially considering that most customers in retail shops wouldn&#x27;t be so sensitive about privacy, openness, etc. compared to online purchasers.<p>If I may offer an idea to recover some costs, why not making a backplane board for the PinePhone mainboard, with screws, flat cables to the mainboard and connectors to the external world? It could become both a development platform for the phone, and be used as a SBC for tinkering. Also all people who upgraded their phone to the 3GB&#x2F;32GB version could make some use of their old mainboard.\nIt could become a normal procedure: phone is upgraded, old mainboard becomes useable again, everything is reused and nothing is thrown away. The message sent would be <i>so</i> different from other phone manufacturers and their planned obsolescence.')
