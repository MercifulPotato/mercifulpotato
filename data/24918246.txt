Even if one was breaking into the house of the other.<p>If you&#x27;re a healthy human being you don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to kill the intruder, you want to be safe. Neither does the intruder want to kill you, they want to get away with your stuff.<p>Two people not wanting to kill, being forced to kill simply by the presence, or even just the <i>possible</i> presence of a gun.<p>If you can&#x27;t see the intrinsic evil in that, then I guess you must really think lightly about killing people.')
