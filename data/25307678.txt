(I think it varies by language).<p>I thought the rule was ridiculous - until I realised one of my colleagues had set his computer up with 3 tmux sessions side by side, each perfectly fitting a 120 column code window. He never had to scroll sideways, and he was very productive with his setup. The fact he knew exactly how wide to make his terminals made his workflow much better.<p>I don’t follow that rule on my own projects, beyond keeping line lengths “reasonable”. But that rule might be on to something.')
