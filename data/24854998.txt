You get on the LIRR and you end up in penn station. It&#x27;s not the same as grand central but from a connectivity perspective it&#x27;s similar. I&#x27;ve taken the train from Zurich airport to Zurich HB and while I recall it being fancier it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s materially different (both go from point A to point B in a reasonable period of time at a reasonable cost).')
