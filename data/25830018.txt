My advice would be to find a hobby or a club where you start off with some common ground.  Or even sports, join a casual softball league if they have them.  The thing with making new friendships is that they don&#x27;t happen overnight, and sometimes its hard to tell right away which acquaintances turn into friends. On top of that, peoples&#x27; stage of life changes (marriage, kids, jobs, etc), so some friends fade in and out along the way.  So cast a wide net and don&#x27;t let your prejudices get in the way (too much).  Sometimes it takes a year or more until some casual acquaintance (or group) turn into actual friends, just from being around them enough (via some shared hobby or club, etc...)  That was all pre covid... these days in a COVID world, I imagine it can only be exponentially harder to make new friendships....')
