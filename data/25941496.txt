I mostly agree with what you&#x27;re saying here (and thanks for including a local example!). That said, I think the following isn&#x27;t the correct portrayal of the situation:<p>&gt; <i>To me people who cling their freedom to utter words that a significant portion of their fellow compatriots find offensive, look exactly like that. Picking a silly battle, and entrenching themselves.</i><p>We&#x27;re not talking about people who &quot;cling to their freedom&quot; to say what they want to everyone. We&#x27;re dealing with a group that used language allowed by its local culture, that suddenly got in the spotlight, and now <i>the rest of the world</i> is trying to pressure them into conforming to the norms used elsewhere. To riff of your example, it&#x27;s like the wide world suddenly noticed Tuscany is a place, and decided to condemn people living there for insulting the Christian god on a regular basis.<p>I mention this point because, in my observation, this was a common pattern in on-line communities, particularly around forceful introduction of Codes of Conduct. Outsiders would enter a niche community, take public offense at the local language norms, mobilize a wider Internet crowd, and force the community to change their norms under threat of heaps of negative publicity. To me, this kind of behavior reeks of... colonialism.')
