Because TLA+ allows you to either write a proof of an assertion or to automatically look for counterexamples with a model checker, it makes it easy to compare the relative difficulty of those two activities. Not only is proving much harder, in most cases you&#x27;ll find that &quot;intuitive&quot; reasoning is just wrong.')
