Every 4-8 years when the political cycle changes they stock up but after a few cycles the demand should grind to a halt. It&#x27;s not like guns are advancing a lot either.<p>A lot of people who own guns also collect them. It is kind of a hobby. Guns might not be advancing, but people like having multiple different kinds, swap attachments, get some rare handgun from WW2 era from Czechoslovakia, etc.<p>Plus, it isn&#x27;t all just about guns themselves. A lot of it is in the adjacent stuff, like ammo (which inevitably runs out, if you go to a gun range on a regular basis).<p>I prefer to think of it similarly to an audio gear enthusiast hobby. How many headphones&#x2F;amps&#x2F;synths&#x2F;keyboards&#x2F;guitars&#x2F;etc. one might need? People spend enormous amounts of money on audio gear for decades, without actually &quot;needing&quot; most of it, and it isn&#x27;t like the actual acoustics or technology in audio changes that much (with exception of a few specific categories, like midi controllers).<p>&gt;So I really wonder if republicans are scared when a democrat is in office and subsequently buy guns because of that or whether they are scared into buying more guns by mere marketing.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I have plenty of politically left-leaning friends who bought their first firearms this year. So, I think, covid and protests are, at least partially, definitely fueling that increase in sales all across the political spectrum.')
