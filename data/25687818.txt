The best I could do before switching to Simple was putting about half my paycheck in a savings account in another bank that I had no other accounts with and using that to pay my rent and maybe a few other bills.  I was still always overdrawing my checking account at my main bank.  I would occasionally have to go to the other bank, withdraw cash and drive over to the main bank to deposit it.  Luckily, that bank didn&#x27;t have any branches near where I worked, so I either had to wait 3 days for an online transfer or do my &quot;shame banking&quot; as my SO called it on my work from home day or Saturday morning.  Simple&#x27;s &quot;Safe-to-Spend&quot; is really a game changer for people like me.')
