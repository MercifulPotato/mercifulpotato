I was just $40&#x2F;mo for me in NYC. However, I lived in an apartment building with only one wall exposed and the other 5 surrounded by apartments&#x2F;hallway. Further, the apartment was insulated so excessively, we&#x27;d open the balcony door and windows in the winter to get rid of stale air.<p>Flip to a house, also in NYC, and the heating bill was 4x for 2x more space...I think mostly because it was a detached home with all sides open.')
