(Scheme described here - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sriku.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;29&#x2F;forget-password&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sriku.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;29&#x2F;forget-password&#x2F;</a> ) I don&#x27;t think I understand the full consequences of reducing the steps for this even more, but am very curious to consider. I do need to maintain a sense of continued identity across machines and need to communicate with the users outside of the site, as my users expect that (and email serves that well). I think it is already fairly simple (relatively). What would be an approach to simplify this even more?')
