I&#x27;ve done the last 300 km. The distance between places to stay is manageable, lots of infrastructure, lots of friendly people who could help you if you get stuck. You don&#x27;t need to carry much because you sleep indoors and there is food available along the way.<p>The next step would be doing a hut&#x2F;refuge to hut&#x2F;refuge hike in the Alps. A hut&#x2F;refuge is a hotel with a restaurant, private rooms, dorm rooms. They are hundreds (thousands) of them throughout the Alps. You can arrange them yourself for multiday hikes. There are an infinite number of routes, but a good starting place would be this publisher of guidebooks: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cicerone.co.uk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cicerone.co.uk&#x2F;</a>.\nLikewise, you only need to carry your lunch, but you do need more clothes because mountain weather can be unpredictable and dangerous.<p>I&#x27;ve personally done the &quot;Tour de Vanoise&quot; which I think is easy enough for novices and the &quot;Stubai Hohenweg&quot; which was definitely harder and scarier.<p>Actual backpacking (tent&#x2F;sleeping bag, etc) is harder because you need more equipment but a good way to start in the United States might be by doing a group trip with The Sierra Club or a local club (meeetup.com) or commercial trip (REI?). I&#x27;ve done many Sierra Club trips.')
