If you follow them on social media, you’ll see they make lots of partisan posts, are no longer very professionally neutral in how they talk about things, and have a selection bias in terms of what they focus on and talk about. I doubt today’s ACLU would make the same statement, if only because most of their social media following seems to be against the free speech principles that are fundamental to the US. I feel this change primarily happened between 2015 and now. It’s why I stopped supporting them after years - there are better organizations for supporting those principles, like FIRE.')
