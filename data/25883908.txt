There&#x27;s text saying &quot;Microsoft announced X last week&quot; and it&#x27;s a link, but when I click it I don&#x27;t go to the announcement, I go to their article about the announcement.<p>It frustrates me to no end that I can&#x27;t easily reach the original material because the site wants to keep me engaged.')
