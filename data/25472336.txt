A supermarket has an app and offers in-store discounts on food, your data subsidizes the cost of what you purchase. Many offers are locked behind a social contract of &quot;you give me data and I&#x27;ll give you some money off&quot;. It&#x27;s amusing to see how &#x27;cheap&#x27; people are and how much data they are willing to freely give away in the name of a very very small discount (the data is worth much more than the savings you are getting).<p>An always online, always connected fully digital society is prone to attacks, hacks and disturbances. We&#x27;ve seen hospitals held to ransom and have paid bitcoins to get critical machines working again, something that shouldn&#x27;t even be possible, yet one person who opens $phishingEmail.exe can bring down an entire network.<p>Our life is essentially in the hands of crudely built machines, with absolutely no security against basic human errors - and we trust these with the very foundation of society. One day we will witness a truly devastating hack, a disturbance unlike anything we&#x27;ve known previously, and it&#x27;ll likely be as devastating as the Beirut explosion. It&#x27;s not an if, but a when.<p>I want to return to a time without cars or computers, even just for a brief period (the lockdown was so nice this year. the hum of the birds and not the thunder of engines was a blessing).')
