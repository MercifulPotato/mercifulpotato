Most people who suggest this don’t realize that it would eliminate public participation from most of the  internet. There can be no comment sections or Reddit or HN or StackOverflow or Wikipedia in this model. It would be very difficult to have any discussion forum at all. It would lead to an internet where powerful voices are even more powerful  (because they have big publishers that will stand behind their words) and where the average user has a much much harder time being heard.')
