This figure makes LUMI one of the world’s fastest supercomputers. For comparison, the world’s fastest computer today (Fugaku in Japan) reaches 513 petaflop&#x2F;s and the second fastest (Summit in the US) 200 petaflop&#x2F;s<p>But good to see heat used for district heating, also that&#x27;s probably the first supercomputer which will not be used for calculating aging atomic weapon yields.<p>edit: first time I heard about not calculating aging atomic weapon yields. Thanks.')
