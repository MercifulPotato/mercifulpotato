A compiler that runs in 3 seconds that produces code that&#x27;s half the speed as a compiler that runs in 3 minutes is a worse option than the latter in plenty of use cases. And if we <i>really</i> care about minimizing compile times (and if we&#x27;re being a little pedantic) we can just use an interpreted language and achieve zero compile times, by virtue of not doing any compiling at all.<p>Rust and Pascal have different use cases in mind. I think a better question would be what are the different design philosophies between the two languages, and how this impacts compiler implementations.')
