I went through the whole article and it just seems to me that instead of asking .NET devs to build a react app, you could have just hired react devs and none of the problems would&#x27;ve existed. Or have the entire team go through a proper react bootcamp. As a dev, I can say for sure, devs not learning new things and keeping up to date are the worst. The ones you need are the ones who try new things and then create solutions that are best fit for the problem with a rational mindset. Pretty much everything else will slow your development eventually, be it react or something else.')
