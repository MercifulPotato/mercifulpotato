Because of the euro-centrism of these fields in their traditional naming schemes, the &quot;Neolithic revolution&quot; often refers to the invasion&#x2F;migration of Neolithic peoples into better documented regions, in particular Western Europe. That happened after Göbekli Tepe.<p>But if you ask &quot;where did the Neolithic people come from&quot; the answer is somewhere in central or western Asia. And presumably they developed their technology and society over thousands of years before taking the world by storm, so that puts Göbekli Tepe (potentially!) inside the bounds of the Neolithic peoples.')
