Covid-19 has resulted in over 2 million deaths, 400k of which are in the US.  It has brought the US life expectancy down by a full year.  The death rate varies by age, but is roughly equivalent to a full year&#x27;s worth of mortality risk, concentrated into a single event.  And we fundamentally do not know what other long-term risks there are from it.  The vaccine carries less risk than the disease.<p>&quot;Something like Covid&quot; is exactly the sort of disease that should be vaccinated against.  The only reason why this is being done at an employer level rather than at a government level is because the federal government under the previous administration plugged its ears and refused to acknowledge the severity of the disease.')
