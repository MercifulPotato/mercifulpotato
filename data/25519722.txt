I guess I&#x27;m spoiled in that the government in my country is not very corrupt. Sure a little, but not very.<p>But we also have our fair share of disputes over what businesses can open, which have to close, etc. \nThe problem is a very difficult one, so it&#x27;s to be expected that there will be inconsistencies and some unfair treatment unfortunately.<p>In the best case the businesses that are forced to close get some help with payroll and such. Then again there is the problem of who gets help. You said small consultancies don&#x27;t get help where you&#x27;re from but big ones do. That sounds corrupt and so I can understand your viewpoint better.<p>Sometimes small businesses or individual operators don&#x27;t get support because they have neglected proper taxes. They surely feel treated unfairly, but are they?\nIt&#x27;s a hard problem.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s the case with your example, I can totally see a corrupt government helping their lobbyist friends in this way.<p>Speaking of corporate interests, it seems I really spooked some readers by mentioning asset taxes.')
