A bomb was found and four people died.<p>Somehow, this is not that bad? How are these people merely funny protesters and not insurgents or even terrorists? The funny guy broke laws that can land him at least 20 years in jail.<p>Its weird seeing the lackluster police response after the secretive kidnappings, overwhelming force and use of chemical weapons against blm protesters.')
