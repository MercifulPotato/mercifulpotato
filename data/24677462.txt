Pretty much everyone have seen how this or that incapable person comes the ranks or how someone got leadership because he is son of the right person. Right person can be owner,  or is not like it would be even illegal. Even the president is someone like that,  someone whose achievements are all build on lies and excessive benefit of doubt due to his family of origin. The advisor is guy exactly like that too.<p>But somehow,  telling that this is how things work is still conspiracy theory.')
