The barrier is in getting your card accepted by zillions of retailers and online merchants. Having built that network is what entrenches Visa and MC.<p>PayPal has attacked this in the online space by offering merchants a credit card checkout flow that also allows you to pay straight from your linked-directly-to-bank-account PayPal account. Square is attacking it in a similar way in the physical domain. Companies like WeChat and Grab are also working on alternative ways to pay for common things.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a duopoly, but the solution here probably looks like some kind of government-overseen&#x2F;mandated standard which allows a reasonable hurdle for newcomers to participate on both the consumer and merchant side.')
