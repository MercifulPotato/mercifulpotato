Fastest will always be if there is nothing except the content served in a single minimal request&#x2F;response. So, this means no JS (excepct issuing requests), no browser framework, pure content. Browser sends the simplest request and receives simplest content. User reads it or looks at it. Fast as hell. It can&#x27;t be faster than that because JPG can not be compressed further, gzipped  HTML can not be compressed further. With later HTTP implementations, the connection can already be open and re-used.<p>To explain this with an analogy. Bloatware comes when you decide that your true content is not enough to be appreciated as is, and needs to be beautified, made interactive, .... Just like make-up. Without make-up you only need to show your face. When you decide to use make-up to cover the true content (your true face), you need huge ammount of overhead - you need to buy the make-up, you need to learn how to apply the make-up, clean the make-up, re-apply the make-up. You need robust make-up. You need waterproof make-up. Then you need special cleaner because water will not be able to clean it. Then you start needing a make-up framework, to help you clean, apply and re-apply the make-up consistently and easily. So reinventing make-up frameworks will do nothing in alleviating overhead. Dropping the framework is the best way to go.<p>I hope this analogy makes things clear what I meant.')
