So a really nice house isn&#x27;t taxed more than a run down house. Fixing up the house, or knocking down a post war box and putting up a nice modern house, should not change your taxes.<p>Tax needs to vary with the maximum use of the land. A daily farm that is now surrounded by luxury apartments should pay taxes at the same rate per acre as those luxury apartments. This is where people start to flip out and get offended that they might be on the side of things that&#x27;s disadvantaged by it.<p>Most property tax systems in the US have features that allow some land to be taxed at much lower rates than other land based just on historical ownership. Most notorious is California&#x27;s Prop 13. The beneficial incentive system of the LVT is that it encouraging redeveloping now-valuable land. That means grandma can&#x27;t afford to live there anymore. But, that only happens if grandma owns land that has appreciated, so she&#x27;s probably okay overall.<p>I&#x27;m not really clear on whether LVT always goes with opposition to zoning or discretionary review, but I have seen some of that as well.')
