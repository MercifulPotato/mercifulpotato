I played the piano as a child and, as an adult, bought a well-used Clavinova as soon as I could afford it.<p>It wasn’t long before I had to admit I had a problem with getting my fingers between the black keys.<p>I have found some people suggesting altering playing style so that the fingers don’t play between pairs of black keys. I can’t find a way to do this that feels right at all.<p>Another suggestion was that some pianos have slightly more space between the black keys so larger fingers can fit in the gaps. I’m hoping there is an electric piano with this larger gap.')
