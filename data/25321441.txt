I do.  But if you’re State Farm* you have to either find a solution or get air cover for your decision by offloading it on your long term, trusted vendor.  (This is basically half of the thesis of the article).<p>The need to have a story for all these special cases is why Microsoft’s messaging is so confusing and their products frequently (but not always) unwieldy.
