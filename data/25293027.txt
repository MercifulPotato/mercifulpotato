AMD is famously unable to sell their high end cards to the Steam audience (at least in recent years) so the ability for a new and hyped Nvidia card to sell well in a month&#x27;s time (especially <i>these months&#x27;</i> time), is very much not surprising.<p>The only surprise for me here is that the stock of Geforce cards they got out is slightly higher than complainers on internet forums makes it seem. If they truly already had enough stock to cover 1&#x2F;5th the demand of the RTX 2080 then their stock situation is not great but not all that bad (these numbers are not that, but an indication).')
