In the absence of such studies, we have to rely on our priors, which are based on laboratory-proven effectiveness of masks in reducing the distance and the mass of virus particle spread from the wearer combined with what we know about germ theory.<p>&gt; if they don’t work in one direction....<p>You somehow ignored that your study does not show that it does not work in either direction. It was not designed to measure effectiveness in one direction, and it was not powered to measure effectiveness in the other direction.')
