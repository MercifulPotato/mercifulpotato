Item(by='morsch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607985235, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25421256, text='Leave at 10 pm, arrive at 8 am in Austria, connecting train to a village in the middle of the Alps, get some last minute supplies, start hiking at 10 am, arrive at the mountain hut at 5 pm. Not really feasible with air travel without spending a night in the valley where you don&#x27;t actually want to be as 2 or 3 pm is too late to start the hike. Admittedly that is a very specific example.<p>For city travel, I&#x27;ve had good experiences with hotels that let me check in early (before noon). I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> had a hotel that wouldn&#x27;t let me stash my luggage before check-in.')
