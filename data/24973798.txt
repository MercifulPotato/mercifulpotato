My key issue with Linux is the small selection of productivity apps: markdown editors, code editors, drawing packages, password managers like 1Password. Feature rich terminal apps like iTerm2. Well designed Git UI clients like Tower etc.<p>The rest is pretty good. Like the core UI, file manager, virtual desktop management, configuration etc works very well. Much nicer than the Windows mess.')
