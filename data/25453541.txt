Perhaps there are the kind of safeguards you mentioned in place, but they returned an incorrect view of the world because of a bug exposed by a network partition? The point is that with huge distributed systems the things take them down (at least once they&#x27;re mature) are typically the result of several failures that compound and interact in a way that wasn&#x27;t foreseen. IMO it&#x27;s more likely that the suggestions you made (blocks and&#x2F;or automation) are already in place but failed in some more complex way.<p>Source: worked at a FAANG for a decade, saw many big incidents. Almost all were the confluence of several smaller issues that, had they happened alone, wouldn&#x27;t have been newsworthy.')
