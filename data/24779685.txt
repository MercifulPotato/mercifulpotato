Universities want interesting people who will enrich the campus and their fellow students.<p>One easy way to demonstrate this is through extracurricular activity. If you founded a club, excelled in a sport, engaged in charity, won contests, etc., that&#x27;s a sign that you&#x27;re somebody who does things in a community and not just a test taker.<p>(There is room at even top schools for test takersâ€”but you&#x27;re going to need extremely uncommon scores to stand out that way.)')
