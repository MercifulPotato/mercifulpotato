Item(by='VikingCoder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611771992, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25930794, text='&gt; You&#x27;re proposing to make the market more efficient by giving the politicians more power to boss companies around and pick winners and losers.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your analysis of how Norway is handling their oil reserves.<p>Huge companies are not paying taxes.  That&#x27;s a problem.  You seem to think there&#x27;s no good solution.  I maybe agree.  But I&#x27;m willing to move on to a bad solution.  How about you?<p>&gt; As it turns out, government is already entitled to N% of a company&#x27;s profit, through corporate taxes.<p>If you think in practice that actually works, then you and I are on completely different pages.<p>&gt; politicians start filling board seats with political apparatchiks<p>I&#x27;m proposing the government receive non-voting shares, or is just restricted from voting.  I don&#x27;t want politicians on boards.<p>In fact, if you&#x27;re curious, I think that the major political parties should refuse to endorse anyone who doesn&#x27;t 100% divest themselves of all future income, instead promising to receive all of their future income through their government pension.  And elections should be publicly funded (each citizen gets $100 per year to allocate to whichever politician or party they want to, and that&#x27;s it).  Amend the Constitution to overturn Citizens United.  Re-instate the Fairness Doctrine.<p>&gt; everything shady about big business with everything shadowy about government<p>That you apparently believe they&#x27;re not already 100% glued together already shows again that you and I are on completely different pages.<p>&gt; More private equity, or just incorporating overseas.<p>Yes, we need a &quot;Uniform Commercial Code&quot; for taxation, around the world.  We all suffer that that doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>&gt; Apple can just take its cash hoarde and invest like crazy<p>That problem already exists in many ways.  We should never have allowed corporations to get as big as they are, and we should start to break them up.  Competition is good.')
