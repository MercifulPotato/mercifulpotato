Places where the most efficacious method of killing yourself (guns) are banned still maintain a ~3:1 male:female suicide death ratio.<p>A naive read on suicide attempt:success rates suggest that men are literally 10x as effective of women in achieving their aims. That&#x27;s the kind of ratio that suggests that there&#x27;s something big not being captured in the statistics, and in that case it&#x27;s important to focus on the more objective measure (a death by suicide) than something relatively subjective (a suicide attempt)')
