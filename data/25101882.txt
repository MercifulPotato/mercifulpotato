Data doesn&#x27;t magically exist and we are not stuck with what&#x27;s out there. A data sci job is to figure this stuff out. Tech has a weird culture of not doing their job. Kind of like the Zip Recruiter ads. &quot;Working as a hiring manager, hiring new people is the worst part of my job.&quot; Bitch, that IS your job. If you dont do that, what&#x27;s the point in keeping you around? Bee keepers collect honey. Yea it&#x27;s not exactly easy if you&#x27;re not careful, but they dont bitch about it because they knew what they signed up for.<p>Data sci&#x2F;analysis is about collecting and analyzing data, in not straightforward ways. Because if it were easy and didnt require any effort, why are they needed?')
