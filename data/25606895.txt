You do some screening and conversation before-hand.<p>It always seems strange to me that people won&#x27;t bat an eye at taking a day (or more) off work to come on-site for technical interviews, yet the idea of giving someone a 6-hour project do at home, at their leisure, is somehow a bridge too far.<p>In real-world hiring experience: I gave candidates a choice between on-site interviews and take-home projects for a while. Zero people chose on-site interviews when given the option, so I stopped offering it.<p>The bottom line is that interviewing requires time. If someone isn&#x27;t willing to lift a finger or allocate a few hours to an interview, how are we supposed to gauge their competency? The &quot;just trust me&quot; model doesn&#x27;t work at all.')
