Im thinking of crime against vulnerable people, especially that these drugs impair one’s senses. I’d like drug trading to be legal but heavily regulated and the enforcement taken seriously. \nIt would also do a very good thing to educate people about the risks of addiction, the simptoms of it and where to ask for help for it.')
