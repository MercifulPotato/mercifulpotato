I have been using the same installation since 2015 without problems. I&#x27;m currently one version behind the latest and I only upgrade when its absolutely necessary (e.g. a new GPU doesn&#x27;t have drivers). I do keep it updated too, due to the LTS nature of the distro. Its a very stable distro to use if you don&#x27;t need bleeding edge software from the repos. I use it for all my stuff, including gaming (mostly Steam) and development.<p>Just something you need to know tho, these little issues&#x2F;teaks you describe, I consider that they are part of the Linux experience and no distro will be completely free from them. Sometimes things will break and you&#x27;ll have to fix them, that&#x27;s not a problem, its just different from what people are used to on other Operating Systems (as things break differently). With time and experience using Linux their frequency will drop (you&#x27;ll know what parts of the system are more prone to break and how to avoid it) or will be less annoying (you&#x27;ll know how to fix stuff without losing hours searching on the net).<p>Good luck, I think its worth the time spent learning, as Linux gives you a great amount of power over the system and what you can do with it.')
