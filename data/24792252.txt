They don&#x27;t even acknowledge this as an issue to be addressed. It amazes me that their callousness still hasn&#x27;t backfired further.<p>I was on the receiving end of a similar issue with Google Pay Support for Android and it took <i>weeks</i> for Google to unblock in-app-purchase transactions, even via internal escalations from friends who work there. I guess I should count my blessings that it got cleared up at all.<p>The casual cruelty and opacity is just ridiculous. Surreal and bizarre that this extends even to their own employees. I really do hope this finally serves as a wakeup call for Google, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.')
