I rely on it for my daily tasks and have no problems finding local services there. In fact I have already paid thousands Euros in contracts to local businesses I&#x27;ve discovered via Runnaroo.<p>Occasionally I still have to scroll down to click &quot;Search on Google&quot;. I wish that link would be in the page top rather than bottom, especially for the picture search (where it is almost impossible to click as more results get shown as soon as you scroll down). It would also be cool if they would add a link to search with the local country-specific search engine (i.e. zoznam.sk, seznam.cz, yandex.ru etc.) for those located in respective countries.')
