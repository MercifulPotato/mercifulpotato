And the easiest way to do that is to insist correcting people when it really doesnâ€™t matter.&quot;<p>We primarily say &quot;Well, actually...&quot; to <i>each</i> other, and it&#x27;s pretty much unavoidable.  Physics is a diverse, complex, and <i>difficult</i> field.  People working in any given niche have to make a plethora of simplifications and assumptions about peripheral stuff <i>just to make it manageable</i>.  It&#x27;s a bit like how computer scientists usually don&#x27;t worry about the solid-state physics of a logic gate, how a CPU is designed, or how compilers are written when they&#x27;re writing a program.  Yes, it&#x27;s the foundation their work is built upon but, <i>most</i> of the time, they can safely ignore it.<p>When we say &quot;Well, actually...&quot;, some of us are letting our insecurities show by trying to one-up everyone else.  Some of us (probably a lot of us actually) are obsessive about certain things that fall within our bailiwick.  We have difficulty staying silent when somebody smooths over something wonderfully crinkly that we can&#x27;t resist talking about.<p>Mostly, we&#x27;re just pointing out things that we find genuinely interesting.  This serves a valuable purpose. Sometimes the simplifications and assumptions we make bite us in our posteriors.  When we talk to other physicists, mathematicians, etc. outside (or within) our own specialties, sometimes the &quot;Well, actually...&quot;&#x27;s lead to important realizations.<p>Most of the time, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  Well, actually, sometimes it really does matter!')
