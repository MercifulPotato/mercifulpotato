I did need a USB to serial adapter to connect to the serial and power pins - I got one that included an ESP-01 so I knew it should work [0]. I also needed some bits of wire and crocodile clips, but that&#x27;s all. The S20 is easier by all accounts, but I didn&#x27;t know that until I&#x27;d already got the S26&#x27;s. Having three to flash, I was motivated to figure out a solution that didn&#x27;t involve soldering.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;gp&#x2F;aw&#x2F;d&#x2F;B07KF119YB" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;gp&#x2F;aw&#x2F;d&#x2F;B07KF119YB</a>')
