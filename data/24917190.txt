And it was really more than that - at least on the surface, this was microservices + orchestration + autoscaling + serverless, as well as, via Internet Explorer, component-based UIs with graceful degradation. That paper seems like a window to an alternate reality in which everything that&#x27;s currently hot in tech has been done 20 years ago, except programming language-agnostic, using saner (i.e. binary) protocols, offline-first, and with advanced security built in from the start. I don&#x27;t know why this is not our &quot;real&quot; reality, but I finally understand why MS was in a dominant position back then, and why IE was a hot thing.<p>EDIT: for the curious, the mentioned whitepaper is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.softwaretoolbox.com&#x2F;dcom&#x2F;DCOM%20Technical%20Overview.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.softwaretoolbox.com&#x2F;dcom&#x2F;DCOM%20Technical%20Over...</a>.')
