Phones are already pretty prone to breakage and they&#x27;re easily fumbled as well.<p>I enjoy the materials in my phone and I&#x27;d love to use it without a case, but when my phone bumped against a saltshaker and the glass back panel cracked, I felt miffed to pay 160 euros to have that replaced when a 10 euro case would&#x27;ve prevented any damage.')
