There ought to be a thick, fat, slow layer between Fast Python and CPython.<p>You can write fast native you. You can write fast code by calling into native. The two rarely cross.<p>If we were clever, we could even have one front-end and multiple backends to go into fast Python, CPython, Cython, embedded micropython, etc. If we were double-plus-clever, we&#x27;d add GPGPU, multicore, and compute cluster to the mix.<p>We&#x27;d need someone with deep pockets and high risk tolerance to pull it off. It&#x27;s a big change. Big changes often fail. Still, when I look at the amount of Python at Google... Well, it&#x27;d sure be a pity if all of that became legacy code when we all jumped ship to Julia.')
