For some reason, this turned out to work better than the intended regimen (90 % vs 60 % in the other trial).<p>When they noticed the mistake, they pretended it had been their intention all along.<p>That&#x27;s <i>one</i> troubling error, <i>one</i> surprising result that doesn&#x27;t fit expectations and could, therefore, indicate other, potentially dangerous, problems in thinking or execution, and <i>one deliberate lie</i>.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d tend to agree with you and would probably take their vaccine if offered.<p>But that&#x27;s something entirely different than allowing it to be given to millions of people.
