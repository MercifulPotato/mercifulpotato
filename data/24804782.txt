It protects everybody who&#x27;s ever run a phpBB forum for their little community, or allowed comments on their blog, or set up a Mastodon instance they share with others. If you host content written by someone else, Section 230 is what allows you to moderate it, and what prevents you from being legally liable for it. Proposals requiring &quot;political neutrality&quot; even add new burdens to be compliant with; your friend on your Mastodon ranting about &quot;that politician&quot; probably isn&#x27;t &quot;neutral&quot; publishing.<p>Facebook et al. could be big enough to wrangle the regulatory burden of existing without these protections. But many proposed 230 &quot;reforms&quot; could scare off anyone smaller, creating a regulatory moat that keeps Facebook at the top in perpetuity.')
