No property damage, no arrests, no one hurt or arrested.<p>Contrast to the ones that did turn into riots with property damage, looting or people getting hurt, which were perpetrated by a small group of protesters that stuck around after they were told to disperse &#x2F; broke curfew, it seems similar to what happened in the capitol.<p>I think a big difference is that the rioting this summer affected insured private property and unfortunately did get people hurt in an effort to bring attention to systemic problems that parts of our country have. The event yesterday was a specific attack at a democratic process our country has in an effort to overturn an election that, at this point, has not had any evidence in court shown to cause doubts of it&#x27;s legitimacy.<p>Intent matters. If the riots from this summer tried to assault city halls or state capitols that were in session I have a very good feeling they would have been met with more prejudice.')
