They’re to bare the full cost of fires and deaths they cause. Unfortunate... they also regulate PG&amp;E with the CPUC and other local governments to make it so they can’t do anything but maintain cables (not improve them).<p>Not to mention they have an insanely high estimate to “underground” the cables and some crazy regulations basically pushing politicians and people in general simply to avoid putting cables underground - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cpuc.ca.gov&#x2F;General.aspx?id=4403" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cpuc.ca.gov&#x2F;General.aspx?id=4403</a><p>What does this lead to? Well either massive fires OR no power. PG&amp;E is just an easy scape goat for an incompetent government with too much regulation.')
