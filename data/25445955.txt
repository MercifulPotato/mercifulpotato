They really need to do something to reduce how many cars are on the road.<p>The thing is overall the metro is decent as is the bus service and they are always full yet there are still <i>so many</i> cars on the road I wonder where all the people come from tbh. There are also lots of alternative options available with Lime e-scooters and VÃ©lo&#x27;v bikes all over the place but still what feels like a million cars!<p>I used to live in London so a lot of traffic isn&#x27;t new to me but during peak times Lyon is a nightmare so I just avoid it as much as possible.')
