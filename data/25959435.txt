Item(by='CarelessExpert', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611939350, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959337, text='a) It&#x27;s not clear these were margin calls.  If they were, absolutely, they were in the right.  If these were cash accounts, this would be... bad.<p>b) The MM&#x27;s almost certainly didn&#x27;t force RH to shut down buys.  Current speculation is it was likely a combination of pressure from clearing houses and their own internal risk management.<p>Odds are they didn&#x27;t have enough capital on hand to deal with settlement given the level of volatility, and if they let more people buy, it would&#x27;ve pushed them over allowable levels.<p>This is supported by the fact that they&#x27;ve drawn down about 500mm from debt facilities and announced a 1B funding raise this morning (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;29&#x2F;technology&#x2F;robinhood-fundraising.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;29&#x2F;technology&#x2F;robinhood-fund...</a>), while throttling purchases of GME to no more than 5 shares per account and no more than 10 options contracts (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robinhood.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;support&#x2F;articles&#x2F;changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robinhood.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;support&#x2F;articles&#x2F;changes-due-to-...</a>).<p>And note, I say this is speculation because RH has been completely opaque about what happened here.  All they say is &quot;we have regulatory requirements&quot;, and we&#x27;re left filling the blanks.<p>Edit:  In fairness to RH, I should note that in their blog post on the topic (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.robinhood.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;1&#x2F;28&#x2F;an-update-on-market-volatility" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.robinhood.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;1&#x2F;28&#x2F;an-update-on-marke...</a>) from late yesterday they mention:<p>&quot;As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment.&quot;<p>This does obliquely point to the issues I mention above, and is enough to unpack what happened here <i>if</i> you have an understanding of the structural mechanics of stock trading.  Though it&#x27;d be nice if they were a lot more direct in their language, here.  If I was a layman investor this&#x27;d look like meaningless obfuscation.<p>But it&#x27;s certainly (somewhat) better than some of the early interviews and reporting...')
