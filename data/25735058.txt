All this meddling with politics, openly taking sides and censoring based on arbitrary rules like a cesar pointing thumb up and down - I&#x27;m pretty convinced (and I hope!) that especially for &quot;social media&quot; giants this will sooner or later backfire and will be one of reasons of their demise, improvement or at least significant reduction of influence.<p>All of this serves as reminder that not necessarily full and true picture could be visible when looking through social media lens, at the same time it&#x27;s sad because it increases doubts,distrust and divides society even more - certain and looking at votes count - pretty big one - part of society could feel that there is no common ground for discussion,they are not welcome, have to find or create their own platform (bubble).<p>I think that one of reasons why social media is that messy is the reach, it appears that it&#x27;s the curse and the blessing at same time - it makes local issues global ones, it allows to form a mob, mass where individual voices and meaningful discussion is impossible. This is visible even here on HN, sometimes there are massive threads with thousands of comments and while plenty are insightful and valuable I have feeling that some threshold is crossed and it no longer make sense to read and comment there.')
