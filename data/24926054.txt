Nvidia is not perfect but the 5700 series was awful from AMD (had to return mine). They need to at least match Nvidia.<p>Seriously. I have the RX 5700 XT and at least once a week the driver crashes with the same error on `dmesg`, with the only solution being to reboot the machine because the 5700 XT for some ungodly reason doesn&#x27;t support software reset. I love the card and I feel like I got what I paid for in terms of performance, but the driver instability is absurd.')
