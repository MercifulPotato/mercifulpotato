Bannon is trying to express frustration with the culture of the bureaucrats and his opponents are suffering a suspiciously strategic total failure of imagination.<p>But as a tip, &#x27;All you seem to be doing is repeating the statement and gesturing wildly at it going &quot;See? See????? Bad!&quot;&#x27; is horrifyingly bad technique when responding to someone who just said &#x27;you need to respond to what people actually say, rather than fantasies of what you&#x27;d like them to have said&#x27;. gp is literally correct now.
