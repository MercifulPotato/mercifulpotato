At first I thought it would be a good idea to buy as many as the platform would allow me, and get the guaranteed 4ish% percent return. But then I remembered the withdrawal fee and realized I&#x27;d still lose. And then realized that any other potential buyer would do the same.<p>I suppose if you already have money deposited there, and don&#x27;t know where else to park it, then buying these contracts would be the in-universe equivalent of &quot;parking it in treasuries.&quot; But I&#x27;d expect the pricing to become more accurate if that 5% transaction cost was eliminated.')
