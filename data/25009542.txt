Not all projects can restrict their choice of libraries to the ones that conform to some preferred style or language subset. Not everyone is self employed and working alone. You cannot know in advance what subset of the language any particular employer or client prefers.<p>So my advice to a young developer would be to learn all of C++ or steer clear of it altogether. Learning C++ well enough to not be dangerous is a major undertaking.')
