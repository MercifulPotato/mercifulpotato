This weekend I went out for my first walk, about an hour. Although I didn&#x27;t have any lung issues during the really-ill period, I definitly can&#x27;t walk as fast or long as I used to, one hour felt more like two or three. I really had to pace myself. I broke out into heavy sweating going up a small hill. When I got home, I laid down in bed and dozed the rest of the day. Pure exhaustion.<p>After I got &#x27;better&#x27; I thought it was comparable in severity to a bad flu. It&#x27;s becoming rapidly apparent that the real impact shows itself after sickbed. I&#x27;m 33. I feel like I&#x27;ve aged a few decades in the past month. I really hope this will pass.')
