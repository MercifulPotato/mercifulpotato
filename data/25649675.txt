Basically you are saying that, because of a quirk in human psychology, the only way to get people to donate, over the long term, a portion of their income, derived from them doing jobs they are much more productive at than building houses, to building houses, is to engage them by having them build a house themselves first.<p>The question then becomes, does this actually happen? Do people who volunteer to build homes end up becoming lifetime donors? Or are those two <i>separate</i> sets of people?')
