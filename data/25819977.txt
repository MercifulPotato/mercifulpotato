For any decent recipe book the recipes are made and tested many times in different variations. If you know that you are slower then just pad it out a bit. It shouldn’t be discouraging that professional &amp; motivated amateur chefs are faster than you—just like it should not be discouraging that professional basketball players can score more points than you.<p>I can understand why cooking can be slow and painful for people new to the activity. However, if you want to get fast at cooking, it is not that hard to get fast. Knife skills, multitasking, and planning will make everything go much faster. If your knife skills are not great (say, takes you longer than about a minute to dice an onion) or you are tired from a long day of work and aren’t in the mood to move fast, prep will take a lot longer.<p>Just observing people do prep I think it’s fairly plain to see that <i>tons</i> of people are just damn slow at it, either because they don’t enjoy going fast or because their skills aren’t up to par. And there are plenty of cooking shows where the contestants are under strict time limits but must still do all their prep within the time limit. Cutthroat Kitchen usually has a 30 minute limit, including prep, and including acts of sabotage that increase the difficulty.')
