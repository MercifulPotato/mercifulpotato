Where do this money go to? Fx, with these covid trials, 40000 people in pfizer trial, half a year cost would be $200-300 mln. People presumably weren&#x27;t paid for this. Of course there&#x27;s some work by doctors that needs to be paid for, but that can&#x27;t be this large amount. Also, does this all assume USA standards of pricing? Because in rest of the world healthcare is much cheaper.<p>I just think big pharma are fundamentally ok with huge cost for trials and are not motivated to decrease it&#x2F;make it more efficient, since they&#x27;re ok with their pie being larger. They will just shift costs to healthcare system and will be happy with larger profit.')
