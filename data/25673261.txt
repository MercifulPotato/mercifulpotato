My child is one of only two in the class that doesn&#x27;t use WhatsApp. All the others do. They have what they call a &quot;class group&quot;, even though not everyone is there.<p>When I try to tell parents how much Facebook learns about their kids (their friends, networks, and by merging data from different sources: habits, school, frequented locations, etc), they just roll their eyes. The response is &quot;well everybody is tracking us, who cares&quot;.<p>All this even though there is Signal, which works JUST FINE.')
