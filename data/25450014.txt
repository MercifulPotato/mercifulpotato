I just know that I used to need to spend 1-5 hours fixing an esoteric X.org problem (or similar) every few months on arch and that I don&#x27;t need to do this on ubuntu.<p>I stay on ubuntu because of its critical mass of users. If there&#x27;s a prebuilt package for something, it&#x27;s probably a .deb that&#x27;s compatible with ubuntu and debian. And PPAs are nice. I don&#x27;t like where they&#x27;re going with snap at all (I disabled snap and added flatpak support instead) and would probably switch if I thought another distro offered the same benefits.')
