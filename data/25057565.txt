That means, the program does not work &quot;as expected&quot; anymore for any directly or indirectly impacted enduser.<p>b) Logs that have no semantic impact when missing. No one will notice that they are missing, unless there is any other problem. These logs are solely meant to better understand the program operations.<p>Logs of type A should be tested like everything else. But logs of type B - I don&#x27;t think I would test them.<p>While it is not nice to have a failure in production and figuring out only at that time that the logging doesn&#x27;t work, I think that is even worse to break tests because of logging changes. Logging usually is so easy that it is an all- or nothing thing. I&#x27;m not saying that it does not have advantages to test for these kind of logs, but from my experience it is not worth the costs in 99% of the cases.')
