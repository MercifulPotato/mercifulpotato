I&#x27;m interested, but had some questions.<p>What&#x27;s a controller?  It sounds like some sort of combined battery pack&#x2F;bluetooth adapter...  How much extra desk space does it take?  Do you have photos of that?<p>Also re: battery life, I assume the reason why having a &quot;central&quot; half reduces battery life is the same as the first version.  Why can&#x27;t the computer keep track of modifiers&#x2F;layers?  If you have two keyboards plugged in, you can press shift on one and type on the other and you&#x27;ll get capital letters.<p>Is the group buy just for parts or is it for (partially) assembled keyboards? I&#x27;m not a DIY eletronics sort, both from an equipment and know-how perspective.')
