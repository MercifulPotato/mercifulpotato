I held this position for almost exactly a year.<p>I was consistently working 50+ hour weeks to just get done what needed doing. I was in hindsight not ready to be a manager, dealing with employees emotional arguments, dealing with underperforming employees, being pressured to do things I didn’t feel right about, I have never been so stressed in my life.<p>I went to the hospital thinking I was having a stroke because my head felt like it was being electrocuted. Turns out after a CT scan to be stress activated trigeminal neuralgia. Doctors advice was to try and decrease my stress levels. lol thanks.<p>Days later my yearly review rolled around. I had my first negative review in my 5 years, telling me that I wasn’t getting enough done. Icing on the cake.<p>My friend had been trying to recruit me to various gigs for years. I gave him a call that night. I had a new job later that same week. He and I are still there almost 10 years later, through several buyouts, and have had a great work life balance.<p>On top of everything, I set a start date 3 weeks out thinking after my two weeks notice was up, a week off would be good for my mental health. However, when I put in my two weeks notice, the owner of the company pulled up my contract and pointed out I’d agreed to a 3 week notice. I honored it and got no vacation.<p>My year as lead developer was one of the most miserable experiences of my life.')
