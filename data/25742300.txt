Does elderberry not work for you?<p>Some anecdata: I had the flu NUMEROUS times as a child&#x2F;young adult. I know what the flu feels like. A couple of years ago, I got the flu (no, I didn&#x27;t go to the doctor because I knew it was &#x27;just&#x27; the flu). I was feeling crummy one day, and the next I was curled up in bed, unable to move, fever with body aches, and slept most of that day. My wife told me about elderberry and gave me 4 or 5 spoonfuls of an elderberry tincture throughout the day. The next day, I was shoveling compost in the yard.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;15080016&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;15080016&#x2F;</a>')
