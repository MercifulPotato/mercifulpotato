It&#x27;s your job to explain what you think is true, and my job to explain what I think is true. Up to this point in this conversation I <i>explicitly</i> haven&#x27;t taken a stance about how generally intelligent our best AI are, because it&#x27;s pointless to argue that until the epistemics are valid. In fact I didn&#x27;t intend to argue past that point at all; I&#x27;m objecting to bad arguments, not the position per se.<p>&gt; The way we do AI can never achieve that<p>This is not meaningfully true. We have unsupervised image recognition, for example, and there&#x27;s plenty of work on all sort other unsupervised learning of all sorts of things.<p>The idea that insects ‘don&#x27;t have a reward function’ is not really valid; a reward function is just the function you&#x27;re optimizing on.')
