They all gave me deep scars through countless hours spent troubleshooting extension conflicts. All while seeing the unhelpful, literal bomb icon dozens of times in a row [0]. The windows BSOD was bad, but at least it never mocked you about the OS blowing up.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.versionmuseum.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;operating-systems&#x2F;classic-mac-os&#x2F;webp&#x2F;classic-mac-os%5E1984%5Esystem-1-system-error.webp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.versionmuseum.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;operating-systems&#x2F;class...</a><p>More details: In theory, extension troubleshooting should have been easy. 1) Boot with them off. If it boots, it&#x27;s the extensions. 2) Turn half off. If it boots, you know it&#x27;s the other half. 3) Repeat step #2 with the remaining extensions until you find the offending one.<p>Except it wasn&#x27;t always a single one. It could be a problem that only occurred when a combination were active. So you&#x27;d go through the much higher # of combinations of turning certain groups on together... the first 5 &amp; third 5 extensions, etc... Sometimes even that wouldn&#x27;t work, and you&#x27;d be stuck opening programs you knew used certain extensions to force them into activity. Eventually, if you were lucky, you&#x27;d find the one corrupt extension and reinstall it. But if all else failed, you backed up the data with all extensions disabled, blew out the OS with a clean install and reinstall all the programs &amp; restore the backup.')
