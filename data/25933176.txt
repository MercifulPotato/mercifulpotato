He explained that there were many unattractive terms in the agreement he received after the recording that made him ultimately decline the investment. My takeaway was that it doesn&#x27;t matter what happens on the show, the real offer is more complicated.<p>(I have never seen the show, so I don&#x27;t know how the offers are described. As an investor, I cannot imagine any offer that can be made verbally in the timespan of a television episode being meaningful.)')
