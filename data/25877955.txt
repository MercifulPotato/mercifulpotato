When I started with the internet, there were countless free&#x2F;non free email providers, and now nearly everything is gmail, outlook, yahoo, qq, and a few more big ones. We&#x27;re playing the same with messaging, whereas in reality what we&#x27;d need is federated providers, competing with their client software which can all write to each other - see SMS and email.<p>I was talking with my wife that somehow people are OK with a borrowed (rented?) identity for so many things. xyz@gmail.com, +00-00 on whatsapp, etc, and there as only a few wanting to be mail@this-is-my-home-on-the-internet.me, though this is a very different topic.')
