It just feels fun. I&#x27;d love to use it for backend or web development, but currently if I&#x27;m not targeting iOS or Mac, I don&#x27;t use Swift.<p>You raise a good question about whether the investment is worthwhile, but if you earn money from targeting Apple platforms then it&#x27;s a no-brainer.<p>When I was in the game industry, pretty much everyone I knew had the attitude that you had to be an expert in one language, C++, and it was career suicide to take a job working in a different language. But I&#x27;ve always felt that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with using multiple languages. Over the course of my career I&#x27;ve had to use many different languages, at this point it doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal pick up another one. When I had to do a Unity game, it seemed like it took less than a month to get ramped up on C#. Just this year I&#x27;ve jumped back and forth extensively between Swift, Typescript, Elm, Elixir, Python, and Golang, while also doing some small projects in Agda, Haskell, and a few others. Yes, I do get the syntax mixed up, particularly right after a transition, and sure, I&#x27;d probably be more hireable if I honed my skill in a single language, but really learning a language is not such a big investment once you get the hang of it.<p>The Apple frameworks are a different story -- that&#x27;s a bigger time investment, but it&#x27;s incremental. You don&#x27;t have to learn all of them to make an app, or to be productive in Swift.<p>[edit: fix typo]')
