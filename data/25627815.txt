We <i>still</i> need to fill as much as we can find, but we&#x27;re not <i>bound</i> by it.<p>The USA has it easy so to speak. Higher density countries, especially if they don&#x27;t want to fill literally their whole share of the sea with wind (which is also much more expensive than on land), if they have any sea to begin with... e.g. I heard that southeastern Germany has much less wind because they have a higher minimum distance between villages and wind turbines, but I don&#x27;t remember where I read that (whether they have less wind installed was a quicker check[2], omw to bed since it&#x27;s 5am here). They already can&#x27;t find space to put them and green energy is only at like 5% of their energy need (33% of the electricity[3], which is 15% of the energy need[4]). In fact, if you look at the graph of [3], renewables are so far mostly replacing nuclear production and fossil fuels are still going strong.<p>This just isn&#x27;t the time to phase fission out, yet, regardless of whether anyone is in favor of building it out.<p>I just think it&#x27;s silly to exclude many many megawatts of the safest kind of green energy. We&#x27;re barely scratching the surface of replacing power generation, let alone the other ~90% of fossil fuel usage (e.g. in the Netherlands, 112TWh is electricity versus 900TWh total fossil fuel usage per year[1]).<p>It&#x27;s like deciding not to bring more oxygen to the international space station, hoping you&#x27;ll be able to find enough room to grow plants instead. Just that the experiment we&#x27;re doing is on the scale of a planet and decades ahead with a notoriously hard to predict future. I say we should start building today and, as soon as we then can, turn off the fossil fuel based power plants, replace the lion&#x27;s share of combustion engine cars, etc. that contribute to killing or impairing millions of people every year[5], rather than (to use the previous comparison) worrying whether oxygen production by vegetation might be cheaper than lifting up some more oxygen. &quot;Will it keep us going strong&quot; is perhaps a better question than &quot;what&#x27;s the cheapest option that will make it look like we&#x27;re making good progress to the majority of our voters?&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_in_the_Netherlands" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_in_the_Netherlands</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1-stromvergleich.com&#x2F;wind-power-germany&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1-stromvergleich.com&#x2F;wind-power-germany&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_in_Germany#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Germany_Electricity_production_1991-2017_(EIA).png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_in_Germany#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_in_Germany" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_in_Germany</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_pollution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_pollution</a> &quot;air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, and is the world&#x27;s largest single environmental health risk&quot;')
