This sounds weird, but I spin up a &quot;bootstrap PKI&quot; Vault that is local-only, and produces, e.g.: &quot;consul.service.dc.consul&quot; certs with the issuer labeled as &quot;bootstrap PKI intermediate&quot; or some such.  I generate a full suite of these for everything in a space, get it all up and running, then there&#x27;s a 2nd layer of automation where self-certs are issued.<p>That said, I&#x27;m moving to a central distributed Vault that is mostly going to exist as a PKI so I&#x27;ll only really need to repeat this process once more!  Going to be using the raft internal engine for this one, and spread it physically across the globe so performance is going to be pretty terrible by design, but it should be quite resilient!')
