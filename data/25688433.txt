If you spent 5 minutes on TDW you&#x27;d see they hate most establishment Republicans. This isn&#x27;t new either, it started with Ron Paul and then the Tea Party movement.<p>I&#x27;d say overall the majority on TDW are leaning more towards libertarian than conservative. Certain things like freedom of speech, 2nd amendment rights, limited government and spending are shared ideals. Other things like pro-marijuana, pro-life, Christianity are depicted and respected but differ between supporters and less popular then the ideals everyone agrees on.')
