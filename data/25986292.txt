Still early days to be sure.  Keyboard input is not easy.  Some pages are strange in the Remote shell apps due to font sizes or image scaling etc.  But its you can see the potential and just having multiple huge floating screens you can control is enough to work through the rough edges.<p>Other than what you can do in browsers I recommend you check PC remote terminals like vSpatial or ImmersedVR which give you a VR office experience.<p>Good Luck  (and watch this space ;}')
