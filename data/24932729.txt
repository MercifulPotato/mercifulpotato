I do lean towards certain language in general, but more so I try to use each of the many options artistically, based on the circumstances. Who am I talking to? What are we talking about?<p>You&#x27;re correct that ultimately, I&#x27;m not responsible for how someone takes things that I say when I&#x27;m being sincere... but I&#x27;m still one of the people that lives with the outcome. Might as well try for positives.<p>Personally? I do get pretty solid results with these kinds of micro-adjustments. Or, rather, since these are toy examples, what these kinds of micro-adjustments do when they&#x27;re applied in larger situations. One mechanism for this is that I&#x27;m making an internal choice in how I&#x27;m thinking and framing something in my own mind, and that &quot;vibe&quot; impacts body language, conversational flow, attentiveness, how I understand and receive what they&#x27;re saying, etc.<p>I find that the starkest and simplest is whether I start sentences with &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, or neither. Flat statements have one impact. You don&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;ve had much experience with these variations and their impacts. Am I putting the conversational pivot in myself, in your self, or between&#x2F;outside of us? How do you find yourself responding to the various options?')
