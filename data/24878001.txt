The only thing you ever heard, by word of mouth, was that taxes were paid yearly in April. I had the impression that if the stupid government is teaching me, they have an obligation&#x2F;responsibility to see to it that I know something to basic as what I will have to do to avoid extreme penalization. After all, they went to the trouble of telling me to use condoms and not do drugs, shouldn&#x27;t they cover things that will cause terrible harm to my life if it only takes a few minutes to teach?<p>By time I dutifully did my taxes in April when I turned 17, the IRS said that I owed them over $10,000 in penalties for not paying &quot;quarterly taxes&quot; on time - something I&#x27;d never heard of in my life. This was a huge sum for a 17 year old to try to come up with in the late 1990s, and ultimately the only way out was to fraudulently use a college loan to pay them - otherwise they would stalk me day and night with threatening letters and sanctions<p>So that&#x27;s the story of why I&#x27;m not a patriot but an enemy of the state, they burned me before I even had the chance to reach adulthood.')
