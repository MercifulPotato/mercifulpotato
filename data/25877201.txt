This also one of those things where it&#x27;s fairly uncontroversial that the George Floyd (and all of the other comparable incidents) were unquestionably bad. But is that representative of all policing? Are police departments, as a concept, unethical? I&#x27;m not sure that this is clear cut or obvious.<p>And finally, all of these police departments are funded and run by republican forms of government (which BTW are predominately one-party democracies, just not the party that&#x27;s popular to hate), that can democratically change. It&#x27;s not a dictatorship. Any more than 21st century Italy is a &quot;dictatorship&quot; because it briefly had an authoritarian Prime Minister (Berlusconi).<p>&gt; In light of Snowden&#x27;s revelations, dealing with ICE to better surveil their own citizens is unethical.<p>Sure, and I think that it&#x27;s up to the public to elect leaders that change these policies, which is possible because the US is a Federal republic, not a dictatorship. Unfortunately, in light of right-wing extremism, domestic surveillance is increasingly developing bipartisan approval. Is it unethical to serve the needs of the people even if some subset of those people don&#x27;t approve of domestic surveillance? Unless it&#x27;s not about doing business with dictators, it&#x27;s about doing business with democracies that enact policies we don&#x27;t like, but that&#x27;s a different line of argument entirely, and one much less straightforwardly bad than &quot;selling guns to dictators&quot;.')
