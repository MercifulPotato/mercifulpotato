I&#x27;m ok with what&#x27;s necessary, but deeply resent the politically safe strategy of overreacting by default.<p>If you live in California, you may be interested to learn that elementary schools are open in states like Colorado, and these states universally have lower rates of infection than CA.  You may also be interested to know that a study published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (those quacks!), conducted jointly by Duke&#x2F;UNC, following 100,000 students and faculty in North Carolina public schools, conclusively determined that schools can be opened safely with basic PPE and adjustments in scheduling.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aappublications.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;covid-north-carolina-schools-study-010821" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aappublications.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;covid-north-...</a><p>From the study: \n&quot;During the nine-week study period, the 11 districts reported 773 community-acquired infections. Typically, people in North Carolina who are infected have infected slightly more than one other person, meaning there was the potential for 800 to 900 secondary infections within the schools. However, local public health officials found only 32 in-school transmissions, according to the study.<p>Of those 32 cases, six were in pre-kindergarten, 11 were in elementary schools, six were in middle schools, five were in high schools and four were in schools that included kindergarten through 12th grade. None of the cases involved a child infecting an adult.&quot;<p>My daughter and son are both enrolled and attending in-person school here in Colorado, and it&#x27;s gone smoothly.  I&#x27;m curious as to what dynamics exist in California school buildings that would be different than my kid&#x27;s school buildings, and can&#x27;t think of any.  Which makes me strongly suspect that California and certain other places have schools closed out of an overabundance of caution that doesn&#x27;t take into account the holistic costs of keeping them closed.')
