Why do you think people wanted to leave, and why do you think people wanted to stop them? Why do you think they had to literally shoot people to stop them leaving the country if it wasn&#x27;t a dictatorship and they were welcome on the other side?<p>Are you confused about the &#x27;Democratic&#x27; part of the name? North Korea also calls itself &#x27;Democratic&#x27; today.<p>Read some history:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Politics_of_East_Germany" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Politics_of_East_Germany</a><p>&gt; Elections were held but were effectively controlled by the SED and state hierarchy, as noted by Hans Modrow [communist premier of East Germany] and others.<p>The last premier of East Germany was literally convicted of electoral fraud after unification.<p>&gt; Modrow did not deny the charges, but argued that the trial was politically motivated and that the court lacked jurisdiction for crimes committed in East Germany<p>It was a dictatorship. Any reasonable historian or even person there at the time will tell you this. The literal Premier himself didn&#x27;t even deny it.')
