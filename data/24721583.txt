Item(by='soyiuz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602178654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720310, text='&gt; The dramatically reduced costs of infrastructure for constructing mounted tubes on pylons, with each section being a fungible, mass produced item, makes rail obsolete.<p>This makes no sense. The &quot;mounted tubes on pylons&quot; contain rails inside and therefore are MORE not less expensive than just &quot;rails mounted on pylons,&quot; which we already have. A more complex rail does not make simple rail obsolete. Nor does it beat it on fungibility, cost, or mass production. Where are you getting these &quot;dramatically reduced costs&quot;?')
