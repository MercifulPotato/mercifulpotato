It was a pretty involved installation but I finally got it going.  I set up a gitea cotnainer and was able to use it for a while.  But one day it stopped working and I had to spend a bunch of time diagnosing why mariadb wasn&#x27;t coming up.  I can&#x27;t recall exactly what i did (something with ib_logfile) but i finally got it going.<p>And a few days later when checking on it, I noticed it was using a bunch of cpu time.  Apparently it uses resources just sitting there idle, like 5% cpu.<p>In the end, I made a git container again.  I just used SSH access and one user: git<p><pre><code>  # pacman -S git\n  # useradd -m -G wheel -s &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;git-shell git\n  # systemctl enable sshd\n</code></pre>\nrepos are in ~&#x2F;git&#x2F;foo.git and ~&#x2F;git&#x2F;bar.git, ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;authorized_keys for the hosts I give automated access to, password for others.<p><pre><code>  $ git clone git@gitmachine:git&#x2F;foo.git\n</code></pre>\nI liked the idea of git+https.  And running gitea seemed like it would be like having my own git <i>infrastructure</i>!!  But in my experience, git is  easy with a minimal setup.')
