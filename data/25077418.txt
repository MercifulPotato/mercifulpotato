Can anyone recommend some kind of annotated version that&#x27;s more accessible to a modern reader?<p>These Anti-Federalist Papers seem a bit more accessible, but part of my interest is in understanding the motivation of the writing of the constitution, and it seems there is no better source for that than the Federalist Papers.')
