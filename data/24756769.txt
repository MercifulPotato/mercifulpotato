If you are driving much longer than that the cost of gas to pull it vs a mini-van is probably more than a hotel + restaurant meals. (depending on how expensive your tastes are). Maybe it works out if you have a luxury camper (read would splurge on the expensive hotel rooms), like to cook your own meals, don&#x27;t drive too far every day. There is a reason most campers don&#x27;t got very far from home: they need a lot of fuel.<p>Having had a RV (which I lived in all summer - I didn&#x27;t move it), and done real tent camping I object to calling any form of RV roughing it. I&#x27;ve been 10 hours be canoe from the nearest car before (it took us a full week - I&#x27;ve talked to some who did the same trip in a long day which is where the time estimate comes from), I know what roughing it means, and a RV isn&#x27;t it.')
