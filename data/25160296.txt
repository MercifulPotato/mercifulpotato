Item(by='Fnoord', descendants=None, kids=[25160449, 25163125], score=None, time=1605879475, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159365, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve grown up in a period when pop culture didn&#x27;t care much about cultural sensitivity.<p>I wonder when that was, cause pop culture has <i>always</i> cared about that in one way or another. I believe you are projecting.<p>&gt; The most relevant point of this article is not about historical accuracy, but on the contradiction of claiming cultural sensitivity by including gender and origin diversity while totally missing the point on deeper issues.<p>I can&#x27;t summarize this fantastic write-up, but either way, here goes...<p>The author goes to great lengths about how in said game the Scandinavian culture is only shown in a positive light (with the bad such as slavery and rites being avoided), whereas the Christian religion is deliberately put into a bad light. That is what the article is mainly about. Example: Christianity is shown as intolerant and hegemonic, Scandinavian the intolerance and hegemony is avoided at all costs. Slavery? Pillaging? Apparently non-existent; instead the Scandinavians colonized Saxon ground, and never took slaves, never raped women, never pillaged or set anything a-fire. Furthermore, Norse culture was very patriarchal, this game shows nothing of that either.<p>The gender&#x2F;origin issue is minor in comparison, both in coverage as well as in how relevant the author finds it. Gender a subset of the lack of showing the patriarchy in Scandinavian culture. Origin is a bit odd, as the trade route with North-Africa is more accessible than the one to Eastern Europe and Asia whereas the races shown do not reflect this. It is you who finds the gender&#x2F;origin issue &#x27;the most relevant&#x27;; not the author, nor did the author ever imply such.<p>A fantasy world can be based on real history as we know it (consider, for example, the Nordic theme in World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King, or the Norsca and Warriors of Chaos in Total War: Warhammer II). If it is then inaccurate, we&#x27;re OK with that, we see it as artistic freedom. This game tries to base itself directly on history. Big difference!<p>The author also literally claims the following:<p>&gt; [...] And to be clear, that is not empowering feminism so much as virtue viewed from a society (like the Romans) which blithely assumed that men were better; it is misogyny masquerading as empowerment. And of course the game indulges in this too, as noted above.<p>The author does not, at all, appear to agree with your take on the matter.<p>The author&#x27;s final chapter is titled: &quot;Conclusion: A Love Letter to Colonialism&quot; which again isn&#x27;t your take on the matter.<p>As a side note, what I find funny, is that in a certain music genre, Scandinavian culture is idolized as well: metal music. Certain metal bands, such as for example Amon Amarth, exercise this practice. Coincidentally, the music is also going against the Christian religious dominance. I believe the game is made with such &#x27;counter-culture&#x27; in mind; as the deeply religious Christians would not opt to play a Scandinavian religious person. I admit, pure speculation from my side.')
