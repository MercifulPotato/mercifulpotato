But I&#x27;m stuck on the ACA. It&#x27;s the example you provided. In reality, no normal person on my side of the aisle thinks that opposition to the ACA is racist, nor do I think you can find credible mainstream Democratic sources saying that. Clearly, there are people who believe everything is racist, but you set a higher bar for that, and I don&#x27;t think you can clear it.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth: I don&#x27;t want conservatives to give up on the idea of limited government; I think Republicans are right about some things, Democrats about others, and we need both perspectives.')
