Item(by='gibspaulding', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610543879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25761327, text='&gt; At one end of the scale, the work set on monday this week for my kids (elementary school age) was done in 50 minutes for one, and 30 minutes for the other.<p>&gt; On the other hand other parents are saying there is too much work to do.<p>High School CS teacher here.  I definitely relate to this.  Even when we were in person, I had students who could finish a project in 20 minutes, and others who would take two or three class periods.<p>Working remotely seems to exacerbate this difference.  The students finishing in 20 mins still finish in 20 minutes, but the ones who took days before are often the same students who never reach out for help, and in many occasions don&#x27;t even attend virtual meetings.<p>Now I definitely have room for improvement as far as keeping on students and parents to get things done, but it&#x27;s also just a lot harder to hold someone responsible for their work when you aren&#x27;t looking over their shoulder every day.')
