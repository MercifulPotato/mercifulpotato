Item(by='dimitrios1', descendants=None, kids=[25340030, 25337530], score=None, time=1607351519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25330849, text='&gt; &#x27;Big government&#x27; is just a catch name for many anti regulation lobbying entities to remove power from citizens and acumulats it on corporations.<p>This is completely reductionist, and completely uninformed.<p>Banks, as an easy counter example to your worldview, don&#x27;t have armies of third party regulators, corporate compliance staff, and auditors because they hate regulation. They <i>love</i> big government. It acts as a barrier to entry for them, because they already have the 10,000 person department ready to modify procedures and legal documents to comply with the next set of regulations while the little banks drown. Regulators frequently dine with top bank executives, but I can assure you they aren&#x27;t dining with the citizenry or your local regional bank.<p>Every amount of extra regulation just increases tyranny. It makes the American dream more untenable. I want people to succeed and not rely on giant mega corporations for their well being and wealth generation. You can rightly claim that I&#x27;m an anti-regulation lobbying entity in this regard, if you wish.')
