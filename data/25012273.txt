Customers want cheap printers, and HP has to make money somehow, so they make their money on ink. And to be fair, for people who just want to print a page from time to time, it is actually not a bad deal.<p>Want cheap ink, HP also sells ink tank printers which you refill from bottles, no DRM or any nasty tricks here, but the printer is $300+. They also sell laser printers, printer for businesses, etc... Each with economics adapted to its market.<p>HP have competitors of course, but they also fit into an economic model targeted at a market. They may be less aggressive than HP regarding ink, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily makes them better. Maybe the printer itself is more expensive, the print quality may be worse or is lacking some feature you need.<p>There is no printer monopoly, and if HP can get away with that, that&#x27;s because it fits some customer needs, otherwise they would have bought Canon, or Epson, or Brother, or anything else...<p>Personally, I kind of like Brother. They seem to be the company with the least nonsense among printer manufacturers.')
