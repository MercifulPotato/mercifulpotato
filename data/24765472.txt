(Just checked.)<p>Hatred was available to buy, even as it was not on steam. Steam is not like apple store - you can sideload windows apps. It does not even show warning like alternative to playstore would. And the bad reviews did not made it impossible to get. The controversy around it likely just added to sales.<p>Hatred shows only that some games don&#x27;t make it to the steam. Steam was always historically super selective in what they allow. Quite openly so. The steam community was historically even more selective making it hard for new genres to go in at first.<p>&gt; I dont understand how you came to the conclusion that I want institutional power over society, when the advant garde was exactly against that<p>I misread what you wrote.')
