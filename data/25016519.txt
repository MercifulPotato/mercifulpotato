Unfortunately Trump&#x27;s blend of populist rhetoric fueled by conspiracy theories, divisiveness, and victimization coupled with a vindictive&#x2F;authoritarian agenda has seeped out of the US borders and reverberated in european countries that are now struggling (again) with he rise of fascist parties.<p>Take for example Spain&#x27;s Vox party, which is quite literally a fascist apologist which copies Trump and recently even went as far as claiming that Spain&#x27;s current government is the worst in 80 years, subtly bundling Franco&#x27;s fascist regime in comparison and thus stating that it was a better alternative than the current democratic regime.<p>The free world has a problem with fascism in specific and authoritarian regimes in general, and Trump contributed to whitewash these political movements to the point that they might regain mainstream status throughout the world.')
