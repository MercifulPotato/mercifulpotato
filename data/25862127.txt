The a.i. being demonstrated to simply be better than chance would be a significant result, which is obviously not a spectacular standard for diagnoses.<p>The issue is that the meaning of “significant” is very often overrated. It means nothing more than “<i>We are highly confident that there is a stronger effect than zero.</i>”; — this does not mean this effect is particularly large, and most importantly, it does not mean the effect is universal.')
