I really felt like I &quot;knew&quot; people on forums. I recognized their names. Our inside jokes were ones <i>we</i> had created.<p>These days I never recognize a single username on any forum (HN and Reddit, mostly), even tiny sub-reddits. The culture there is created by the masses, so there are plenty of in-jokes only because tens of thousands of people repeat them every week.<p>Twitter is the closest I have to a site where I recognize a stranger&#x27;s voice and opinions.
