And prime numbers are surprisingly common.<p>So finding a variant of one offending digital file that&#x27;s also a prime is a rather straightforward process.<p>What fascinates me more is all the illegal bits people put into the bitcoin block chain; and how bitcoin people deal with that.<p>Especially since you can make random looking strings illegal after the fact:<p>I have an illegal file A.  I produce a random binary file R of the same size as A.  I publish (R xor A) and R in two different venues, both mathematically-perfectly random files on their own.  But together, they produce illegal file A.')
