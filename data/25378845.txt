They know something about me. I am at location A and I have a problem: I want to be at B. They then solve that problem smoothly with reasonable defaults. They know this is the <i>prime</i> problem I have and that I have some top few variants on this.<p>Speaking of the defaults, the auto-suggests these guys have are fucking ridiculous too.

It&#x27;s 11 PM in the evening on a Friday&#x2F;Saturday and it offers me a ride to my friend&#x27;s place. It&#x27;s midnight and I&#x27;m at that friend&#x27;s? They offer me a ride to my favourite club. I am one-click touching everywhere. These guys are <i>good</i>.<p>Superb user functionality.')
