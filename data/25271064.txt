Item(by='gnicholas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606862708, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25269958, text='I tried to test this and discovered that my Wyze Cam thinks there isn&#x27;t even an SD card installed (there is). In the cloud, it showed there was an event just before it was unplugged, but it won&#x27;t let me download the footage. I would be pretty upset if I discovered these issues when I was trying to get footage from a break-in or other important event.<p>EDIT: After a firmware update, it&#x27;s now recognizing the SD card, but just as parent said, there is no video of me walking up, standing in front of the camera, and unplugging it. It&#x27;s not missing 4 minutes, but definitely at least 20 seconds.<p>This means a thief could just walk up to any Wyze cam, yank the power cord, and be certain that he wouldn&#x27;t be caught on camera. Maybe there&#x27;s a way for Wyze to grab the data from their cloud if the police asked for it, but it seems impossible for an end-user. Really disappointing.')
