That is, with Hashlife you can trade memory for computational efficiency. That means that for a sufficiently difficult task like mining bitcoin, this computer could be simulated faster than any conventional computer could run at the expense of using more memory.<p>My question: does anybody know what the ratio of trade-off between time and space is for Hashlife? I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything from my searches.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hashlife" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hashlife</a>')
