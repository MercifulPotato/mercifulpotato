There&#x27;s some weirdness in this between 32 bit and 64 bit, based on how the calculation is done.  See [1].<p>I had a mysql instance once where I migrated from a 32 bit system to a 64 bit system, and one of the main tables&#x27; primary key was a float that was a high resolution timestamp.  Unfortunately, on inserting the old data into the new 64 bit system with a MySQL compiled for 64 bit, the values started having lots of collisions on the primary key, where two previously distinct high-resolution float values now rounded to the same float in 64 bit.  Counterintuitive, and a nightmare.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;31415712&#x2F;floating-point-differences-between-64-bit-and-32-bit-with-round" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;31415712&#x2F;floating-point-...</a>')
