One of the lessons learned from the Weimarer Republic is that a democracy has to defend itself, that&#x27;s the reason why modern days Germany has - by request and design from the US - laws to limit freedom of speech.<p>It is false because certain types of calls for violence and hate speech have the uncanny ability to mobilize people who would otherwise never think of being violent. There are psychological reasons why otherwise normal people can be drawn fairly easily to violence and de-humanizing their opponents. With a few well-designed suggestions at the right time you can easily cause lynchings like in the Reichskristallnacht.<p>Generally speaking, people in democratic societies far overestimate the force of their society&#x27;s civility and culture. It takes but a scratch on the surface of society, and a threshold is reached that leads to a reign of terror. A recent example is the war in former Yugoslavia. Seemingly harmless family fathers in an advanced society started to torture opponents to death by raping them with steel pipes until they died of inner bleeding. They were encouraged by politicians.<p>Things like that can occur in any country within just a few months of conflict and unhindered &quot;free speech.&quot; There are large groups in the US who dream of a violent revolution, openly advocate &quot;race wars&quot;, and so on. It&#x27;s very reasonable to take away their megaphones and social network speech amplifiers.')
