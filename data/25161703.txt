That&#x27;s one of the purposes of &quot;cloud credits&quot; that AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;etc give out to new companies and projects that they are very successful in that.<p>Even worse, organisations rarely do it even once they&#x27;re up and running and spending large sums - and even then I have never seen the impetus for cost control ever come from within the technology department.  It&#x27;s finance that reins in the spending later, and usually by sticking with the same cloud supplier but limiting activity - so now you need to get someone to sign off on your infrastructure before you provision any of it - which is largely the problem the cloud was supposed to solve.')
