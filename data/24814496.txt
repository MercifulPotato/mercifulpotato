And keep in mind that pretty much everywhere a New Zealander can go is more infected than NZ.<p>We also have a lot less international clout than the US and less money. This matters.<p>As a country we have less people per square km than the US, perhaps by half. But the US is not vastly more populated the New Zealand when examined as a whole, and USA is nowhere near the top when you order countries by population density.<p>Our population is about 1&#x2F;66th (5 million versus 330 million) that of the US, but our death toll is 1&#x2F;8,900th (25 versus 224,000). I don’t believe the reasons you list explain this. In protecting its citizens New Zealand has done better than the average and the US has done worse.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traveller.com.au&#x2F;the-worlds-biggest-travellers--which-nationality-takes-the-most-trips-11979j" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traveller.com.au&#x2F;the-worlds-biggest-travellers--...</a>')
