Item(by='kls', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603680325, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24890170, text='Forgive me if I am wrong, but I do not suspect that you are well read on the subject matter:<p>On the matter of genocide, the texts are very clear that we all have to experience death, no one escapes it. In the text god does not see death as a tragedy. It is the expected outcome, this is exactly why I referenced Psalm 137:9 because most people do not know how to explain what is going on, because they have not read the full text much less many times to understand the context. Again I ask why would someone be happy to bash children against rocks. Did god command them to do it, did he condemn them for it? Jeremiah 32:35 get&#x27;s to the heart of it. If there is a god and he is eternal and he views our lives as eternal then the death of this life is no more than telling a child to not touch a hot stove but it is clear throughout the text, that he exalts the innocent and the downtrodden. If one makes a habit of abusing these classes he tends to anger, there is no inconsistency here. In the old testament before the time of kings he was in direct commandment of his elect. He exacted judgment on several nations specifically due to the fact that they where sacrificing their children to Baal. While you may not agree with it, this is extremely consistent with the fact that from the outset humanity is to be judged by death.<p>On rape, I will forgo rehashing it, I would assume that wikipedia is a fairly well vetted war zone. It is fairly well accepted that the Torah condemns rape. Now we can certainly argue over our present day view against the remedies for said act as laid out in the Torah but to say that the book encourages it is not factually true.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rape_in_the_Hebrew_Bible" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rape_in_the_Hebrew_Bible</a><p>As for slavery Matthew 19:1-9 and Mark 10:2-9 describe this very succinctly, and that is man is flawed, man enslaves man or more aptly put man&#x27;s inhumanity to man. It is clearly laid out that slavery was not by design, but rather slavery is man&#x27;s desire to be their own gods and subjugate other men. God recognizes that we are fallen but does not condone the practices that we do that are inhumane. The text do not advocate for slavery yet over and over repeat the lesson of exalting the meek. The Jews were slaves exalted out of Egypt. Joseph was of wealth and favor and sold into slavery by his brother. He was a loyal and faithful servant thru his suffering and was in the end redeemed. The text never says slavery = good. It says if you find yourself in that situation, do not lament your situation, be kind, be humble, be of service to people. If we contrast it with Jainism they teach a very similar concept of suffering is an illusion. None of this says slavery is good, rather the lesson to be learned is suffering is part of this life, no matter what you are presented with, try to make the best of it.<p><i>Your powers of rationalization are substantial</i><p>I find that most people have not taken the time to read all of the major religions texts a least a few times to understand them. So it is hard to argue rationalization when one does not fully comprehend the text. I know because I was one of those people that used to mock the religious but it came from a position of ignorance as I had only cursory reading and cherry picked evidence. When in fact most of the religious text (Pick your religion) are fairly logically consistent, especially when it comes to moral codes. That does not make them true, but it does mean that one does not have to rationalization them. They very well may be fairy tales, but where certainly written by smart men who where logically consistent. The problem is that the texts span thousands of years. Five minutes of reading the cliff notes will not suffice if one wants to truly understand the texts and not listen to what the Baptist or Dawkins have to say is in them, because the reality is they both are flat out wrong.<p>The funny part is I see the same thinking on both sides and it has been a real eye opener as to why so many sect of the Abrahamic religions can exist. Almost none that &quot;believe&quot; actually read the thing end to end, so they just take what their flavor tells them is the truth as the truth. On the other end, you get the majority of detractors who just parrot Dawkins and have never read the works to decide for themselves if it tells a rational and logical story, or they hear some text that seems really f&#x27;ed up and just go yep fruitcakes, or like me they were raised in it, never read it, were told what the text said at a young age, had no interest in reading it, and checked out before that interest could develop, due to other people saying what was in the text.<p><i>Jesus encouraged people to devoid themselves of personal goods and family and follow him. Well at least in the Bible fables.</i><p>Jesus said this world is temporary and the pursuits of it are trivial. None of that is untrue, it all goes away when you die. Even, if he was a crazy dude that thought he was the son of god, he is still right. None of it matters in the end. He advocated for a full and abundant life and said he was the example to follow to achieve that. It&#x27;s not that crazy of a thought that the guy placed experiences and happiness about material pursuits, and saw that as the example of how to achieve happiness, as from all I have seen material pursuits are a trapping and we become slaves to our possessions. Meanwhile those that have not succumb to this material world seem to be much happier:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.survivalinternational.org&#x2F;not-primitive#:~:text=Studies%20have%20shown%20that%20tribal,just%20as%20we%20all%20do" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.survivalinternational.org&#x2F;not-primitive#:~:text=...</a>.')
