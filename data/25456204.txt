Being called by a label that you don’t recognize is alienating.<p>Okay, so the word is an academic construct. But it comes from a good place: an effort to be more inclusive. I will understand if everyday folks don&#x27;t subscribe to the latest code and vocabulary of a younger progressive society, and I understand any resistance to new vocabulary, but that is no reason to stop progress. You can&#x27;t deny that embedded in our language are the biases of our history, and it&#x27;s possible that a natural evolution of language may not get us out of this, so why not let a prescriptivist push get us out, even if it comes from academia?<p>Separately, curious to hear your thoughts on changes imposed by Académie Française in recent years toward a similar direction of being more inclusive.')
