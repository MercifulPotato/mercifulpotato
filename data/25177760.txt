I stopped doing so completely and moved to Fastmail. Greylisting delays, while unnoticeable with the contacts I frequently communicate with, were very annoying with new and one-off contacts, especially all sorts of confirmation emails from bank etc, which would often expire before greylisting allowed them in. Sometimes, emails were sent through cloud mailing systems, so coming from a different host each time they’d hit greylisting again and again and again.')
