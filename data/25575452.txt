There is a social stigma with appearing rich to your friends so you spend poorly...social media has made this so much worse in the last decade.<p>This problem extends to many different aspects of life...from taking out student loans to pay for a useless degree to letting people buy shitty food on food stamps.  People could be doing a lot better for themselves, but it&#x27;s rarely seen as a function of personal responsibility to do so (it&#x27;s always society that has to change to help them).')
