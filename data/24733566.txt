I remember those sites that would say &quot;please click on the ads and support us!&quot;<p>There was also that one in the early 2000s that claimed to donate a cup of rice for every ad clicked, and maybe another one that planted seeds or something. I think I clicked on those a bunch for a while. Doubt they ever did any good, and I should probably have just donated the $2 I probably &quot;earned&quot; for those charities with my clicks.')
