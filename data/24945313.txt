Say all your competitors are 1st world countries reliant on technology. You already censor the internet, if you could &#x27;survive and thrive&#x27; without satellite&#x2F;space tech, while other countries couldn&#x27;t (or would have a hard time), wouldn&#x27;t you be the winner if you could simply knock out space satellites by creating a Kessler effect? You move the countries tech back space-wise and communications wise, but you make it easier to win wars&#x2F;battles on land potentially and expand your territory, or at the least cripple adversaries like the U.S. or Russia.')
