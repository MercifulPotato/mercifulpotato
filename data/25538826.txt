I had the Monogram F-19 model based on the Loral mockup, along with an SR-71 model. I didn&#x27;t know a whole lot about airplanes at the time so I didn&#x27;t realize one of them was fake. It was very plausible, when it&#x27;s sitting next to an SR-71. I never thought twice about it being a real thing.')
