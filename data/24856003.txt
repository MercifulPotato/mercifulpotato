But I&#x27;d like to say that factors like tax rate progression (higher tax if you earn more), marital state, children and location (where you live in Switzerland) have a <i>huge</i> impact on the overall tax burden. So comparing 2 cities with very specific input variables will lead to very wrong conclusions when applying the results to make a statement about differences between two countries.<p>Side note: Including the significant deductions for payments into your retirement fund seems problematic to me, as you will get that money back at some point. And then there are more factors that have a big impact, like church and wealth tax.')
