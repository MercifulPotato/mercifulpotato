Signed integer has been undefined behavior since 1989. If you want wrapping arithmetic, using a library or langauge with those primitives built in.<p>If you want to use GCC for example,<p>-fwrapv\nThis option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around using twos-complement representation. This flag enables some optimizations and disables others. The options -ftrapv and -fwrapv override each other, so using -ftrapv -fwrapv on the command-line results in -fwrapv being effective. Note that only active options override, so using -ftrapv -fwrapv -fno-wrapv on the command-line results in -ftrapv being effective.')
