The stock was always around $20 and whenever it went up, Bezos usually said something that investors didn&#x27;t like and drove down the stock price (free shipping, search inside the book, etc).<p>Then there was the Segway deal where I amused myself by checking the orders database to see how many they sold (because the numbers were so small)<p>If you told me back then that the stock was going to $3000 some day, I would have stuck around for longer.')
