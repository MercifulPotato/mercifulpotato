Item(by='bonestamp2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601826024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24678415, text='I&#x27;ve been working remotely for 13 years now. I do have a desk at the office, although I rarely go in. The only thing I miss is seeing some of the great people every day. Prior to the pandemic, many of us still talked remotely every day. But, that rarely happens now. More on that in a moment.<p>The worst thing about WFH during a pandemic is that one of the major things that kept me sane for the past 13 years was being able to go work at a local coffee shop or co-working space when I needed to get out of the house -- but none of those places have tables right now so that&#x27;s off the table (sorry). On a side note, my kids and wife are around the house all day now, which should be from a social standpoint,  and it is to a point, but it&#x27;s terrible for concentration and it&#x27;s a little too much time together when everyone tries to maintain their pre-pandemic expectations (hard for kids not to).<p>I&#x27;m not complaining though, my point is simply that WFH isn&#x27;t normally this bad and cannot be judged fairly during a pandemic. I used to start working when I woke up very early in the morning and stop working around 330pm. Now, between helping my kids with their School from home work, and other family related interruptions, the workday never ends.<p>Many of my coworkers are in the same boat. Those who don&#x27;t have kids are still anxious because their wonderful life is mostly shutdown too. Everyone is more stressed, more anxious, more irritable, and these feelings are the opposite of what WFH normally feels like.')
