Item(by='bachmeier', descendants=None, kids=[25393865, 25391164], score=None, time=1607715763, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25389583, text='&gt; I’d like to sit down all university professors who teach compiler courses and teach them a course on what’s relevant.<p>I don&#x27;t teach compiler courses, but I&#x27;m an academic, and I do keep in touch with industry people to find out what&#x27;s important for my data analysis course. A couple of big problems with your proposal:<p>1. Time variation in &quot;what industry wants&quot;. This year one thing&#x27;s hot, the next year it&#x27;s something else. A bare minimum requirement for any course is that a student taking it in their second year should learn something that&#x27;s still relevant three years later when they&#x27;re in the first year of their job.<p>2. Cross sectional variation. There&#x27;s no such thing as &quot;what industry wants&quot;. Every place wants something different, with only a small subset common to 80% of employers.')
