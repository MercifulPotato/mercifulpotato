Trade imbalances with the rest of the world could be solved very quickly by making it clear the the dollar is going down in flames and that policies will be put in place to make that happen:<p>1. massive federal budget deficit spending<p>2. purchase of all the debt by the Federal Reserve (yield curve control)<p>Holders of bonds would be absolutely wrecked. That&#x27;s a lot of institutions and wealthy individuals.<p>The only question is whether the political will to do this can be mustered. So far it hasn&#x27;t.')
