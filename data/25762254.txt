Furthermore, its author outlined how to work around the problems with the app by using Macports instead.<p><i>What about the problems? Well, it&#x27;s free. They owe me nothing. But, you should still be aware what you are getting into when you choose to [use the app]. That&#x27;s why I wrote this post: to serve as a warning to others.
