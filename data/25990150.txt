Item(by='ParadigmComplex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612197173, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25988764, text='Bedrock does support exactly this workflow.  I do something along these lines, with the nuanced difference that I have a period of overlap where I&#x27;m using both the old and new strata around at once.<p>When a new major release of a non-rolling distro (e.g. Debian) is out, I make a new stratum for the corresponding release.  I slowly migrate things over, a few packages at a time.  If anything doesn&#x27;t just-work with the new release, I can easily revert to getting the given functionality from the old one until I&#x27;ve made the necessary adjustments.  Once I have everything working confidently with the new release, I can remove the old one.<p>Bedrock offers a configuration file that declares which packages should come from which stratum [0].  A section of it might look something like this:<p><pre><code>    # e-mail\n    arch:pacman isync # mbsync\n    buster:apt  msmtp\n    buster:apt  mutt\n    buster:apt  urlview\n</code></pre>\nWhen Debian 11 Bullseye is released, I can `s&#x2F;buster&#x2F;bullseye&#x2F;`:<p><pre><code>    # e-mail\n    arch:pacman isync # mbsync\n    bullseye:apt  msmtp\n    bullseye:apt  mutt\n    bullseye:apt  urlview\n</code></pre>\nthen try out my e-mail setup.  If it works, I&#x27;m good; if not, I can revert.  Once I have it working, I can move on to the next stanza in the described configuration file.<p>That having been said, I don&#x27;t think this compares favorably to NixOS&#x27;s much stronger rollback system here.  It&#x27;s a nice bonus for people who otherwise are interested in Bedrock.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;0.7&#x2F;commands.html#pmm-world-file" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;0.7&#x2F;commands.html#pmm-world-file</a>')
