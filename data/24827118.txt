Remember the days when one person did their section in a totally different style from the rest of the document and you only discovered it at 3 am the morning it was due because they waited until the last minute to email it to you and then at 5 am when you had finished reformatting it you realize that all his references to another person&#x27;s section are incorrect because he wasn&#x27;t at the meeting where that person said they reorganized their part, so you fix that until 7 am and then you go to add in the bibliography but the guy who had that last sent an old version in his email so you have to call him and get him to send you the real version, and the next thing you know it&#x27;s 9 am and you need to give a presentation on this 400 page document after getting no sleep and not even having time to grab a cup of coffee.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t understand why anyone wouldn&#x27;t take advantage of concurrent editing.')
