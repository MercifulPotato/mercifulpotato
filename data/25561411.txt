Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609178611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25560328, text='&gt;There&#x27;s a fundamental unfairness in putting in work to make your local community great, making it so good that rich people want to live there,<p>Actually that is a the result of an incredibly skewed tax policy. Prop 13 means that the government cannot derive any significant tax income from residential property. It is forced to allow commercial property because it brings in tax money. This means you will always have more commercial property than residential property. Land owners want this because it raises their property values. The government wants this because it&#x27;s the only way to fund itself.<p>When you look at the reality of what you are doing you are actually incredibly selfish. You are creating jobs and moving them away from rural places but at the same time you are not building enough housing so that people can live near those jobs. You do this because you want the value of your property to go up. Then once those people are coming because you moved all the jobs to your city you start complaining because they want to work there.<p>There is this misconception that it&#x27;s &quot;rich people&quot; who want to live there when the reality is that those people only became rich after they arrived in your city. It&#x27;s you who created them.<p>&gt;, and then being told that the community no longer has room for you because the rent is too high.<p>Well, that&#x27;s exactly what you wanted. You wanted more jobs meaning more people but you did not want more housing which means someone has to go. If you call this unfair then you have no one to blame other yourself.')
