He used the device for a few days and shared his review as a counterpoint explicitly intended to balance against the pro-M1 hype. I thought it was a pretty nice assessment because Morehead focused on product usability instead of raw benchmarks, and I used his review as part of the process of informing my recent decision to buy an Intel MBP13 rather than an M1 model.<p>It seems obvious that Morehead&#x27;s opinion seven years ago about 64bit being unnecessary in mobile was incorrect, mainly because today&#x27;s mainstream phones ship with more RAM than 32bit would support, but that doesn&#x27;t mean every word Morehead types is now ritually unclean. He was wrong about something; it hurts his credibility but doesn&#x27;t banish him from the conversation.<p>Besides, unless we think Morehead doctored his screenshots, it&#x27;s pretty hard to argue that his review is nonfactual in its entirety.<p>More specifically to your point, I don&#x27;t see why there has to be a separation between hardware quality and software experience when the user (A) can&#x27;t buy the hardware without paying for the OS too, and (B) can&#x27;t use the hardware without using the OS too.')
