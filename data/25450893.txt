Turn them off if you want to optimize for size. Not every site has to be a static wall of text.<p>And why is 512KB acceptable but 4MB a problem? Yes the web is a bloated mess, but there&#x27;s no point drawing random lines on meaningless metrics. Just focus on providing a good user experience. A few bytes of bad JavaScript can mess up your site&#x27;s performance, while several well-optimized MBs can make it accessible and useful.')
