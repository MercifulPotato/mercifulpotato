Item(by='heimatau', descendants=None, kids=[24725560], score=None, time=1602202437, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24724149, text='&gt; My company is becoming increasingly political and it&#x27;s terrible.<p>IMHO, this is not the problem. The problem are the managers of the work. One doesn&#x27;t need to micromanage to stop this from happening. Nor does one need to limit free speech to prevent this.<p>Companies aren&#x27;t working enough, that&#x27;s the problem and managers aren&#x27;t keeping people focused on the actual challenge at hand.<p>P.S. I feel this is a white-collar problem. These soft skills are paramount but also come from leadership. Restricting speech doesn&#x27;t really deal with the people that the decision affects. Instead, one needs to become a better manager&#x2F;leader to get &#x27;buy-in&#x27; from the workers and then work!')
