Undirected graphical models are very closely related too (all directed models can be represented as undirected models, but not all undirected models can represent directed models), but they’re usually not referred to as BNs.<p>They’re used all over the place. One school of causal inference is heavily steeped in BNs&#x2F;DAGs. This shouldn’t be surprising because the creator of BNs, Judea Pearl, is heavily involved in causal inference now.')
