Item(by='woodruffw', descendants=None, kids=[25402704], score=None, time=1607814153, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25402507, text='&gt; History, literature, philosophy, and anthropology are all good examples of valuable humanities where there is some grounding in logic and facts.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but this is a profound misapprehension of the humanities: one of the first things you <i>do</i> in the study of history is learn that history is a human project, subject to human flaws. We don&#x27;t take Thucydides and Herodotus at their words; we <i>expect</i> the &quot;facts&quot; of history to be distorted.<p>Philosophy predates what you think of as &quot;logic,&quot; and does <i>not</i> use the phrase to refer solely to systems that map roughly to the constrained proof structures that programmers are taught. More profoundly, many philosophers will outright <i>reject</i> the idea that logic is some kind of a priori substrate: not because they think it&#x27;s <i>wrong</i> or <i>not</i>, but because they think that it&#x27;s the <i>responsibility</i> of philosophy to consider what would <i>have to be</i> for it to be otherwise.<p>I know that it&#x27;s difficult, but <i>please</i> consider whether your own positions have become dogmatic. You don&#x27;t have to agree with prevailing views in gender studies (I don&#x27;t even know what they are!); you merely have to ask yourself whether you&#x27;re qualified to dismiss it as &quot;an ideology with very little basis in reality.&quot;')
