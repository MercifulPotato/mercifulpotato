How does that work without trusting (presumably off-chain) software&#x2F;firmware to honor the change as to who should be able to open the lock? The smart contract might be iron-clad in showing who should have access, but at some point, that has to be <i>interpreted</i> and <i>executed</i> by a real-world entity, human or machine.<p>In other words, standard contracts work just fine (without any lawyers involved) when everything goes to plan. It&#x27;s the failure cases that matter, and it&#x27;s not hard to imagine a compromised lock (or an entire company&#x27;s locks if they&#x27;re connected to the internet for access to the blockchain) that no longer respect the smart contract. So you&#x27;re back to calling your lawyer to help sort out the mess.')
