Rysolv holds the funds and then distributes when the issue is resolved.<p>Right now, if an issue isn&#x27;t fixed after 6 months, the bounty can be refunded to the user. But I&#x27;m still exploring better ways for this to work out.<p>Since other sites have run into issues where they refund money to a user&#x27;s account, and then it sits in limbo forever because the user forgot about it.<p>I&#x27;ve contemplated instead of refunding the bounty, having the funds move into a repo account that get&#x27;s distributed among other issues for that repo.<p>i.e. and issue for OBS with $100 was closed and not solved. So all the other OBS bounties will have an extra $100 &#x2F; n added to them')
