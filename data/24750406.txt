Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602463266, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24748954, text='&gt; The Computer History Museum in Mountain View pretty clearly falls into three categories: government projects, genuinely innovative ideas from the private sector that failed, and the people who ripped off those ideas and made a killing. There is very little overlap between the last two categories.<p>This is ignoring two very important things.<p>The first is the number of government-funded projects that burned a mountain of cash and led to nothing. Unfortunately this is the rule rather than the exception in modern times because modern government has been captured by interest groups that divert money from where it&#x27;s supposed to be going to themselves, which makes everything cost ten times more than it did when the government was funding the Apollo program and ARPANET. So you can&#x27;t just say &quot;government fund more stuff&quot; without fixing that first.<p>And the second is that private companies inventing stuff only to see somebody else successfully commercialize it is still causing it to be invented. And the overlap between invention and commercial success <i>can</i> be very little and still cause people to do it, because the reward when it happens is very large.')
