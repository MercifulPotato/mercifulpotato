Item(by='idrios', descendants=None, kids=[25000292], score=None, time=1604595165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998458, text='Sure you get more practice but what you&#x27;re getting practice with is online dating, not dating in general.<p>If you&#x27;re a man who&#x27;s not in top 10% of most desirable, it&#x27;s a barren wasteland. Your best hope becomes to attempt to match with basically anyone, and even when you do match most won&#x27;t respond. So maybe you tried to be witty the first several times and got no response or possibly unmatched. A lot of men will lose their wit after this and just start sending &quot;Hey&quot; in hopes of getting some kind of response.<p>Meanwhile if you&#x27;re a woman, nearly anyone who you click &#x27;like&#x27; will be a match (except for the few you really want). The men you&#x27;ll match with may not be charming because they&#x27;ve become tired or desperate or jaded, some may be outright rude, sexist, or cruel, and maybe the guy you want isn&#x27;t responding at all -- because he&#x27;s in that 10% of guys that all of the women are trying to match with and he&#x27;s ignoring you.<p>The upside of it being impersonal so you have more freedom to screw up without much effort or commitment is also it&#x27;s downside, where the people you match with don&#x27;t put much effort or commitment in for you either.')
