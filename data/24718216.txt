Item(by='cyphar', descendants=None, kids=[24718405, 24718334], score=None, time=1602157744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718112, text='I&#x27;m not a metalworker <i>at all</i> (I just spent a bunch of time last year researching it while diving down a rabbit hole of forging YouTube videos). However, I did stumble upon a longer explanation of this.<p>Folding steel is only required to remove impurities, so in theory high-quality steel doesn&#x27;t require much folding (if any). However in Japan due to the volcanic nature of the land, the iron deposits are full of impurities which lead to the need for folding. After you&#x27;ve done enough folding you end up with a billet which is basically the same quality as western steel. In other words, there&#x27;s nothing intrinsically better about the steel in a finished Japanese sword (if anything the starting materials are worse).<p>But again, I&#x27;m only speaking a someone who read about this and other bits of metalworking last year in a spurt of interest in the subject. Wikipedia claims otherwise:<p>&gt; The folding removes impurities and helps even out the carbon content, while the alternating layers combine hardness with ductility to greatly enhance the toughness.<p>But in my mind this does raise the question &quot;why don&#x27;t all modern swordsmiths all use this technique if its objectively superior?&quot;')
