This used to be plainly displayed on their website, but I&#x27;m having troubles finding it now, and perhaps that narrative has been challenged internally as certain chapters of the ACLU (Nevada comes to mind) have begun recognizing it as an individual right.<p>Moreover, arms rights challenges that <i>could</i> spur ACLU action haven&#x27;t ever really come to fruition, such as a ban on arms sales to individuals on the no-fly list for example.')
