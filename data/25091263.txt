That might blow up your speakers, headphones, or even worse, your ears.<p>I experienced one glitch like that while mixing with headphones, it&#x27;s hard to describe how loud it was, a bang in my ears that made me fall and left me shackling for a few minutes. If you have ever be surprised by headphones at max volume, imagine it&#x27;s even (way much) louder (because music at max volume is not a full 0db white noise). To this day I now avoid playing with plugins with the headphones and only put them for the final mix&#x2F;mastering.')
