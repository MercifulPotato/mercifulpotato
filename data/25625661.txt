Please wish us luck.<p>I work at a company that has a management team that historically thinks they need to prioritize initiatives for the organization. A little over a year ago we had a conversation with the management team and explained we would like them to focus on outcomes instead of telling us specifically what to do. It didn’t go over well, they basically ignored the entire conversation and told us what to do.<p>We are one year later and now undergoing a shift to focusing the organization on outcomes using OKRs and spotify style agile. People are starting to get it now and we’re having a lot of discussions with the very same leaders on a more individual basis which I think helps.<p>One thing is for certain, people (and culture) are hard to change.')
