AFAIK the biggest ad company, Google, doesn&#x27;t share your private info. It&#x27;s not in their interest to do so. Instead they keep it to themselves and then offer ads by categories so as a 3rd party I can say &quot;Please target this ad at &#x27;video game players&#x27;&quot; but I can&#x27;t ask &quot;give me the names of video game players&quot;')
