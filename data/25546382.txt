The fact that it came from a cow is irrelevant to me - I like it for taste&#x2F;texture&#x2F;etc. If you can give me the exact same product from a lab, I&#x27;ll 100% buy it (especially if it&#x27;s cheaper). This is how most people are (and not just about meat) - they care about the end product they&#x27;re consuming, not its origins or how it got to them (otherwise, y&#x27;know, we&#x27;d be thinking about where our iPhones came from and whatnot). Give them the identical product they have now that&#x27;s better along some line that matters to them (like cost) and they&#x27;ll happily switch.')
