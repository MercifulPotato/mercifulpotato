I was judging by:<p>1) Who is hiring top people in my group of colleagues<p>2) Who is described by people who work there as having a healthy work environment (i.e. people want to work there)<p>For Twitter, I&#x27;ll admit I have a small enough N that I can&#x27;t speak with very much confidence at all. I have one or two friends there, but they seem very happy, describe their peers as smart, etc. They&#x27;re competent and I trust them, but well, one or two anecdotes doesn&#x27;t make data.<p>But Twitter did put out a few high-profile things like Bootstrap. I don&#x27;t like or use Bootstrap myself, but it&#x27;s predominant in that area.')
