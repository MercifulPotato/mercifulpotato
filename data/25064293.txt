Also starting new habits and not tying so much of myself to my work&#x2F;current company is something I have to learn better to do and is a goal of mine during my break.<p>When you care deeply about the area you are working in, it is hard to turn off. This combined with a very ambitious company lead me to crash and burn about 18 months ago. Tried to recover with short breaks and while that helped, it kept going back to the same pace and have decided if I want to kick this exhaustion, I need a longer break to form better habits and try to find that joy in what I do again.<p>Whether or not I&#x27;ll be successful, I don&#x27;t know, but need to try.')
