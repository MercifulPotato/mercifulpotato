That&#x27;s because hedge funds are an <i>absolute return</i> product that offers an income stream uncorrelated to the market.<p>This may sound counterintuitive, but it&#x27;s the basis of modern portfolio theory. The price that an investor should be willing to pay for an investment has to do with its beta to the broader market.<p>Think of it this way, imagine you could access the S&amp;P 500 in a parallel universe. It has the same return characteristics as the normal S&amp;P 500, but in any given year moves independently. How much does this improve your portfolio? Intuitively you&#x27;d think it&#x27;s not worth anything. It&#x27;s only <i>as</i> good as your current investments, so what&#x27;s the point.<p>But in fact modern portfolio theory tells us that it&#x27;s a huge improvement. Investing 50&#x2F;50 in S&amp;P and Bizarro-S&amp;P, substantially improves the amount of return you can access for the same risk. That&#x27;s because the two diversify each other, and the blend either reduces risk by 30% or lets you leverage up and increase expected returns by 30%.<p>You&#x27;re saying, &quot;maybe Melvin isn&#x27;t a good investment, because it seems about equal to the S&amp;P&quot;. But the point is an investment that&#x27;s about equal to the S&amp;P, yet uncorrelated to the S&amp;P is <i>massively</i> valuable. Even if it has big drawdowns, you typically don&#x27;t care as long as those drawdowns tend to occur during times when the rest of your portfolio is doing fine.<p>This is the same reason that a 60&#x2F;40 stock-bond portfolio has massively outperformed 100% stocks historically. Even though bonds themselves return less than stocks.')
