Of course they don&#x27;t sound better than my HD800, but I find the sound quality <i>good enough</i>.<p>After wireless headphones started to emerge, I&#x27;ve always wanted to replace my dac, amp, headphone setup into a single headphone and I&#x27;m satisfied with AirPods Max. HD800 is obviously for home use only, so for the past few years, I&#x27;ve been trying to find headphones that have good enough sound quality, wireless, noise canceling, great build quality and design, great comfort at the same time, and I think this is it.<p>Treble of AirPods Max is more similar to HD650 than HD800 which is slightly less bright. And the bass is what I find very interesting. AirPods Max not only has very good bass, they feel more like they are coming from speakers than most other headphones. To my ears, the bass is on par or even better than HD800. Overall, I still like the sound of my HD800 more, but AirPods Max comes close enough for me as a replacement. In fact, I like them more than HD650 and Beyerdynamic T1 which I&#x27;ve owned in the past.<p>One thing I want from them is system wide spacial audio, or for music at least. You can use spacial audio for supported apps and videos only. The experience is amazing and I would really like to use spacial audio for other things as well.')
