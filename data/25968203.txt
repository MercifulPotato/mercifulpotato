That means that if I change the width of the browser window, the position of the website elements changes. So when I make the window bigger for ONE annoying tab that requires more width, it changes ALL other tabs. This is horrible for my muscle memory.<p>Also, I arrange my windows such that overlapping windows don&#x27;t hide important stuff underneath them. So I can see essential elements of a site even with chat windows on top. But if the website position changes on browser window width change, this invalidates ALL my other windows. It&#x27;s simply awful.<p>I want degrees of freedom to be independent, otherwise they are far less useful.<p>People want centered websites because they are using browser windows that are far too wide, usually full screen. Just use a narrow browser window and left-aligned websites will look just fine. You&#x27;d think that with everyone having a narrow smartphone, websites would work well with narrow browser windows, but no, usually they use a different (bad!) layout on desktop browsers. I really hate this.')
