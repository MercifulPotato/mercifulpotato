They even had a search filter based on physical attributes like any dating site.<p>I had a female friend set up my profile specifically for this purpose in early 2006.  Within hours after signing up a random girl sent me a message to ask if I had a girlfriend.  The following week I went out on 3 dates.  By the end of the year I met about 30 women in person and probably went out with a dozen multiple times, until shutting things when one became my girlfriend.<p>Facebook was setup to work differently and I never used it for this purpose, instead moving on to OKCupid when I was single again in 2011.')
