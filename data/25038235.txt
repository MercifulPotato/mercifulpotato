It isn&#x27;t clear that the price input expects the user to write a value in it, nor that there is a minimum value. I would recommend using the placeholder value as the value if the user doesn&#x27;t enter anything. Additionally, the call to action is very ambiguous. &quot;I want this!&quot; doesn&#x27;t really tell me what&#x27;s going to happen when I click it. What if I&#x27;m curious and I don&#x27;t really know if I want this? Etc. Plain old &quot;Buy&quot; or &quot;Download&quot; are universally known and understood.')
