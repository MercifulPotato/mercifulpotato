I got into a similar argument with someone on here before, and I believe it is an insufficient economic principle to justify a currency. A good currency serves as a medium of exchange or a standard of value.<p>Are people using bitcoin to replace USD in general? No, not really. It&#x27;s not a very good medium of exchange not because of the illegal stuff but because no one knows how it works and it&#x27;s messy, that&#x27;s why no one buys stuff with it. They also don&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;s worth on average and therefore struggle to use it, bringing me to my next point...<p>Are people using it as a standard of value? No, if I tell you a car costs 15k USD you know what that means. If I tell you it costs 1 BTC, you have no tangible idea of how to relate that to the real world because BTC&#x27;s value changes sporadically. I am sure this will stabilise as crypto matures, but i dont think people should invest this much effort into something that is just going to be used as a value measurement.<p>So back to the &#x27;store of value&#x27; thing, why do I want people <i>not</i> to invest their money? Is wealth hoarding not a problem now, or do you believe that just by virtue of it existing as BTC, it&#x27;s doing something good?')
