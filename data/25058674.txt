Item(by='andreareina', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605105040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25057915, text='If it were about dodgy parts, it would be enough to use genuine parts. It&#x27;s not. If it were about dodgy parts they&#x27;d make it easy for third-party shops to get genuine parts. They don&#x27;t. Why do parts through their independent repair program cost more (to the point of being uneconomical) if the shop is replacing a non-OEM part or (god forbid) they want to stock up so they can actually replace parts when their customer walks in and not have to wait for Apple&#x27;s approval[1]? How does charging more for replacing a non-OEM part protect people?<p>I&#x27;ve done things Apple&#x27;s way, and my reward was losing access to my work tools for two weeks. They can pay for prime real estate but they can&#x27;t pay to train their Geniuses to actually fix things? To change a battery? They can&#x27;t keep parts in stock? Doing things their way is miserable---they are capricious, they deny they ever make any design errors, it is inconvenient. This drives people to third-party providers where they can actually get better service for the products they paid a premium for. How does this protect people?<p>I&#x27;m not even talking about component-level repair. I&#x27;m not talking about changing a bad chip.<p>These are the feet[2]. They stick on. No soldering required. But apparently that&#x27;s too hard for their Geniuses to do.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0rCUF-V1esM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0rCUF-V1esM</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifixit.com&#x2F;Store&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;MacBook-and-MacBook-Pro-Unibody-Plastic-Feet&#x2F;IF163-052?o=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifixit.com&#x2F;Store&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;MacBook-and-MacBook-Pro-Uni...</a>')
