The idea would be that in exchange for a loosely regulated phone factory you give locals discounts in the range of 50% on the products made there. You couldn&#x27;t do it with everything but for goods that are both expensive and nigh ubiquitous like cars&#x2F;motorbikes, phones, household appliances, etc. I think it could be a good value for the locals.')
