A few months ago, chromium and other applications started to give me major rendering problems, becoming completely transparent when switching virtual desktop &quot;workspaces&quot;.<p>I decided it was time to get with the times and try out GNOME on wayland. While I would have preferred to stick with xfce, Debian stable does not make it convenient to upgrade to their latest version, 4.16.<p>I&#x27;m using a T480 Thinkpad and I&#x27;m sure my GNOME version is similarly out of date, but wayland has been performing well enough so far.<p>However, at this point I&#x27;m looking to migrate to Fedora when I get the time. I&#x27;m tired of fighting against the bizarre nerd carnival that is the Linux Desktop.<p>These are my installation notes: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anschwa&#x2F;debian-thinkpad-install" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anschwa&#x2F;debian-thinkpad-install</a>')
