It&#x27;s literally trivial to build a Chrome extension. It&#x27;s a big part of Chrome&#x27;s success: people who used to struggle to build FF extensions when it was about XUL and RDF, when Chrome arrived could quickly bang together something that directly improved their life. Google understood that their audience was <i>anyone using a browser</i>, not just this or that subset of markup fanatics.<p>One of the pros of the Quantum switch was that building FF extensions became as easy as Chrome. Reintroducing complexity via the tooling is just self-harm.')
