Also Memoria, same company.<p>Wadjet Eye Games does more retro adventure stuff. Unavowed sits comfortably alongside old adventure game classics for me in terms of presentation and story. I&#x27;ve heard good things about their other games as well but haven&#x27;t played them yet.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Unavowed for a 7-year-old, though, as it can get quite dark.')
