Myself included (though I wish the Muller report were written with stronger language to clarify itself: its conclusion had extremely weak wording).<p>I talk about the misinformation that I can see personally and in my social circle. Fortunately, none of my family members are getting sucked into Q or some of the more dangerous stuff... but the misinformation across the spectrum online destroys discussion as a whole. Far more than &quot;censorship&quot; of posts by Twitter or whoever.<p>After all, I don&#x27;t do Facebook. I honestly don&#x27;t care about it: I&#x27;m practically &quot;self-censored&quot; from Facebook because I don&#x27;t use it at all. What I do care about is the misinformation my family is getting from it.<p>---------<p>I mean, it seems clear to me that you are a user of Facebook, and you seem to agree with me that misinformation is running rampant?<p>I&#x27;m blind to it, since I don&#x27;t read Facebook at all. I can only tell you what has come through my Mother and Sister&#x27;s mouths in  my discussions with them. But as far as I can tell, you&#x27;re just confirming my point: that there&#x27;s a huge amount of misinformation here. And I applaud Facebook&#x27;s announcement that they&#x27;re fighting against it.')
