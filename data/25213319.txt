There was something about the quality of the colors, the weather, the camera work, even to this day you can distinguish the video from the &#x27;86 World Cup at a glance of just a couple of seconds. It still brings back such amazing memories from my childhood - even though we lost. I collected the Panini World Cup stickers religiously and put them all carefully in the sticker album. I was heartbroken to be knocked out by someone I considered to be a massive cheat, but even so, I can&#x27;t take away from the brilliance of this goal. It was an incredible run. He deserved the goal. I wish I could&#x27;ve said they deserved the game without feeling that tinge of bitterness.')
