The cameras should have been there to record&#x2F;document.<p>Yes, but we know that guards do not monitor. We know cameras frequently aren&#x27;t working.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not the prevention I&#x27;m concerned about, it&#x27;s the convenient lack of documentation&#x2F;monitoring&#x2F;etc.<p>You say &quot;convenient&quot;, I say &quot;sadly all too familiar&quot;.<p>&gt; But how many cases as important as epstein, where he was being monitored via guards and camera, and being watched for suicide have both the guards and cameras fail?<p>Honestly loads.  Fred West, Harold Shipman, were both notable serial killers who took their own lives when in prison. West murdered 12 people and was on remand. Shipman, who murdered over 200 people, had previously expressed suicidal intent and gave a reason for wanting to die.<p>&gt; and the guards are sleeping and the cameras are not working?<p>You keep saying this, as if it&#x27;s some kind of smoking gun. The thing I&#x27;m trying to tell you is that it&#x27;s very common and that it&#x27;s not in anyway surprising that a person, even a very high profile person, dies by suicide.')
