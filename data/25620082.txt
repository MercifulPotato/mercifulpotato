Item(by='boulos', descendants=None, kids=[25621682, 25620996], score=None, time=1609656702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25619798, text='Yeah, that came off clumsily (I’d lost part of my comment while switching tabs on my phone).<p>An AMD Rome&#x2F;Milan part will give you 256 decent threads on a 2S box with a ton of RAM for say $20-25k at list price (e.g., a Dell power edge without any of their premium support or lots of flash). By comparison, the list price of just an A100 is $15k (and you still need a server to drive the thing).<p>So for shops shoving these into a data center they still need to do a cost&#x2F;benefit tradeoff of “how much faster is this for our shows, can anyone else make use of it, how much power do these draw...”. If anything, the note about more and more software using CUDA is probably as important as “ray tracing is now sufficiently faster” since the lack of reuse has held them back (similar things for video encoding historically: if you’ve got a lot of cpus around, it was historically hard to beat for $&#x2F;transcode).')
