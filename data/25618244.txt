Long conversations are discouraged.  Hot takes are encouraged.  They want to smash you with things that trigger an emotional response over and over.  In my personal business I don&#x27;t care all that much what you &#x27;want,&#x27; I care what you&#x27;ll pay for.  Twitter doesn&#x27;t care what you want, they care what drives engagement&#x2F;ad sales.')
