These aren&#x27;t perfectly Vim commands, but from the Vim-like &#x27;evil mode&#x27; for emacs, I have some examples of common idioms I use frequently:<p>- &#x27;I want to change the name of this variable. &lt;cw&gt; (Change Word)&#x27;<p>- &#x27;I want to copy the contents of this braced block. &lt;yi{&gt; (Yank Inside Matching-braces)&#x27;<p>- &#x27;I want to surround this word in parentheses. &lt;vaws(&gt; (Visual-mode (region selection) Around Word Surround-with Matching-parens)&#x27;<p>You get used to the separate modes fairly quickly. Your existing editor already works that way when switching between &#x27;region&#x27; and &#x27;insert&#x27; modes; it&#x27;s just the command mode that throws people off initially. It&#x27;s not that rough, especially if you have a reasonably placed key to return to command mode.')
