I did that thereafter and it made a lot of difference in my understanding of the result. It isn&#x27;t done by many engineers any more, and I always look with suspicion on results claiming  absurd precision. There isn&#x27;t so much understanding there and people who engage in it are much more likely to submit work with multiple order-of-magnitude errors. They do not -know- the answer, they accept the line on the screen un-critically.')
