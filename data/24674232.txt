The end is generally obvious (hint: the good guys win) and they follow a fairly common setup. That&#x27;s not necessarily bad, you can produce very entertaining movies that way, and they&#x27;re often very well produced and supreme in technical aspects, but they&#x27;re not something I&#x27;d watch twice and usually not something I recommend to anyone.')
