No better way to consume other&#x27;s code than going through it on a printout!<p>This was the very reason I looked out for a modern dot-matrix printer, last year, only to find, that they have gotten pretty expensive (at least when compared to the InkJets and Lasers and in color, you also want more than 80 columns, etc.).<p>Also, what I did not find was a printer utility, that would print as many pages as still readable onto the paper, with a special emphasis on source code (hilite, etc.)<p>I did not purchase, however, since it is not so often, that I have to go through somebody else&#x27;s full source-code.')
