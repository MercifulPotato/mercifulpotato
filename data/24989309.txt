We wanted to validate our thermal control model and we had ~20 heaters and 24 hours to do the test.  Heaters couldn&#x27;t cycle faster than about 4 hours due to thermal mass, so we had to fit our periodic function in less than a quarter of a period of cycle time.  It works fine if you have a good initial guess to the period and you know your solution is periodic.')
