As far as I know, the HN moderators restrict only comments which are needlessly inflammatory and posts which don&#x27;t have to do with the technology industry, and I&#x27;d be fine with it if Twitter or Facebook adopted similarly general policies. (I&#x27;d be a huge fan of forming some version or corner of Twitter without politics at all, frankly.)')
