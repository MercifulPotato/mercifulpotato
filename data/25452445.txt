Item(by='borroka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608179126, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447797, text='There are a few fields in which there is movement academia to industry to academia, that is there is a permeable academia-industry barrier. Say, computer science and adjacent fields, business&#x2F;economics if we include business schools, medicine, but hospitals can also be research centers.<p>For the vast majority of other fields, if you move to industry, they (academia) are not interested in you anymore. Yes, there are some exceptions like that flight attendant who survived after falling out of the plane at I don&#x27;t know how many feet of altitude, but in my research field (one the life sciences) I have yet to see someone moving back to academia after having left to go work in industry. First, they (academia) do not want you anymore, you are simply expired. Second, as one faculty when I was a postdoc said: we would like to ask researchers who moved into the private sector how life is out there, but they never came back to tell us. And, I must add, it is easy to guess why: as soon as one gets some distance from the academic world (and I guess, from most worlds, but let&#x27;s stay focused on academia), they see that when researchers are not making ground-breaking work, they are just doing some work, not better or worse than many others that requires passion and dedication, pay little, and leave you like snow in the summer sun when you are not needed anymore.<p>Recently, someone in academia told me: when you are tired of industry, you can try to get back into academia, maybe as a professor of practice. Like, for 1&#x2F;3 of the money and 3 times the annoyances? I would much prefer to open a pizzeria and I don&#x27;t eat pizza.')
