I got interviewed at top tech companies and joined a well-respected one after submitting a &#x27;beautiful&#x27; resume which I really only spent a few hours designing. One of the tech interviewers thanked me for putting the time and effort into it, especially not trying to fill the entire page with as many bullet points as possible. A good design can&#x27;t make up for a lack of experience in a field, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nearly as detrimental as you&#x27;re making it to be.')
