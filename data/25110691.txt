It looks like 2016 was a major upgrade to the leaf, so I&#x27;d be curious what the resale of a 2014 vs 2016 nissan leaf looks like when they&#x27;re both out of warranty.<p>&gt; The last two ICE cars I had, I bought them when they were 12 and 9 years old,<p>You&#x27;re comparing technology that&#x27;s had 100 years to develop, with the first iterations of EVs. You&#x27;re right in that a current 2 year old EV likely has a much lower resale value than a 2 year old ICE vehicle. But remember that the Model S has been on sale for less time than the time between now and when this ban comes into place. Buying a 6 year old EV right now seems like a terrible idea, buying a 6 year old EV in 2035 will likely be a very different story.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nissan_Leaf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nissan_Leaf</a>')
