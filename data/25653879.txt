Most technical members are required to be on the list, with a few reasonable exceptions. If there&#x27;s someone who isn&#x27;t in the list, people will joke about them not being on the list and that seems to put pressure on adding them (this won&#x27;t work in all company cultures). It&#x27;s usually 1 week every 6-10 weeks depending on team size.')
