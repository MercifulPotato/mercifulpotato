In a movie theater you are forced to not play with your phone, etc while watching. Even though you are just sitting you are getting &quot;out&quot; of normal life for a while. You get better immersion and there is a shared experience that you simply can&#x27;t get at home. I fear that movie theatres are soon going to be a &quot;luxury&quot; as small theaters are killed and they try to turn them all into the &quot;dinner and a movie&quot; thing for higher margins, which to me completely defeats the entire purpose. There is something awesome about walking out of a great movie, the lighting outside is so different than when you came in and it&#x27;s a great surreal experience in and of itself.')
