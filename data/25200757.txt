You mention your product&#x2F;service X alongside the obvious brand names, you always have a story ready about how X can do what OP wants, etc.<p>The self-promotion rules just force you to be dishonest at all times.<p>Works well because people have a knee-jerk hate for &quot;check out this X I made&quot; but they are completely blind to &quot;check out this X I found.&quot; You can see this a lot in r&#x2F;gaming when solo devs share their work.')
