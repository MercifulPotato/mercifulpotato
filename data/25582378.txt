I am working with Amazon (they are my supplier in an IT project) and I have friends who work for Amazon, core IT people are very good, project managers are a mixed bag, the &quot;business oriented&quot; people are hit or miss, some are good and some are plain incompetent. This is because they are probably too large and hire too many people and they cannot always be too picky (a friend is a hiring manager and he is complaining how hard is to find competent people).<p>That being said, the problem is not very complex to solve, but the motivation is fairly low: they get a percentage of everything is sold, at some point that income can be a lot larger than the damage a few news articles usually do.')
