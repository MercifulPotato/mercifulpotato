Stack Exchange is a curious case study.<p>I share the general HN sentiment over microservices complexity but just to play devil&#x27;s advocate...<p>I suspect that server cost in this case is asymptotic. If the (monetary) cost of SE&#x27;s architecture is F(n) and your typical K8s cluster is G(n), where n is number of users or requests per second, F(n) &lt; G(n) only for very large values of n. As in <i>very</i> large.<p>In essence, the devil&#x27;s advocate point I&#x27;m making is that maybe development converges towards microservices because cloud providers make this option cheaper than traditional servers. We would gladly stay with our monoliths otherwise.<p>I tried to contrive a usage scenario to illustrate this but you know the problem with hypotheticals. And without even a concrete problem domain to theorize on, I can&#x27;t even ballpark estimate compute requirements. Would love to see someone else&#x27;s analysis, if anyone can come up with one.')
