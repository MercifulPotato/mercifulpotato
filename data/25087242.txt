That&#x27;s amazing and a huge feat.<p>Second, no you&#x27;re not crazy. It is risky, but not crazy. Are there a few things you can do to derisk your decision? Identify what you would need to know to feel comfortable and work back from that to form testable hypotheses. Then  figure out how much time&#x2F;money&#x2F;effort it  would cost to test those hypotheses.<p>If that seems like too much work, or you still won&#x27;t have the certainty, I  wouldn&#x27;t  go all  in, but there&#x27;s one other option before shutting it down.
