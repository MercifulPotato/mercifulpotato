In other words, the energy imparted by the ambient temperature is orders of magnitude greater than that that could be established through momentum of objects with that little mass.  So everything bumps into everything, and the only distinguishing factor between various bumps is how long they stay stuck together.  Most things just bounce right off.  Sometimes they are repulsed, and in rare cases (when they&#x27;ve been selected for), multiple proteins can meet in just the right orientation that they stay stuck for a while (now scale this so that 3 or 4 objects <i>must</i> meet at the same time, and now you get into the &#x27;regulation&#x27; of a cell at perception-relevant time-scales).  This measurement of stickiness is called the &quot;dissociation constant (Kd)&quot; and is a measurement of what concentration of component A you need alongside component B such that half of component A is bound to component B.  It is one of the primary drivers of most biochemical processes in a cell.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dissociation_constant" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dissociation_constant</a>')
