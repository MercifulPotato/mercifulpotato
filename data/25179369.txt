A corporation (despite our current legal definition in the US) is not a person, and therefore shouldn&#x27;t take sides in political matters, nor should it&#x27;s representatives make overt political statements as though the company is a monolith. Companies are made up of people, and as individuals on their personal time and without conveying themselves as representatives of the company, should be able to to engage in politics.<p>If Silicon Valley executives are now going to be the arbiters of all that is good, we are in for a load of trouble.
