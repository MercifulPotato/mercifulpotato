Obviously there are many problems with the sociology and incentive systems for physics departments; affirmative action, papers with 1000 &quot;coauthors,&quot; infrastructure fees for grants involving giving a grad student a pencil, political witch hunts, difficulties in family formation, herding behavior in subjects, byzantine political games, overcrowded winner take all credit. Frankly you&#x27;d have to be kind of a combination masochist moron to want to do it these days outside of the rare person whose career is assured post PhD; masochistic morons probably don&#x27;t make good scientists.<p>But nobody talks about the fact that an awful lot of &quot;physics&quot; these days is unfalsifiable piffle. Phenomenology, network theory, cosmology, noodle theory, &quot;quantum computing,&quot; black hole physics, neural net fiddlers, nanotechnologists, cosmologists, numskulls babbling about &quot;muh multiverse&quot; and &quot;muh simulation hypothesis&quot; -the <i>world</i> let alone the average physics department has entirely too many of these. Nobody <i>in</i> the physics department can make fun of these cranks for entirely political reasons. And at this point the lunatics outnumber the actual scientists, who, you know, can make predictions that can be checked, rather than generating piffle suited for press releases and late night bong sessions.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;1996&#x2F;06&#x2F;the-end-of-science&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;1996&#x2F;06&#x2F;the-end-of-science&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201004020641&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;cross-check&#x2F;science-faction-is-theoretical-physics-becoming-softer-than-anthropology&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201004020641&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.sci...</a>')
