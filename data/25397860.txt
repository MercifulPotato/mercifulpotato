They aren&#x27;t as bad as lootboxes, which are clearly designed to extract money, but their problem is that the potentially limitless money you can spend. If you go into a game knowing that it costs $60, you <i>know</i> that&#x27;s how much you&#x27;re spending on it. If you go into a game that hands out skins for $2.50 a piece, there&#x27;s no limit, and unless you&#x27;re good at making and sticking to a budget (which is a large portion of the world, especially kids who have no experience!) you can just as likely spend way more than $60.<p>This is worse when such things as skins end up getting tied to status within the game world. Fortnite doesn&#x27;t have randomized loot boxes anymore, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped kids from spending tons on V-bucks, especially since they get bullied if they don&#x27;t [1]. Seriously, just look at videos of people bullying &quot;defaults&quot; on Fortnite. I think it&#x27;s especially bad because there <i>is</i> a way to finance long-running multiplayer games: battle passes. It&#x27;s an upfront cost so you always know what you&#x27;re getting into.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.polygon.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;5&#x2F;7&#x2F;18534431&#x2F;fortnite-rare-default-skins-bullying-harassment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.polygon.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;5&#x2F;7&#x2F;18534431&#x2F;fortnite-rare-defa...</a>')
