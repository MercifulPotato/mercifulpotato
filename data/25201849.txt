Type definitions aren&#x27;t just for the compiler, they&#x27;re also for the developer. Being able to see at a glance which components expect children and which don&#x27;t is really valuable. Not to mention that there are situations where I want to restrict what kinds of children can be passed in (think render-props, or named slot projection patterns).<p>In other words, just because React supports an implicit definition of what a &quot;child&quot; can be doesn&#x27;t mean that my specific component supports all of those same possibilities.')
