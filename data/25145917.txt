If China wants to take territory from Japan, they have to go through the US (ask Biden, he just confirmed that for Japan, to their delight). If China wants Taiwan, they&#x27;re afraid they&#x27;d have to go through the US (or they&#x27;d have already taken it). If Russia wants the Baltics, a chunk of Finland, part of Poland, or Romania&#x27;s Black Sea territory, it has to go through the US.<p>Who else provides that blanket for the world?<p>The US should be spying on what <i>everyone</i> is doing militarily, without exception.')
