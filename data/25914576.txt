Item(by='Yizahi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611660164, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25910652, text='1. A limited set of drugs should be legal. Stuff like heroin or synthetic &quot;salts&quot;, etc. should be legally banned. I see no good reason for legal heroin for example.<p>2. Legal drugs should be equal in rights, including alcohol and nicotine. Same laws, same taxes etc.<p>3. ALL advertisements for legal drugs should be permanently banned everywhere. Including advertising with a package&#x2F;bottle itself on a market shelves. So no drug containing products can be displayed visibly on the shelves, anywhere, even in 21+ shops.<p>4 (optional). There should be a network of government sponsored clinics who will provide a certain subset of legal drugs for free, with mandatory medical screening. Not the drug itself for later use, but a single dose administered on-site. I&#x27;m not exactly sure about all negative possibilities here, so it&#x27;s an optional idea.<p>Points 1,2,3 should be mandatory and implemented as soon as possible.')
