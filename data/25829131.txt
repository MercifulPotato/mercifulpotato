A huge amount has happened in the last year. Plus, if you want more tidy-like syntax, you can go with Query.jl, (or DataFramesMeta.jl, though that isn&#x27;t quite finished updating to the the new DataFrames syntax), or of you just want pipes on DataFrame operations, there&#x27;s Pipe.jl and Chain.jl.<p>I don&#x27;t think your comments are harsh, you need what you need and you like what you like. I do mostly data wrangling too, but feel much less constrained with Julia than with tidyr. Sometimes having constraints and one right way to do things is good, but it&#x27;s not for me.<p>Also worth noting it&#x27;s not necessarily on the language developers to do this. Even in R, tidyverse is in packages, not in the base language.')
