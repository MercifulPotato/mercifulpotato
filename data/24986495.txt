I have become dismissive of non-Haskell languages. I think in Haskell. Languages less powerful than Haskell are obviously too limited to get any real work done in, and languages with more advanced features than Haskell (like dependent types) are really just weird and not actually solving a problem I would ever face.<p>&gt; The arrogance! Such a know-it-all!<p>&gt; I have decided to call such a realisation a “Blub Crisis”. Haskell is my Blub. The only solution is to become proficient—actually proficient—in a different language, and once again learn a new way of thinking.')
