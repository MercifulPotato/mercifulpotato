Item(by='rendall', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602844582, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24799188, text='&gt;&gt; any evidence produced you can label as fake or made up or false flag... Once evidence is provided the goal post is moved to evidence being made up or not credible. &lt;&lt;<p>There was no goal-post moving here, and accusing others of bad faith is against the guidelines. Accusing me of bad faith here is unfair and inaccurate. I ask for evidence that matches the magnitude of the assertion and that has never changed. Evidence I would accept is falsifiable: the forensic footprints of the malware, <i>or equivalent</i><p>Can I see the evidence myself and evaluate it on its own terms? The answer, after 4 years, is a hard no. Lots of articles; lots of partisans saying it&#x27;s true; lots of people such as yourself who are convinced, accusing others of moving goalposts; but nothing tangible<p>My original assertion is that this all remains an allegation. In response, you and the other user posted lots of links to people affirming that they know it to be true.<p>Your original assertion was that it has been proven and to claim otherwise is &quot;disinformation&quot;, but so far, and bear with me please: so far, you have <i>people</i> telling you that it&#x27;s true. Only. And that&#x27;s okay! It doesn&#x27;t mean they are lying or misinformed. They could be telling us the truth. At the end of the day, if you trust those people not to be lying or misinformed, then it&#x27;s good enough<p>I would hope that you see here that principled people can disagree, even if you find all the affidavits for it compelling and convincing.<p>&gt;&gt; No one walked back on anything. It was simply not investigated since Republicans (especially people like Mitch McConnell) are putting party over country and not holding the president accountable. &lt;&lt;<p>It could be that they are cynical, perhaps a bit evil, and <i>know in their hearts</i> the President is working against the interests of the country, but just gain too much personal benefit from looking too closely. Or, and stay with me here, perhaps at least some of them truly and <i>reasonably</i> believe that the evidence is not strong enough<p>I&#x27;m most likely done with this thread, but I do appreciate your contribution. If you would like to have the last word, know that I will read it and consider carefully what you have to say. I would love <i>one</i> link to the evidence you personally found most compelling. I will open-mindedly look at it')
