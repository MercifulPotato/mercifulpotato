Nothing will be more educational than a &quot;GPL death sentence&quot; to some multi-billion dollar multinational like Broadcom. <i>If it will not be McHardys doing the hard work of suing such companies, who will? I don&#x27;t see those conservancy guys, Linus&#x27; associates, or meek Linux Foundation raising a hand on kinds of Qualcomm, or Samsung (from whom, coincidentally, lots of Linux Foundation funding comes)</i><p>I completely don&#x27;t understand people who direct flak on them, and the brouhaha with the &quot;pledge.&quot; The only rationale I can fathom, is again is that material beneficiaries of GPL violation have now penetrated the circles who made the &quot;GPL Cooperation Commitment&quot;')
