We&#x27;re doing it with this Undertale thing, and there&#x27;s a good chance he&#x27;ll use it with Roblox, because the kid <i>loves</i> Roblox, and Lua is used there for scripting as well.<p>And in that context, it&#x27;s for non-programmers in a sense, sure, but it&#x27;s also for people learning to program. Those aren&#x27;t conflicting descriptions, right? Because initially you can call them &#x27;non-programmers&#x27;, but at a certain level of complexity, calling them non-programmers doesn&#x27;t even make sense anymore (and the Roblox custom games I&#x27;ve seen him play, they seem plenty complex to me).')
