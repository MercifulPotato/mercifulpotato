Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25923386], score=None, time=1611709928, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25922578, text='&gt; Something that has struck out to me for many years now is the rather striking lack of reporting on the incredibly strong correlation between parental (both maternal&#x2F;paternal) age at time of conception and ASM.<p>Thee&#x27;s a strong link to paternal age that seems well established. Maternal age effects seem to be all over the map: I&#x27;ve seen weaker positive correlation with advancing maternal age than paternal age, no correlation with maternal age, and negative correlation with maternal age in different studies (possibly with varying degrees of controlling for other known contributors; e.g., apparently women with autism tend to have first children older, which by itself can create the impression of a maternal age effect of not controlled for.)')
