I was replacing a high-write Postgres instance (10% creations, 90% updates), and was testing out a drop-in replacement that could &quot;just scale.&quot; CRDB did wonderfully, but ultimately I decided to rearchitect the problem to fit more of a CRDT model (albeit a crappy version) and just throw an endless stream of events at the DB which get reconstructed when the data is pulled out.<p>The model ended up working fantastically well, and I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I like ScyllaDB so far. I will say I wish there was an easier backup method, but I understand that&#x27;s a big ask on a distributed DB and automating our backups wasn&#x27;t that difficult.')
