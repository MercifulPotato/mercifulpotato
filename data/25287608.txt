(Not a very big surprise.)<p>- There do seem to be several users in research computing. (As a computational biologist, I find this interesting and encouraging.)<p>- The user demographics skew towards younger adults (&lt;45 yrs). (That&#x27;s interesting because they weren&#x27;t around yet during Lisp&#x27;s heyday, so the language seems to retain enough appeal to still attract new users.)<p>- User&#x27;s top 5 countries of origin: USA (30%), Germany (10%), UK (5.4%), Japan (5%), Canada (4.3%). (Not quite as anglophone-leaning as I&#x27;d expected; there&#x27;s actually a very wide spread of countries represented.)<p>However, I don&#x27;t know how this survey was advertised, so the results may just be sampling bias.')
