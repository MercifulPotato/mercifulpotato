Productivity is way up but wages haven&#x27;t kept pace.<p>That&#x27;s the whole problem: if everything is just labor arbitrage and owners take all the surplus we wind up in a world with excess capital (which encourages malinvestment) and consumers without money to spend. Business don&#x27;t hire or expand as a result of tax cuts. They hire when the marginal return is positive - aka when you have more customers with money to spend so hiring another employee leads to more sales or more profit. A billionaire isn&#x27;t going to buy more widgets if they pay $200m less in taxes this year. They don&#x27;t need the capital to expand or hire either - money is extremely cheap right now. That $200m will be invested in capital markets already awash with cheap money.<p>I wonder if paradoxically we&#x27;d all be better off if wages were higher (and offshoring &#x2F; labor arbitrage were mitigated). Labor would certainly have more dollars to spend across the board. That would give businesses more dollars to spend in turn.')
