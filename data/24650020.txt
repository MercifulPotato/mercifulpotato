If you find them consistently in a layer of a certain age all over the Earth, that points to a single source. Two different isotopes too, but only created by the same process so far as we know. Itâ€™s pretty decent evidence.<p>As for direct evidence, I know what you mean. There so way to observe the supernova, but how often do the jury get to watch a murder happen on film?
