Just because you may not be able to break something down into first principles, does not mean that the knowledge is useless.<p>Design, too, can be data driven. UX and UI design can be analyzed using A&#x2F;B tests, or by observing patterns of user behaviour.<p>It might be true that much of systems design is based on anecdotal evidence and intuition, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s enough of a reason to ignore the field of design entirely.<p>For example, the concept of abstraction in software design may be based primarily on the intuition that human beings are bad at holding too much complexity in their minds. But any software developer who has written more than one program will agree that abstraction is crucial to good design.')
