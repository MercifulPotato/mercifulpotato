He traveled one of the most popular hiking trails in the country. Went into stores. Stayed in campgrounds. Let himself be photographed a bunch of times. Why he hesitated that once, I don&#x27;t know, but I seriously doubt anyone would have pressed him if he&#x27;d just declined.<p>Better ways? A boat out into the ocean. Hiking out West or in Alaska. Or South America. Going deep into an unpopular cave. Hiking in a desert.<p>There are many, many places more &quot;wild&quot; than the popular hiking trail in Florida where he passed. If he&#x27;d wanted to slip away quietly, he seems like he had the means and the intelligence to have figured out how to do that successfully.')
