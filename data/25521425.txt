Fonts set a &quot;tone&quot; to your writing, and while Comic Sans if maybe fine for inviting people to in impromptu office pizza party, it represents yourself poorly in a professional environment. Here&#x27;s some examples of how inappropriate some of his emails were (all real):<p>- Contract negotiations<p>- HR issues<p>- Announcing the unexpected death of a co-worker<p>- Announcing layoffs on a contract loss<p>It looked ridiculous. It also turns out he was a terrible employee and manager. The two seem to be pretty correlated.')
