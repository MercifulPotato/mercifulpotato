It means if I want to go to a bookmarked page I have to close the tab I&#x27;m on (because I really just want to use that tab and I&#x27;m done with it) then open a new tab then the bookmarks show up.<p>But they&#x27;re not actually the bookmarks are they? They&#x27;re pinned sites which are different in the browser versus desktop. And they&#x27;re not collections. There are too many &quot;bookmark things&quot;')
