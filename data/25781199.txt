As I said in: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mastodon.social&#x2F;@stevelord&#x2F;105510076754785649" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mastodon.social&#x2F;@stevelord&#x2F;105510076754785649</a><p>&gt; Was it Uriel that committed that section? I could kind of understand not wanting to remove it if it was. If that&#x27;s the case then context in the FQA might be helpful for people who stumble across it.<p>That&#x27;s hardly demanding names, unless you&#x27;re referring to somewhere else in the convo. In that case please feel free to point it out.')
