Each number would list the numbers allowed to spoof it.  When a spoofed number comes through you check the list and see if it&#x27;s allowed.  Only the owner of the number can edit the list.  (This is not a burden for the vast majority of people who have no need of spoofing, they don&#x27;t need to ever look at the system.)')
