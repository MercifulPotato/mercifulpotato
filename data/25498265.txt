Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608577915, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25497778, text='&gt;In 1977, state and local governments spent $105 billion on higher education (in 2017 inflation-adjusted dollars). In 2017, they spent $297 billion.<p>&gt;Higher education spending has remained relatively constant as a share of total state and local spending over time. In both 1977 and 2017, 10 percent of direct state and local direct general expenditures went to higher education.<p>According to the source below, there are at least twice as many people attending higher education between 1977 and 2017, not including the ones who do not complete 4 or more years of college:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;184272&#x2F;educational-attainment-of-college-diploma-or-higher-by-gender&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;184272&#x2F;educational-attai...</a><p>There&#x27;s obviously a ton of waste in the system, such as the college sports business that has nothing to do with education and is clearly a taxpayer subsidy for private interests.  But it seems like taxpayer spending per student is down quite a bit (can&#x27;t include taxpayer backed loans, of course).<p>And I definitely agree, there is no need for everyone to go to a 4 year liberal arts school.')
