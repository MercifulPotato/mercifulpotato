As far as I can tell it&#x27;s pretty similar to when you left. React is still number 1 and maturing, Vue is number 2. Dependency hell is still an issue in node and frontend. Typescript won, a lot of libraries are adopting it although your average project is probably 30-50% migrated to TS with a bunch of &quot;any&quot;s floating all over the place. Rails &amp; Django are still pretty popular for MVPs, quite a lot of new developments in both. Go is used for a lot of smaller APIs and infurstructure tooling. Postgres is still the go-to. CSS in JS is accepted (at least in the React world). Kubernetes is delpoyed far more than it probably should be. I predict backend is on the edge of &quot;microservice fatigue&quot;.')
