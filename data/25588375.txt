I didn&#x27;t make any money for a while, but all in all I&#x27;ve sold about 80,000 copies. I haven&#x27;t published anything new since 2018 and my sales have since dried up completely.<p>Fiction is a product market fit game first: if you don&#x27;t write what people want to read, they won&#x27;t read it. After that, it is a quantity game. New books come out every day, if you don&#x27;t keep releasing more stories, people will forget you.<p>getting back to writing is one of my 2021 goals.')
