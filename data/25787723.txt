People have already started building cool projects with it, like air quality sensor visualizations or enhanced travel blogs.<p>Some key features<p>- Novel GPU powered level-of-detail system gives butter-smooth rendering, including on mobile\n- Stream in standard raster imagery tiles. Supports map tiles from a variety of providers\n- Easily include elevation data. Global 3D data integration via nasadem.XYZ\n- Powerful overlay capabilities. Draw crisp markers and lines\n- Well-thought-out API, complex applications can be built without needing to deal with 3D concepts\n- Great UX and intuitive controls, mouse-based on desktop &amp; touch-based on mobile\n- Tiny filesize means library is parsed fast. Package size is less than THREE.js thanks to code stripping<p>Check it out on Github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;felixpalmer&#x2F;procedural-gl-js&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;felixpalmer&#x2F;procedural-gl-js&#x2F;</a>')
