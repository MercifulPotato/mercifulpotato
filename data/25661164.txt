Reads like a survey of the state of the art from a decade+ ago. Many of the things mentioned are already mature areas of focus for startups and major players in the industrial robotics space. Many startups are working on the portability, ease-of-integration, and ease-of-use problems [0][1]. Cloud-oriented tools tailored to robot, line, and facility level health-and-status monitoring (even beyond the capabilities typically provided by SCADA systems) have been available to buy from major players for a long time [2]. I know Big 3 automakers have been toying around with integrating collaborative robots for years (and another OP already mentioned Rethink). Simulation tools run a pretty wide range of usefulness and market penetration, from first-party tools like ABB&#x27;s RobotStudio or Fanuc&#x27;s ROBOGUIDE to tools in the ROS stack to Nvidia&#x27;s ISAAC simulator [3].<p>To be fair, I only scanned it but I did not detect the hints of anything useful except for those who are entirely unfamiliar with the industrial manufacturing and robotics space.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ready-robotics.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ready-robotics.com&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.olisrobotics.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.olisrobotics.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rockwellautomation.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;software&#x2F;factorytalk&#x2F;operationsuite.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rockwellautomation.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;software&#x2F;f...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nvidia.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;deep-learning-ai&#x2F;industries&#x2F;robotics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nvidia.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;deep-learning-ai&#x2F;industries&#x2F;rob...</a>')
