Don&#x27;t  really see the problem with banning things that people cannot stop to use irresponsibly and that cause loss of life, including cars. (well technically they&#x27;re not banned, a license is just hard to get, 10% or so own a car).<p>Build good public transport, walkable cities, done. I mean have you actually considered how mental it is that we let people roam around in two tons of metal at high velocity next to pedestrians just to buy a bag of groceries. If people look  back at this in 500 years we&#x27;ll look like crazy cavemen')
