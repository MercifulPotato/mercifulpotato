I think he&#x27;s fantastic. His calm style is really great for both the interviewee and the listener in my opinion.<p>My knee jerk reaction to Lex was to dislike him, but if you allow yourself to dig a little deeper I think you&#x27;ll find he&#x27;s a hard working, intelligent and humble guy that&#x27;s following his passion.')
