May have changed since then, but it felt like peak panic (of the unknown) was strongest in my area closer to the initial outbreak. While more people wear masks now, my perception is that there is far less concern about COVID. I&#x27;m curious what is responsible for that - fatigue, fatalism, survivor&#x27;s recklessness?')
