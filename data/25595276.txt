Reading in general is the basis of learning, and boys over time have moved away.<p>Have to disagree; the sort of reading discussed in that study isn&#x27;t conducive to positive educational outcomes, but rather is more of a social activity.  (Yeah, I know reading is often thought of as a solitary activity, but reading fictional narratives may be better understood as desynchronized socialization.)<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, children can enjoy an educational advantage from pleasure-reading early on, as an introduction to how to read.  But after that, pleasure-reading is a largely wasteful activity, at least in terms of educational advancement.<p>Further advancement in reading may come from learning to read expanded English -- including [Markdown](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Markdown" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Markdown</a>), $\\mathrm{\\TeX}$, `(string)&quot;source code&quot;`, M+A+T+H, technical texts, diagrams, schematics, etc. -- but it&#x27;s unlikely that reading young-adult narratives provides the reader with any significant advantages.  In fact, I suspect that it&#x27;s likely to correlate with negative educational outcomes.')
