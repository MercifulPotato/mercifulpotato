In a typical hierarchical organization there is a clear heterogeneity in job skills.  The fry cook at McDonalds does not have, and will likely never have, the skills necessary to become an executive.  Similarly in a law firm the secretary cannot advance to become a law partner: he is not a lawyer.  There is no expectation that the line worker would ever become the CEO, at least not without going back to school.<p>But in academia, and I suppose in a criminal gang, everyone has the same skillset.  PhDs are notionally being trained with the <i>specific</i> abilities necessary to become a professor.  Those at the very bottom have the capability to move to the very top, and likewise are hoping to do so.')
