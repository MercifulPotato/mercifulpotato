Item(by='yongjik', descendants=None, kids=[24963806], score=None, time=1604272326, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24962130, text='As for me, I shamelessly downvote most comments promoting climate denialism, because (1) it&#x27;s wrong, and (2) it&#x27;s not going to be productive (people have been having the same discussion for 10+ years), and (3) in order to have <i>any</i> productive discussion on the climate, people have to agree on basic shared facts.  I&#x27;m not interested in the 700th rehash of whether the sun explains global warming.<p>And no, we&#x27;ve been having &quot;But science requires skepticism!&quot; debate for 10+ years as well.  I can literally hear both sides&#x27; argument in my head, there&#x27;s no point in repeating it.<p>Sometimes my inner keyboard warrior gets the better of me and I end up replying to these comments instead of downvoting, but in retrospect, I think I&#x27;m doing this community a disservice by amplifying the noise.')
