We&#x27;re getting breakthroughs in a wide range of problems, and translating those gains in the problem space into &#x27;real&#x27; stable, practical solutions we can use in the world is the remaining gap, and often takes years of additional effort. It&#x27;s still really expensive to launch this stuff, and often requires domain expertise that the ML research team doesn&#x27;t have.<p>We&#x27;re seeing a lot of this pattern: ML Researcher shows up, says &#x27;hey gimme your hardest problem in a nice parseable format&#x27; and then knocks a solution out of the park. The ML researcher then goes to the next field of study, leaving (say) the doctors or whatever to try to bridge the gap between the nice competition data and actual medical records. It also turns out that there&#x27;s a host of closely related but different problems that ALSO need to be solved for the competition problem to really be useful.<p>I don&#x27;t think this means that the ML has failed, though; it&#x27;s probably similar to the situation for accounting software circa 1980: everything was on paper, so using a computerized system was more trouble than it was worth. But today the situation in accounting has completely flipped. Apply N+1 years of consistent effort improving data ecosystems, and the ML might be a lot easier to use on generic real world problems.')
