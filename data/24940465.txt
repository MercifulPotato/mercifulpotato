I was nearby recently and went for some bicycle trip. One pleasant little creek, perhaps 50cm deep and 1m wide, used to rise by 6m every so often. That area was settled eight hundred years ago, because the farmland was worth the effort required to keep the flooding under control.<p>It&#x27;s hardly surprising that such fine land becomes a breadbasket, and it&#x27;s not proof that it can be done anywhere.<p>And you&#x27;re not capital-rich if your capital is a home in an area people want to leave, and your country isn&#x27;t capital-rich if people there see no future. The fine infrastructure of your former home is worthless in the eyes of the visa applicants in the country you want to move to, because they, like you, don&#x27;t want to live there.')
