Blockers are:<p>* Usage of the Google Maps SDK - the service needs revenue to be able to support running and maintaining it&#x27;s own tile server<p>* Usage of push messages via Firebase - the zood server has no problem with a socket remaining open all the time with the Android app, I&#x27;m simply not sure what the impact would be on the battery.<p>* Usage of the FusedLocationProvider API - a code path needs to be added that would simply use the platform provided GPS access. It wouldn&#x27;t be too difficult, but it would hurt accuracy and battery life.<p>* Usage of locationiq.com API - similar to the need for a Zood tile server, I would need to stand up my own reverse geocoding API somewhere so F-Droid wouldn&#x27;t need an API key for locationiq<p>That all said, I do think it&#x27;s a worthwhile endeavor to make the app F-Droid compatible.
