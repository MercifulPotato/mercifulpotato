IKEA doesn&#x27;t use anything fancy and weird, all their stuff is standard or a slightly variation of standard and could easily be replaced by a standard one. In fact most of the IKEA stuff is so popular it has become standard.<p>IKEA sells both particleboard &amp; veneer for their cheap&#x2F;budget friendly stuff and hard pine&#x2F;other wood for more expensive stuff.<p>You can&#x27;t have cheap and solid wood, it&#x27;s just too expensive.<p>Go down to the local wood shop and buy all the wood you need to make a sideboard and tell me how much it will cost. Certainly will be leagues higher then buying a particleboard &amp; veneer version of the same thing.')
