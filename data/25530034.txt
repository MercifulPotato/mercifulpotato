I&#x27;ve asked five (5!) times to be taken off their list and added to a blacklist for candidates and I still get emails, calls, and LinkedIn messages. The first two &quot;buzz-off&quot; messages were polite, but now I&#x27;m just downright rude and respond with my actual opinion on their employer (and subsequently what I think about <i>them</i> working for that employer).<p>Facebook is a bad company that does bad things. If you work there, you&#x27;re gross.')
