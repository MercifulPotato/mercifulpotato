Usually, you would expect such a system to match you with players of similar skill. But, that&#x27;s NOT how it works in CoD.<p>Instead, the SBMM in CoD matches you with a bunch of players who are far worse than you for a game or two. Then, it matches you with a bunch of players who are far better than you for a game or two, and this cycle continues over and over again. This means that you will do really well for a game or two, and then get destroyed for a game or two. Eventually, this averages out to the target of every player having around a 1.0 kill&#x2F;death ratio.<p>In theory, SBMM is supposed to help lower-skilled players, but the implementation in CoD is so bad it is more of a roller coaster than a bunch of matches against similarly-skilled players.')
