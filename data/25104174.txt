The political conservatives who had disliked the countermajoritarian output of the Warren and early Burger Courts developed a fondness for judicial activism once there was a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Originalism was thus transformed from a shield against what its proponents saw as illegitimate liberal decisions striking down laws adopted by conservative lawmakers into a sword that could be wielded by conservatives to strike down laws adopted by liberal lawmakers.<p>Originalism coupled with judicial restraint could not invalidate affirmative action, campaign finance regulations, or gun control. Abandoning judicial restraint led to an &quot;unbound&quot; form of originalism that licensed conservative judicial activism, even as judicial conservatives continued to complain about liberal judicial activism in cases involving such matters as abortion, the death penalty, and gay rights.</i><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dorfonlaw.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;why-not-to-be-originalist.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dorfonlaw.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;why-not-to-be-originalist.h...</a><p>Do you have a non-activist originalist argument for Alito&#x27;s on-going stance against legal protection of gay marriage? In Obergefell v. Hodges he stated that the Due Process clause protects only rights &quot;deeply rooted in this Nation&#x27;s history and tradition&quot;. He&#x27;s making up a justification to allow a minority of conservative opinion to prevent gay people from getting married. How isn&#x27;t that activism?')
