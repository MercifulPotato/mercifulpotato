It&#x27;s not a cutting edge, concurrent generational GC but it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> big of an undertaking. And it performs very well for small problem sets since memory is all slab allocated. Only a few hundred lines in Rust.<p>I do definitely see how writing a tree walking interpreter is non ideal in Rust if you don&#x27;t have a ton of experience writing Rust.
