You can search through photos by text without having to have previously annotated your photos, it automatically builds albums that contain people it&#x27;s decided are important to you, it automatically pulls out the &quot;best&quot; photos for you which really helps if you like to take tons of photos, it can automatically create entire slideshows for you. This is probably just a subset of the things to which ML is applied in one app on the device.<p>Fully agreed on the Siri shortcomings, though! But, I&#x27;m not sure how much of that work is done on device with the neural engine vs in the cloud. Not like that matters when the end result is so bad.')
