Item(by='doix', descendants=None, kids=[25727028, 25727813, 25727689], score=None, time=1610358403, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25726658, text='&gt; Goldman Sachs does a lot of work in erlang but mostly to limit turnover on the dev side - try getting a job if all you have on your resume is years of working with a language nobody else uses, you can do it but it’s going to take a lot more effort on your part.<p>My take on that is slightly different. Choosing a fairly esoteric language as a company reduces the amount of effort it takes to review applicants. Right now, if you post a job for python, you&#x27;ll get thousands of applicants. You&#x27;ll then need to filter them and a vast majority won&#x27;t be able to code the most basic things.<p>Post a job advert for erlang, you&#x27;ll get significantly less applicants because there are fewer erlang programmers. Also, no one learns erlang to “get a job in tech”, they learn erlang because they like it as language. In my experience, this means that on average erlang programmers will be better on average to python programmers.<p>I&#x27;m going to assume that if someone from Goldman Sachs leaves, they will try to find another erlang job, because that&#x27;s what they enjoy programming in.')
