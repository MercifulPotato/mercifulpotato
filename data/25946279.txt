If you want to focus on GME-as-ownership-unit, as a share in a retail business, that&#x27;s perfectly valid. But that&#x27;s not the only perspective.<p>Right now there&#x27;s a bull case for GME(-as-contract-closure-instrument): that may not be the case in the future. But that&#x27;s no different than any other commodity (IMHO).')
