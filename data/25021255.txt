Do you <i>want</i> to save up for another 5 to give the next 5 a try? Do you <i>want</i> to spend 10 years on a goal that&#x27;s no guarantee and that most other people will tell you is a bad idea vs working at FAANG?<p>For most people, they are solving for securing a predictable career so that they can have a family and live their lives. What better way to secure your spot, if not by becoming or joining&#x2F;enabling a monopoly in your little sphere of life? Why is FAANG a term? Because people want to join monopolies&#x2F;potential monopolies to secure a predictable family future :)<p>That&#x27;s why software doesn&#x27;t talk to one another for the most part - if it isn&#x27;t enabling someone&#x27;s potential monopoly - it isn&#x27;t worth doing given most people&#x27;s life goals.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s ever going to change unless we establish basic income creative people can raise a family on and I don&#x27;t see why most people who aren&#x27;t creative, would be in favor of such an arrangement, so we&#x27;re stuck with what we&#x27;ve got :)')
