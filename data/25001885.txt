If I understand it right, this is up to a 0.6% tax on gross receipts. What if a business runs on very thin margins? I can imagine someone like Waste Management ($50b company, $11m in CEO comp, median employee probably makes waaaay less than that) deciding that operating in SF is no longer worth it.')
