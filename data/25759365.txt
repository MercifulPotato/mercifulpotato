I want a way to supply links to past discussions that communicates clearly: &quot;this is just a list of additional things that some of you may be interested in and if you aren&#x27;t that&#x27;s cool and this is a fine post and don&#x27;t worry everything&#x27;s great!&quot;... except brief. I thought <i>If curious see also</i> would do itâ€”but apparently it doesn&#x27;t quite land that way with everybody.<p>You&#x27;re right that when I post those I filter the list for only the most engaging discussions, because HN readers don&#x27;t like clicking on things and being taken to something not-so-interesting. Unfortunately that makes it a bit harder to write software to come up with just the right ones.')
