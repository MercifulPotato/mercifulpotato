However, you might be assuming that the US Dollar has a fixed price too. The US Dollar is fixed at the price of the US Dollar, which is of course only a relative value.<p>Likewise, a Bitcoin is worth what a Bitcoin is worth.<p>The difference between the two, what the OP is pointing out above you, is that Bitcoin currency has a limited supply and so can&#x27;t be devalued. Relative to each other, a Bitcoin will increase its value to the USD because the supply of the latter is always increasing.')
