But there&#x27;s a lot of waiting to get care, and sometimes a lot of fighting [1] to show eligibility in addition to all the waiting. Psychiatric care is reportedly much more problematic, as well.<p>I agree, it wouldn&#x27;t be the one to expand, because of lack of goodwill, and lack of capacity for more patients.<p>[1] One of my relatives has symptoms associated with Agent Orange exposure, but had a lot of trouble getting the VA to cover it until recently, because (as I understand) his service records didn&#x27;t show that he was in an area with exposure. Some recent laws passed changed the criteria that granted eligibility, and he&#x27;s been happy with the care he&#x27;s received since.')
