You will want to hide the extractor fans in the ceiling if you vent up out the roof.  Bear in mind that a newer house will be tightly sealed too so your stove&#x2F; vent will need it&#x27;s own air intake as well.  I mean you can open a window but I think code will require it to prevent backdraft. Basically the air intake opens when you turn the fan on.  Most of your other gas equipment (gas water heater and a gas clothes dryer) will be direct vent though in new builds.')
