I&#x27;ve now been a SWE for 15 years and I revisit CS 101 every few years when doing interview prep, but it always feels like a chore and I learn just enough to get by. I think I&#x27;m a great coder and can get shit done and solve hard problems, but I&#x27;m still scared of graphs and other concepts!<p>I&#x27;m on the job hunt again, but this time instead of just cramming for interviews I&#x27;d like to actually develop an appreciation for algorithms. What do you all recommend for lectures&#x2F;reading&#x2F;other learning material? I honestly have found a lot of the instructors quite boring, and wonder if maybe I just need to find the right video series or books. Someone like a Feynman of CS who just exudes excitement as they convey the beauty of concepts and the power they have in solving real problems.')
