China controls a lot of the supply chains that the US depends on which gives it great but subtle power. It&#x27;s not in the interests of a nation to allow another nation that much control over the items it depends on. They may not use that power right now but that can change at any moment and there may less public uses of that power. Same reason China (and Russia) pushes home grown companies over foreign companies.')
