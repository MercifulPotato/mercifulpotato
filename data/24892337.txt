But when you&#x27;re using electric propulsion, <i>how</i> small starts to become an issue. As far as I&#x27;m aware ion thrusters have TWRs in the 1&#x2F;1000 range - NERVA&#x27;s were in the ~1 range. This means you&#x27;re taking a 3000 second burn and replacing it with a 3,000,000 second burn - add in efficiency losses and things start getting interesting. (assuming a constant mass fraction devoted to engines, and that the electric propulsion TWR includes power generation and cooling)')
