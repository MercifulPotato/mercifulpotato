Period.<p>If one of the main parties running wants to prevent you from marrying the person you love, you can&#x27;t just be apolitical.  If one of the parties running wants to allow police to disproportionally harass, arrest, and kill people who look like you, you can&#x27;t just be apolitical.  If you&#x27;re poor, struggling to pay your bills, and one of the parties wants to add new hoops to jump through to claim any welfare or healthcare, you can&#x27;t just be apolitical.<p>If you have any empathy and care about any people in those positions, <i></i>you can&#x27;t just be apolitical<i></i>.<p>The only way to truly &quot;not care&quot; about politics is both to be very privileged and very selfish.')
