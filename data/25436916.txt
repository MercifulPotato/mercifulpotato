(e.g. what if you&#x27;re in a situation where rolling back could make the problem <i>worse</i>? we might be Google, but we don&#x27;t have magic wands)<p>* Debugging new failure modes is a coin flip: maybe your existing tools are sufficient to understand what&#x27;s happening, but if they&#x27;re not, getting that visibility can in itself be difficult. And just like everyone else, this can become a trial and error process: we find a plausible root cause, design and execute a mitigation based on that understanding, and then get more information that makes very clear that our hypothesis was incomplete (in the worst case, blatantly wrong).')
