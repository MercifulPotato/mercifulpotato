Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610027765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25669572, text='&gt; every new feature added was worth less than the features taken away<p>I think this is the core of the issue, not just adding new features. Adding features, especially in the general purpose OS that was chosen as an example, is not a bad thing as long as they stay out of sight and are there as optionals for the people who need them. But removing one feature to add another, or twisting an existing feature into something that can satisfy 100% of the users is bound to make the product worse.<p>The real obstacle the 100 year computer faces isn&#x27;t software, there&#x27;s no reason for it (or a copy) not to run for hundreds of years, providing it has something to run on. it&#x27;s hardware. Making a complex device that can run for a century is close to impossible unless there&#x27;s a chain of supply behind it to constantly replace failing parts. That&#x27;s a big ask over 100 years.<p>And then there&#x27;s the philosophical question: if over that 100 years every part is replaced and upgraded to fit the new trends, take advantage of new tech, etc. is it still the 100 year computer? Or the ship of Theseus?')
