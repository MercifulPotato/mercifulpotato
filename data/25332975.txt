We have a gas stove.<p>It&#x27;s been amazing to see how much what I considered &quot;light&quot; stovetop cooking will set it off and make it spend the next 20 minutes on max settings trying to decontaminate the air. Pan-frying and stir-frying are expected triggers, but even the evaporated vapor from a pot of simmering soup can make it momentarily angry.<p>Meat fat seems the worst offender. Nothing angers it quite like trying to brown&#x2F;sear meat does. God help us when I cook bacon in the cast-iron skillet. Even if there&#x27;s no smoke (I keep the heat at medium low to prevent the bacon from burning), the AP might continue to run for up to an hour after I&#x27;ve turned the damn stove off!')
