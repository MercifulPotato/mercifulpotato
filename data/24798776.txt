I&#x27;m glad I scrolled through the YouTube comments a bit to see this note on the background of the recording in wartime Berlin:<p>&quot;Recorded in Berlin, June 17, 1941. This was based on an old Yiddish song &#x27;Yossel, Yossel&#x27; (by Nellie Casman) which Sammy Cahn and Saul Chaplin later retitled &#x27;Joseph, Joseph.&#x27; Wonder if the censors realized this.&quot;')
