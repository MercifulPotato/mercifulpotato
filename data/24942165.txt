It&#x27;s entirely unnecessary to take down the mailing list (perhaps to take down the archives, but not stop accepting future emails) to comply with a DMCA notice. The mailing list and the repository are not joined at the hip like they are on GitHub. And the service provider is not obliged to be creative in finding the broadest possible scope of infringement: the onus is on the DMCA author to provide a list of infringing material.')
