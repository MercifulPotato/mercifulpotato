If I had not done this, I would have definitely moved back home as I wouldn&#x27;t have had time to appreciate the things I enjoy in life here.<p>The government here doesn&#x27;t do enough unless you&#x27;re unemployed to get you to learn the language. The courses at university are hard to get into and in demand and there&#x27;s not intensive courses shaped around the realistic work&#x2F;life schedule of technology professionals.<p>I don&#x27;t know a single person who has learnt the language here to the point where they can use it professionally, who hasn&#x27;t either a) studied intensively or b) been forced to learn it as part of being a student or c) had no choice (ended up outside of Helsinki in a place where English-language skills aren&#x27;t as high).')
