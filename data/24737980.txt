I can&#x27;t really see a reason to change: it&#x27;s not a huge amount of typing, it works everywhere, it&#x27;s very explicit and not magical.<p>For instance out of the top of my head I don&#x27;t remember how #pragma once decides what constitutes the same include file. If you have symbolic links, or absolute and relative paths for instance, how does it work? I&#x27;m sure I can find the answer in the compiler&#x27;s documentation, but with #ifndef I don&#x27;t even have to, it&#x27;s obvious what&#x27;s going to happen.<p>I would personally argue that old school guards should be preferred because of this and the fact that they&#x27;re standard, but I don&#x27;t feel super strongly about it.')
