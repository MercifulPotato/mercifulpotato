Squashing is also bad, because you’ll lose the history of the bug fix that prevented the deployment. Or at least someone will have a hell of a time deciphering the PR to reintegrate the original change and your bug fix.<p>After a few days, weeks, or months, the argument loses even more water because code will likely depend on the commit in question.<p>War story: there was a time someone accidentally deleted a multi-gb table in production. The table would take hours to delete and replicate globally, so the entire company spent at least an hour deleting the feature from production to stop the database errors. There wasn’t any reverting of original commits. No one had time for that.')
