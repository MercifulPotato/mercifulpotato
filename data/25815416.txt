E.g, I am long BAT. I can deposit my BAT stash on a MakerDAO vault to make an overcollaterized loan of DAI. I go on then to use DAI to pay people and services and other investments (see next point). If BAT&#x27;s value falls between a certain threshold and the loan is no longer collaterized, then the loan is liquidated.<p>- Provide liquidity in a volatile-stable pair (e.g, ETH&#x2F;DAI) on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap and reduce what is commonly called <i>impermanent loss</i> or <i>impairment loss</i>.<p>- Provide liquidity on Curve Finance on the DAI&#x2F;USDC pool. The fees I get to collect from that so far more than offset the interest rate from the original loan, and if you put on top of that that Curve gives their own tokens as an incentive to liquidity providers, I am getting around 2% ROI <i>per month</i> by holding fairly stable and low-risk crypto assets.')
