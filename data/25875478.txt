Item(by='fouric', descendants=None, kids=[25877773, 25876794], score=None, time=1611344906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25874860, text='I don&#x27;t understand the point you&#x27;re trying to make here.<p>&gt; We all are mostly average users.<p>If by &quot;we&quot; you mean the population of HN - that is blatantly false. The average HN user is <i>far</i> more technically sophisticated than the average computer&#x2F;phone user.<p>&gt;&gt; The average user does not do this.<p>This is completely true, and not &quot;paternalistic&quot; in the least - it&#x27;s a statement of fact.<p>&gt; There is not really any difference between your father and you.<p>Absolutely false. My father, as do most of the fathers I know, are profoundly <i>disinterested</i> in customization and learning more about their devices - even after I show them some of the stuff that they could do, and offer to teach them. It&#x27;s simply not interesting to them - they want to do workworking, or something.<p>&gt; My mother wants to play with things like everyone else.<p>Then your mother is different than most peoples&#x27; - including mine. My mother does not want to play with her phone - she wants to use it to get something done, whether that be talking with her friends or watching a video. This also describes my father, and the parents of the majority of people I know.<p>Now, sure, most humans want to &quot;play with things&quot; in the general case. However, that does not extend to every kind of object (e.g. car, gun, workbench, computer, house) for every person, and what&#x27;s more there is a <i>tremendous</i> amount of variability in the <i>drive</i> that each person has to customize each of those things. The fact that your mother might passingly be interested in changing the wallpaper of her phone does not in any way make her comparable to the &#x2F;r&#x2F;unixporn poster who has spent literally hundreds of hours on a single visual theme.<p>&gt; But we, the developers, don&#x27;t allow them, and we put them into walled gardens without ever giving them a choice. Because we are smarter and we known better, and we are doing it for their own good.<p><i>That&#x27;s what the post is arguing against.</i> You seem to be under the impression that separating &quot;users&quot; and &quot;developers&quot; implies taking control away from the former - which is false. Users <i>are</i> different than you - and you should give them power.')
