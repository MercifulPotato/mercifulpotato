And building a heat pump that can cool the inside of a box to &lt;100C when ambient is &gt;450C is... an interesting project.<p>You may as well just build a mechanical computer using gears and such. Modern manufacturing would make it practical to build a wind-powered tiny geared mechanical CPU and memory.<p>Thermal expansion would be a challenge, but not an impossible one.<p>Peripherals would still be a problem. Receiving commands would likely be impossible, so it would have to be autonomous. But you might be able to use a chemical&#x2F;optical system for signalling. Or maybe vary radar reflectivity. Or...?')
