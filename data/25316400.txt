So any protocol that prevents censorship&#x2F;surveillance by ISPs also impinges upon bona fide network administrators. Corporate networks have the same dynamic, although there are few tears shed when it becomes harder for them to tamper with users&#x27; traffic.<p>The right answer is to make sure devices that have <i>any</i> Internet access run code you control. The root of the problem here is buying a &quot;smart&quot; TV, hooking it up to the network, and then expecting to tame all of its user-hostile anti-features by policing its communication. The only way to use black box IoT devices is to remove all general Internet access from them, allowing communication only with hosts you do control. For instance I&#x27;ve got a network of tp-link bulbs that are all controlled from a Home Assistant instance, and they never have and never will get a packet out to the larger Internet.')
