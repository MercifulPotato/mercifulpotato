You blame me for using the very example you brought up in the first place? Well, that&#x27;s a new low.<p>My very first comment was not about Parler but in general. Which you keep misunderstanding.<p>You also seem to not understand the difference between the ideal of free speech and the law. When I&#x27;m talking about free speech I&#x27;m not talking about the government.<p>&gt;Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction. The term &quot;freedom of expression&quot; is sometimes used synonymously but includes any act of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.<p>Nor is the definition of freedom of speech mentioning anything about the government.')
