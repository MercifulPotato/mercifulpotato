Github is slowly becoming less and less endearing with export regulations ICE contracts and lock-ins like github client.  Minecraft was a confusing four-billion dollar purchase that left people scratching their heads in 2014.  analysts said it would help get newer younger users into Microsoft products, but youtube and google trend data since 2015 shows interest had peaked by the time Redmond bought it.  They tried shoehorning it into code camps for whatever that was worth.  They bought Linkedin, a sterile wasteland of spearphishing and recruiter spam that (surprise) is export restricted as well.<p>Azure and office365 target the same locked in old-news customers: corporate and mega corporate IT shops that deploy COTS and do whatever their rep tells them to do when its time to pay the piper for the OS and server licenses.  Neither of these services can seem to stay online for more than a few months at a time before a crippling outage.<p>and now they fold the edge browser into their competitors engine and flog it mercilessly like the &#x27;91 browser wars never ended.  hardly &quot;great work&quot; from the company thats desperately trying to clean up Ballmers spiraling mess of myopic war drumming against the OS that clearly and definitively won.<p>I guess you could say &quot;Xbox&quot; is doing &quot;great work.&quot;  the console is fun, the games are fun, and the division in charge seems to genuinely care about and do things the customers want.')
