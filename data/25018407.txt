Item(by='mcguire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604778663, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25017534, text='I flagged and downvoted your comment because it follows a disturbing pattern I have seen in messages from President Trump and his supporters, that the President cannot lose in a legitimate contest. The President has today asserted that he has won the election, &quot;by a lot&quot;; an assertion that can only be true if a significant number of votes against him are illegitimate. Mr. Trump has previously asserted that he won the 2016 election by a historically <i>large</i> margin, that the primaries and even the Emmys were rigged against him.<p>I&#x27;m tired of it.<p>Your comment is nothing more than an attempt to shut down discourse by denying that any opposed ideas can have any validity. That is a fallacy in an argument. In a democratically elected leader, or his followers, it is a direct attack on the foundations of the country. Please stop.')
