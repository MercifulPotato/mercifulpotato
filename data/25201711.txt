Bosch has rumored a pivot for several years now that the time for them to get out of ICE vehicle parts is coming up as all the German manufacturers plan to go EV only. If Bosch makes that pivot they would hugely disrupt ICE costs. That&#x27;s just one conglomerate of a dozen or less capable of that kind of disruption right now.)')
