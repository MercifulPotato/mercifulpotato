Of course, PyCharm has great features and you don&#x27;t need to use all of them when working with the IDE on your own as a novice coder. But as a teacher, you have a completely different problem: You need a really simple, easy to explain environment - no fuss, no unnecessary complexity. Students &#x2F;will&#x2F; explore unused features on their own and get lost or mess up. There is simply no time to deal with all possible problems individually as a teacher.')
