One hundred times this.<p>Those here arguing that things can, in fact, be found, or saying that my claim that &quot;nobody can find anything any more&quot; is absurd, clearly haven&#x27;t worked in the ~5 large enterprises that I&#x27;ve worked in over the last decade.<p>Internal organisation in enterprises is <i>shockingly bad</i>. Remember, these people aren&#x27;t techs. They have no idea what `find &#x2F; -iname file | grep whatever` means. They crack open SharePoint and rummage around. When they want to save a thing, they just put it wherever. It&#x27;s chaos.<p>I&#x27;m just implementing this for a few new projects at my current place and my boss has messaged me a number of times expressing his joy at just knowing where stuff is.')
