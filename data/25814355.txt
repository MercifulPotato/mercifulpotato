I think they still attribute to defensive strength, though.<p>I find it weird that railway&#x2F;road&#x2F;waterway coverage aren’t scaled by something like land area&#x2F;population.<p>Fair scaling would be hard for countries that have lots of less densely populated areas that they would be willing to temporarily give up in case of war and that, hence, wouldn’t need good infra for defense, or for island countries where lots of transport goes by sea, but I think it should be possible to do better than not doing any scaling at all.<p>For example, looking at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalfirepower.com&#x2F;railway-coverage.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalfirepower.com&#x2F;railway-coverage.asp</a>, Indonesia has just over 5,000 km of railway lines.<p>It scores about equal to Switzerland, with 4,800 km, but Indonesia is over 40 times the size of Switzerland.')
