It can add money to the economy but only on the supply side. In theory this is enough because companies don&#x27;t exist in isolation, to operate they must always employ workers. The problem with this theory is that those workers don&#x27;t have to be domestic workers. If you lend me USD to build an LCD factory I 100% won&#x27;t build the factory in Wisconsin or anywhere in the US.<p>There are two options: Just wait (for decades) until salaries in China have caught up to western levels. Introduce an artificial stimulus for domestic work.<p>That artificial stimulus is not the responsibility of the central bank. The rest of the government has to do this.')
