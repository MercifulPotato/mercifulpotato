It is hard to get too deep into the weeds by accident. It builds fast, so programmers who code by successive approximation, making more or less random changes until something works can get there quickly. It runs pretty fast, so programs usually don&#x27;t need much optimization attention.<p>It competes in the same niche as Java, but lacks Java&#x27;s complications that, more often than not, are purely obstacles.<p>Before Go, before Java, there was Visual Basic. Visual Basic coders didn&#x27;t go anywhere. Go acknowledges and welcomes them.')
