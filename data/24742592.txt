And why do the answers need to be universal? Most papers I&#x27;ve read do not universalize their results, at least outwardly, but (some) popular science writers seem to do that a lot.<p>I can imagine, and several other comments allude to this, that individuals with different genetic makeup will experience a different set of dynamics around nutrition. I don&#x27;t mean to be facetious or to suggest these aren&#x27;t real challenges, I&#x27;m just curious on what the big obstacles are, in 2020.')
