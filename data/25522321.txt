Handling finance will be outsourced either way, using Stripe or one of many other 3rd party services, you wouldn&#x27;t be processing any of that yourself. I buy a ton of 3rd party indy software on my Mac and always have, and nothing from the MAS, and typically the only &quot;personal info&quot;, kind of, is an email and maybe my name (and it&#x27;s not as if that&#x27;s verified somehow, I could just put in whatever). I also have plenty of email accounts and can trivially make more, as well as developer-specific aliases.<p>Plus there are other tools to further layer if it was ever a problem, like virtual credit card numbers. In practice the very nature of credit cards means it doesn&#x27;t seem to generally be a problem, has been less of a real world risk than hacks of physical retailers. If I see a bad charge, I just report it and get a new number.<p>Also FWIW, I&#x27;ve seen plenty of sites starting to offer Apple Pay as an option at checkout, I assume it&#x27;s getting built into more payment systems now. That itself is solid defense, at least as good as the MAS though sometimes the checkout flows seem a bit wonky still.')
