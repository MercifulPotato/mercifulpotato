The crypto-anarchists (left and right leaning) were getting their spotlight and laying out their &quot;dream&quot;. Basically an updated version of Kropotkin&#x27;s and Bakunin&#x27;s work for the blockchain-era.<p>I really don&#x27;t get what is the hate with the central banks getting control over the money. Yes they are not appointed by the Government but it does not matter, the moment they gain such power, they will become political.<p>At least, at allows countries to have complete control over their currency and cut the middleman when it comes to monetary policy. ECB and FED throw all this money into quantitative easing now, and the real economy gets nothing.<p>BTC as a global reserve is a pipedream, the only global and eternal reserve are big guns. BTC as a means of transaction is a dystopia ready to happen. No country is able to increase BTC supply, hence its a highway to unbelievable inequality, and no monetary policy control. Also, good luck enacting fiscal policy in an economy purely based on untraceable cash.')
