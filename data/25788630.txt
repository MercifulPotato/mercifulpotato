I don&#x27;t do the whole &quot;spoons thing&quot;, but I do have to make spoon-style choices.<p>A choice I might make is: will I go out for a short walk with the rest of the family? By doing so, I&#x27;ll hurt even more, and will need to sleep when I get back - so extra pain for me, and the kids miss out on playing with me later for an hour or two.')
