Android, Chrome are &#x27;moats&#x27; that are used to ensure Google wins. No other search engine could develop enough momentum to build the quality necessary while up against those moats and natural barriers.<p>&quot;If you give the government the power to decide who a private business has to allow in, that&#x27;s a power you will probably never get back. &quot;<p>Right now, you have absolutely zero power over how Google implements their policies, ergo, nor you nor I have any power to &#x27;give away&#x27;. While I don&#x27;t always entirely trust how government intervenes and there are risks, I trust them more than I do large corporations.<p>Your arguments don&#x27;t work because they are so general that they also work against every other government regulation. No FTC? No FDA? No FCC and &#x27;Net Neutrality&#x27;? No Privacy Laws? No worker regulations?<p>These basic arguments about gov vs. private practice generally become moot in the face of nuanced reality.<p>Part of the role of government is to help ensure a competitive landscape, to enforce anti-trust and to regulate where necessary. That&#x27;s why they exist.')
