Growing up in the north, I had a strong bias against southern accents, which were almost exclusively treated with disdain by everyone around me. This disappeared after I had to struggle through learning to speak a language quite foreign from my own and where I was helped immensely by people who spoke varying degrees of accented English.<p>But I think this was also colored by my adult experience of being mocked in academic and professional setting for certain aspects of my speech (most often mispronunciations of foreign, historical or place names that I had only read in books, having had no other exposure to them from my working class family). This kind of mockery always seemed so stupid and low that to hold on to it in anyway myself became repulsive.')
