If people are below the poverty line you can raise UBI, but you don&#x27;t have to put your thumb on the scales of the labor market.<p>But to not just re-create welfare, you have to completely dissolve the tie between UBI and taxable income. And to do that effectively you boost the marginal rates above your cut off point.<p>You could plot that to show how much the UBI was a net increase to your annual income and then design the tax rates to have it be effectively 100% reclaimed as tax after $400K AGI or what ever number you pick.')
