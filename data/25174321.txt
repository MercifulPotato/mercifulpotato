Item(by='jandrewrogers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606011277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25173963, text='The US is a big place, I think many people situated in tech cities do not appreciate just how inexpensive it is to live in many parts of the country. Cost of living can be surprisingly low in flyover country. I know many people that get on pretty adequately with a family on much less than the median US household income. Definitely not living large but also a reasonable if basic standard of living. Wages are relative to a region.<p>If $20k&#x2F;year per worker is &quot;poverty&quot;, and to be clear it is a relatively poor wage in the US, it would be interesting to apply the same analysis to European countries. It gets uncomfortably close to the median income in countries that we typically don&#x27;t view as particularly poor. Americans have anomalously high incomes, even those below the median.')
