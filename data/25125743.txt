OK, it is possible to get your friends to fund you after you describe the innovative idea, then perhaps it&#x27;s possible to get an Angel to invest into your uber after you explain the losing business is only temporary to capture the market and the ultimate goal is a self-driving taxi.<p>Wishing for self-driving cars is easy, building them not so much. But Pizza delivery unicorn based on some arbitrage?? Come on, at least develop a fleet of food trucks in which the pizza is cooked along the way. \nBaking a Pizza takes 6mins, add 2-3 for preparation so the order can be prepared along the way. No need to get back to the restaurant. This gives you 2x efficiency of the delivery person ($15&#x2F;h). Equipping a restaurant is probably $200k+, a food truck closer to $50k which gives 4x capex efficiency. Perhaps in the future the pizza can be made by a robot saving you one person (50%) of the personnel. There is room for efficiency.<p>Here in Europe during Lockdown take away pizza was €2 cheaper, around €8 instead of €12+. I cannot imagine how someone selling it cheaper is anything but a pyramid scheme &#x2F; attempt to corner the market.')
