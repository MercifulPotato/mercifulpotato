Item(by='ur-whale', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607900137, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25411123, text='&gt;So if literally every known billionaire in the world decided to convert $1 billion of their assets to BTC<p>Not what I said.<p>The reason I mentioned the number of billionaires in the world was to point out the magnitude of money sloshing around in the existing financial system and that it would take <i>much less</i> than nation states giving up on their currency for BTC to do (yet another) 10x.<p>&gt;its price isn&#x27;t dictated by two dudes swapping one BTC at an absurd multiple of what everyone else is willing to sell for either.<p>I guess making a point by pushing it to the limit isn&#x27;t something that is going to work here, so let me rephrase: the fact that Bezos&#x27;s net worth is calculated by multiplying the number of AMZN shares he owns by the current price of the share is a completely unrealistic way of doing things.<p>Were he to <i>actually</i> convert all of his AMZN shares to cold hard cash, he would be left with a small fraction of what he currently weighs.<p>In the same fashion, the BTC market very much sensitive to liquidity: a very large portion of coins were acquired when the price was much lower, and the actual market depth of BTCUSD is - I suspect - rather shallow and it certainly wouldn&#x27;t take &quot;every known billionaire ...&quot; to move it up 10x.')
