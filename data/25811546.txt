However, as interesting a shrimp are, my experience with ghost shrimp was that they were inexpensive, looked lively, and then died suddenly within weeks. She speaks of red cherry shrimp, which I&#x27;ve not found locally. I recommend her site[5] which has a lot of information about Planted Aquariums along with the latest corrections for her book; she also describes how she bred guppies in 12 gallon plastic tubs without any filtration or aeration[6] outdoors 15.5C-25.5Â°F.<p>[1]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00DB94K5I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00DB94K5I</a><p>[2]- <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theaquariumwiki.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Walstad_method" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theaquariumwiki.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Walstad_method</a><p>[3]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fishlore.com&#x2F;aquariumfishforum&#x2F;threads&#x2F;setting-up-3-gallon-walstad-bowl.297688&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fishlore.com&#x2F;aquariumfishforum&#x2F;threads&#x2F;setting-u...</a><p>[4]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dianawalstad.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;shrimprcs2017.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dianawalstad.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;shrimprcs20...</a><p>[5]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dianawalstad.com&#x2F;aquariums&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dianawalstad.com&#x2F;aquariums&#x2F;</a><p>[6]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dianawalstad.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;small-scale-breeding-aug2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dianawalstad.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;small-scale...</a>')
