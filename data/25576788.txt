The cost and the software aren&#x27;t there yet, but it&#x27;s only a matter of time. Flexibility and time to market will beat purpose-built robots in many cases once the cost comes down. Many purpose-built factories will disappear. Local, distributed generalist factories will spring up, staffed by robots. Drones and autonomous vehicles will deliver &quot;hand-crafted&quot; products directly to customers.<p>With autonomous vehicles poised to replace the most common job in the majority of U.S. states -- truck driver -- we&#x27;re on the verge of massive systemic changes. That&#x27;s at best. At worst, with economic and political tensions already high, we&#x27;ll get violence and bloodshed on a global scale.')
