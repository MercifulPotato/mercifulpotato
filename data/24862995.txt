Microsoft have root access to your system and can do an update whenever they want. There has been a back and forth about how much the end user can push back, but obviously Microsoft wins that battle. This is definitely a security benefit - but it also means you cannot check out the behavior of the system and have confidence about the behavior of the system tomorrow.<p>So the answer is no.
