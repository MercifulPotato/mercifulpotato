The only reason it exists (and, unfortunately prevalent) is because a number of popular technologies (Java, Javascript, Windows) thought they were being smart when building their Unicode support on UCS-2, and now here we are.<p>Now, the issue of clipping or reversing strings is a problem not just because of encoding. It simply doesn&#x27;t work even with UTF-32. You&#x27;re going to end up cutting off combining characters for example. Manipulating strings is very difficult, and software should never really try to do it unless they know what they are doing, and even then you need to use a library to help you do it.')
