The old Sony CRT reference monitors were weird with their calibration as well. Had a 32&quot; 16x9 HD monitor that had the mass of a dying star. It was in a dedicated film xfer&#x2F;color correction bay. Once installed, it never moved until we moved to a new location. Once in the new location, it had some weird anomalies even after the typical calibration steps. Our Sony tech realized that we had changed the orientation of the monitor 90 degrees. His explanation was that the earth&#x27;s magnetic fields were the culprit. Rotating the monitor 90 degrees made the issue go away. Don&#x27;t remember ultimately what the fix was, but it was fixable.')
