The visual cues only work temporarily until the software gets retrained and it’s dangerous to test if the drones are using updates to defeat the anti-AI t-shirts and whatnot.<p>Drones are pretty expensive (few thousand). So if they can be destroyed for $1, that’s probably the only way to really stop them.<p>Slingshots and shotguns are probably too easy to use and get away with it. But maybe some cheap drone, autonomous, that just flies into the expensive drones and crashes them.')
