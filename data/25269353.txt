And it includes at least some technical detail that paint a picture of what the service actually does (if it does this).<p>To answer your question bluntly: Yes, it is possible to be much more descriptive and still simple with an opener.<p>As it currently stands, I had to go to the FAQ to see an off-handed note about CloudFormation.
