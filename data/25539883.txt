I was not a Nintendo fanboy before. I had a Wii back in the day, but it was mostly a gimmick, never substituted the PC as the &quot;serious gaming platform&quot; for me. BOTW is one of these rare games that was so attractive that I bought the entire console just to play it. I am aware of and recognize its flaws, but I have over 200 hours in this game, so obviously it can&#x27;t be all that bad. Heck, I watched a BOTW speedrunner on Twitch just yesterday. The community around that game is still going strong.')
