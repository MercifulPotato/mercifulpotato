I usually take the rematch because I can often win the second game too, Iâ€™ll guess 15% of the time.  Almost always the better player is trying an opening trap which is dubious but will cause me to loose in the first 10 moves if I miss it.  So I just make really sure to look for tactics extra carefully in the opening.  If I survive I can often win.  And if I loose I get to learn a new opening trap. :)')
