But tben, they make it 2xM+N by forbidding the use of their LSPs in other editors - which, if done by everyone would put as back at MxN.<p>This is hypocritical behavior, and it does remind people of EE&amp;E which was Microsoft’s explicit policy in the past. It’s not an exact repeat, but it does seem to rhyme.')
