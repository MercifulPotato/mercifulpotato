There&#x27;s no need to think about &#x27;algebraic effects&#x27; or anything like that. Your event handlers returns effects which is data. That&#x27;s it.<p>The world moves forward via<p><pre><code>    Event dispatch\n    Event handling\n    Effect handling\n    Query\n    View\n    DOM\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s about enough complexity to deal with manipulation of a tree structure and getting some callbacks.<p>At least - given I&#x27;ve followed basically all JS frameworks-du-jour since jQuery- this is the simplest model that allows for complex UIs I encountered. \nIt certainly is opinionated and not completely pure - by design - but oh so sweet to work with.')
