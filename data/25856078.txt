I, personally have never succeeded in figuring out how to install drivers separately. I doubt there actually is a way; or if there is, that anybody can figure it out just from what is published. Why they are asked to try is an enduring mystery.<p>Instead, I tell them to install the Debian flavor of Mint, which publishes installers that, y&#x27;know, <i>install</i>. Once Debian-flavor Mint installation is finished, you have a Debian system that works.<p>Most people don&#x27;t ask me, and install Ubuntu instead, which they always seem to think works, although it always works badly, for me. Driving people away to Ubuntu does neither them nor Debian any good.')
