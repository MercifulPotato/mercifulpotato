Always got the impression that PCs, Macs and Nintendo was bigger in the US.<p>Growing up in Norway in the 80s I remember the Commodore 64 and  Amiga really dominated the home computer scene. We used to read computer magazines from Sweden, so it must have been big there too.<p>Pretty much nobody used Macs. Schools used a home grown Norwegian computer system called Tiki, with these odd keyboards with round orange keys.<p>I had the impression that Macs where much more prevalent in the US due to school usage. My American wife has fond memories of playing Nintendo games as a kid. But for me it was all about Amiga.<p>It was really sad that it died. It was a really enabling system. I compare to people who used Nintendo and we learned so much more. I learned to do Basic programming on the Amiga. There was even this Game making Basic called AMOS which as really ahead of its time.<p>Using Deluxe Paint to draw was amazing. I learned so much about colors and shading from that. Then there was Assembly programming which was actually kind of nice on the Amiga.<p>But before all that I remember making things like bootable disks with menus where you could select preferred program.')
