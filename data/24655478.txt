It&#x27;s a trap. You can check for initialization failure (&quot;remember to call isObjectOkay()&quot; or something like that) but you&#x27;re basically hosed if a destructor fails.<p>No, exceptions are not the answer. NONE of the C++ projects I&#x27;ve worked on in the last 30+ years have used those in production. Exceptions are far, far worse trap.<p>It&#x27;s funny that the teams across half a dozen companies I&#x27;ve been in have independently come up with just about the same set of guidelines about C++ features. It&#x27;s almost like some of those features were bad ideas. :-)')
