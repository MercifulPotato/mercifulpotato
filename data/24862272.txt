The general approach, as I recall it, was, &quot;we can&#x27;t do anything about it, but it doesn&#x27;t kill too many people, and those at risk can get flu and pneumonia vaccinations.&quot;<p>And herd immunity for measles is due to vaccination. If measles were a novel disease, you would be seeing lockdowns that make San Quentin look open and free.')
