Wasn&#x27;t my most productive year at uni.<p>Anyone remembers DBD_Jinx? For very long the only western dude to compete with the Koreans in 1vs1. However he also confessed, that he had partly sacrificed his private life for it.<p>I trained a lot. I trained hours a day on 2X speed hunting, build order. I played under many smurf accounts, to then foster my primary account(s). MrFixIt forums as well.<p>I played 1vs1, team games, I played DM as well.<p>After intense 2 years (time zone shifts as well, many sleepless nights) I decided to never ever play online in a community again in order to prevent my lazy&#x2F;fun loving side to be sucked in again in clans, games etc.<p>No Warcraft nothing. To this day I keep the vow. Only game I play still from time to time is AoE II: DE.')
