Item(by='pedrocr', descendants=None, kids=[25978220], score=None, time=1612094369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25978140, text='&gt; There is unfortunately no way to do this that doesn&#x27;t break down in mixed-DPI situations because of the rounding issues.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been able to explain then. There&#x27;s strictly less rounding than today this way, Because from the point of view of Wayland every window is at native resolution and it&#x27;s up to the client to scale.<p>&gt; To be clear, this is if you configured your output scaling to be 2&#x2F;3. 133px is absolutely not correct there.<p>I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re saying. 133px is correct, just like 134px is correct. The way WMs and compositors work is they split the screen between windows at integer coordinates. That&#x27;s how it works at 1x and there&#x27;s no reason to not work like that at 1.5x. They&#x27;re completely independent issues.')
