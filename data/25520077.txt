I find that unlikely, given the stated purpose is “ intended to more easily identify sex offenders, unauthorized school staff or other adults that might be dangerous” since literally every school I’ve been to since 1996 requires ID checks of every adult entering the building, and volunteers get fingerprinted and run through criminal databases.<p>So now you have a system that can’t clearly accomplish it’s stated purpose, but does have serious potential side effects.<p>Now I also agree in strong local control of schools and think the state should have done the study before enacting the moratorium, but as a parent I wouldn&#x27;t support it at my school &#x2F; district as presented in the article.')
