I had taken programming classes in C++, and had to use Visual Studio for that. I declined to use BlueJ, and decided to find something like Visual Studio. I looked at Netbeans and the predecessor of Eclipse, and eventually found out about Intellij IDEA. I was very happy and used it on a trial basis.<p>Whenever I&#x27;ve had to use program Java, I&#x27;ve always gravitated towards using Intellij IDEA. \nIf I were programming Java full-time, I&#x27;d definitely buy a license for it.')
