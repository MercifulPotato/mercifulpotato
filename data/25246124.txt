I hope we will have multiple implementations of the spec. The specs also have to evolve with time.<p>Last decade, systemd had its fair share of criticism. But it provided a consistent API to run &quot;Compute Units&quot; locally. K8s can benefit from the same principles to manage &quot;Compute Pods&quot; across the cluster. The concepts of promise theory [1] provide interesting control loop co-ordination.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Promise_theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Promise_theory</a>')
