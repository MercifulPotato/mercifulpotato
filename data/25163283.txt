Item(by='slx26', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605896744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25162379, text='Lots of people enjoy &quot;philosophical&quot; discussions and certainly derive value from them. What they might not like is the &quot;philosophy&quot; that&#x27;s continually throwing around author names, complicated words, and kinda leaves the average person feeling stupid talking around &quot;proper philosophers&quot;. If you want to educate people, start with the layman explanations, and only at the end annotate the complicated words. It&#x27;s not like people don&#x27;t understand the general concept of things like &quot;utilitarianism&quot;, it&#x27;s simply that they don&#x27;t use that word in their day to day, so they don&#x27;t associate the concept to the word.<p>As to your other comment, well, that included a rather oversimplified example of utilitarianism, which many utilitarians will not even share. It&#x27;s very easy to make naive utilitarian calculations, and in many cases there&#x27;s too much uncertainty to even make calculations. You can only say that <i>naive utilitarianism</i> is easier than deontology. No offense intended, but maybe some people were downvoting you for this.')
