The same thing, and that goes all the way back to thinking like SQL is not a bad language. Active Record has never taken the approach that like SQL is this sort of demon that needs to be exorcized. We&#x27;ve reduced the amount of SQL you need to write, on a regular basis, I don&#x27;t write a lot of SQL, we used to write more because Active Record didn&#x27;t do as much, but it&#x27;s not from this perspective of like we have to eradicate it. We do the conceptual compression but, when I look at something like, Ruby to JavaScript transpiling, there&#x27;s limited amounts of conceptual compression, &#x27;cause you still have to understand the model of what it outputs into and like, it&#x27;s just, it&#x27;s not for me - David Heinemeier hansson')
