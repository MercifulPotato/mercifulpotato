Last year the average hourly wage slipped to $17.50.&quot;<p>Guess what? Low-skill immigrants have a similar effect on local economies. But it doesn&#x27;t mean that those workers are &quot;stealing&quot; higher paid jobs. Seems likely to me that those higher paying jobs are still there, and it&#x27;s just the average that&#x27;s gone down.')
