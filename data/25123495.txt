You change the contents of your file, close the program and that&#x27;s it.  The boundary between &quot;changes in memory but not yet saved&quot; and &quot;changes already saved to the hard disk&quot; is an obsolescence and does not really make sense today.<p>Git adds not one, but three layers upon the idiotic save button.  Now, after saving your changes, you still need to add them, commit them, and finally push them.  What I want is less stuff, not more.  All my keypresses and states of files at any moment should be automatically saved forever, without action by my part.  Then, if I want, I can &quot;tag&quot; a state of the file tree to refer to it later.  The perfect git interface should only have two commands: &quot;git init&quot; and &quot;git tag&quot;.  All the rest of saving and bookkeeping could take place automatically.')
