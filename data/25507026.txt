What you see here aren&#x27;t regular mp4 screen recordings, but are DOM recordings where we record the entire DOM as it changes.<p>Here&#x27;s a Capsule video I just made of me using HN: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capsule.click&#x2F;playback&#x2F;1608649966705" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capsule.click&#x2F;playback&#x2F;1608649966705</a>\n(hint: try using your mouse in the demos)<p>All of the core code is written from scratch using basic JS functionality and browser APIs like MutationObserver among others.\nWhen you view the recording at a Capsule link, we replay all the recorded changes one-by-one right in your browser. So although it looks like it&#x27;s a regular mp4-type video due to the screen moving and such, it&#x27;s actually a <i>webpage</i> that &#x2F;looks&#x2F; like a video.<p>You can use your mouse, click, and scroll in the recordings. Note that all javascript is disabled automatically to ensure security. (And because we don&#x27;t want a recording or an action you make in a recording to continue to make network calls &#x2F; update data in a prod database in the original application).<p>(Note there are still bugs on some sites since there&#x27;s a whole bunch of weird things people do on the internet given how large the HTML spec is!)<p>I like to think of what we&#x27;re doing as providing &quot;DOM recording for the masses&quot;. People have really only used DOM recording for user tracking &#x2F; analytics (e.g. fullstory). But we wanted to make this same technology available for regular consumers to use.<p><i></i>I think this would be useful to you if:<i></i><p>- You&#x27;re a developer and want to share the webpages you make with others. My favorite part about Capsule is that it works on localhost! So you can actually instantly &quot;deploy&quot; a site that you&#x27;re working on locally and share it with a teammate to get instant feedback on it without needing to push it to a staging environment. It&#x27;s just 1 click with the chrome extension.<p>- You work on a frontend dev or design team at a company and want to show your teammates (engineers or designers) new features you&#x27;ve made in a better way than a regular image screenshot. Just send a Capsule link or attach it in a commit&#x2F;PR.<p>- You do web testing &#x2F; QA, and you want to have better bug reporting. In Capsule recordings, you have access to the direct HTML&#x2F;CSS of the webpage so you have all the info you need to reproduce bugs your users face!<p>--<p>Let us know what you use Capsule for! It&#x27;s totally free to use and we hope you find it useful.<p>P.S.
