Only 2% of those asked respond. Impossible to get a statistical sample with that. People are bad at predicting their future behavior. They are dishonest, they don&#x27;t know or just don&#x27;t want to tell you. There&#x27;s a huge class divide right now. The bigger the class divide the worse polls are historically. And we know they are wrong this time around. None of the early voting margins predicted have held close. Better predictors are Google trends, rally participation, and voter registrations.')
