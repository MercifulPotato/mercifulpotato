Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25585869, 25586563, 25586029], score=None, time=1609360328, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25585591, text='&quot; This entire election cycle is a mess&quot;<p>To be clear - the election is <i>not a mess</i>.<p>Even though we don&#x27;t have &#x27;state ID&#x27; the processes overall are legit on the whole.<p>There is no systematic fraud.<p>It <i>appears</i> as a mess because of the messaging of the President.<p>That said: there are obviously antiquated and non-standardized problems - literally just yesterday, Stacey Abrahams sister, a Georgia Judge, had to rule on ballots being thrown out. It&#x27;s politicized.<p>So having ID would not so much make elections more fair (they are effectively fair), but it would give more confidence in elections.<p>Also - the genie may be out of the bottle and we may be in a new era where a) people try to actually cheat and b) losers of elections refuse to concede based on lies.<p>So it might be a good time to modernize with ID, and it would help with those problems.<p>....<p>It &#x27;needs to be free&#x27; because the some will otherwise believe it&#x27;s voter suppression.<p>Having a $10 payment would actually theoretically suppress some people from voting. In practice, I don&#x27;t think that would be the case, but it&#x27;s enough to blow it up.<p>Homeless people are still &#x27;citizens&#x27; - and &#x27;citizenship&#x27; is not based on whether or not you have $10. Which is a fair argument (even through pragmatically a side show, because you need to have an address to vote already today).<p>Citizenship is a right not a privilege ... so just make it free.<p>Politically, they could make it an extension of SS - it&#x27;s just &#x27;SS with a photo&#x27; kind of thing.')
