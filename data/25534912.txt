Google runs .dev.<p>I read the contract carefully, there is nothing preventing Google from increasing the price to 10,000 or 100,0000. It’s my biggest fear.<p>My only hope is that Google wouldn’t do it from a PR perspective, which I think is a safe and fair assumption.<p>The real worry is they sell the rights to .dev to GoDaddy or somebody else, because then I am screwed.<p>Google is one of the best things to happen to domain registrations. I highly recommend them. Even though I’m contractually exposed, to date, Google have been conducting themselves very well in the domain registration market.<p>One of the great things about .com is that there is a contractual cap on price increases. However the domain I bought would cost in the 10s of millions if it was a .com; so at 1,000 per year, it’s a good deal for the .dev version as long as they don’t significantly increase it (I’m okay with 10% per year increases).')
