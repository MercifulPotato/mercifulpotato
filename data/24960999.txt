The software devs had near complete freedom of scheduling, the sysadmins had a little less, and the help desk had almost none since they needed to be there when the people they were helping were. Everyone had as much flexibility as their job allowed and it worked great. It sucked that the help desk didn&#x27;t have the flexibility, but they understood why, and I tried to find ways to provide other perks. Plus on the flip side they&#x27;d never find themselves trying to resolve an outage at 1 in the morning on a Sunday.')
