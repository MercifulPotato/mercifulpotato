Its amazing, I have been on reddit forever and was just curious as to how it was on the front page for awhile.  This is a pretty good explanation, I don&#x27;t know why I got down voted, honestly curious about the Hacker news process of what makes it to the front page vs other things.  I was stoked to hear about Penrose winning the Nobel and shocked it was on the second page vs this story.  And now an article Penrose has co-authored is on the top spot! Thanks for the solid response!  And RIP to EVH too, I saw VH with my pops years ago, he saw VH open for Black Sabbath back in the day and said they destroyed Black Sabbath! Madness!')
