It’s like going from 80% to 99% just to leave off the last 1%.<p>Without going all the way with server push, the logic behind the transition from http1.1&#x2F;tls&#x2F;tcp to http3 seems a bit dubious to me. If they aren’t going to go all the way, things already worked well enough IMO. Seems like google is just arbitrarily deciding what they want the web stack to look like.')
