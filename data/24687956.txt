Long story short: sitting at a floor table and on the couch all day was causing issues with my back and hamstrings.<p>I did look into the AltWork setup mentioned. At $7000 (or $4500 for manual option), it&#x27;s quite expensive but not that bad if amortized over a 20 year period of working 8 hours a day. Investment in long-term health is worth it if the product works as it should and lasts the expected amount of time.<p>Aside from my wife not wanting it in our apartment (I understand), there isn&#x27;t enough evidence that zero gravity workstations improve health versus just a good ergonomic chair (ie. an adjustable chair that fits your body) and desk (adjustable and gets low enough to support 90Â° elbow angle without hitting your legs). In all cases, one needs to take breaks to stretch and move around, not to mention daily exercise.<p>Went with a HM Embody (armless) chair and IKEA Skarsta hand crank desk instead; zero regrets and I wish I got them earlier (especially the Embody)!')
