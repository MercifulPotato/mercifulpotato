For all the popular commercial TLDs there are multiple commercial registrars. The registrars have to abide by rules set by the registry (since if they did not the registry can just stop them providing any services) even if they are not under the same legal jurisdiction as the registry.<p>For the gTLDs the rules for this playing field are set by ICANN. It would like these rules to apply everywhere, but the ccTLDs are assigned to sovereign entities, and like a two year old, sovereign entities do not take kindly to being told what to do.')
