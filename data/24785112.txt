Item(by='yurishimo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602738174, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777442, text='Yeah, I&#x27;ve seen the ideal fit for WP sites shrinking over the past 5 years. In my mind, the ideal fit is a business who needs some custom workflow&#x2F;development that isn&#x27;t easily attainable on the hosted platforms, but going full custom dev is also too expensive. $10M&#x2F;yr business or less essentially.<p>Granted, in most of the world, that&#x27;s still a huge swath of businesses, but most of them realistically don&#x27;t need a heavily customized online presence. Professional services are a great example of potentially higher revenue businesses that don&#x27;t need a fully custom web presence. In competitive markets, I&#x27;ve seen plumbing firms&#x2F;electricians&#x2F;pest control all compete for SEO, thus spending more on web dev services, but they&#x27;re the minority.<p>I work for a company that specializes in E-Commerce, with a narrower focus on high performance WooCommerce and custom Shopify development. We&#x27;ve seen some enterprise level customers start on WP and Woo for an MVP and then spend half a decade working to get off of it to their own in-house stack, or to transition to a more managed platform like Shopify. Each one has it&#x27;s ups and downs, but by no means is any one a silver bullet. It largely depends on what your business requirements are and the expectations of your customers.<p>Selling a dozen individual SKUs with limited customization? Shopify is fantastic and has an extremely optimized checkout flow.<p>Need more customizations to the checkout or you want to create extremely customized user experiences for interactions like Add-to-cart? WP might be a better fit since you can control the entire stack. But WP doesn&#x27;t scale as easily as Shopify (though it can scale, that&#x27;s our job) so you&#x27;ll pay a premium to develop the platform to handle that scale.<p>Outside E-commerce, I see a lot of potential for WP in the higher ed space still. Community colleges and trade schools especially as you can work towards a unified branding effort, while still providing customization and flexibility for teachers. I know a few colleges that keep a small staff of less than 5 people, who manage web development and maintenance for decent sized institutions.<p>All that I guess to say, is that WP still has a place, but that it&#x27;s shrinking in scope, despite the increase in actual usage numbers. Only time will tell if the trend stays positive for another decade, or if we start to see a slip as other offerings continue to improve and mature.')
