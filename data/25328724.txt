I&#x27;ve never shown (nor seen another instructor show) a two pointer implementation for list traversal, except perhaps as an example of bad practice (probably by someone who doesn&#x27;t understand the syntactic sugar of the -&gt; operator). &quot;Every pointer to node is a list, including the trivial case of a null pointer being an empty list&quot; is the way I was taught in CS101 in the early 80s, including a one-pointer implementation of this algorithm in Pascal.<p>I suspect this might a case similar to that of the &quot;Waterfall Method&quot;, where we have this unexamined belief that in olden times or academia they just weren&#x27;t capable of comprehending really obvious things. CompSci instructors, and most of their students, are quite capable of recognizing that two pointers aren&#x27;t needed, if only because every algorithms textbook they&#x27;ve ever read discusses it.<p>I think that this might be like Bubble Sort: it&#x27;s discussed in class as a way of illustrating a point. In students&#x27; fuzzy memories of school, they remember that bubble sort and 2-pointer traversal were taught, but they forget that they were taught only to show why selection sort and single pointer (&quot;look ahead&quot;) traversal are better algorithms.<p>As a side note: I don&#x27;t like the &quot;elegant&quot; version&#x27;s use of double indirection.  It&#x27;s not necessary if you return a pointer instead of void, which is also nice because you can treat calls to your list functions as lists themselves and chain them together. It also allows you to avoid warts like \n`p = &amp;(*p)-&gt;next;` \nat the modest cost of needing `p=remove(p,t)` instead of `remove(p,t)`.<p>Finally, the use of two structs is unnecessary. IntList is just a wrapper around a pointer to IntListNode.  Why not just use a naked pointer to IntListNode like the gods intended?')
