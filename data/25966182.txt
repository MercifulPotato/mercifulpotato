I thought Outlook on Windows was a crappy, crashy POS application, then I used it on Mac. It actually hinders my productivity. There&#x27;s not even an option to manually run mail rules that you create. I guess you just have to wait for that e-mail to come in again to see if you set up your rules properly.
