If you dole them out like candy they lose their power, and since an apology&#x27;s power comes from your dignity, it follows that you lose your dignity.<p>So when do you apologize? An apology is great when you&#x27;ve hurt someone by making a mistake - which I would define as something you wouldn&#x27;t do knowing how it would turn out. You&#x27;ve made a deliberate decision that in hindsight was an error of judgement. Hopefully that doesn&#x27;t happen often.<p>What does happen often is a decision you make that hurt someone&#x27;s feelings - maybe you declined to merge a pull request because the patch wasn&#x27;t good, or you skipped a colleague&#x27;s wedding because you were sick; in those cases you can maybe make it up to them or explain, but don&#x27;t apologize - beyond the &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I couldn&#x27;t come, but I had a fever&quot; one-liner, which is more sympathy than an apology.')
