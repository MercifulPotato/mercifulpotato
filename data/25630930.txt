For workers pay is kept higher, benefits stay active between jobs, and benefits stay unchanged between jobs at different companies.  Companies also gain the ability to support surges&#x2F;drops in manning requirements (without ruining life&#x27;s of workers), and know workers have a minimum level of training (along with that training not leaving workers a debt addled depressive). I also see the best workers rising through the ranks, and bad ones either never actually entering the union or quitting when they realize they&#x27;re not going anywhere.<p>Not every union strangles their company like automotive unions.  Though those unions start to look better looking at nonunion companies like Tesla which somehow manages to pay their workers less, in one of the most expensive areas in the world, and maintaining an accident rate that would shut a union shop down.<p>Also it makes sense that Google would fight unions.  Since the current implementation of unions for SV companies has been Kickstarter.  And that union mostly exists to drive profit to their competitors by choosing what is allowed on Kickstarter.  Something like that for Google would just end up making an easy paper trail for a prosecutor to follow for SV platform bias.')
