Any sort of recognition there are center right or moderate conservatives appears to have been cancelled.<p>Regarding extremists, It&#x27;s the old story - ban it and it will go underground. Free speech is always better and is also a cornerstone of western democracy. The irony of Parler having to be hosted in fascist Russia is extreme and embarrassing for the western world.')
