Filled out a form online and uploaded my 2020 usa tax return proving my income. You don&#x27;t even need a job lined up. 100x easier than moving to the USA.<p>It took about 4-5 hours of my time and 8 weeks of waiting for the government to approve it.<p>I got really lucky. I had a friend of a friend who I moved in with. He found his apartment through an agent who speaks English. Send me an email if you end up making the plunge and I&#x27;ll connect you with our agent.<p>If you&#x27;re considering a similar move: just do it. For real. It&#x27;s not going to get any better any time soon internationally. It&#x27;s easily the best decision I could have made. If you&#x27;re worried about money either get a remote dev job or even just teach English here, there&#x27;s a million schools around. It&#x27;s incredibly cheap to live here compared to metro USA ($3000 USD&#x2F;month gets you an upper class life, all in, including dining out, gym, drinks etc. You&#x27;ll probably spend less than that if you even remotely budget). You can live a great life as a single person on even less than that.')
