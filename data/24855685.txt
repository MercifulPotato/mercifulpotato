They purchased PDI, had been doing CG since 1980. They maintained a proprietary CG pipeline for decades and integrated multiple locations. This was during a time when the industry went from NURBS to sub-d, from basic direct lighting to global illumination to path-tracing--mostly using software written in-house.

At scales only a handful of other facilities were doing CG at, while competing for innovation, scale, and quality.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Katzenberg and Whitman courted when she was at HP and they were DreamWorks&#x27; &quot;technology partner.&quot; They worked together on things like a price-friendly color-accurate LCD monitor and the Halo video conferencing stuff.<p>I know in the years before DreamWorks was sold to Universal there were Skunk Works projects working on phone apps.
