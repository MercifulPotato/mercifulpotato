The priority is always compromise and getting along, which results in design by committee, tons of wasted time, and generally low quality output. Of course, they don&#x27;t say this explicitly, but actions speak louder than words.<p>I&#x27;m not in a place where I can leave my current job, and I realize that this is prevalent basically everywhere.<p>The issue is, I find myself essentially constantly walking on eggshells, unsure of when the situation calls for directness vs. being agreeable at all costs. This constantly delays projects and saps my energy, which negatively impacts the company, my career, and my happiness.<p>Are there any books HN can recommend that discuss this at high level? I&#x27;m not expecting a solution â€” but I&#x27;m hoping there is reading material out there that will help me understand and navigate this better.')
