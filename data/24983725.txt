The layer deduplication section of the spec does state that the same blob MUST be shared between repositories. The manifest digest endpoint suffers from a similar ambiguity.<p>In any case, all I wanted to say is that it would have been quite possible to implement docker registry as a purely content addressed store + a key&#x2F;value layer that binds human readable names to it. It&#x27;s almost, but not quite that.')
