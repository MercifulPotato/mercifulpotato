Everyone wanted to find the Spring equivalent for Go (or Django, Ruby on Rails, etc) when it doesn’t actually exist. That’s by design.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s &quot;by design&quot;. Go, by itself, doesn&#x27;t give much more than e.g. Java gives with its Servlet base libs, etc. And yet Java has Spring, and some popular framework could very well emerge as the &quot;THE&quot; framework for Go.<p>Whether that framework would conform to the stdlib interfaces &#x2F; middleware is another question. It might not, if it&#x27;s compelling enough (there are lots of popular Java non-servlet API conforming frameworks, e.g. Play, Vert.x, etc).<p>It&#x27;s only because of fragmentation (and small still market, with lots of NIH) that one hasn&#x27;t emerged as such, not some special Go design. Many&#x2F;most Go-ers like to keep it simple, so they don&#x27;t adopt any big framework lib (after all, if they didn&#x27;t keep it simple, they wouldn&#x27;t be using Go).')
