If you want to use nano or vscode or whatever, there shouldn&#x27;t be any social pressure.<p>I think it comes down to how people like to use their tools and how they like to shape their working environment. I&#x27;ve gotten my vim&#x2F;linux machines into a place where editing code is comfortable, and I&#x27;d love to share it with people, but I understand that they may not want to do it. And that&#x27;s fine!<p>Use what works for you to get your work done!')
