I’m very surprised, despite all the negative commentary and controversy surrounding web components, that Google has remained loyal to their Polymer project and even developed it further into LitElement. I think what happens is that Google will bring an OSS project to market and then after a few years the community takes over, so there’s an illusion of “abandonware”. But it’s hard to say whether Google just moved on to something else first, for example from GWT to Angular, and then the community took over or if it’s the other way around. So there’s this implication that Google does abandon their projects or at least stops funding them even when that’s not really the case, but the implication alone almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. In fact, at work I suggested we even do a project with LitElement over React and the reason the team went with React was because they thought Google would abandon the project. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
