It&#x27;s excellent provided you accept its limitations. It really is a single use device for reading PDFs. That said, I also use it for handwritten notes (easy to export as PDF) and for presenting on-line (convert slides to PDF, use the screen viewer and you can do live annotations--great for remote lecturing).')
