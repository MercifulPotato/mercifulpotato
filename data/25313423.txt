There are special embedded low-power chips (eg TI 16 bit MSP), but they are NOT running Linux, and they never will. They couldn&#x27;t reach their power targets running Linux, not even close. So I&#x27;m not sure obsolete designs being manufactured on old process node being kept alive is a net win. The special low-power cores are unaffected, as they are not running Linux anyway, and the ones that do aren&#x27;t particularly low power.<p>There is a sweet spot for low cost chips, I think its 40nm due to mask costs, manufacturing gets exponentially more expensive from that point on, which is the reason they haven&#x27;t upgraded. Anyone knows if there are signs this cost is coming down over time?')
