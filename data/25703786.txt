I prefer to omit things like &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;, &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;, &lt;&#x2F;td&gt; and &lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;, because it takes less effort (and I hate text editor plugins that automatically add closing delimiters of any form, because they <i>always</i> do the wrong thing a meaningful fraction of the time in a way that I have to think about, more than if I just type the delimiters myself, though an accurate “insert at the cursor whatever is needed to close the last thing” shortcut might be handy), and reduces visual noise.<p>I also normally omit quotes on attribute values if correct to do so.<p>I mostly do these things when working on things of my own, when I know no one else needs to worry about them. When working on things others will touch, I don’t drop quite as many closing tags, and will normally leave attribute values quoted.')
