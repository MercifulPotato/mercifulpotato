I was young little shit,so naturally, paying for the internet in the student dorm was beyond me. The entire campus is scattered all over the city, and more or less everyone was using this internal chat on the LAN( great to meet fellow students, especially women,as it was in my case). So it took me a few days to figure out that all I had to do to reach the Internet is to use any user&#x27;s, that was on the chat, MAC address. There was at least 100 people connected at any given time,so plenty to choose from. As soon as I would give myself someone&#x27;s MAC, they&#x27;d be kicked off the internet. It was glorious.I was little shit on wings! Anyway, one day, two,very very very pissed off people walk into our room( there were 3 of us living there). One looks like sys admin(he was),the other,who had a baseball bat, was the muscles.They ask to check everyone&#x27;s PC.. he goes to my roommate first... It took me seconds to realise what&#x27;s going on,so while the admin is checking my roommate&#x27;s PC,I quickly try to change my PC name... And I run out of time before he goes on my PC...He goes mental... It&#x27;s you!!! I&#x27;ve been trying to find you for nearly 6 months, checked so many rooms and buildings!!! I thought his head would pop.. The muscle man thinks it&#x27;s an opportunity to hit me. Well, here I come..I put on idiot&#x27;s play. I  explain  them that I&#x27;m clueless about computers, the room is more or less 24&#x2F;7 party place with 20 people visiting just last night(not true,my roommates were calm). This goes on for 5 min or so,and they kind of believe and leave us, even though not quite satisfied with the outcome. Loved every single second of it..Still Karma exists,so fast forward 15 years later and I have to have very difficult conversations with people at work, who try to cheat the system...I became the sys admin.. of sorts..')
