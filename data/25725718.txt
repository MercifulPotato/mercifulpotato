Item(by='lliamander', descendants=None, kids=[25725767], score=None, time=1610349221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725642, text='&gt; I&#x27;m sorry if the conservatives can&#x27;t understand the difference between BLM people yelling in the streets, and Trump people searching the capitol for senators and representatives to stop a Constitutionally mandated vote count.<p>That is manifestly not the comparison being made.  Antifa and BLM rioters burned down apartment buildings with people still inside in Kenosha.  Over the summer, dozens of people were killed and there was billions of property damage (that&#x27;s peoples homes and livelihoods, not just &quot;stuff&quot;).  And Democratic politicians - including the VP-elect - provided bail for these criminals.  Many democratic DAs in cities like Portland simply refused to press charges.<p>That being said, I abhor that Capitol police were attacked and that there were people who breached the Capitol with violent intent.  But the deplatformings have gone well beyond the fringe few who actually engaged or promoted violence.')
