This is a shit model. And I want to apologize in advance to any Wish employees that may be here and that are surely doing hard work to build the logistics and consumer layers of this business.<p>This is a business built on top of cheap Chinese goods, subsidized shipping and low customer expectations. High transaction volume with very low margins, and totally exposed to the winds of international trade policy.<p>This is just a fancy wrapper on top of AliExpress which is honestly superior when it comes to buy crap. In AliExpress you get way more insight into what you&#x27;re buying and its quality, shipping times, shipping rates, etc. In Wish you don&#x27;t and you will most likely get the most low tier quality product.<p>I hope that an IPO can bring more discipline into their business and help them move to a more sustainable and innovative model.')
