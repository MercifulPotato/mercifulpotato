It&#x27;s more common in academia because you can run containers without privileges which is nice in HPC environments. The containers themselves are simple immutable flat files that can be easily copied around, backed up, etc. There&#x27;s also no system daemon. It&#x27;s nice knowing everything you need for your container system exists in the containers themselves and a single singularity executable. No volumes, remembering to append --rm to avoid dangling containers, wondering where the actual images are stored, etc. Of course there are tradeoffs but I like them for certain use cases.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sylabs.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sylabs.io&#x2F;</a>')
