Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602113083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24713163, text='&gt; You think it&#x27;s ok to sell the set that kills people because they have a set thats save people.<p>Only if all three of the following are true:<p>A) they both affect the same risk factor  (Just because they&#x27;re &quot;separate&quot; features and sold separately doesn&#x27;t make this false.  And the way the autopilot is so intertwined with the others, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really fair to say they are truly separate features.  They build upon each other.)<p>B) it&#x27;s impossible to run the dangerous one without the safety one<p>C) running both is safer than running neither<p>If you want to make cars safer, then you should be insisting that all cars be safer.  The car that kills people because it lacks <i>any</i> of these electronics is just as bad.<p>To elaborate on (A), with <i>these particular features</i> I don&#x27;t see the car as causing distinct people to die compared to who it&#x27;s saving.  It&#x27;s not trading between different groups of people in any meaningful way.  It&#x27;s just a single number of how many people die per mile.  With <i>other</i> features you could get into that moral dilemma.  With <i>these</i> features I don&#x27;t think it does.')
