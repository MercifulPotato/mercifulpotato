Also, this is comparing a car that&#x27;s been on the market for a year and a half and is delivered continuously, with a launch of a new model that mostly consists of pre-orders being delivered.<p>Can&#x27;t really tell much from this graph, but it would be a nice surprise of the state of global EV development if Volkswagen managed to produce and sell the all the 300.000 ID.3s per year that they intend to by the end of 2021. That would put them on par with the current Model 3 production rate :-)')
