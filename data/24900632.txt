In primates, the fields would be harder to precisely interfere because of our thicker skulls and larger, more convoluted brains.<p>The level of c-fos activation in the Cell paper is also a little crazy--it seems way too intense to be correct, especially when compared against direct electrophysiological measurements.<p>It&#x27;s also not 100% clear that the high frequency fields do nothing--there are some claims that they have DC-like effects due to hysteresis in the neurons&#x27; membrane potentials.')
