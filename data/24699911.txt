The author received a report of an error, investigated, found that MySQL&#x27;s TIME did not match EF Core&#x27;s expectations for a timespan (hence causing the error):<p>&gt; for a brief moment I assumed the incorrection in this value was the hundreds of hours, as one could reasonably assume that maybe TIME values were capped at 24 hours, or that a different syntax was needed for values spanning multiple days<p>And then it turned out that wasn&#x27;t the case and they basically got nerd-sniped by the issue into finding out why the type had such weird bounds.')
