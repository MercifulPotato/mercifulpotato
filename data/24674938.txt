The big problem is: almost no one has desktop machines, where the software development happens, with ARM. Linus once commented that ARM doesn&#x27;t sell so well on the server, because developers are lacking desktop machines with that architectore. Apple Silicon could close that gap. You can develop with a Linux VM on AS, and deploy on ARM in the cloud.')
