I&#x27;d encourage you to have a good talk with your partner to see how each of you can give the other time to step away from parenting guilt-free. It&#x27;s important to find that, for both of you. It might sound silly to ask them to give you three hours to play D&amp;D, but it&#x27;s not. This is actually even more important to do if you feel you have a parenting situation that neither of you can step away from, not less.<p>I&#x27;ve been in the same situation with LoL and parenting in the past, letting down a 5v5 group, so I totally understand the hesitation. My problem was that I was trying to sneak in the time instead of being honest about what I wanted from myself and my family right then. It&#x27;s just about being more intentional with the time commitment. And recognizing that D&amp;D is <i>much</i> more forgiving of unexpected surprises than MOBAs are--the GM can always say you&#x27;re off running an errand or just roll for you if you have to leave during a combat. You&#x27;ll find many groups are forgiving of being a new parent.<p>Also, keep in mind non-parents also have things come up. It&#x27;s not just us. My D&amp;D session Saturday night cut short by two hours because the GM thought he had recovered from a Friday night migraine, and he suddenly realized how tired he was. We had been planning the night for two weeks but it was totally okay to wait and plan a time to resume. It&#x27;s all normal.')
