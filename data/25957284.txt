The word itself is great, but there was about 10 seconds of anything that resembled the levels of reality distortion that are now quite commonplace. I was mostly interested in the Soviet system of full-spectrum propaganda such as staging protests against themselves, which was only mentioned in passing. There was basically no common theme running through it, just a bunch of weird stuff that happened, mostly relating to US foreign policy, mostly blaming it on personalities of republican presidents. It felt like it was itself the sort of propaganda meant to distract from real fundamental problems and place blame on boogeymen, rather than an exposure of the same. I chose it for movie night with people I live with, which was embarrassing for me.')
