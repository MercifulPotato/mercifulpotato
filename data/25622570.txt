I can assure you that your standard computer components are not rated for century-scale use.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve always been on the fence with this ECC thing. For servers it&#x27;s vital because you need stability and security.<p>For desktops I think that for a long time it was fine without ECC. If I have to chose between having, say, 30% more RAM or avoid a potential crash once a year, I&#x27;ll probably take the additional RAM.<p>The problem is that now these problem can be exploited by malicious code instead of just merely happening because of cosmic rays. That&#x27;s the main argument in favour of ECC IMO, the rest is just a tradeoff to consider.')
