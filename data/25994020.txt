I used to take 100mg of HVMN &quot;Sprint&quot; pills as a test whether I had ADHD; it helped quite a bit. It didn&#x27;t make me jittery and it let me focus much better.<p>Caffeine is an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist.<p>See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Adenosine_A2A_receptor_antagonist#Caffeine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Adenosine_A2A_receptor_antagon...</a><p>You may want to check out this paper, Adenosine A2Areceptor as potential therapeutic target in neuropsychiatric disorders: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scihubtw.tw&#x2F;10.1016&#x2F;j.phrs.2019.104338" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scihubtw.tw&#x2F;10.1016&#x2F;j.phrs.2019.104338</a><p>Caffeine has a problem though:<p>&gt; Moreover, considering that caffeine has a half-life of 2.5-4.5 hours [137]the once-a-day schedule of administration used in clinical trials in ADHD patients could be insufficient to antagonize A2AR throughout the day; thus, in future trials different administration schedules should be used or, as an alternative, selective A2AR antagonists could be tested in animal models of ADHD. In particular, it would be interesting to test the efficacy of the A2AR antagonist istradefylline in view of its approval for the treatment of Parkinsonâ€™s disease in Japan [138].<p>Ironically, I just started taking Nourianz (istradefylline) (link: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nourianz.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nourianz.com&#x2F;</a>) as a last-resort drug for my severe restless legs syndrome, which has been going phenomenally well. I also have ADHD combined type (inattention and hyperactivity), and fairly severely.<p>Anyways, I have been taking the the istradefylline for a week now, and it has made a tremendous difference in many of my ADHD symptoms. In addition, it greatly increased my sense of wellbeing within 1-2 hours of initially taking it, and it has been sustained for the entire week.<p>I hope you find this interesting! I take Vyvanse for my ADHD.<p>Thanks to istradefylline I can now focus seamlessly and without effort. I can just &quot;lock in&quot; to whatever I want to do. Before, it would require some static force (&quot;friction&quot;) to be able to &quot;lock in&quot; my concentration to do the task. I can also just focus, without hyperfocusing. It now comes naturally to me. I also no longer find myself pacing around the house aimlessly. I also do not randomly get up from my seat or fidget hardcore. I can also lock back into a flow state without effort if I am disrupted.')
