That’s been supplemented in recent years with people moving here but the genesis started with the great colleges.<p>Once you admit there are negative externalities that the government has to force companies to “price in” to meet human goals (eg slowing climate change) you can’t just turn around and be a hyper libertarian on every other issue.<p>Musk is smart enough to extend his reasoning from the environment to other factors.<p>Indeed environmental regulations are slowing down Gigaberlin, if he were to whine about government required environmental impact reports, he’d be a hypocrite for example.')
