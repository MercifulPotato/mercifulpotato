It is really the &quot;Internet&quot; as a whole, or the always connected tech. Not simply Social Media.<p>For example there are far greater amount of information flowing through Instant Messenger that is not accounted for.<p>I have now come to the conclusion it wasn&#x27;t Social Media or Internet that divided the world. They act as an amplifier or solidify the viewer views. Simply because they spent more time on these media than ever before. So in reality, Social Media isn&#x27;t really to blame, but it is currently a good use for politicians and other Press to target.<p>My new question for myself is, Before the amplifier or solidifier comes in, How did one get their view in the first place? What shapes it?')
