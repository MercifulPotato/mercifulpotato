And before life got in the way and she and I stopped being able to hang on the phone regularly, she used to routinely read the latest cancer research because she worked at the CDC and because she had cancer.<p>And she used to routinely bitch to me about how &quot;98 percent of it is some variation on the same thing because it&#x27;s what is trendy and it&#x27;s what you can readily get funding for. There&#x27;s almost nothing actually new and interesting in breast cancer research.&quot;<p>She was also patient zero in a cutting edge study and yadda. She was very much an insider in multiple ways and she and I were close at one time, before I was homeless and had no phone for a year or more and before she began working 16 hours a day and had no time talk to anyone regularly, not even our mother.')
