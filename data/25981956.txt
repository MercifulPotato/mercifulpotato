This argument is the same one that keeps Emacs greybeards defending M-k and M-y despite the fact that there hasn&#x27;t been a Meta key on a single keyboard I&#x27;ve used in my 30 years of computing.<p>At some point you have to accept that the rest of the computing world has agreed upon a different standard than yours, and you either need to take steps to accommodate that or die.<p>That&#x27;s not to say you can&#x27;t try out new things while still abiding by existing standards (for instance, with advanced features like pastebuffer history), but that&#x27;s completely different from clinging on to inferior historical approaches when everyone else has moved on.')
