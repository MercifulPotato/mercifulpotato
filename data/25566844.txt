Item(by='jfultz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609217279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566291, text='Yeah, I&#x27;ve seen some similar problems with my Surface Book 2.<p>I didn&#x27;t see this initially, but I now see frequent, .5-to-3 second lagging response to the touchpad, seemingly fixable only by reboot.  Googling suggests a lot of other folks have seen a similar problem.  For my machine, there&#x27;s no lag from the touchscreen or from an external mouse...only the touchpad.<p>Re your USB problems...I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve seen that specific error, but I have noticed that I simply cannot plug in two external USB cameras and expect them both to work.  The first one plugged in always works, the second appears as a device, but no software I own can get an image off of it (where the same two cameras can easily be used by other Windows boxes).<p>And, yes, I&#x27;ve also seen multi-screen problems when I put it to sleep with no external monitor and try to wake it up after it&#x27;s plugged into the external monitor (plugged in through a USB-C hub).  Basically, I had to plug in the monitor after it woke to avoid this.<p>Also...the detachable screen is a cool concept, but given that the seemingly larger portion of the battery life is in the keyboard half, and that the screen half has no power or USB ports, it really blunts the applications I might have put the detachable screen to.<p>Yes, definite problems here.  I&#x27;ve wondered if I would&#x27;ve been happier with the Surface Laptop rather than the Surface Book.')
