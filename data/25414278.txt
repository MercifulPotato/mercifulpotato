My observations below.<p>1)  When gradually most of your implementation is happening in a DSL &#x2F; graph based system all of your best tools for debugging and optimizing are useless.<p>2) So often I&#x27;ve seen people make an &#x27;engine&#x27; before they make anything that uses the engine and in practice the design suffers from needless complexity and is difficult to use because of practical matters not considered or forseen during the engine creation. Usually much work has been spent on tackling problems that are never encountered but add needless complexity and difficulty in debugging.  Please design with debugging having an equal seat at the table!<p>3) Overly factored code is almost indistinguishable from assembly language. - Galloway')
