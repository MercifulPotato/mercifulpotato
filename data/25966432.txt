The vaccines can be retargeted, and like the flu vaccine, approved with a faster trial. And the mRNA vaccine production can continue to scale up.<p>So if there is a need for a new vaccine, we can likely deploy it with a shorter interval to availability and much larger initial volume.<p>We can also become more disciplined.
