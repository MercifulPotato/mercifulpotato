A net 0.8% of residents leaving in a year is believable.  An astounding 40% of the city&#x27;s population leaving, and then another 40% entering the city, which is an order of magnitude higher than any turn-over the city has ever experienced, is clearly not believable.  That is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence, and they have not remotely provided it.  Indeed I suspect this claim will be very easy to disprove by looking at voter rolls, tax rolls, jury pool rolls, DMV rolls, etc.<p>&gt; It explains that they&#x27;re extrapolating from three NYC neighborhoods (Astoria, Tribeca, and Williamsburg).<p>Wow.  This is garbage-tier methodology that doesn&#x27;t remotely deserve anyone paying attention to the &quot;results&quot;.  Talk about sampling bias galore.')
