So far my observations about tool and library availability:<p>Node: build it from source at HEAD and it works fine. Will work out of the box in release 16.<p>Java: Get the Azul JRE, works fine.<p>Go: Has to be bootstrapped from HEAD.<p>c++ toolchain: works out of the box<p>cmake: build and install from source release, no problems.<p>bazel: still doesn&#x27;t grok darwin_arm64, release build tries to x-compile everything.<p>anything that needs bazel: doesn&#x27;t work due to above.<p>python3: comes in the box, works<p>R: no native package yet')
