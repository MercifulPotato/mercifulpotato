Arresting them was not illegal and they were breaking the law. \nHowever, 2 points: as most district attorneys showed, people who were just there and didn&#x27;t do anything were not prosecuted and so shouldn&#x27;t really have been arrested. Secondly the declarations of a riot could be wrong, but at the time being in a riot was a crime.<p>But let&#x27;s ignore all that for a moment.<p>Propaganda.<p>&#x27;innocent people being snatched off the streets..&#x27; (...in unmarked vans)<p>Implies that the feds and local police are routinely illegally kidnapping peaceful protestors across the country.<p>The truth is that this happened in one street in one city on one night only to less than a handful of protesters, still prortesting once a riot had been declared by uniformed feds in one unmarked van at the same time as uniformed feds in marked vans were doing the same thing a few yards away.<p>That leads me to think that this small event has been turned into a propaganda story..it&#x27;s a classic example.<p>in groups think the out group believes propaganda and that we in the ingroup are immune to it. Don&#x27;t believe the hype.')
