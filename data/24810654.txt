I used to be a part of the job market until about a year ago, although my last two employers were both SV companies. So that&#x27;s probably is where many of my biases come from.<p>I have a couple of freelancers working with me and I never really paid much attention to their CVs. I value the technical and (written) communication abilities over anything I see in the CV. Especially because everyone is working remotely.<p>I seem to have have the opposite bias. When I see that someone has spent &gt; 5 years in a well established &#x2F; post growth company. I see it as a sign of compacency, which has a slightly negative connotation in my books. I totally undestand it if you&#x27;re getting fat raises and stock refreshers every year at a growth phase company. But if you&#x27;ve been working at a podunk company for 5+ years, that&#x27;s definitely a negative signal for me.<p>Also, the old cliche quote: &quot;If you want loyalty, get a dog&quot; comes to mind. Loyalty and ambition are anti correlated. I think the extremes of both are bad, and it helps to strike a balance somewhere in the middle.')
