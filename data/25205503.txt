Item(by='wutbrodo', descendants=None, kids=[25208659], score=None, time=1606272578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25204040, text='&gt; contrary to the popular belief in the US, doctors can be fairly un-intellectual. The main requirement to do well in their career is to rely on rote memorization (go check out on YouTube how Anki is so important&#x2F;popular among med school people).<p>I agree with everything in your comment, but this is one of the most important ones. This is actually the basis upon which my cocky little 17-year-old self decided he wanted to study math instead of medicine, contrary to the pressure my family was exerting: the idea of turning my brain into a file drawer was somewhere between horrifying and nauseating. I point-blank asked my brother-in-law at one point (he was around ~30 at the time) how someone as intelligent as him was satisfied with going into a field as unchallenging as medicine, and he was on exactly the same page as me: over the course of his medical education (started the same year as my sister), he also got an MBA and has started on a PhD, because being a GP would be immensely dissatisfying to his intellect. If you have a sense of yourself as fairly intelligent, it is _absolutely crucial_ for your health as a patient interacting with the healthcare world that you internalize that doctors aren&#x27;t necessarily that smart (though of course, some are!).<p>This isn&#x27;t an insult! Most professions are filled with people that aren&#x27;t that smart. But putting yourself blindly in the hands of an imagined omniscient without being an informed and opinionated advocate for yourself as a patient is foolhardy and dangerous, and you&#x27;ll quickly discover the costs, if you&#x27;re self-aware enough. If you have a doctor who buys into the God Complex and scoffs at the notion of a patient having an opinion, then you&#x27;re double-fucked, and should definitely get a new doctor.<p>This can be a delicate balance, and the doctors I know are quite fairly annoyed at the patient who does his own research (often poorly) and argues with them on the basics. &quot;Knowing what you don&#x27;t know&quot; is an important part of being informed. Just 1) find a doctor who understands his limits and 2) approach the conversation as a meeting of mutually-interested peers logically discussing a problem (your health): one who has substantial headstart on the intimate, sometimes-inarticulable details of the problem, and one who has a substantial headstart on general research that&#x27;s relevant to the problem.')
