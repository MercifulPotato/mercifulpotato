Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=[24853638, 24853847], score=None, time=1603323541, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24853277, text='The Facebook Container extension is special, it does a bunch of work to put all of Facebook and only Facebook inside the Facebook Container. Bits of Facebook trying to peak through outside Facebook (e.g. tracking pixels) are elided entirely. Which is exactly what I want. But ordinarily that&#x27;s not the behaviour you get from a Firefox container.<p>e.g. I have that Facebook Container, and I also have a Slack container I just put together in the usual way by opening my Slack session (it&#x27;s for the main social group I hang out with, during the pandemic) inside a Container with a pink theme and icon.<p>Suppose three friends send me a funny Youtube video of kittens, one sends it on Slack, one on Facebook, one literally sends me a postcard with the URL on it.<p>In Facebook, it&#x27;s inside the Facebook container. Since the Facebook Container has no idea who I am, Youtube presents adverts and of course there&#x27;s no way to add the video to my &quot;Fun kitten videos&quot; list. <i>But</i> if I tell Youtube to open this now the tab is <i>not</i> Facebook, a no-referrer link opens with the URL and now in my default context which has Youtube Premium, so there are no adverts and I can add this to my lists. As far as Facebook is concerned I apparently just left. Unless Google tells them I watched that video they are none the wiser.<p>Slack is inside the Slack container. So again, no Youtube account, adverts. But if I open the Youtube page that&#x27;s still inside the Slack container, so still no Youtube account. I need to explicitly get the URL and paste it into a not Slack tab to get my default context.<p>The link from the postcard obviously I get to choose which context to type it into the URL bar, although maybe the UX of typing random Youtube URLs in isn&#x27;t great.')
