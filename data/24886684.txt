Item(by='Hewlberno', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603637358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886683, text='Hi everyone!<p>I built <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moodmap.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moodmap.app&#x2F;</a> originally around the issues I had to work through when managing my ASD and ADHD. There&#x27;s still a lot of work to do, I think it&#x27;s pretty neat so far though.<p>In terms of how I want to manage privacy, which I think is ridiculous important in building a tool like this, I am trying to implement SOLID (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inrupt.com&#x2F;solid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inrupt.com&#x2F;solid</a>) as a way to make sure any data that is used is completely under the control of the people who need the tool. Fuck surveillance.<p>I am using a variety of different ML methods, and as the product evolves I expect those methods to evolve with it. I am hyper focused on solving the big problems that I, and those like me, have to deal with when testing medication and managing mental health with ADHD and ASD.<p>Love to answer any questions and appreciate any feedback~! !<p>Mike')
