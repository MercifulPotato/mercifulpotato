Item(by='dwohnitmok', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605576443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25119277, text='&gt; there&#x27;s a model that corresponds exactly to that theory: anything that&#x27;s true in that model can be proven in the theory, and vice versa.<p>Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work if you swap our &quot;for all models&quot; with &quot;there exists a model.&quot;<p>Take the theory of the natural numbers with the new symbol &quot;Special&quot; and the axiom &quot;there exists a number n such that Special(n) holds.&quot; In every model of that theory there will be a concrete n that is Special (say 6). However, the theory will never be able to prove that a specific n is Special, precisely because it is under-specified which n it is.<p>&gt; Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem tells you that there&#x27;s no such model for any system that includes the usual &quot;full&quot; version of arithmetic.<p>No in conjunction with Godel&#x27;s completeness theorem, the incompleteness theorem would say rather that there is no theory that is strictly only the &quot;full&quot; version of arithmetic. Any theory will always be too broad and have <i>too many</i> models that satisfy it, only one of which is the &quot;usual&quot; model of arithmetic.<p>EDIT: Ah I see I misinterpreted your statement the first time, around, but my objections still hold with modification. Change &quot;the theory of the natural numbers&quot; to a far weaker theory, e.g. the theory of Presburger Arithmetic, and everything else still holds.')
