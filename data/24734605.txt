Markets are remarkably good at bringing down the price of goods &amp; services, but that necessarily means that they also bring down the price of labor, which is an input. While this is good for most people, it&#x27;s obviously less good for those workers that are engaged in low leverage work where net-productivity hasn&#x27;t changed. As a society, we should help those workers via welfare.')
