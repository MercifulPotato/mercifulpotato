All three are distributed teams with no offices.<p>I learned a long time ago when I was assigned a task, if I concentrated I could get my days work done in 2&#x2F;3 hours, sometimes less. If it was a large task that was supposed to take a month, I could do it in two weeks.<p>I dont believe this is because Im special in any way, I just think people slack off and generally lose too much time at work.<p>Obviously I didn&#x27;t start with 3, I had 1 and noticed I had a lot of downtime and applied and was selected for a second job. At first I was very nervous I had taken on too much, but after a few weeks it became clear I could finish both in about 6 hours a day.<p>I then added the third, and usually I can finish everything in 8&#x2F;9 hours. Ive gotten into trouble a few times where things piled up and I had to work all through the weekend, but its rare.<p>Its also happened where I finish all my works&#x27; week by Wednesday and have Thursday and Friday pretty much off.<p>I dont get into trouble with meetings because all 3 jobs dont have that many (1 or 2 per week) and since the teams are distributed theres always some room for scheduling effectively.<p>At one point I even got a 4th job, that immediately was too much and I resigned after a week.<p>Final note, I see nothing immoral about this. I want to make money and keep busy, if I end up paying the price by pulling some all nighters or long weekends I accept that, and have done it.<p>In all three positions I get positive reviews and even raises.<p>(this is not my real HN account, I created it just to share this story without divulging my identity)')
