I agree with this, since charging corruption is very strong.\n   - 68% error rates are not really errors. OK\n   - Does not look like anyone actually went in there and set a zero. The specific picture is blacked out, so I cannot tell what was happening (I seem to remember an earlier version where it wasn&#x27;t blacked out, but probably just human memory playing tricks.)\n</code></pre>\nDid I summarize and comment fairly?<p>Fortunately for you (aha!) I actually was not looking at these things. What I found interesting were the following:<p><pre><code>   - Instances of verifiable high rates of adjudication not just here, but elsewhere. There is a clip of an official in some county where they said their adjudication rate was 60% which is excessive and means x% of votes were decided by people in a room somewhere.\n   - Deleted log files for 2020 but not 2016 (this was the big one for me, should be unacceptable.)\n   - Same ballots giving different results. Admittedly, this could be user error.\n</code></pre>\nAside from the particulars in 2020, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, every single election should be audited to the highest standards possible and I cannot understand why anyone would disagree. This (to me) means adversarial parties trying to convince a third party of their version of the truth with opportunity for rebuttal. I don&#x27;t feel that actually happened here which worries me overall. What we seem to have is one party says something, the other party takes to the news to offer a rebuttal and no one will be able to fairly hear both sides without piecing together bits of information.<p>It&#x27;s for this reason I wish the Supreme court had taken up the case.')
