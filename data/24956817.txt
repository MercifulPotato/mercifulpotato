Hope you&#x27;re not on N-2 and there&#x27;s a sudden version bump!<p>(I say production APIs, since even payment gateways often have flaky dev&#x2F;qa gateways that you can&#x27;t reliably do automated tests against. Past companies that I worked at had to test against prod gateways with their own personal credit cards.)<p>Otherwise, if you want an API, ensure you choose a product&#x2F;partner that offers&#x2F;supports one.')
