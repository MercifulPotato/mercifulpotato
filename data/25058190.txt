(extraction of required resources from mines - I realise nuclear requires this too).  I like green energy a lot, but don&#x27;t believe they come at zero cost.  Also PVs work for half of the day at best, and wind blows sometimes... What we need is all of the above.  Diversity in energy.<p>When most vehicles are electric are need to be charged at night, I&#x27;m not sure PV and turbines will cut it.')
