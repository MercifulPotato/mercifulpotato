Hard bounces mean that email delivery services are going to start automatically removing, or at least stopping delivery to, entire slews of email addresses.<p>A lot of clean up is going to be needed as a result of this.<p>To add some more details, when using a 3rd party email delivery service, those services will either black-list or just outright remove email addresses when they get a hard bounce &quot;email address no longer exists&quot; message back.<p>Some providers make re-adding an address after a hard bounce a non-trivial task, since after all, the authority on that email address <i>just said</i> it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>This is going to be <i>really</i> ugly.')
