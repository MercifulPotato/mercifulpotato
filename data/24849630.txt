I mentioned this chip in a recent discussion on single-board-computer&#x27;s cpus[1], in relation to Odroid&#x27;s $50 C4 which uses the same chip &amp; their much beefier 2.4GHz A73 $63+ N2+[1].<p>I realize the ethernet is the primary thing a NAS tends to need. Still can&#x27;t be a bit disappointed that this board doesn&#x27;t have USB3. Seems to be the chip, the S905X3, which multiplexes USB3 and PCIe on the same pins: you&#x27;ve gotta pick! And they use that PCIe for SATA, so there&#x27;s no pins for USB.<p>Alas alas, PCIe switching is just too expensive. It&#x27;d be so nice for some small PCIe switches to be more robustly used. And like, why not more pcie micro-IO hubs? Big desktop CPUs talk to platform hubs that have a bunch of SATA, USB, PCIe on them. They have no where near enough bandwidth to the CPU to support it all at once, but it allows for good expandability. Systems like this would benefit so much from a ~$8 platform hub, whose uplink is a PCIe lane or two, and which exposes 4 SATA, a USB3 root &amp; 4 port hub, and 2x pcie x1 links. One of the notables from the recent &quot;Turing Pi 2&quot; was discussion of how to attach a bunch of peripherals to a micro-cluster, and they discussed their shying away from PCIe, which I started some discussion on[2]. I think the hub would do them well, but any old PCIe switching, especially with NTB, would do them a world of good, but is just regarded flatly by most of the world as &quot;too damned hard&quot; and&#x2F;or &quot;too damned expensive&quot;. Enough &quot;alases&quot; in this post already, but it would be so enabling to see us get better at &quot;small&quot; pcie.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24813668" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24813668</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24830084" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24830084</a>')
