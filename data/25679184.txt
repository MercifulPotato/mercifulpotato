Instead, applying by smearing the time over a period (see Google’s approach) is a less dangerous way of handling the situation, but now you’ve got computers that might not agree on time exactly.<p>As a result it is easier to abolish leap seconds and just live with the fact that in 30,000 years time that noon might not be directly overhead.')
