Most of their episodes are topical these days, I recommend checking out the recent Pandemic Special.<p>Matt, Trey and a guy named Robert Lopez wrote the theatre production Book of Mormon, which was well received and won Tony awards (Trey studied Musical Theatre in College, which explains why the South Park Movie was a musical).<p>Trey&#x27;s daughter was cast as Jared Kushner in Sassy Justice, which was hilarious, and the lead in Sassy Justice is played by Peter Serafinowicz [0], who is a British comedian!<p>I hope they make more of these, not just because I&#x27;m a fan, but because it massively disseminates the power of deepfakes!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6-7NDP8V-6A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6-7NDP8V-6A</a>')
