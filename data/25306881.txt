That lets us, for example, make it a challenge for others to figure out how to type stuff that they need to type.  It lets us create variables that use characters that have almost exactly the same appearance as latin characters, but aren&#x27;t.  For bonus hilarity, create two versions of the same variable name, one with a non-latin-but-similar-appearance character, and the other with the latin character.<p>No thanks.  Hard pass.')
