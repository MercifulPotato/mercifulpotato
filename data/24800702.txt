Seems a bit like re-typing Javascript programs in order to &quot;learn&quot; programming?<p>Will you be able to improvise after enough of this? Play songs by ear?<p>There are a few fundamental musical concepts that I&#x27;m not sure you easily pick up by rote memorization:<p>* Most music is based around &quot;chords&quot;, which have non-obvious mappings to physical keys. (They&#x27;re linear intervals in frequency space, but that doesn&#x27;t make it easy to realize that D&#x2F;F#&#x2F;A and Ab&#x2F;C&#x2F;Eb are two representations of essentially the same thing)<p>* Likewise, songs can be transposed up or down without affecting their fundamental attributes. (They just sound &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot;). However, to do that, you need to be able to shift +&#x2F;- N keys which is tricky given the difficult layout of a piano. To really do this well, you need to understand the concept of scales&#x2F;modes.')
