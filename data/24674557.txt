But, I don&#x27;t know if this is ADD, some kind of anxiety, borderline depression, whether it&#x27;s something else or whether it&#x27;s just me.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to reply and talk about myself, I actually wanted to ask (if you wanted to share), about what led you to the diagnosis at that age - what kinds of things were not working for you? What were you developing coping skills for?')
