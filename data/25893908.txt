Also either the UK governement still hasn&#x27;t hired near enough customs agents, either the training was so horrendously planned it&#x27;s shamefull (especially when you compare to NL and FR customs agents).<p>There is a fresh food issue in the UK, salads and tomatoes especially. Maybe you don&#x27;t eat salads so you did not notice until its tomatoes that are hard to find on the shelf.<p>My cousins that are exporting some medium-quality wine (10 to 25â‚¬&#x2F;bottle) to the UK seems to be fine, there will be a price hike that can cut some of their british customers but the chineese market seems to open up for them so they won&#x27;t rely on UK export anymore.')
