We&#x27;re interested in a useful-energy-obtained for useful-energy-spent comparison. For instance, if I leave a block in the sun and then bring it inside, I have only expended the energy to move the block out and then move the block in. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for me to include the sun&#x27;s contribution to the system because that&#x27;s not a cost I incur.<p>The actual apples to apples comparison in efficiency _is_ the heat emitted by the block in my house divided by the cost of moving the block.')
