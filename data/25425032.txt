Even if Google is maintaining a mostly constant head count, people change jobs all the time, and to account for this Google is <i>continuously</i> hiring. This is part of the process, where tech companies have already focused on fixing problems. The other part of the problem is that tech companies can be quite hostile to underrepresented minorities, and the comments on this post are a perfect example, especially all the trolling dead comments. In real life, URM experience those comments and they don&#x27;t get deleted from their memories.  So making the work environment less hostile is essential to, in addition to the hiring practices.')
