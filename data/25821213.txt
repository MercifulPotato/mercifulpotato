Item(by='robenkleene', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610973793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821120, text='I&#x27;m not quite sure what your point is, but those are 100% the most interesting cases of apps conforming to the Mac App Store that I wouldn&#x27;t expect to. Here are my explanations:<p>1. Lightroom is easy, Lightroom Classic is not in the Mac App Store and is still supported. Anecdotally Lightroom Classic appears more popular than Lightroom, especially among professional photographers where it&#x27;s fair to say Lightroom is shunned. So Lightroom is Adobe&#x27;s attempt to have it both ways.<p>2. Office is much more interesting. I honestly find it shocking that Office is in the Mac App Store, since I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s in Microsoft&#x27;s best interest. I <i>think</i> the reason is that the Mac versions of Office are really stripped down and separate code bases than the PC versions, and I&#x27;d guess that this decision was in some way made possible by that separation (e.g., if there&#x27;s a feature that&#x27;s not possible in sandboxed version, it can just be stripped from the Mac version, which would be more difficult with a shared code base). I&#x27;d also guess that this will eventually be reversed as Microsoft is on a path to making cross-platform web-based (Electron&#x2F;React Native) versions of all their software, and I don&#x27;t expect those to be sandboxed.<p>For the record, by productivity software, I didn&#x27;t mean things like Office and Lightroom (my fault for not being clear). I meant utilities like LaunchBar, Keyboard Maestro, Moom, etc... e.g., launchers, window managers, and the like, which generally need more privileges than sandboxing allows, because they involve scripting, interacting with other apps, etc... A lot of the indie Mac app community centered around these apps because they allowed users to get a lot of value without much code (relatively) by adding smaller, system-wide, features.<p>Document-based apps work much better with the Mac App Store, but those apps tend to be an order of magnitude more work to make, therefore there were always much fewer of them. Document-based apps also have a lot of problems with Sandboxing, but at least they&#x27;re possible to make sandboxed.')
