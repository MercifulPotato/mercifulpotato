I decided to embrace that and set rules about how often they could do that.<p>I made that decision in part because I was homeless for a long time and while homeless I participated a lot on Metafilter where people would squee at me for &quot;caring&quot; about them and giving everyone good advice for free, but no one was willing to help me solve my biggest problem which was that I needed to develop an earned income adequate to get back into housing. And they ultimately banned me for supposedly &quot;self promoting.&quot;<p>People there were promoted all the time. You just had be in good with the right people and your crap could make the front page constantly.<p>And on r&#x2F;ClothingStartups, a lot of people posting appear to be people of color and appear to be trying to start something while out of work during a pandemic. And they do all kinds of stupid, ham-handed stuff that looks really lame.<p>And as long as you don&#x27;t have all caps in the title or violate the self promotion guidelines, I don&#x27;t care.<p>This idea that you have to be adequately smooth in your self promotion techniques is a hardship for a lot of minorities and marginalized peoples who have no business experience, no money for ads, etc and no one will give them a break.<p>My sub is growing at several people a day and it has more than just self promotion, though it does have a lot of that. It also has discussion about &quot;Where can I find a manufacturer?&quot; and so forth -- which is exactly what it&#x27;s for.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much value it has for people to self promote there. I don&#x27;t know if people are really turning that into an income. I don&#x27;t have data on that.<p>But when I was homeless, I was surrounded by well-heeled people who were happy to benefit from my expertise for free and accuse me of &quot;panhandling the internet&quot; for having donation buttons on my websites. What I knew as a former mom is stuff people expect women to do for free out of the goodness of their hearts and it was an abusive expectation because they expected me to care about them but no one cared about me. No one cared that I was homeless and going hungry and was making an honest effort to figure out how to establish an earned income in spite of my medical situation.<p>So I think we need more spaces on the internet where they cut you some slack for being new to business and having no idea what you are doing.<p>Upper class people who know how to do the smooth thing and promote themselves everywhere in the socially acceptable fashion and are pro UBI are the same people that then have some problem with people doing something overly blatant like using their company name as their account name on Reddit.<p>It&#x27;s a &quot;Fuck you, got mine&quot; policy masguerading as faux compassion. UBI is not about helping the poor. It&#x27;s about actively treating them like parasites and actively turning them into parasites while slamming all other doors shut in their face because you can only self promote if you have a Harvard education and know how to do it the right way in accordance with the sensibilities of other Ivy Leaguers.<p>And that boils down to &quot;Fuck all y&#x27;all currently poor people. We are not only pulling the rope ladder up behind us, we are burning it in front of you and pointing and laughing at your predicament.&quot;')
