If you have trivial kernels sure, but ISPC guarantees convergence across control flow which isn’t even available in CUDA (according to ISPC docs at least).<p>Just to be clear: I want to use Julia but without guessing about SIMD use in kernels. Until this is available for complex control flow in Julia,   it’s not a game changer in my opinion.<p>Edit: that kernel is trivial.  I have nested control flow to vectorize.')
