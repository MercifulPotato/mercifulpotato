Not only they are directly harming my ancestors, the way they were performed has always been beyond my comprehension.<p>In some sense, I am afraid that I might suffer the demise of Iris Chang [1], where her exposure to the bloody facts caused severe mental stress. Which combined with the denial from Japanese government and right wing extremists, caused depression, and eventually her suicide.<p>I am also constantly puzzled by the denial from Japanese government regarding the war crime. For example, Japanese government is mad at the sculpture of comfort women [2]. Some times they succeeded at silence the expression [3].<p>Everyone involved should actually be open about what happened and collectively overcome the hurdles of historical events. Not denying, and automatically will trigger violent counter attack, which sustained a vicious cycle of hatred. See what happened in the African Americans and slavery and German&#x27;s deeds for Holocaust. Where true concession indeed healed the wound largely.<p>I cannot help but guess that Japan&#x27;s rejection of the war crime has truly been the culprit of the nation&#x27;s disintegration in the east Asia bloc. Sadly caused a lot unnecessary frictions in the local geopolitical scene.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iris_Chang" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iris_Chang</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;news.artnet.com&#x2F;art-world&#x2F;comfort-woman-shinzo-abe-sculpture-1898109&#x2F;amp-page" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;news.artnet.com&#x2F;art-world&#x2F;comfo...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;mobile.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;amp&#x2F;idUSKCN1UT0DG" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;mobile.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;amp&#x2F;...</a><p>Edit: to reply the comments below:<p>Actually, Japan denial is more puzzling, in that the facts are not to be held back by the Japanese government. For domestic violence, the ruling government still have full control of the facts and how to interpret them. In Japan&#x27;s case, the evidence is all controlled by foreign nations because they were performed there.')
