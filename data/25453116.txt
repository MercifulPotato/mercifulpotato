You&#x27;re a bright guy, and you seem pretty confident, so I suspect I&#x27;m missing something here.<p>Which activity among [money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics] requires murder-for-hire?  Is there a fifth charge for which he was convicted that I&#x27;ve missed?<p>Is there some non-intuitive legal definition of conspiracy to traffic narcotics, where conspiracy to traffic requires conspiracy to distribute plus conspiracy to commit murder, or something like that?<p>Also, is there any legal or strategic reason to drop the charge for the predicate crime?  It might make sense as a legal strategy to reduce attention on a shaky part of the case, but it seems that the defense would draw plenty of attention to a shaky key pillar of the case anyway.')
