I ate there a couple of times, it&#x27;s nice inside too!<p>I love biking&#x2F;walking around the Oracle campus area because they made a bike path and the area is safer than it was before.\nThat being said, I know a couple of people who work there and they don&#x27;t like their job - it&#x27;s thankless - but I think that&#x27;s the same with all big companies where you&#x27;re just another number.<p>When the pandemic hit everyone started working from home and this mega-building was pretty much empty. I am not surprised they&#x27;re gonna move their HQ here. That&#x27;s because they got plenty of office space to fill amongst other reasons. Also with favorable taxes and lots of space to expand (if they ever need to) as they hire more and more people. Good thing for those who purchased homes near the campus! Their value will keep increasing as more &quot;execs&quot; move here after the pandemic settles.')
