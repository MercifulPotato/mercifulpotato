I&#x27;ve updated the diagram with the right version.<p>Yes, the transistor is a current sink. Since the gate is wired to Vdd, the transistor is stuck on so it provides a fixed current limited by its size. Transistors are much smaller than resistors on an IC so they used transistors instead of resistors.')
