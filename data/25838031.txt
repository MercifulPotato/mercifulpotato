What I see is a kind of moral legalism, where people essentially litigate their positions to greater and greater powers as a means to wield their dominion, and this is the very essence of faithlessness.<p>Whether it is a constitutional appeal to freedom of speech, or political &quot;ratfucking,&quot; by people who hide behind societal penalties for any violence, the spirit of mendacity and sadistic antagonism is the same. That good faith principle is the only thing that enables societies to be governed with consent instead of just ruled over as interchangeable subjects.<p>When we dispense with principles and their honourable spirit, we dispense with the only meaningful thing separating people from animals.')
