It isn&#x27;t required to be &#x27;locked&#x27;, and I have never encountered a Windows laptop or desktop that didn&#x27;t not allow you to disable secure boot within the BIOS. I am not as familiar with Apple hardware so I will not comment on that.<p>UEFI and it GUID partition layout is superior to traditional BIOS. I develop within embedded systems that rely on GUID partitions to provide granularity of storage. One current system I support has 34 partitions, to support redundancy, safe image updates, and soft recovery.<p>With UEFI on the desktop, you can implement the same strategies.<p>So those are two statements in the post that I found to be misleading, if not outright wrong.<p>On the hardware front, yes, current era consumer laptops have become completely sealed boxes. If you want to own a laptop that can be upgraded and maintained, you need to buy either a gaming or enterprise laptop.<p>For most people, and enterprise laptop is only going to be slightly more expensive than a consumer grade device. It is not going to be as slim and &#x27;sexy&#x27;. It t will likely have useful ports down the side.<p>On desktops, as long as you are buying a full sized desktop, I have not seen any (yet) that are not completely equipped with appropriate connectors and cabling to support upgrades.<p>I have seen &#x27;mini&#x27; systems that are completely soldered down, but that is the price you pay for small. Connectors consume real estate.')
