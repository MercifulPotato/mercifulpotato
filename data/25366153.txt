They will obviously have terrible performance, and waste space due to blocks not fitting nicely due to non-standard physical block sizes.<p>mirror&#x27;s are easy because you don&#x27;t have to worry about ASHIFT values, and physical block sizes of devices and making sure all of your blocks can be divided nicely into 128K block sizes.<p>I get the feeling that the author of the article never actually has ran a properly configured raidz(x) with SLOG and cache devices.')
