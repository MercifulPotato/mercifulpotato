Instead of hydrating the whole page, only the interactive parts are hydrated, sending the absolutely minimal JS needed to the client.<p>AFAIK only Marko has this feature today. Since it&#x27;s developed and used at Ebay they focused on the best SSR+hydration experience from the start.<p>Imba v2 will also have patial hydration (confirmed by the devs here on HN).<p>Other than those two, it seems nobody is really taking partial&#x2F;progressive&#x2F;lazy hydration seriously. IMO SSR+partial hydration is really the next frontier in web development.<p>It&#x27;s possible to do it yourself (I did it recently with a Svelte project) but it results in complicated setups. We need a solution that does it transparently, extracting the needed components and data automatically.')
