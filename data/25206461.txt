Most problems worth arguing at length require collaboration to solve.<p>I would rather discuss problems and their solutions, and hash out disagreements, with someone who is likely to be a true partner in the implementation of the solution.<p>Bad faith vs good faith can then be inferred by track records or commitments, same as you would for anything else.')
