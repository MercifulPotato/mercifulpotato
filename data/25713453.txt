Item(by='AsyncAwait', descendants=None, kids=[25725436], score=None, time=1610276793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25712012, text='You don&#x27;t see the irony of censoring a leftie in a thread that complains about the right getting censored by a &#x27;left-wing witch hunt&#x27; do you?<p>I have had plenty of interesting debates on here; when it comes to politics however, HN has a certain bias and an ideological blind spot. The narrative that the left is censoring everybody while you have Republican legislators passing this[1] is laughable, yet the narrative persists because it&#x27;s not being challenged.<p>I do try to see the other side[2] when I think it makes sense. Playing victim of the left while a right-wing mob just stormed the Capitol is not one of these times, sorry.<p>The cynic in me thinks this is what YC wants; it promotes the sort of thinking on which VC thrives. I have little reason to believe otherwise. There&#x27;s few people on HN challenging these narratives and now there&#x27;s even fewer.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-BDS_laws#Anti-BDS_laws_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-BDS_laws#Anti-BDS_laws_in...</a><p>2 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25691631" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25691631</a>')
