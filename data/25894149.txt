There&#x27;s not enough theory and science in organizing code and understanding complexity.  Most of what goes on here is just guessing. If you created &quot;good architecture&quot; it only means future requirements happened to fit your design, aka you made a good guess.<p>Rarely does anyone design anything that is efficient in the present and adaptable to any possible future simply because there&#x27;s no science and theory on how to design such a thing. There&#x27;s some rules of thumb but even following these rules of thumbs people end up with technical debt most of the time anyway. It always happens, if a project lives long enough, more and more &quot;design mistakes&quot; made at project inception become evident.<p>I have personally found tacit programming to be the solution for this but because there&#x27;s no theory I can&#x27;t explain to you definitely why tacit programming is the best way to deal with tech debt of the structural nature.')
