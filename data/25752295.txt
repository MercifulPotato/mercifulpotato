Item(by='skohan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610480390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752177, text='Maybe I am one of those &quot;old people&quot; but I don&#x27;t understand how discord is better than more traditional forums or mailing lists for technical discussions.  With a mailing list, forum thread, or GitHub issue, I can search and find something relevant to me from years ago.  By contrast, discord seems so ephemeral: I have to hope I can be in the same place at the same time as the person who has the information I need.  And it&#x27;s a closed platform, so it&#x27;s not searchable or indexable the same way as content on the open web.  And if discord closes their doors, or changes their TOS in the wrong direction some day it might all just be gone from one day to another.  I would be happy to understand why you think chat is a better tool for the job.')
