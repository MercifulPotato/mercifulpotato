No one could complain about Apple&#x27;s financial performance, but the company has definitely lost the &quot;Let&#x27;s launch a market-defining product every five years or so&quot; momentum and gloss of the Jobs years.<p>It&#x27;s an open question whether this would actually have harmed Apple&#x27;s performance over time, or whether the market cap would be even bigger if Jobs were still alive.
