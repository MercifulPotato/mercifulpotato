Developing native desktop apps is more work (Win32 and Cocoa, who even knows those? you&#x27;ll have to implement the app in both) and these days you&#x27;ll have to go through the app signing bureaucracy even if you&#x27;re not using app stores. And good luck with the monetization, especially if you&#x27;re not distributing through app store or other and paying a huge share for it.')
