Grow like cancer, engulf all competition, capture the market etc.<p>However, the owners of the company are humans that do not need to be constrained by those rules. Indeed, humans can hold other values higher - such as seeing that acting in the benefit of the entire society or even to benefit the entire planet is better than focusing on the best for a single corporation.<p>Pretend for a while that you are the majority owner of an internet company that preys on attention. You can capture the attention of millions, even billions of humans, and grow your vast empire.  You can even become so successful that humans choose your product before the attention of other humans, choosing the dopamin kick from social media before real social interactions.<p>But...should you?

Even your own offspring might suffer and perish in a world where social life has been replaced by hearts, thumbs up and endless scrolling.')
