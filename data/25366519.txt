Instead\nthere is in the Constitution:<p>&quot;Each State shall appoint, in such Manner\nas the Legislature thereof may direct, a\nNumber of Electors, ...&quot;<p>So, in each state, the legislature STILL\nhas the final authority.  Supposedly this\npoint was tested in the SCOTUS in 1892 and\n2000 or some such.<p>Mayor Giuliani claims to have lots of\nsolid evidence of fraud in the form of\nhundreds of signed affidavits in each of\nseveral of the six states and with enough\nfraud to have converted a Trump win to an\napparent Biden win.  By now legislatures\nin several of the six states have seen at\nleast an overview of Giuliani&#x27;s evidence.\nStill, AFAIK, no legislature has taken the\nConstitutional power to &quot;direct&quot; and\n&quot;appoint&quot; their state&#x27;s electors.  Some of\nthose legislatures still could &quot;direct&quot;\nand &quot;appoint&quot;.<p>It appears that going directly to the\nstate legislatures, that is, just\nf&#x27;getting about all the courts except\npossibly the SCOTUS, could be sufficient.<p>The way I read the Constitution, each\nstate legislature can take the power to\n&quot;direct&quot; and &quot;appoint&quot; without regard for\nthe state constitution, the state laws,\nthe state governor, secretary of state,\nAG, or board of elections and without need\nfor the governor to *call the legislature\ninto session&quot;.  Net, anytime before the\nElectoral College votes, some states\nlegislatures could still &quot;appoint&quot;\nelectors that could cause Trump to win.<p>If there was fraud that threw the\nelection, then as citizens we darned\nbetter well get to the bottom of it before\n1&#x2F;20&#x2F;2021.<p>Some of the alleged fraud is just old\nfashioned ballot box stuffing.  We really\nSHOULD be able to settle such claims\nsolidly, for or against.<p>Fraud that changes an election for POTUS\nis a threat to our rule of law,\nConstitution, democracy, and country.  We\nneed a solid answer.<p>IMHO, Youtube should encourage full debate\nof these points.  As it is, it appears\nthat Youtube doesn&#x27;t want videos of Trump,\nGiuliani, or Justices of the SCOTUS -- not\nso good.')
