When AWS is willing to throw whatever against a wall (launching 50+ services a year) to see what sticks, sooner or later they&#x27;re going to land in your space.<p>This is true for a subset of products, but not uniformly. To the extent you&#x27;re building an infrastructure product, you get to choose what axis to compete on. If you&#x27;re going up against AWS, then trying to compete with them on things like cost and reliability are likely poor choices. But something like user&#x2F;dev experience isn&#x27;t. DynamoDB has a mongo compatible API and yet Mongo&#x27;s Atlas hosted service is responsible for most of the company&#x27;s growth over the past year. Why? Because it provides a unique offering, not just a &#x27;good-enough&#x27; offering, which is what a lot of higher-level AWS services are.')
