Why did you even waste your time asking me what problems I had with unions, if your response was just going to be &quot;Well, we can&#x27;t look at your real world example&quot;?<p>Also, I do not accept any hypothetical union, that does not exist, as a justification as for why unions are good.<p>The only thing that I will accept is a real world example, of a real union, so that we can make judgements on that to see if it would be good for the tech industry or not.<p>&gt;  to a weird standard where they should be rejected unless all instances are flawless<p>It is not about being flawless. Instead it is that the actual, real world examples that I have of unions, very often include very serious problems.<p>&gt;  reform the institution<p>So now we are entering the world of fantasy land.  If you cannot point to a real world example of a union that you like, then any argument that you are making right now is just a story that you made up in your head that is not backed up to fact.<p>I have already pointed to very serious problems in unions.  That is valid evidence.<p>And the only response that I ever get, when I point out the very serious problems with real world unions is &quot;Well, all the examples that you brought up don&#x27;t counts, and no I don&#x27;t have any examples of unions that I like!  Instead, you should just believe me that things are going to be good, even though all the real world evidence proves otherwise&quot;.<p>If pro union people want the tech industry to get on board then they need to show us facts, evidence and real world examples, instead of making up a story that is not backed by anything.')
