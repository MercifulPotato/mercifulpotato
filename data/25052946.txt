If you are unhappy, but it is within your power to protest, then the Stoic rationale would be to do that, since it is within your control.<p>But likewise if there are things that seem beyond your ability or energy to protest, you still have an inner world which you control, and that is one that you can only be deprived of through your death.<p>In this light the stoic is necessarily against status quo thinking, which would have you subscribe to the thinking of &quot;us versus them&quot; and drown out that inner world with external crisis and reaction to events, rather than proactive change.<p>It&#x27;s all in where you draw the boundary, and that&#x27;s where the critique lies: Who&#x27;s to say how much you really control?')
