Birth rates are falling because people don&#x27;t feel secure in their future. I can&#x27;t think of a single thing that makes me hopeful about the future. Stagnant salaries, stagnant economy, weak global leadership, rising nationalism and sectarianism, climate change, increasing wealth inequality, people don&#x27;t agree on basic reality (masks, climate change) and no where in our political spectrum do we see glimmers of hope of someone having a vision for what is the right thing to do.<p>I think we are about to see a huge insolvency event in the next few years that will further destabilize the economy on top of everything. A huge demographic shift is coming with the boomers retiring, and damn, they&#x27;re getting out at just the right moment as we inherit the problems they started and&#x2F;or ignored for decades. If you are in your 30s or younger, we are the world&#x27;s biggest suckers.')
