Only a fraction of population does that. There are not too many of them. TV shows people in old homes crying for their children abandoning them. I guess that&#x27;s how most people end up in old homes here.<p>On the other hand this culture has problems as well. It&#x27;s not easy to take care of old. When children move out, often because of their own children, unless at least one kid is very happy to take care of now very old parents, it becomes a great question which kid they can live with.<p>I never really understood the culture of adult kids and old parents living all separately as a way of life. What&#x27;s considered wrong with living with your parents or keeping them with you?')
