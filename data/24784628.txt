The idea that a corporation&#x27;s board would decide collectively what political stances to take is not groundbreaking. However this kind of critical thinking seems to be so rarely applied to organisations trafficking in information, such as those making up &#x27;big-tech&#x27;.<p>I was speaking elsewhere on Hacker News recently about how the attitude towards trusting corporations seems to have shifted so dramatically. Distrusting the motivations of large corporations was once a pillar of liberal thought in the west. Now many liberals seem to be willing to empower these corporations absolutely as long as they control online discourse in a way that largely benefits the liberal establishment.<p>I would encourage people to consider for a moment the financial incentives for organisations at the scale of Facebook, Google, Twitter et. al. to support globalist political agendas. This isn&#x27;t &#x27;conspiracy theory&#x27; thinking, it&#x27;s shareholder primacy, it&#x27;s simple politics. Anyone who thinks that these organisations support liberal causes out of the goodness of their hearts needs a reality check. They pursue these choices for their own gain.')
