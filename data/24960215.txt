The comment I responded to is overtly and unequivocally expressing arrogant repression<p>No, it isn&#x27;t: It wasn&#x27;t critical for you to respond (particularly with insults) nor was the comment &quot;repression&quot;.<p>&gt; If you think my comment is a personal attack<p>Your first comment <i>is</i> a personal attack, and so is this one. You continue calling the first commenter you replied to a &quot;thug&quot;. There&#x27;s really no room for opinions or different thoughts; that you insulted that person is undeniable.<p>&gt; The parent comment is the one behaving that way<p>The parent comment didn&#x27;t insult anyone here, it&#x27;s really odd that you&#x27;re trying to say otherwise when we all can read the comment and can see that there&#x27;s no insult to anyone here in it.<p>&gt; it is absolutely fair and uncontroversial to point out their own words demonstrating thuggish repression.<p>It isn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; In fact, not challenging their comment on these reprehensible points would be the far worse action.<p>No, it wouldn&#x27;t be, much less with insults.')
