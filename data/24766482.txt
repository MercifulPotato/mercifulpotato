That being said, unfortunately this is one of those things where Ubuntu and Gnome are objectively worse than they were ten years ago – due to the changes related to renaming files in Nautilus, you can no longer give your new files a proper name as you create them, but have to manually rename them afterwards. Compared to all the clicks that takes (with typing in between), it&#x27;s faster and more convenient to just click &quot;Open Terminal here&quot; and create any files you need with touch.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any problems with Super-left&#x2F;right, though.')
