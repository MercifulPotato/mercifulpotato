If he hadn&#x27;t been gifted billions of dollars in free advertising from all of these networks that hate watch his Twitter feed I don&#x27;t think we would even have Trump as POTUS. And now he&#x27;s never going to go away. And they&#x27;re going to be hate watching his every step to keep &quot;reporting the news.&quot; For the life of me I do not understand why people watch the news in this era.')
