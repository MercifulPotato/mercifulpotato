It makes starting new projects <i>really</i> easy. Personally, that&#x27;s one of the main barriers I feel when I&#x27;m trying to start anything in other languages.<p>Consider Java (or Kotlin, for that matter). You need either a Maven POM or a Gradle build file. Gradle makes things a little easier with &#x27;gradle init&#x27;, but you&#x27;re still stuck with arcane build files either way. If you have to use Maven and need any plugins... Good luck with that.<p>I think the general pattern here is that pretty much every language doesn&#x27;t stand on its own when it comes to starting and working on a project. You need external build and dependency management tools. Go has it all built-in and it&#x27;s super easy to use. It&#x27;s beautiful.<p>Language-wise, I want a language that&#x27;s as versatile as Kotlin, with the ease of use of Go. Imagine having a bunch of .kt files and just being able to &#x27;kotlin build&#x27;, &#x27;kotlin run&#x27;, etc. That&#x27;d be gold.')
