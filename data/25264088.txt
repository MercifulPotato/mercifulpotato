This is born out in the reactions that such critics tend to impose on the system, i.e. imposing draconian and expensive checks on those who seek it, both rejecting or impeding legitimate claiments while also not demonstably reducing costs (any savings due to catching fraud or even just rejecting those who need it being swallowed up by the cost of the checks).<p>See the UK government&#x27;s current (over the last 10 years) approach to welfare. Lots of money spent on checks which are run almost seemingly malicously incompetently, the vast majority of rejections not being upheld when they go to court (even more expensive), assuming the claiment hasn&#x27;t died by then (as many have due to extreme poverty).<p>It&#x27;s the kind of argument which carries a lot of emotional weight (everyone hates a cheater) but it&#x27;s really hard to believe is being taken in good faith from a rational, cost-reduction perspective.')
