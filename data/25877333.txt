(Remember that this was the original reason that Richard Stallman created the Open Source license -- it was a preemptive contract(!) TO PREVENT COMPANIES FROM ENGAGING IN PRECISELY THAT BEHAVIOR!  Remember that that actually happened to Richard Stallman a long time ago -- some company used his own work in a commercial product, closed sourced it, and didn&#x27;t give him any credit!  It&#x27;s sort of like Richard Stallman used the Law -- to fight other company&#x27;s abuse of the Law!)<p>But, I see your point.<p>So, let me refine my statement somewhat...<p>Open Source Software agrees with #1 in spirit as much as possible -- though not always in all circumstances (due to license restrictions -- but remember that for the most part, those license restrictions (AKA &quot;property rights&quot;) are there to prevent abuse by actors that do not share in the same spirit.)<p>Now, private property rights as applies to #4 -- is a completely different discussion...<p>I do not believe a government has any right to take away the private propety of it&#x27;s people, for any reason (although, for exceptions one could examine the history of our Constitution&#x27;s Taking&#x27;s Clause: “Nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” (Translation: private property <i>can</i> be taken for public use -- albeit with &#x27;just compensation&#x27;...)<p>In fact, one of the reasons why governments are formed -- why our government was formed -- is&#x2F;was to protect the private property of the individuals that comprise it.<p>So, private property rights as applies to how a government is implemented (#4) -- is an entirely a different discussion.<p>For the record, I do not believe in Communism (at least in its historical governmental implementations) -- but I do believe in sharing, helping others, etc. etc.<p>The word &quot;Communism&quot; itself is an abstraction which means many different things to many different people; I outlined four possible meanings, but of course, there are many more.<p>Perhaps a good idea would be to read Joel Spolsky&#x27;s essay on &quot;Leaky Abstractions&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;11&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-law-of-leaky-abstractions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;11&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-law-of-leaky-a...</a><p>And then, compare this (symbolically) to what the Bible has to say about &quot;The Tower Of Babel&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tower_of_Babel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tower_of_Babel</a><p>And possibly think about abstraction hierarchies in language as Jenga games:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jenga" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jenga</a><p>In other words, we don&#x27;t just have leaky abstractions in Software -- we also have leaky abstractions in language...')
