Same for e-mails.<p>That way, when on the pro account, no personal notification, only professional stuff, and vice versa.  Has been helping me being concentrating on pro stuff for the last 4 years.<p>To be precise, the separation is not totally strict, but it does not have to be 100% to be effective.  Visual theme and only relevant notifications make a big part of the benefit.')
