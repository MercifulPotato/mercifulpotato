For example, supposing there are a bajillion stars (we know that much), then we have to multiply against how likely it is for those stars to have a planet - and at the time, the likelihood of planets was completely unknown.<p>That at least, is something that&#x27;s changed in the last decade, thanks to new telescopes.  We&#x27;ve addressed one of the Drake Equation&#x27;s big unknowns:  we now can hazard a guess that planets are extremely likely.<p>Sadly there are enough other unknowns that we still can&#x27;t make any sort of <i>conclusions</i>, but at least the betting odds are going up.')
