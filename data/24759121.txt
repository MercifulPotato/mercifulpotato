History has not looked kindly on OS&#x27;s in such an environment, and further market declines may be inevitable as windows begins to look like a legacy platform or a use case specific platform (Games).<p>I&#x27;d have to imagine that Microsoft has been thinking of what their Desktop OS play would be at that point, allowing windows to simply die a slow and profitable death would threaten other business lines such as Gaming.  Non-Apple hardware vendors will be looking for OSX like systems to compete with a possibly dominant OSX platform.')
