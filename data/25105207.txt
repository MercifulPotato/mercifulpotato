This usually means first growing an audience through blogging, conferences, courses, etc.<p>2) The &quot;Marketing&quot; Path: you become so good at the &quot;business&quot; part of your business that the you&#x27;re able to launch new products from scratch without a preexisting audience. It&#x27;s tough to know if this really works or not but I assume with all the money spent on Google Ads some of it <i>has</i> to work… right?<p>3) The &quot;Idea&quot; Path: you have an idea that you believe in so much that you&#x27;ll basically stop at nothing to make it work, even if it takes years (which it probably will). You usually pick up the other skills along the way.<p>I feel like the poster here suffers from not quite fitting in any of the main paths: they did not seem to have a large pre-existing audience or network to launch to, hate anything related to marketing by their own admission, and their ideas –while perfectly good products, such as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nomadmail.io&#x2F;–" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nomadmail.io&#x2F;–</a> do not seem to be the kind of project that would inspire the kind of passion necessary to sacrifice years of your life.')
