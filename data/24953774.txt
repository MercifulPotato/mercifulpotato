A lot further south and you don&#x27;t have as much variation of light across the year so you might as well pick a suitable timezone and stick with it. A lot further north and there just isn&#x27;t enough light in the winter to effectively use on a workday if you&#x27;re indoors and there&#x27;s lots of light in the summer so picking the ideal wakeup time isn&#x27;t a big deal.')
