That&#x27;s pretty much how it works. The cows start lining up at the barn door when the time comes.<p>This family treated their cows very well -- they were their livlihood, almost like family. Unfortunately, policy has impacted the small farm to everyone&#x27;s detriment. I&#x27;m sure corporate farms treat cows as well as they treat their people.')
