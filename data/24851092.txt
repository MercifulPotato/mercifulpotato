Read the part about &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; and think about just how much Corresponding Source is out there.<p>E.g.: If this company ran the service on AWS, then the source code for their provisioning scripts for AWS to run the service would be in scope.

It&#x27;s lose-lose anyway.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely not worth it to run AGPL. It&#x27;s not a weird reaction at all. It&#x27;s probably the only possible action.')
