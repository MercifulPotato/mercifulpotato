The WHO makes very simple blanket statements that are safe in general.<p>A doctor usually looks at an individual. (And we know a lot of pregnant women got infected with COVID. We know that hospitalization was higher for them, but also that mortality is the same - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6925a1.htm?s_cid=mm6925a1_w#T2_down" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6925a1.htm?s_cid=mm...</a> , so the immune reaction should be the same too)<p>The real problem is that it&#x27;s impossible for a non-expert to gauge the expertise of any of these entities (your full-sized real-life walking-talking doctor who you know for a deacade, the WHO and anyone in between). Even simply asking many questions is just the illusion of getting informed (not just because there&#x27;s rarely any time for proper answers as you mentioned), but because the answers are biased, so this naturally biases the next question too. (Unless there&#x27;s enough time and effort to go through years of science and try to falsify whatever theory is being communicated with very targeted questions, it&#x27;s close to useless&#x2F;futile effort.)<p>&gt; But they are not really vested in you in particular, you are just one more,<p>Yep. Agreed. Also usually primary care physicians are better at &quot;bedside manner&quot; and pattern matching than at real medical science. (Because it&#x27;s not really their job to have 20 doctorates in every subfield of biology.)')
