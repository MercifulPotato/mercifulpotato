I wish the church was more popular (even though I am unbelievably against the negativity and judgments associated with US Christianity).<p>I am certainly an atheist but as Sam Harris attempts to evaluate morality in some books. There is a non-religious aspect that religions provide to their adherents. It&#x27;s not even just atheism but rather just the lack of &#x27;going to church&#x27; amongst those who still believe themselves to be Christian.<p>&gt;The world is better when people have a common ground, I believe. Nothing is there to fill the void; it feels like people are just blindly groping for something to be a part of.<p>It&#x27;s that need for community but the complete false community that reddit and facebook provide is a trap. Worse than a trap perhaps.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s maybe my lack of creativity, but I can&#x27;t come up with anything except the church, or old-timey civic organizations (Masons, Elks, Moose lodge, etc) to provide this.<p>There&#x27;s loads of options, there are fishing groups. Rowing clubs. Sports teams. But that doesnt fulfill that entire need. 1500 years ago, there wasn&#x27;t endless amounts of entertainment. People talked and did things together. Religions knew that a need for people were these things and developed them. For thousands of years everyone got that need from religion and there wasnt a need for other options. Or for that matter religion made it impossible for those others to provide.<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to do with any of that, but there it is.<p>The obvious reality that Christianity mostly went unchanged for 2000 years and only forces outside the religion has made them change. The fundamental basis of Christianity is over and they can work very hard to fix themselves but it&#x27;s a futile effort because if you remove all the sexism and various other hatred, or for that matter any bullshit out of the Bible. You are left with a pamphlet.<p>The movement forward isnt to go back to religion. It&#x27;s the understand what is missing and replace it. What&#x27;s interesting is that it&#x27;s replacement will have to be called religion in order to gain the &#x27;freedom of religion&#x27; protections that many constitutions provide.')
