I&#x27;m in a suburb of a large US city on the East coast, not really a tech city.<p>It&#x27;s... fine? I guess?<p>I guess I never really thought about doing this job in a &quot;non-tech&quot; city, versus doing it in a &quot;tech&quot; city.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure what the difference would be in a &quot;tech&quot; city. If you&#x27;re into the startup scene, or simply really enjoy local hacker stuff like local user groups, maker spaces, etc then doing a remote tech job in a non-descript suburb would surely <i>suuuuuuuuuck.</i> Those aren&#x27;t big factors for me though. I have friends and family here, and I satisfy my urge to connect with the larger &quot;tech community&quot; online and thru my team at work.<p>As far as working from home in general, I love it. It&#x27;s not for everybody. For most people I believe it&#x27;s 1000% healthier than commuting if you have a full and healthy life outside of work <i>and</i> your job provides at least a modicum of community via daily video calls, etc. It&#x27;s just a simple math equation: there are a fixed number of hours in a week. Since I switched to remote work, I spend less hours commuting and thus I have more time for sleep, other pursuits, exercise, friends, etc.<p>Not everybody feels the same about remote work and that&#x27;s fine. You will quickly discover if it&#x27;s for you!<p>Unexpected hurdles?<p>1. Feeling like you&#x27;re &quot;always at work&quot;. Enforce some kind of physical space for work time. If you don&#x27;t have a separate office, it can even just be a particular chair at the dining room table that is reserved for &quot;work time.&quot;\n2. General lack of respect from friends and family assuming that &quot;work from home&quot; means. They think you aren&#x27;t working, or you can just completely make your own schedule, leave work on a Tuesday afternoon to drive Aunt Sally to the dentist, etc. For folks who&#x27;ve never worked from home it can be hard for them to wrap their heads around it.')
