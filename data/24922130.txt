I also mentioned Proton as only one of several technologies for playing previously Windows-only titles on Linux.<p>I get where you&#x27;re coming from, and I have had my own frustrations with Proton in the past. With that said, even some native Linux ports have been problematic (Rust, 7 Days to Die, etc.) so it&#x27;s not just Proton itself with the issues. Overall though, my experience has been overwhelmingly positive lately, and certainly far better than it was ten years ago.')
