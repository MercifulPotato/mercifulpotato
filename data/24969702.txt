I can sleep in an extra hour or two and hit that 8AM meeting 5 minutes after I wake up. When we have to go back to the office in June, I&#x27;m going to have a problem though.<p>I work in tech, but I live in Michigan and work for the auto industry where the norm seems to be to wake up at 4 and start work with the farmers at 6 AM. I&#x27;m a &quot;late&quot; morning person since I prefer to start at 8 or 9.<p>This has been held against me my entire 25 year career. 15 more to go and then I can sleep how the hell I want.')
