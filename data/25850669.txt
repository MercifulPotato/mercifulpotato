From your link, looks like it&#x27;s ATT who did that.<p>Cox, my ISP, instituted a data cap before the repeal. Furthermore, data caps have zero to do with net neutrality. Preferential billing and routing based on source or destination is certainly more possible with a data cap but data caps are net neutral by themselves. Data caps are cancer but they aren&#x27;t going anywhere unless there&#x27;s competition. Competition may also make net neutrality, as a political issue, obsolete.<p>Net neutrality seems like a red herring to keep the telecom regulatory capture off the front page.')
