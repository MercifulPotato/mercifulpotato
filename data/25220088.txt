A lot of the technical leadership the US has maintained in the 20th century was built on the shoulders of others. Be it the german pharmaceutical industry after world war 1, jewish immigrants from europe, operation paperclip, east european intellectuals during the cold war, asian immigrants fleeing wars, the US has always attracted or coerced these people. And I think atleast voluntary immigration to the US is declining due to the political and social issues with which the US is associated more and more. At least in my wider social circle (Engineering&#x2F;Sciences), very few people are even considering the US to emigrate to anymore, which is a major contrast to 10-15 years ago.')
