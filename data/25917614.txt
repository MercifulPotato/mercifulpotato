I&#x27;m a little confused though I thought Singer was the open source version of Stitch (which you mention briefly): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.singer.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.singer.io</a>. But maybe Singer doesn&#x27;t have all the UI features that Stitch does and that&#x27;s where Airbyte is different? I would love to know more about the differences')
