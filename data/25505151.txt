This would probably be a fun discussion in person. In my experience, most apparent disagreements like this just come down to confusion over which factors are being held constant out of field of view, sensor size, focal length, total amount of light gathered, etc. etc.<p>If the phone was using a slice of a DSLR sensor, then yes, the absolute aperture would be what was relevant, as you obviously cannot improve the resolution of an image merely by cropping it (if you imagine a ultra ultra wide DSLR lens which becomes a normal phone lens after the crop).<p>But two points:<p>First, you&#x27;re then comparing resolution at a focal length that&#x27;s irrelevant to DSLRs, so in practical terms it&#x27;s not a like for like comparison.<p>Second, phones are using sensors with higher pixel density. The question is just whether the phone can use a wide enough fixed aperture to avoid being limited by diffraction at the desired resolution. A fixed aperture of e.g. f1.6 is practical at phone focal lengths but not (as a fixed aperture) at full frame focal lengths. If you calculate the theoretical linear resolution limit imposed by phone camera f-numbers, it&#x27;s approaching 1000 lp&#x2F;mm for the better models (e.g. an iPhone with an f1.6 aperture and a ~10mm sensor). I&#x27;m sure the real limits are lens aberrations and noise at the moment.')
