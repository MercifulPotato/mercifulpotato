You don&#x27;t know what bottlenecks you&#x27;re going to hit as you scale up, so why spend precious development time trying to guess which systems to optimize? And to be clear, &#x27;cloud-scale&#x27; architectures are complicated and bring their own set of issues - why subject yourself to that?<p>Plus a well designed (monolithic) system should get you very far with vertical (resource) scaling and&#x2F;or data sharding.')
