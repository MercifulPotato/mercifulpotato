So what <i>is</i> different? What <i>is</i> included in the Rust binary that isn&#x27;t in the C? Because <i>that&#x27;s</i> what is being tested in these types of comparisons.<p>This difference may be because some language included inefficient instructions - has bloated includes, etc. Or it could be because you&#x27;re comparing Apples to Oranges, eg one ships with libc in the binary, and one dynamically links to it.')
