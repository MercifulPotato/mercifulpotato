So you take the statement that we can recover and shouldn&#x27;t believe in doomsday as let&#x27;s just kill each other? What are you, a Stalinist? ... But I guess you want that since you&#x27;re a nuclear war advocate.<p>Do you understand sarcasm?<p>&gt; You realize the rhetoric of life being over as we know it is increasing suicide rates. People are literally killing themselves because they dont want to live in the narrative that life as we know it is down hill from here.<p>There&#x27;s actually little to no &quot;rhetoric of life being [permanently] over as we know it [due to COVID]&quot; <i>except as a straw man</i>.  There <i>is</i> rhetoric arguing for <i>temporary</i> sacrifices for the greater good, and also rhetoric downplaying or denying the situation to argue against making those sacrifices.<p>A proper appreciation of the seriousness of the situation is not &quot;being a fucking doomsday prophet,&quot; as you said; rather it&#x27;s the mindset that steels one to make the sacrifices that need to be made with the hope that they&#x27;ll work.')
