Staying in guest bedrooms sucks. You have to be quiet at certain hours (and hosts may not be), you cannot do certain things (like walk around without dressing, or return super later, or have sex). I&#x27;d stay in a hotel any day, and would be if anything more reluctant to visit someone with a guest room cause it&#x27;s such a hassle, literally the only reason I can think of to prefer guest rooms is to save money for the visitor.<p>Similarly with cars (in a couple, you are designated driver half the time, you have to look for parking, etc.; although I do have to own a car to go to the mountains, that&#x27;s one use case that is simply not covered by rideshares and such), backyards&#x2F;parks (doing stuff in the backyard is just boring, it&#x27;s much easier to convince me to go to the park).<p>Indeed one would expect the &quot;95%&quot; owned versions to be inferior to the specialized ones; after all, the latter are specialized for a particular purpose, rather than a compromise faux replica like a guest room or a backyard.')
