European and Australian universities should be <i></i>jumping<i></i> at this opportunity:<p>They need to organise themselves to use one platform for giving online lectures. Nearly a year after the start of COVID, universities are all over a place with their software. Some unis allow every lecturer to decide how to do the course forcing students to install sometimes 3! different applications for taking the lecture, sharing documents and taking the exam - per course! Sure, there&#x27;s overlap, but it&#x27;s a little crazy.<p>Then there&#x27;s the problem of proctoring - the best way to sell your students data and invade their privacy. If for reasons beyond your power the internet flakes out or the software has a bug, it&#x27;s either fail or simply resit. MOOCs seem to have already solved this problem, but many universities fail to do any kind of research on the subject.<p>What&#x27;s pretty bad is that many universities don&#x27;t record their lectures despite it being a wonderful tool for learning. You can pause, rewind, speed up, clip and discuss lectures after they happen and increase collaboration with students and the lecturers, but the opportunity seems to be willingly ignored. Even worse, some lecturers are staunchly against being recorded for fear of saying something wrong, but will gladly invite any proctoring company into the homes of their students.<p>We still have a long way to go.<p>Despite many people bemoaning the current pandemic, I think it is having a wonderful impact on the status quo. We had to be rocked out of our comfort zone to be force to innovate because we would&#x27;ve taken decades longer otherwise. This year was a good year.')
