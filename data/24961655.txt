Do you think a plant to cut all funding for renewables or fission and putting it into fusion research amounts to a sound energy policy? Sound approaches to decarbonization are based on technologies that are currently available, not ones that might become available depending on the outcomes of research and development.<p>Nuclear plants definitely could use thermal storage, but the main advantage is of nuclear over renewables is that they have consistent energy production and thus don&#x27;t need storage in the first place. It doesn&#x27;t suffer from the duck curve like solar, or weather-dependent intermittency like wind. Nuclear doesn&#x27;t need storage to become viable, as France has demonstrated for decades.')
