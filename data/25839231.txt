It is just that frugal entrepreneurs are frugal about their comments too :)<p>Jokes aside. It is just not hip to talk about being frugal. You will get media attention if you say you spent million dollars on interior of your startup. That will not happen if you say you bought low-cost or second-hand furniture for your startup. Most long running successful startup founders are frugal. Quitely build the company with minimum financial overhead. The news about &quot;non-frugality&quot; from startups is mostly for PR purpose. If it is not, then it is stupidity on the part of the founder(s).')
