Item(by='romanoderoma', descendants=None, kids=[25361201], score=None, time=1607512624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25349650, text='Homelessness as &quot;a problem to deal with&quot; means society is selfish, means exactly what you wrote.<p>A society where people refuse to see it as a social issue, like sickness, and one that requires a lot of thought because you have to remove them from the eyes of people but don&#x27;t want to deal with the consequences because it&#x27;s actually a cleanse under a different name (decency, decorum, etc.).<p>If SF is the least selfish on the planet (which it isn&#x27;t, unless you consider a few American cities the World), why people refuse to live with what is obviously a byproduct of their lifestyle?<p>You can&#x27;t have all the advantages without any of the drawbacks.<p>Thinking that it is indeed possible is a symptom of a selfish society.<p>I live near the Colosseum in Rome and there are homeless living here, in the city centre. Some of them have been living here more than I&#x27;ve been alive.<p>Nobody thinks they are a problem or have to accept the help, people here accept that where there are people with a lot of money there are gonna be desperate people as well.<p>Because it&#x27;s only natural.<p>And because many have been poor or come from poor families, before being wealthy enough to afford a better life.<p>It&#x27;s easier for homeless to find what they need  to survive in the big city in the wealthy neighborhood than in the small village in the country in the poor quarter.<p>They also feel more protected, for obvious reasons (more people with money means more people willing to give, means more wasted food, better illumination, better public services, etc.)<p>For those in need of medical attention, there is the national healthcare, we call the ambulance, they already know who these people are, bring them in, give them food, a bed and a warm shower and they already know they&#x27;ll be out on the streets again in a couple of days.\nAt least they have been checked and their health conditions assessed.\nBecause it&#x27;s their job, they don&#x27;t have to respond to some kind of profit based mechanism, people taxes already paid for it.<p>Homeless are not treated like a problem, like rejected or defective people, they are taken care of. Because it benefits the society at large.<p>Of course some of them are a problem, but it&#x27;s a tiny minority, our biggest issue is finding as many as possible in winter so they don&#x27;t die in the street for hypothermia or other cold related disease.<p>Of course is not all roses, we are still talking about people living in the edge of society and sometimes dealing with them is not a pleasant experience, but it&#x27;s rare.<p>Also the police here don&#x27;t treat them like criminals, which is an important difference as well, police usually protect them from bad people. They are in fact much more often victims of violence than perpetrators.<p>(According to LAPD report in January this year more than one out of three times police officers used force against homeless people in 2019, a 26% increase from 2018)<p>It&#x27;s really not that hard, especially for one of the richest cities in the richest country in the World.<p>Unwillingness is a form of selfishness.<p>Not learning from what others already do better is a form of entitlement.<p>Which is a form of selfishness.')
