At my employer the largest engineering BU has been a zealous user of Slack for many years.  Problem is, Slack seat licenses aren&#x27;t free (and are thus rationed) and TPBT are balking at adding any more Slack seats now that corp IT is aggressively pushing Teams which is apparently free (since the overall corp has grown a dependence on some mishmash of O365).  The Slack zealots thus appear to be fighting a (losing) rearguard battle against being forced onto Teams.')
