But, here in Hong Kong, not covering your nose and mouth is seen as spit-on-a-baby-rude.  Yea, we have a mask ordinance and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a law against spitting on babies, but 98% of people were wearing masks before the ordinances were passed.  Part of it is fear and self preservation, remembering SARS from 2004, but a lot of it is basic manners.  If you see someone spit on a baby, your first reaction isn&#x27;t &quot;hey, the state will punish you for that&quot;.<p>Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places on the planet, and we&#x27;ve had SARS-CoV2 here since January 2020, but  the population of 7.5 million has fewer than 9,000 confirmed cases.  It helps that at tropical temperatures, the virus survives only a few hours on stainless steel or non-porous plastic, but basic precautions, testing, and contact tracing really work.')
