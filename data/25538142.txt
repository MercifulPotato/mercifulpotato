I know several others who never publically acknowledge their employment, but are active here.<p>The thing that they won&#x27;t do though, is engage in a discussion about Apple products or features, particularly when the issue is an active industry discussion. Apple PR is very explicit about <i>who</i> speaks for the company, and how the company feels about unapproved spokespeople. All corps do this, but Apple takes it very seriously.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the people I know who work at Apple today, either directly or through acquisition, have the usual set of opinions about big companies, but are well-above-average <i>happy</i> at Apple. I don&#x27;t know anyone who wouldn&#x27;t change a thing or two here or there...and the folks that came through acquisition are more mixed, but that&#x27;s all to be expected.')
