Maybe it’s due to the projects I’m sponsoring, but I always had a feeling of “if you’re writing these posts just for us, please don’t bother and just enjoy writing code”. And just to make sure this is not interpreted incorrectly, I mean this in a positive way, I don’t <i>want</i> to be catered to, I want to ensure the survival of the project in the long term.')
