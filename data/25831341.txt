Item(by='KozmoNau7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611046694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821630, text='The thing with Ikea is that they&#x27;re known for cheap&#x2F;disposable furniture, but they also carry furniture made from proper wood, rather than cardboard. My dining table is made from solid wood and you wouldn&#x27;t think twice about standing on it. Obviously it&#x27;s more utilitarian than pretty, but it feels like it&#x27;s made to last. However it also cost a lot more than the flimsy cardboard alternatives right next to it, so it&#x27;s obvious what people end up going home with.<p>I will also say that their kitchen cabinets are significantly higher quality than their other lines of shelves and cabinets. Better fasteners, hinges and so on. Yet again, they are significantly more expensive than most of the other furniture they carry.<p>Still, the amount of proper hardwood furniture in second hand stores is baffling to me, when you see people lugging home glorified cardboard disguised as furniture.')
