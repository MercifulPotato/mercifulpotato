Players of violent video games have diverse environments, social supports, and other factors. These mitigate the effects of playing these kinds of games; in other words, while the games may encourage violent behavior, person A with a stable environment and strong social supports may not be effected in the same way (or enough to measure). Person B with a different environment and fewer supports may exhibit violent behavior. Some studies may <i>claim</i> to account for these, but that should be met with skepticism and rigorous discussion.')
