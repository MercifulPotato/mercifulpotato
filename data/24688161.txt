Why would you need to keep referencing it to the point that it&#x27;s inconvenient to have it in another branch?<p>&gt; you&#x27;d need to keep each branch alive still, each time based on the squashed history plus your individual commits up until the next squash.<p>exactly what I do, and there are maybe just three or four branches I maintain for reference, very few squashed branches are useful a couple of weeks after they are released.')
