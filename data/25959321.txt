You can start with www.healthcare.gov and go from there.  You can also buy short term insurance from an association or group you are a member i.e ieee.org and others.<p>If you are outside the US, you can buy it directly from insurance companies.  \nYou did not say if you are leaving a job with insurance - if that is the case, you can use healthcare.gov when you leave.<p>I am not sure how the laws are now, but you can structure your company so healthcare is a benefit for everyone.  You will probably need a small salary to make it all work out.  Definitely a question for your accountant.<p>Good luck on your company!')
