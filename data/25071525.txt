Unless you were in the in-group, you were screwed.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt your annecdote. I guess all I can say is, welcome to the club? Being part of the &quot;out group&quot; in a toxic workplace sucks. I&#x27;ve had men come up to me and say, &quot;Wow now I get it.&quot; Because in their entire lives they had only worked on male dominated teams, and working on a toxic non hetero non male dominated team made them really uncomfortable, they were fine working on toxic hetero male dominated teams. All the norms had changed and they didn&#x27;t know what to do. But until they experienced it themselves didn&#x27;t get &quot;what the big deal&quot; is.<p>I stay in tech because I don&#x27;t want to be forced to take a lower salary because of cultural attitudes that women being around &quot;ruins the atmosphere&quot;. But yes if I had a pile of FU money, I would bail in a second, not because I&#x27;m busy taking care of children or whatever excuse, but because people are insecure, emotionally immature and create a great deal of toxicity.')
