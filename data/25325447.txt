Being able to build a function library beyond User Defined (UDF, VBA functions that can be called from a formula) and a Personal.xlsb file (VBA that&#x27;s available in any open Excel file)<p>One common use case this helps takes the general form &quot;If A2+B2 &gt; 10,then A2+B2, else 10&quot;. &quot;A2+B2&quot; needs to be updated, it has to be updated twice. Alternately, you could have a &quot;helper column&quot; C2=A2+B2, but this adds clutter to the whole spreadsheet.<p>I have a number of UDF&#x27;s which lend themselves well to this, such as a triangular distribution calculator. Execution through Lambda should allow the undo stack to continue working (normally ditched by executing VBA) and hopefully give a performance boost.')
