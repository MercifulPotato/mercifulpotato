A few key assumptions are based into the runtime, namely that the GC is a generational GC with contiguous regions and that the GC doesn&#x27;t need a read barrier, among many other things. There&#x27;s a bunch of assembly in the runtime that embeds some implementation details of the GC in a way that&#x27;s hard to decouple. The API came about by untangling the GC and the rest of the runtime; it took a lot of work and the resulting API probably isn&#x27;t what we&#x27;d choose if we were building a GC with it in mind from day 1, but the whole scheme of sideloading a GC works pretty well.')
