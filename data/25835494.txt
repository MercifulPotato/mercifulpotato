If you have some Bitcoin you &quot;own&quot; it much like you would own a physical thing, like a lump of gold. And indeed, you are right, to implement a permissionless equity based currency, you probably need something like proof of work to ensure that there is an objective ordering of transactions.<p>However....! You can also build a credit based currency, whereby anyone can issue IOUs which are agreements between a debtor and a creditor. In this regard you don&#x27;t &quot;own&quot; an IOU but you are a participant in an agreement which is an IOU. That might be pedantic but it&#x27;s a difference from an equity based money system. For a credit based system you don&#x27;t need proof of work or an objective ordering of transactions as any transaction is just a bilateral agreement between two parties. You could make the IOUs bearer instruments by introducing some blockchain elements (unilateral ledger updates) but ultimately there isn&#x27;t much point in this because you have to trust the issuer. The difficulty with this type of system is that it&#x27;s tough to bootstrap it - how do you measure reputation in such a system? How do you determine who&#x27;s credit is good and who&#x27;s credit is bad?<p>I think it would be exciting to see more research into distributed credit based monetary systems. Interestingly, our current monetary system is basically a pure credit system and that in this system we can view different types of credit as having a position in a money hierarchy. At the top you have central bank credit, next bank credit, next company credit, next credit issued by individuals. When an issuer&#x27;s credit can be trusted enough such that people can use it as a medium of exchange (it can be endorsed from one party to another) then it _becomes_ money. That&#x27;s quite cool. You can build a whole distributed monetary system from an endogenous money supply!')
