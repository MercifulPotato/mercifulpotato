The strategic changes were immediate, (and aimed at shorter term gains, things that people besides Jobs thought were being left on the table) the effects just took a long time to really add up to something meaningful.  IMO, they never really recovered, they just are massive and have a HELL of a lot of momentum.  It takes time to undermine that all even if you do everything wrong.  They definitely are still doing some things right, but IMO, the type of thing you are complaining about is a leadership issue.')
