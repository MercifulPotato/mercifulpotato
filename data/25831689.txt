Doing it at the server stage requires running an encoder for each user connected to the meeting, which increases broadcast costs imensily for Zoom. It would make sense for security reasons, but the trend with them seems to be profit instead.<p>If watermarking is therefore done at the client stage just before being heard&#x2F;seen at each endpoint, then there is a good chance that it is hackable and watermarking code could be patched or audio&#x2F;video extracted before watermarking occurs.<p>It would still require whistle-blowers to take this more envolved step before leaking a meeting though.')
