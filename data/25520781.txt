Go watch it.  She&#x27;s surrounded by about 8 cops and no one else is present.<p>Note that Villanueva&#x27;s original statement about this incident (that she had no credentials and did not identify herself) was a straight lie, again given clear video evidence.  So I don&#x27;t understanding why you&#x27;re deferring to him here.  Again: watch the video.  It is ABUNDANTLY clear that the police knew she was a journalist and that they knew she wasn&#x27;t part of the protest, and that they were punishing her for trying to record their actions.  It really is.<p>Is it really so hard to admit that, yes, cops do bad things sometimes, that we should track that via objective metrics like the linked article, and that this year they&#x27;ve done more of them?')
