Message boards are all silos that don&#x27;t mingle with each other in any way. You&#x27;re saying the only part where Mastodon diverges is this thing that makes it markedly unlike message boards. I don&#x27;t see the connection at all, not even to Proboards&#x2F;Ezboard which had one global account across many boards.<p>I&#x27;d summarize Mastodon as a confusing version of Twitter that most technical people don&#x27;t even understand. Drawing such a bad analogy like &quot;it&#x27;s basically like 2000s message boards&quot; just drives this home even further.<p>It&#x27;s like nobody can explain what it is. Though I suspect it&#x27;s like monads where people need to drop the belabored metaphors and use simple language. Though then you just end up with something like &quot;it&#x27;s Twitter but the same UI shows people registered elsewhere.&quot;')
