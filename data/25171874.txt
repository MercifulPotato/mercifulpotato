Item(by='StaticGenie', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1605985327, title='Early feedback on TypeScript static website generator', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='TL;DR; Made redundant so built a typescript static website generator for fun ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StaticGenie&#x2F;StaticGenie ), pass some time and give back to the open source community. Now asking for feedback, ideas, thoughts, good, bad, etc.<p>---<p>I was made redundant from my job (thanks COVID). During this time of unemployment I thought I&#x27;d do some programming. So thought of making a static website generator using TypeScript. I know there are many generators that already exist. But, I just wanted to create something new, up to date, using the tools of today and to pass some time both programming and mingling with the open source dev community.<p>Here&#x27;s the static website generator on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StaticGenie&#x2F;StaticGenie and the website https:&#x2F;&#x2F;StaticGenie.com primarily for the docs.<p>The docs have a few pages incomplete (been working on them today and will do for the rest of the weekend) but there should be enough info to get a good idea of the generator, architecture and how it works. The generator is functional and was used to create the staticgenie.com website.<p>I am primarily just looking for any contributors, any feedback (good and bad), ideas of where I could take this, anything to help really?<p>Thanks.')
