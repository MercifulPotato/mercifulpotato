I&#x27;ve noticed two types of outrage most commonly voiced by the general population on the Internet:<p>- Outrage about things that have no bearing on their lives. That&#x27;s, in a big part, continuous dramas about what a famous person said, or - if no celebrity said anything controversial this week - about what some random people are saying. This includes drama as spectator sports - like few people get offended at each other, but it gets magnified to a million-large audience, because everyone gets offended at an offense.<p>- Outrage about things that <i>have</i> bearing on their lives, but misguided and misdirected. Knee-jerk reactions to government decisions, as well as general politics, are a lion&#x27;s share of that. This is the problem with simplistic views, that manifest on the social media. If you talked with any random person individually about an issue that affects them, you could likely help them reach a nuanced position - that takes into account second-order effects, and reflects the understanding that most policy decisions involve optimizing across the entire population. But on social media, almost all you see is repeating soundbites and arguing in circles.<p>To a large extent, both of those types I can confidently classify as manufactured by media, traditional and social alike. Not entirely intentionally - it&#x27;s a bunch of feedback loops we&#x27;re stuck in[0]. But the consequence is that exposure to the hivemind can easily drag you way past &quot;declining faith in government&quot;, and all the way to idiocy.<p>--<p>[0] - Some of the pieces from which the loops are assembled: traditional media earns money through ads, so will systematically prioritize things that generate more pageviews. Algorithms on social media optimize for engagement, which also means promoting things people are statistically likely to engage with. Humans seem to have a natural tendency to pay attention to the gossips about people of highest status. Thinking is hard, knee-jerk reactions are easy. Soundbites are easier to digest and have more immediate emotional impact than well-thought-through, nuanced arguments. Add all that together, and you get a strong, sustained pressure to dumb down our social discourse.')
