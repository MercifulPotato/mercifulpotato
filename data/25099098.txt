I don&#x27;t think so much depends on having two threads rather than one at this moment.<p>But there are exceptions to everything and the two threads are curiously distinct, in a way that makes merging them feel a bit wrong, like merging two different meals or something. So I think it&#x27;s fine for indecision and oddity to win out for a change.')
