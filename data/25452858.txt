To prevent criticality, workers did the nuclear equivalent of pulling the plug on a bathtub. They used a &quot;crit valve&quot; to dump plutonium nitrate from the glovebox to the factory floor. That prevented a criticality disaster from ever occuring at Rocky Flats.<p>&quot;When you got more than 2 inches of liquid in a box, you&#x27;d have a choice - you either have a criticality, or you have a cleanup job,&quot;<p>said Don Sabac, a Rocky Flats worker since 1961. &quot;You always chose the cleanup job.&quot;<p>For a worker, that meant dropping to his or her hands and knees and scrubbing the plutonium solution off the floor with industrial cleanser, called K.W., and strengthened paper towels called Kimwipes.<p>That didn&#x27;t always work. Acids in plutonium solutions often ate through concrete floors or walls and prevented a thorough cleanup. So workers painted over dozens of radioactive areas with purple or brown epoxy.<i>')
