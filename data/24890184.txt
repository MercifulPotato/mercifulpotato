Without having to set up VNC and a window manager etc etc on the remote computer.<p>Of course this feature also needs a big review. It needs proper security (though tunneling over SSH fixes a lot of that) and there&#x27;s too many back-and-forths in the protocol leading to it being really sluggish over high-latency connections. Makes sense as it was mainly invented for X-terminals on a local network. Also, more and more features like fonts are now rendered remotely instead of locally on the user&#x27;s computer (the server in X terminology). NX and X2go fix that mostly but it would be great to have this in the actual protocol. As well as provisions for smooth video streaming.<p>As well as that, the whole computing industry is moving back from powerful endpoints (PCs) to powerful central computing (now cloud, the mainframes&#x2F;powerful unix servers in the early days of X). So really, this feature will become more important again.<p>But yeah I would really prefer to see X11 being brought up to date rather than Wayland. Wayland is focused way too much on the local desktop.')
