I think there&#x27;s great merit to &#x27;gut feeling&#x27; from field experts, even if they cannot support it with data at the moment, maybe because the nature of the thing is exploratory at that certain stage or it&#x27;s simply too chaotic. Experience and intuition coming from experts tenured in relevant areas is priceless - but it doesn&#x27;t have to come with hierarchy or power based authority. When people naturally respect someone they will listen. No need to force it.')
