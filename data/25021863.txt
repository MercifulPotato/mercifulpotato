But your reply is a perfect example of the problem I&#x27;m talking about, and it is present on both sides of the equation (i.e. I&#x27;m going to point some things out, but please don&#x27;t read that as meaning that I think this is a problem that only some people on one side participate in - both are incredibly guilt of it, generally speaking).<p>So here goes:<p>&gt; One candidate supports separating children from their families<p>This is objectively false. Nobody &quot;supports&quot; that position at all as a matter of policy - rather you have oversimplified a complex problem to the point of absurdity. A police officer pulls over a drunk driver and finds kids in the car. The driver is arrested. Do the kids go too? No, of course not. Is it correct to say that &quot;the police support separating children from their families&quot;? Only in the most technical and intentionally misleading sense. Is it their policy to find ways to separate kids from parents? Of course not. Are there sometimes situations in which the only practical solution is to separate some kids from their parents? Yep!<p>&gt; keeping them in cages<p>Again, nobody &quot;supports&quot; keeping children in cages. (and do keep in mind that these so-called &quot;cages&quot; were used by earlier administrations too) But consider this situation: your country has a standing policy that when a refugee comes to your border, instead of turning them away, you let them in, you keep them in a temporary facility while you try to go through the legal process of evaluating their asylum claims or whatever because your country also has a standing policy that people just can&#x27;t wander into the country unaccounted for. Most of the time, these two policies can be in harmony, but one day 20k people show up on your doorstep. Policy A says you don&#x27;t turn them away, policy B says you don&#x27;t let them loose into the country. What do you do? And I&#x27;m not talking about what would be the long term ideal, if we have unlimited time and money. I mean what do you do about this problem &#x2F;today&#x2F;? You&#x27;re probably going to scramble and set up some temporary shelter while you get the policymakers to start figuring out a real solution, but you can&#x27;t just call into existence beds, food, and furnishings.<p>&gt; and has lost track of 500 of them.<p>The president obviously doesn&#x27;t track them to begin with, so Trump obviously didn&#x27;t lose track of them (any more than the 800,000 who are reported missing each year were personally lost by Trump - see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-missing-children&#x2F;missing-children-in-u-s-nearly-always-make-it-home-alive-idUSBRE83P14020120426" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-missing-children&#x2F;miss...</a>).<p>I&#x27;m not really interested in debating these specific policies, because the larger issue is that you can look at things one of two ways:\n1) There are 70 million people who voted for an idiot. By extension, they must be terrible to some degree or another too.\n2) The solution to any &quot;interesting&quot; problem - especially social problems - involves tradeoffs, conflicting objectives, pros and cons. If the solution really were trivial and simple, we wouldn&#x27;t argue about it. The debate is because it&#x27;s so complex, and with any really complex problem, you can have very reasonable and intelligent people draw different conclusions on how best to proceed.<p>If you choose to see the U.S through the lens of #1, you may as well give up now, because it&#x27;s hopeless - those people are barely people and are separated from you by an insurmountable gulf. OTOH lens #2 is hopeful - you see that ultimately everyone wants pretty much the same high level objectives, the debate is the path to get there and how to spend limited resources. With #1, nothing will get done. With #2, potentially everything is possible.')
