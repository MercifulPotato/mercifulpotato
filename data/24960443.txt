Write a throwaway script in a light, fast interpreted language, and then share it with your compiled, native platform-specific UI code. If you need to update that one script, the app can phone home and get the latest. No need to update the entire app.<p>That&#x27;s how I wrote multiplatform code 7 years ago, using hidden webviews in the background.<p>Unfortunately, Android or iOS to this day have not supported JS (or really Node&#x2F;V8) as a first-class citizen.
