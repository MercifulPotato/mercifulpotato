This let him steal votes from Democrats as people wanted to try something different.  Trump&#x27;s rhetoric was tailored to them(&quot;drain the swamp&quot;, immigration crackdowns, economic warfare, etc).<p>- He fired up the right-wing base of the party and got them to show up at the polls.  This caused increased enthusiasm and helped drive turnout of all GOP leaning voters I believe.<p>Also, let&#x27;s not forget that Hillary Clinton, rightly or wrongly, was just not a very likeable candidate with broad appeal.  She did win the popular vote, but as we all know that is meaningless.<p>Now we&#x27;ve had 4 years to see what Trump was capable of.  His primary opponents will be able to point to his record instead of just his promises. I don&#x27;t think Trump will come back for another round.  He&#x27;ll be too old in 4 years, and won&#x27;t want to risk being a loser again.  Also, don&#x27;t forget that he has pending legal and financial issues to sort out after his presidency is over.<p>I suspect you will see someone else, maybe someone from the Trump family, run again with a Trump-like platform.  They may very well win if the Democrats can&#x27;t recalibrate their platform to appeal to more voters in electorally important states.  I&#x27;m seeing a lot of wishful thinking regarding getting rid of the electoral college and it is frankly laughable.  It&#x27;s not happening anytime in the next 50 years.  Small states will <i>never</i> give up that power.  The best you could do is convince GOP leaders in &#x27;purpling&#x27; states like TX to opt for a proportional assignment strategy to rob the Dems of the entire block of electoral votes once the state goes fully blue.')
