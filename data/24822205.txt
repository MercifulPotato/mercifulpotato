It that I am realistic about the situation. I would rather have Linux native options for my games rather than a translation layer. However for that to happen there has to be a viable market.<p>In some ways I think a translation layer will make it less likely there will be a Native port because devs will just rely on the compatibility layer. I am aware of counter arguments to my position and I could be wrong. We will fin out in time.<p>&gt; your assumption that the translation layer is all that counts assumes driver parity between os&#x27;es. both for 3d &amp; game streaming, there are significant performance and capability differences between os&#x27;es.<p>Nope I never said that the translation layer is all that matters. But given everything else being equal (it normally is btw) it will always have lower performance.<p>One native games Linux and Windows performance stats is roughtly the same framerate (if both games are using OpenGL or Vulkan). The difference in performance is 1-2FPS. If the game isn&#x27;t native then then there will be a penalty in using a translation layer and compatibility issues. This aligns perfectly with what I have observed.<p>&gt;  i&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d spend so much effort so loudly making your personal point about your expectations on a day when others are happy &amp; revelling in the ongoing progress &amp; hope &amp; freedom &amp; opening of possibilities that they want to see.<p>I&#x27;ve left a comment on a website it isn&#x27;t a huge effort. It takes me a few minutes to write a reply at most.<p>In any event it is important for people to be informed by the pitfalls. This is mainly because I&#x27;ve seen many people tout all the positives of alternatives without people informing people of the potential pitfalls.')
