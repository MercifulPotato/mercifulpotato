(Not saying your autism didn’t mask symptoms but what you described happens in ADHD without autism very frequently)<p>For example I have ADHD without autism and grew up thinking I was “smart but lazy” because I was &gt; 99% as far as raw intelligence but had little motivation for the drudgery associated with school (or indeed life itself), yet I could play video games for hours straight   without seeming to be at a disadvantage compared to neurotypical peers.<p>This is because ADHD, among other things, is a disorder of attention <i>regulation</i> as opposed to being completely unable to pay attention to anything.')
