This is a massive dependency for Microsoft.</i><p>The moat that Win32 provides has been eroding for a long time. That&#x27;s why Microsoft has shifted their focus to the cloud. This technology might slow things a little but the writing is on the wall.<p>Most enterprises want to deliver software through a browser, the last thing they want to do is install software on the client. My customers have been telling me this for two decades now. They don&#x27;t even like having Office run locally, they will drop it as soon as the browser version is viable.<p>Microsoft will be fine, they appear to be a long way along that journey already. I&#x27;m not so sure about Intel though. It&#x27;s in Microsoft&#x27;s interest for processors to become a commodity product. They would be over the moon if the competition sucked all the profits out of AMD&#x2F;Intel.<p>The people who should be most worried though are the HP&#x2F;Lenovo&#x2F;Dells of this world. They have been happy to be carried along on the coat tails of WinTel for decades now. They will struggle to adapt to this new world.')
