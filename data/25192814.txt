I&#x27;m not saying that you should beleiev it now, just accept for a moment that that happened. Now, let&#x27;s say it took 50 generations for this to happen, for a minor difference.<p>If you then tried to think how this could look like in dogs, it would presumably also take something like 50 generations to happen in dogs as well. Let&#x27;s say again that you do this experiment on dogs, and a few decades later you become convinced that indeed you can produce two species of dogs through selective breeding. Since tthis took a few decades,it is obvious that for more pronounced changes to come about, it would take a lot more time than that, right? Sure, until we do the experiment, maybe it would happen, maybe not - but for sure, we can&#x27;t find out in a reasonable amount of time.<p>But furthermore, if we did find out that through artificial selection we can produce 2 different species from the same dog, doesn&#x27;t it make sense to wonder what would happen in nature if a group of dogs got naturally separated in 2? And also, if we let this process run for even more time, many many generations of separation, wouldn&#x27;t it make sense that the species could become arbitrarily different from the original?<p>And if not, then you have to explain why the process doesn&#x27;t continue - why would the species remain largely dog-like? (remember, this is all under the assumption that we have already confirmed that we were able to successfully produce 2 different species of dog through artificial selection).<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t think I can convince you that the assumption I proposed is true. I for sure can&#x27;t claim to have done this experiment myself, with flies or anything else. But the point was to show what kinds of arguments make peeople like me be highly confident in evolution, given some initial assumptions.')
