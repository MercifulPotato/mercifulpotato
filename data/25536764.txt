Item(by='DinakarS', descendants=2, kids=[25537203], score=1, time=1608907809, title='Ask HN: Need help with growing our community of founders', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='From researching about communities to building and taking it live, I have given my focus to every aspect, all the way from the start.<p>Yet, there&#x27;s a struggle with getting it off the ground.<p>It&#x27;s really hard get founders to see us, deliver the value and get them join us. After they join us it&#x27;s hard to have them talk. I think we&#x27;re at catch 22. We focus on building relationships over just networking and I personally want to help members 1-on-1 with their goals and struggles. For an offer as compelling as this, we&#x27;re still not getting signups. I believe in this idea, but it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m selling something that nobody wants.<p>It&#x27;s a community of founders at join.coulf.com and I&#x27;m a founder myself, so I built something that I wish existed. But after getting harsh feedback from other founders, i.e. &quot;who cares about relationships or your support&quot; &quot;we need something to sell to others, a distribution channel. Not this&quot; among other ones, I&#x27;m thinking of pivoting to focus on networks rather than relationships, and generic community stuff rather than 1-on-1 help with projects and accountability.<p>Is it bad to pivot into this networking and generic community concept?<p>I don&#x27;t believe in that, but that&#x27;s what people want. I just don&#x27;t want the work I&#x27;ve put in get wasted so I&#x27;m in a dilemma to choose networking aspect or stick to what I believe and try to grow it.')
