It gets you the exact same seat as someone who booked on Expedia six months prior but costs an eyewatering amount of money because you usually bought it at the last minute and are just grateful to be on the plane.  Both times, something went wrong, once with an airplane having a minor equipment failure midflight and another where the required airplane never showed up.  (It hadn&#x27;t taken off from its origin and we were due to fly back from an airport that only got two flights per day via this airline.)<p>Both times the amount of money I spent mattered little.  I was an economy-class passenger with no status on that airline.  I wound up having to deal with getting myself where I needed to go via another airline and clawing back the money for both unused tickets.<p>Unless you have status, airlines are privatized versions of public transport, just with wings.  In point of fact, I&#x27;ve been treated better by King County Metro in Seattle[0] than I have by virtually every airline I&#x27;ve flown when an issue has happened.<p>0 - I used to work the late evening shift at my job and would take the last Seattle-bound bus of the night to get home.  Once, because a driver forgot that the route served a slightly different set of stops during that part of the day versus the rest of the day, the stop I was waiting at got skipped.  After 30 minutes of waiting for a bus that OneBusAway claimed had long-since departed, I called Metro&#x27;s customer service line to see if it really was coming.  Someone answered, reached out to the driver, and figured out what happened.  They sent a supervisor in a van to pick up me and the two other passengers who were waiting and took us all directly home.')
