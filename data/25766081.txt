Item(by='politelemon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610562571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25759630, text='&gt; Signal could do a lot better in connecting with the community of users who care to connect. Remember that the users have a stake in this, so dismissing their feedback as “this is free, don’t ask for more” is actually condescending. Without users and users who evangelize the product in their circles, no such project can expand or thrive.<p>&gt; Signal team, you could also practice being nicer and more attentive.<p>I&#x27;ve been interacting with Signal and observing Signal interacting with people for several years now and I have observed the opposite of what you&#x27;re saying here.  They are nice, they are attentive, and they do a great job of connecting with their community.  They don&#x27;t always do what I ask, and that&#x27;s OK.<p>I will be a little provocative even, and say that you&#x27;re deliberately misrepresenting what has been said in their post (dismissing their feedback as “this is free, don’t ask for more” is actually condescending) - that&#x27;s bad faith, and maybe their post is aimed at you.  It will be beneficial if you attempt to separate the emotion and try rereading what they have said.')
