You are in no power to enter suspect&#x27;s premises in search for facts of him committing the burglary, unless you have a warrant from a court issued to the police to do so. And you cannot have that warrant until you get courts start the official process of hearing from witnesses. That&#x27;s exactly the scenario of the alleged election fraud by mail-in ballots, where votes were  (allegedly) stolen by some suspected actors with some suspected means.')
