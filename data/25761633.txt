There are various reasons for the data collection.  One is obviously marketing, but another may also be identifying bad actors.<p>Also, almost all stores have rewards programs of sorts that amount to a few percentage points of discount in exchange for tracking your purchases.  People will, by and large, willingly give their identifying information in exchange for this, so I think it&#x27;s inevitable (unless this type of discount was outlawed).<p>&gt;Is this currently a major problem at big box stores (excluding Amazon because they intentionally ignore the issue)? I personally can&#x27;t remember a single occurrence of me buying goods in a supermarket that ended up being used&#x2F;damaged in a way I could tell.<p>I don&#x27;t know, I just know I would rather have something new.  I assume electronics or stuff that can be invisibly damaged gets sent back to the manufacturer or sold as refurbished after it is returned.<p>&gt;And yet money is still being pissed away in marketing, which means they do have money to spare. Why do you think the savings would trickle down to the consumers instead of just being &quot;invested&quot; into either marketing or something else?<p>How are you determining that money is being pissed away?  Are you suggesting all these retail business owners and operators are wasting money that they could be pocketing?<p>&gt;Starting a supermarket isn&#x27;t an easy task; the barrier of entry and the upfront costs (for the retail location alone) is insane, so I find it hard that competition would prevent this.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to start a retail business.  That&#x27;s why the profit margins are so low, it&#x27;s all very textbook microeconomics.  In fact, with the internet, the retail location matters even less, so the barriers to entry got even lower and now Chinese manufacturers can directly sell to buyers.  It&#x27;s exactly in this situation that marketing and brand awareness (presumably to advertise quality control) is valuable.')
