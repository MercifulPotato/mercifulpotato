I was really thinking of ‘hostile environments’ rather than growing on Mars.<p>Powering my underground Mars farm was a challenge but I sorted that out with a nuclear battery. Whatever. Shouldn’t be a problem for earth tunnel farms.<p>HST: I think if we are to colonize space and start living out there, we could convert earth into a ‘garden of Eden’ ..a work in progress, as it were..with a skeleton farming team tending and supplying food to the space earthlings.<p>Or if we are to colonies a planet, it would be in the form of a cluster of sealed habitats or environments. And each habitat will be vacated as it regenerates ...in a way, a kind of progression of seasonal changes. Only..on earth, the seasons change. Up there, we will simply move to a seasonal module. This way, we can regenerate and deal with waste&#x2F;recyclables etc.')
