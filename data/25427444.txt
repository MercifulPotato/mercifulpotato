Perhaps I disagree with a solution. Or I do not give all the information needed to solve a problem so the person has to ask. Or I give hints on the way and see how receptive the person is. And so on.<p>After that it&#x27;s just part of the conversation. Probing the resume. And asking some of these question flat out. I also discuss real practical problems&#x2F;challenges we have at work, most of which require a team to work together.<p>We also (used to pre-covid) take the person for lunch and decidedly talk not about work at that time.<p>Of course it&#x27;s different between an engineer fresh from college and a seasoned software engineer or architect.<p>In the end, I think interviewing is itself a skill one needs to train. Just having a person solve some brain-teasers doesn&#x27;t cut it. I have _way_ more teams, co-founders, etc, fail due to social issue rather than technical skills.<p>And I am by no means presuming that I&#x27;m good at it, just that these are things I look for.<p>An important part I forgot to mention in the first post that the person is interviewing the company as much as we interview the person. So we leave a significant amount of time for asking questions about the company... and try to make a good impression.<p>(Sorry for the essay.)')
