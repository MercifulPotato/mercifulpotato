But the ones who publish these apps are usually just &quot;non-profits run by single individuals who can&#x27;t afford all the bureaucracy required to run a non-profit.&quot;<p>Keep in mind that FOSS apps like WireGuard are 1. entirely free, 2. with no ads, restrictions, or nags to donate. There&#x27;s nothing you get from the app, or from the developer, by sending them a &quot;monetary gift.&quot; Other than the fact that you can&#x27;t claim it on your taxes, they&#x27;re effectively working for a non-profit that produces this software.<p>If you consider someone offering a link to send them &quot;monetary gifts&quot; to pay their own salary to allow them to continue to work on an app they don&#x27;t charge for, &quot;a business&quot; â€” I&#x27;d hate to see what you call a church, or a library, or PBS.')
