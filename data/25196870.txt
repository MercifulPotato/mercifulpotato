The teams I work in are filled with quiet people who either simply lack confidence, or worse even, have no personal opinion about the topic at all. They&#x27;re frustrating to work with because <i>someone</i> has to drive meetings, bring up problems, and come up with solutions to these problems and if the whole team were filled with these &quot;gorgeous quiet creatures&quot;, nothing would get done. The energy seems more like &quot;I don&#x27;t really care about this just tell me what to do&quot; rather than &quot;I am brilliantly analysing this situation as a wall flower ready to spring to life when it&#x27;s most important&quot;. Even if they were the latter, how&#x27;s a meeting supposed to function this way? Are meetings really theatrical exercises, or a game where the person who says the most clever thing in a few words as possible wins?')
