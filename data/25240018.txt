Every Intel MacBook back to 2016 has broken thermals. They&#x27;re all running at maybe half their rated clock speed. 13&quot; MBP is a 4GHz part running at 1.4GHz. 16&quot; MBP is a 4.8GHz part throttled to 2.3GHz. You&#x27;re comparing M1 vs. a broken design <i>which Apple broke</i>.<p>Don&#x27;t congratulate Apple for failing to ship trash.<p>There&#x27;s an argument for efficiency on a laptop, no doubt, but that&#x27;s not what the parent commenter is talking about.<p>M1 is the highest perf-per-watt CPU today, no question. Ignoring efficiency, there are plenty of faster CPUs both for single-core and multi-core tasks. That&#x27;s what &quot;my Hackintosh did the build in 5 minutes&quot; is showing.')
