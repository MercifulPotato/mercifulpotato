I always make a point when I have time to mention how I’ve solved it.<p>If you haven’t already, try plugging the power in on the right side, and the display&#x2F;any other peripherals on the left. It sounds crazy, but this has been the solution for tons of people. Apparently the heat generated by power input (even at a steady full charge) is enough to spike the sensors near the components on the left side.<p>I haven’t experienced any downsides to this change other than having to spend a few minutes rearranging stuff on my desk.')
