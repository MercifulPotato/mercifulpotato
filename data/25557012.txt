I&#x27;ve also considered sending thanks through the email addresses provided in package control (although it seems a bit weird emailing strangers, especially when you&#x27;re not explicitly seeking a response). Starring a repo is also an (admittedly small) way to show thanks. What are some other ways to reach out?')
