If folks had stayed in for a few weeks at the start, it would be substantially over now as evidenced by all the countries in which it&#x27;s substantially over. Instead by going out like petulant children \nwho won&#x27;t be told no, we have a giant flaming disaster. That would be an example of &#x27;disagree and commit.&#x27;<p>I&#x27;m open to the idea that a lockdown would work, and I&#x27;m also open to the idea it&#x27;s not necessary because some subset of restriction is enough, or because we&#x27;re willing to pay the cost of excess mortality during vaccine development -- the one argument I&#x27;m not open to is &quot;but muh freedom.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sorry that reality doesn&#x27;t always map to the libertarian ideal. Sometimes you have to compromise temporarily for the greater good. For your <i>own</i> greater good. For a net gain in freedom.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aatishb.com&#x2F;covidtrends&#x2F;?location=Australia&amp;location=China&amp;location=New+Zealand&amp;location=Taiwan&amp;location=US" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aatishb.com&#x2F;covidtrends&#x2F;?location=Australia&amp;location...</a>')
