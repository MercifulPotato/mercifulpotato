I was hoping that ReactOS would stick with the Windows 2000 look and feel. I also think that with the limited resources they have, the project team would be better focusing on improving compatibility, over shiny desktop effects.<p>That said... I firmly believe there is a place for ReactOS. Eventually, XP will fail to run on new hardware, and when that happens a lot of great software will die also. Having ReactOS around means we can continually target new hardware, but still remain XP compatible.<p>Personally, I view software like I do books. We can read books written 100s of years ago, but we struggle to run 10 year old software. This has to change, else we&#x27;ll endlessly repeat ourselves rewriting the same programs over and over again.')
