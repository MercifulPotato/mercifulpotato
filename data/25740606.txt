Item(by='xoa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610411904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25740141, text='&gt;<i>that somehow this company&#x27;s business should be treated differently than any other company&#x27;s business--which, FWIW, to me is a pretty ridiculous assertion</i><p>This is such a ludicrous statement I honestly am having trouble thinking out to respond. Companies in different industries being treated differently is the universal rule throughout the world and human history. Airliners aren&#x27;t accountants aren&#x27;t computer hardware manufacturers aren&#x27;t electrical companies aren&#x27;t sports operations aren&#x27;t restaurants aren&#x27;t railways aren&#x27;t... etc etc. A physical infrastructure company isn&#x27;t an internet platform, and shouldn&#x27;t be. Seriously what!?<p>&gt;<i>your frame here is kind of irrelevant to the question of whether there&#x27;s irony to be had from censoring someone over censorship</i><p>No, it&#x27;s not remotely irrelevant precisely because different areas of society have different rules. However much you hate Free Speech saurik, at least in America it is the law, and the humans that make up, own, and direct the entities of Twitter or Facebook have the exact same 1st Amendment rights that the rest of us do. It&#x27;s not &quot;censorship&quot; for you, me, or any other regular private entity to refuse to actively provide help for others&#x27; speech. You aren&#x27;t <i>entitled</i> to my money or property to spread your message, nor am I to yours, unless we are making use of certain public resources.<p>And that last bit brings us back to ISPs, or USPS&#x2F;FedEx&#x2F;UPS for that matter. A physical infrastructure company using public money and rights of way and escaping liability for providing carriage via Common Carrier does not have those same rights, anymore than a public university has the same rights as a private one.')
