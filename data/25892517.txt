Luckily the distances here are not as great as for instance in the US, so my colleague who lives in a town perceived as &quot;far away&quot; from the city has a ~1 hour commute by car. For comparison, I live 6km away from work (well within good public transit coverage) and it takes me around 35 minutes by bus.<p>As a downside to distances being generally shorter, we also don&#x27;t have the same vast impressive swathes of nature that the US and Canada do, plus historically we cut down most of our forests to maintain an impressive navy. However we do have some forests left and plenty of coastline, no part of the country is more than 50km from the coast, there is still plentiful natural beauty to admire.<p>So it is possible to live closer to nature here, while still being not <i>too</i> far away from the city. In the long run, I may also want to get out of IT and do something less stressful and more &quot;real&quot;, but that&#x27;s something I&#x27;m still weighing the pros and cons of. There is also the consideration that by living in the city, I have very easy access to events and dining experiences, which is something I do still value, even if the pandemic has made all of that seem like the distant past.<p>One thing I do know is that I&#x27;m not interested in suburbia. It&#x27;s either apartment living or close to nature, I&#x27;m not interested in the small identical plots of land, cookie cutter communities, HOAs, any of that stuff. I want my neighbors either on the other side of a wall or more than a stone&#x27;s throw away :-)')
