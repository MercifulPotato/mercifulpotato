The DMV are the originators of the data. It is their responsibility to make sure that any third party who has access to this data has the appropriate security in place to protect that data.<p>This isn&#x27;t some far-fetched premise, either. &quot;Third Party Risk Management&quot; is a basic part of pretty much every cyber security framework I can think of. It is even part of the NIST CSF, which every government entity in the US is supposed to be following.<p>Vertafore&#x27;s failure is the DMV&#x27;s failure, and heads should roll at the DMV.')
