Maybe &quot;focus&quot;? It seems that the author is saying that to be moral and morally effective, one needs to be ends-focused, as opposed to means-focused. IOW, if a morally focused person hears of a way to provide the same results that they are, at half the cost, they should rush to implement that method, or join that effort.
