Iâ€™m thrilled.<p>The major upgrade for me was the analytics available in the Unifi controller (built-in to UDM).<p>The analytics (channel scanner especially) enabled me to see the neighboring interference that had degraded the Airport network quality and was causing my devices to act weirdly.<p>I see WiFi as an arms race. My 5+ year old Airport (802.11ac) is no longer a match against newer ISP gateways with built-in access points. The UDM (802.11ac Wave 2) not only competes properly, but can analyze any future problems that will occur as neighbors change out their equipment.')
