In the statistical setting this leads to spurious correlations, and in the machine learning setting it leads to overfitting. In either case the results have a high risk of not generalizing beyond the initial sample being analyzed.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re endorsing this, but it&#x27;s basically antithetical to sound experimental design. I don&#x27;t think the author should pursue automatic anything when it comes to statistics, unless it&#x27;s just a thin quality-of-life wrapper around other statistical primitives and libraries.')
