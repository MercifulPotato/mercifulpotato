Everyone hates their legacy monolith written in Java, .NET, Ruby, Python, or PHP, and wants to rewrite it in whatever flavor of the month it is.  They get buy in by saying it&#x27;ll be an incremental rewrite using microservices.<p>Fast forward to six months or a year later, the monolith is still around, features are piling up, 20 microservices have been released, and no one has a flipping clue what does what, what to work on or who to blame.  The person who originally sold the microservice concept has left the company for greener pastures (&quot;I architected and deployed microservices at my last job!&quot;), and everyone else is floating their resumes under the crushing weight of staying the course.<p>Proceed with caution.')
