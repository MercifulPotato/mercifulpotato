However language itself is built on &quot;labels&quot;, so they&#x27;re required.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to criticize bad ideas without some shorthand label for those kinds of thinking and ideologies. The fact that whole entire groups hold those same ideas necessarily is a critique of the entire group, and is necessarily tribal. But labels are nonetheless also necessary for the discussion to take place.<p>Democracies can only thrive when there&#x27;s an educated population free to discuss all ideas, and allowed to strongly criticize or even ridicule those they disagree with. Yet people like Jack Dorsey think it&#x27;s their duty to step in as a referee to make sure everyone&#x27;s polite and behaves according to his personal political views. He needs to be put back in his place, because no one elected him, and he just fell backwards by accident into a power position over millions by pure luck.')
