A lot of people don&#x27;t understand how important cash flow is. Even Elon pointed out that having factories close to customer is very important for a fast growing company like TSLA because if you grow too fast you&#x27;ll be putting so many cars on boats before they are paid for that you will have no cash.<p>I disagree with the framing of both articles somewhat.
