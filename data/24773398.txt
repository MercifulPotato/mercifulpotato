Menlo, PA, Los Gatos, Cupertino, Los Altos. Moved to Los Gatos. Schools were the single driving factor in picking the area in which to look for housing. Without having a kid, downtown San Jose, Redwood City, East PA, etc would have been on the list. SF was never on the list for what it is worth. I like cites. Tokyo, NYC, London, etc. SF is not a really city as the side walk roll up at 10pm and in the past few years it looks more and more like a public toilet. If you step in shit on the sidewalk in SF, it likely not from a dog.')
