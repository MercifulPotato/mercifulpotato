We need to make sure that people understand some of the camps were extermination camps, and that some of the camps were work camps. This is because anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists will point to the work camps and say &quot;See? No evidence of people being killed in this camp. That 6 million number doesn&#x27;t make any sense.&quot;<p>Concentrations camps aren&#x27;t just about mass murder. They&#x27;re a human rights violation and we rightly draw attention to this by using the correct terms.')
