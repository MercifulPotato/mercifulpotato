I&#x27;m aiming for software engineering manager positions and it feels like my resume could use improvement.<p>I started at an insurance startup and eventually built a software engineering team from the ground up.  After we got acquired, I moved to a data team to acquire a larger breadth of experience.  I&#x27;ve gotten good feedback regarding my technical and people skills, but I&#x27;m not sure if my resume reflects that.<p>Any advice or criticism is welcome.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;vZ6ObXd<p>EDIT: I have a second page of my resume that details side projects and my education. I didn&#x27;t include it here as it would be hard to anonymize.')
