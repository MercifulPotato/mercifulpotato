Integers can represent more decimal numbers, which tends to be what humans use. But that doesn&#x27;t make integers more exact. It does mean that integers will probably more accurately reflect the precision of your inputs. (But that presumes that your inputs are entered by humans, and not floats coming out of a sensor that produces readings as floats.)')
