Compared to the plastic card, this is a huge improvement; a plastic card shows all your data even if the verifier doesn’t need it.<p>&gt; [...]<p>&gt; One commonality between plastic-card driving licences and the mDL is how the relying party verifies that the person presenting the license is the authorized holder. In both cases, the verifier manually compares the appearance of the individual against a portrait photo, either printed on the plastic or transmitted electronically and research has shown that it’s hard for individuals to match strangers to portrait images.<p>&gt; The initial version of ISO 18013-5 won’t improve on this but the ISO committee working on the standard is already investigating ways to utilize on-device biometrics sensors to perform this match in a secure and privacy-protecting way. The hope is that improved fidelity in the process helps reduce unauthorized use of identity documents.<p>So initially, nothing prevents someone from borrowing their friend&#x27;s phone and PIN, only authorizing a DoB check, and passing for them? It&#x27;s good to have a choice, but I&#x27;m guessing no bartender will <i>trust</i> that you have the right phone and will require photo ID anyway.')
