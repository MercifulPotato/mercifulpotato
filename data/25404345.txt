Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[25404398], score=None, time=1607834270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395370, text='You didn&#x27;t answer my question, which I assume means you had no reason to say &quot;pg made an &#x2F;apply2 endpoint specifically for them&quot;.<p>The rest here is also false. The round was not closed. Application deadlines have never been enforced at YC. By accepting their late application he was treating them the same as anybody else.<p>Even the point about the intro email is overstated; I did that too upthread, but now that I think of it, it&#x27;s obvious that pg would have replied the same way to any email he got at that moment: tell them to apply fast, be concise, etc. No good startup investor would say &quot;sorry, you missed the deadline&quot; because they all know that missing outliers for dumb reasons is the biggest mistake they can make, the one that matters more than all the others put together.<p>So really what this all boils down to is that Justin had pg&#x27;s email address, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what the people arguing &quot;special treatment&quot; in this thread were talking about.')
