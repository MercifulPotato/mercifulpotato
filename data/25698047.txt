This was to ensure that it wouldn&#x27;t break during shipping to the customer. After that, not even a zip tie was allowed to be changed.<p>In our case, our development process was such that the software engineers didn&#x27;t get ahold of it until afterwards. One time we built a machine with an internal cable that was too long and so its baud rate was too slow to perform to the customer&#x27;s spec. Rather than incur the cost of re-testing with a different cable, the company spent two years trying to get the customer to accept a slower machine. Fun times.')
