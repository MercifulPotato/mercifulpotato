I&#x27;d gladly give this company a couple of billion if it means they can get us back to normal.<p>This kind of thinking is worrisome to me. It sets a horrible precedent. Previously in times of war private business would be forced into helping the people fight a common enemy. These days a war on a virus has zero help from business and they essentially have a position of power to sit on their hands taking billions of public subsidy and then take the people&#x27;s money and effort for their own.<p>Why do we take this with such apathy? Why is it that a country run by the people for the people has no power in the populace hands? We are doing everything we can to help, committing billions of dollars which represents millions of hours of public production to solve a problem that CEOs only want to assist in if they can up their share price.<p>Since we care so much about our health and the health of loved ones why have we not used these unprecedented times to reform the healthcare industry?<p>We are paying twice for this. Once to fund the research, which we then give away, and then again for the manufacture and distribution which is priced as if the pharma did all the research. These vaccines are going to cost anywhere between $15 and $37 a shot. You cannot tell me that&#x27;s how much these vaccines cost to make in quantity. Why is there any profit at all? Let&#x27;s get ourselves out of this shit without encumbering any more debt on top of an economy that is already falling into a black hole.<p>This stuff is morally corrupt, and to say &#x27;who cares&#x27; makes me sad. We should care, maybe we accept the shit we have, but we should care about it. This stuff should be criticized, we should use our agency to change what is wrong, not to support it.<p>Every day I fear we are all fucked. This sort of thinking is why we deserve the likes of Trump and Boris. We bring this crap on ourselves and then moan about it.<p>You talk about getting back to &#x27;normal&#x27;, well we slowly sold normal. These decisions do not have zero impact on the future, they affirm a shitty attitude and set the path for future generations who won&#x27;t know any better.<p>&#x2F;rant')
