It would create incentives for people to push naive children or newly-adult into taking many drugs that will destroy the rest of their lives.<p>Drug league could have people dying mid competition, as they took too many drugs that they had a heart attack when trying to go all out, and that would create so much backlash and vicarious trauma that it gets shut down hard.  I think it&#x27;s the main reason why it doesn&#x27;t exist.')
