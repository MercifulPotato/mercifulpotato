Being able to jump around text with the keyboard is hardly a big deal compare to that. For example, to delete the entire body of a function in C, you can type &quot;da{&quot;, where &quot;d&quot; means delete and &quot;a{&quot; points to text surrounded by braces. To delete a single sentence, I can do &quot;das&quot;, etc etc. Of course, you could do the same using the mouse by selecting text manually, but it&#x27;s way more tedious than Vim commands.')
