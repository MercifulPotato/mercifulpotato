(treated water or herbal tea + some vitamins &amp; minerals).<p>I did a water only fast which is documented here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16533514" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16533514</a><p>The mental benefits in terms of ability to concentrate are hard to put into words. It&#x27;s different than with micro-dosing which gives you a false sense of your abilities. The long fast showed me what kind of energy gets unlocked when we feel like we&#x27;re close to snuffing it. It&#x27;s like the body gets ready for a final push so that you can hunt and find food. I stopped doing these crazy type of diets after discovering IF.<p>IF gives me a similar result (the highs and lows on the graph are less extreme but at least it&#x27;s sustainable) without landing myself in hospital (in retrospect the kidney stones were most likely legacy&#x2F;cruft that needed to be refactored anyway, and who knows what kind of cancers or other long term illnesses my body &quot;ate&quot; while I pushed him that hard). I understand this is all pretty mental to read but back in 2013 there was no IF and all I had was the theory that dogs and rats that were kept on an IF survived longer.<p>!!!<p>Disclaimer: this is the most extreme one I ever done so please don&#x27;t start out with this if you want to try... try 7 days or 2 weeks are enough time to do some extreme diet. But don&#x27;t go overboard - which is way too easy after 2 weeks because you&#x27;ll be so high on your own achievement and you won&#x27;t feel hunger. It&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;re able to continue for 2 or 3 months. (you won&#x27;t). the key is in recognizing this and to quit regardless! Also knowing your own body is key. E.g. if you do sports and have a 20 year history of pushing yourself to extremes probably yes. But I understand why doctors bail and give the &quot;blanket advise&quot; that this is irresponsible.<p>!!!')
