Item(by='smichel17', descendants=None, kids=[24954309], score=None, time=1604099078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944957, text='&gt; Is it just this simple? You sum their score, then instant runoff the top 2?<p>Yes. First round counts stars, second round just counts preference.<p>If I remember correctly, the main purpose of the second round is to discourage strategic voting -- if you give all other candidates the minimum score, to give your favorite the best chance, then you don&#x27;t get to express a preference in the runoff, in the event that your favorite is not top 2. So it&#x27;s only worth doing this if you really like your favorite so much that everyone else is the same to you.<p>&gt; It still definitely doesn&#x27;t elect the condorcet winner... which you can see from 3 voters and 12 candidates<p>My understanding (from Wikipedia) is that the condorcet winner is &quot;one candidate who beats every other candidate pairwise&quot;. Since often no candidate fulfills this criteria, all condorcet systems that expect to survive contact with the real world need to specify a fallback way to choose a winner. I don&#x27;t know much about the different strategies they use to do this.<p>If my understanding is correct, then it seems like there is no condorcet winner in this scenario (rather, a 3-way tie). So I&#x27;m not sure how you expect a condorcet system to handle it.')
