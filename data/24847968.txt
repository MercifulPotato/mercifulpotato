As another commenter mentioned, angular is the worst offender for me. Ive seen countless _real_ issues get closed over the years because of inactivity by core maintainers.<p>The only reason I knew those github issues existed in the first place was because I wasted hours (sometimes days) of my life looking into an issue only to eventually stumble upon them and realize its a bug and I&#x27;m not &quot;holding it wrong&quot;. Good luck to the next person that goes spelunking on the internet for help on those issues.')
