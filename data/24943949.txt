Everything still works otherwise, but it makes it hard to draw because the canvas is moving with your finger. I&#x27;m guessing it has something to do with the URL bar changing the viewport height because the extra space seems to be roughly the same vertical height.<p>Awesome work by the way, it&#x27;s a lot of fun to play with.')
