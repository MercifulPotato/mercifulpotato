So as to your first point, I totally agree CURL needs to support HTTPS.  My point is that Hyper needs a runtime for HTTPS, and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily make sense for CURL to have a runtime.<p>2. I&#x27;m not sure that CURL should necessarily support multiple concurrent downloads.  It could also be argued it&#x27;s more UNIX-y to make it just do one thing and allow the caller to run multiple CURL processes at the same time<p>3. You wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need async to achieve these goals.  You could easily have a synchronous http implementation which allows for printing to the console between receiving chunks of data from the network.  And if you really didn&#x27;t want blocking to have a &quot;spinning&quot; activity indicator or something, you could still achieve it with threads.<p>I think ultimately you&#x27;d have to decide based on the relative cost of including an entire runtime vs. just launching a second thread.')
