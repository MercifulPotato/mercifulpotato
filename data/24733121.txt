While the countries that formerly constituted the Ottomans are under a constant civil war (and major military groups, like ISIS, dream of re-establishing a religious empire of old: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ottoman_Caliphate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ottoman_Caliphate</a>)<p>Its not very hard to imagine a &quot;cut up Japan&quot;, a hypothetical disarmed Japan where the USA would split between Britain &#x2F; France &#x2F; Russia &#x2F; other members of the allies.<p>In fact, we can look to the (eastern part) of the Soviet Union to see how well splitting up countries went during WW2. The East &#x2F; West Germany thing almost surely stunted Germany&#x27;s growth back into its world standing.<p>--------<p>With that being said: the Ottomans were certainly in a decline by the late 1800s, before WWI broke out. But I can&#x27;t imagine that WWI did those countries any favors.')
