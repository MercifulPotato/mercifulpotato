Item(by='bogomipz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608035769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25428769, text='&gt;&quot;In 2019, Mozilla called on Apple to increase user privacy by automatically resetting the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) on iPhones.&quot;<p>Can anyone provide more context on this event? Is it not odd that Mozilla would call on Apple to &quot;increase user privacy&quot; when one of Mozilla&#x27;s main(most important?) partners is Google which is the very antithesis of user privacy?<p>Then further down the post states&quot;\n&gt;&quot;That’s where you come in: We need a massive outpouring of support for Apple’s decision to help strengthen its resolve to protect consumer privacy.&quot;<p>While I applaud these efforts I&#x27;m curious how does Mozilla reconcile taking hundreds of millions of dollars from Google while taking this principled stance on Apple? This seems to be a bit of cognitive dissonance.')
