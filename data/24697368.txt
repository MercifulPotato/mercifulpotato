Except each frame is actually projected <i>three times,</i> leading to a shutter speed of 72 frames per second. (In reality there are far more options today with IMAX and video tech, though.)<p>Even though there&#x27;s only 24 images on the film per second, this triple exposure results in a smoother experience for the viewer. This is due to how critical flicker fusion works (a.k.a. persistence of vision). [1] (Though another reason for doing it is simply so that the film won&#x27;t be burnt, since those xenon gas projection lamps run very hot.) See also beta movement and phi phenomenon. [2]<p>These physiological phenomena are of course very important to consider when making VR devices and games.<p>In order to create the effect mechanically in the film projector, each frame has to be stationary before the shutter is opened. If not, all you&#x27;d see is a blur. Thus, when the film is pulled forward, the shutter blocks the light from projecting the image onto the screen. In fact, during some <i>half</i> of the movie, people are actually sitting is pitch black darkness. Think about that next time you go to the movies! ;)<p>Please note that peripheral vision has a higher sensitivity to flicker than foveal vision. I&#x27;m unsure how interlacing affects that, though, if applickable. This effect might also be different on video systems where various forms of interlacing may or may not be used.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flicker_fusion_threshold" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flicker_fusion_threshold</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beta_movement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beta_movement</a><p>(Please excuse my lack of sourcing.
