I did learn some interesting things though. I&#x27;d been watching Waymo cars in Mountain View for awhile. They were hiring new drivers because they needed a second driver to keep the first one awake! Apparently having the driver on camera all the time was not enough. Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m highly skeptical that the recent opening of Waymo to the public in Arizona is not some Potemkin Village operation.')
