I don’t think neoliberalism would be considered left by left people ...<p>I think the confusion arises from the different interpretation of liberalism on either side of the Atlantic.<p>Neoliberalism is an economic movement rather than a social one (unlike neoconservatism, the political ideology that funnily enough advocates neoliberalism) and it’s an iteration of classical economics aka “economic liberalism”.<p>Liberal economics is actually more like libertarianism which is paradoxically more closely aligned with the “right wing” mindset.<p>Neoliberalism does incorporate some notes about redistribution of wealth for reasons of economic expedience but this is rarely seen in practice.<p>This all goes to show that words are slippery and labels are bullshit and you’re far better off trying to understand where the people you’re disagreeing with are coming from than be lazily painting them as this or that.')
