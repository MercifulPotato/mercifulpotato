But of course their upstream ISP is now easily able to do so.<p>This is why mullvad intercepts all DNS queries (even to 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1).  Try using OpenNIC from behind mullvad: you won&#x27;t get the extra TLDs.<p>Logging DNS makes it easy to selectively deanonymize people.  All you have to do is get them to browse to a website that resolves a weird domain name.')
