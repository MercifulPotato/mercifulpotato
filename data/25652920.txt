I personally believe in learning <i>paradigms</i> of programming as far more important than languages. Prolog presents the very unique logic programming paradigm. Learning new paradigms always feels a bit mind-bending to me.<p>Edit: Actually, my last statement may be only in hindsight given that any experienced programmer will know or know of languages like C and Python that aren&#x27;t mindbending, so one&#x27;s viewpoint gets slowly skewed. I think that&#x27;s why sometimes beginners find things like Prolog or other &quot;strange&quot; languages interesting or even easy, and that&#x27;s because they present a paradigm that is more like like how humans think about certain tasks. Whether it&#x27;s Prolog and logic, Elixir&#x2F;Erlang and messaging, F#&#x2F;Ocaml&#x2F;SML with pattern matching, etc., these paradigms are actually quite natural to humans who haven&#x27;t been tainted with paradigms like that of C, which takes on the paradigm of &quot;let&#x27;s think like a machine&quot;.')
