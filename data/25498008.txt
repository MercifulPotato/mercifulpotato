Not two distinct senses, but the same sense, twice. I&#x27;ve also coded productively in Scheme and Clojure without feeling the same sense.<p>Watch someone like Notch code in Java; it&#x27;s possible to achieve it without whatever language feature people think is essential. However, if it&#x27;s easier to achieve in Lisp, then Lisp will always have value. The enlightenment isn&#x27;t essential for application development, but it points the gun away from your foot surprisingly often.')
