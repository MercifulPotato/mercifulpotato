XMPP doesn&#x27;t focus on this (though there are XEPs for it, I don&#x27;t know of any use of them outside of military deployments).<p>The &quot;everything everywhere&quot; eventual consistency approach Matrix takes means it is resilient for sure, but it&#x27;s not always a desirable feature. The IETF recently trialled Matrix and were caught out by this behaviour: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailarchive.ietf.org&#x2F;arch&#x2F;msg&#x2F;tools-discuss&#x2F;bdGVrXm7GxMu704HPIXYkJPH6NQ&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailarchive.ietf.org&#x2F;arch&#x2F;msg&#x2F;tools-discuss&#x2F;bdGVrXm7...</a><p>It can raise questions about data ownership and retention.<p>I am happy both protocols exist, and bridges between them exist. For my use cases I am sticking with XMPP.')
