Ask someone with skin in the Wall Street game to explain this stuff to you, not mathematically, but in layperson&#x27;s terms, so simple that a young child could understand it. They either won&#x27;t be able to do it, or they won&#x27;t do it. You&#x27;ll get one of two answers, &quot;It&#x27;s really complex.&quot; or &quot;It <i>can&#x27;t</i> be simplified.&quot;<p>When you hear this kind of shit, you&#x27;re can safely deduce one of two things:<p>1. The person in question doesn&#x27;t have a deep understanding of the phenomenon or principle they&#x27;re trying to explain.<p>2. The person in question isn&#x27;t interested in explaining it because it directly affects them.<p>Ask a Ph.D.-holding, teaching nuclear physicist to explain how a star works. They&#x27;ll be able to break it down for a 5 year old, a 15 year old, and a 24 year old graduate student, at various levels of complexity.<p>Ask a Ph.D-holding investment banker or hedge fund manager how all this works. They don&#x27;t want you to know, because it isn&#x27;t creating value. Not the kind of value an Amazon or a Tesla creates. It creates value <i>for them</i> and <i>for the large investors they represent</i>. Not for <i>you</i> the layperson.')
