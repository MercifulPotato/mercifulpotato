Super versatile, inexpensive, and easy to work with. As winter approached, we had to think about ways to do &#x27;outdoor dining&#x27; in a bit of a nicer method so we opted to partner with a modular home builder. Aside from the steel frame, the structure is clad with marine grade plywood, etc and was trucked and dropped into place. Minimal disruption to our operations or service! Imagine trucking in a cement or brick structure? It would be insanely heavy. Our current structures are estimated to weight about 20,000 lbs?')
