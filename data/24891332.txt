Twitter has a choice: either they can suppress it; or they can be pawns of whatever bad actors are creating this disinformation.<p>It&#x27;s a hard choice, and clearly it&#x27;s a struggle that as a society we have to deal with. Right now, creating and distributing disinformation is easier than combating it, and I think it&#x27;s unfair to call out Twitter for making a moral choice in the matter.')
