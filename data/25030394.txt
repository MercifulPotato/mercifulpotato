On a date night, we sat next to another couple. The guy was really not happy, he started talking just loud enough for us to hear that Trump will round up all Muslims and immigrants and ship them out. Then he started singing that his cousin is Navy Seal and he likes to kill Iraqis, Afghanis, and all the dities. His date kept telling him to shut up. He asked waitress to change tables, I think.<p>We tried our best to ignore and have a good evening. This is the only incident in last 4 years but never experienced anything like this before especially in upscale restaurants.')
