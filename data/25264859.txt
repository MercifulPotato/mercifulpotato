Item(by='kgantchev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606828849, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25264769, text='&gt; This is not true at all. Anti monopoly regulations, for example, exist for the sole purpose of privileging new entrants over incumbents. The actions against Microsoft, or the breaking up of AT&amp;T certainly did not help the incumbents.<p>The intended purpose is to help the new entrants, but I don&#x27;t see Microsoft or AT&amp;T losing anything or their smaller competitors gaining anything after the regulatory action against them.<p>&gt; An example closer to home is that entrepreneurial activity in Silicon Valley is often attributed to California law forbidding non competes in employment contracts. This is regulation, without which, as you see in nearly every other state, workers are severely bound by their employment contracts in the work they can do while and after being employed by a company.<p>That&#x27;s a matter of negotiation. I always (successfully) negotiated with my employer to exclude my personal projects from the contract. I find that employees have a lot more negotiating power than they realize.<p>&gt; If regulations seem to benefit incumbents, itâ€™s because incumbents exist and therefore can play a role in setting regulations.<p>I think that&#x27;s synonymous with the original statement made by OP. You&#x27;re just providing another reason why it&#x27;s true.')
