Use of data should define the data...<p>&gt; The reason why ext4 and xfs both use nanosecond resolution is because in the kernel the high precision time keeping structure is the timespec structure<p>...so resolution here is defined by what&#x27;s provided, not what&#x27;s (decided to be) useful.  Is ns resolution useful is the important question.<p>&gt; Why not use a finer granularity? Because space in the on-disk inode structure is precious<p>That&#x27;s not a good reason AFAICS. What would it gain your users if you did? 1 ns = ~4 machine cycles. Timestamping to that res, well, what&#x27;s the value to any application? I&#x27;m missing something.')
