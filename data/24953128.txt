I think I&#x27;m the first person in my family line in what must be centuries that has the same second name as my father (so what you would consider a &quot;surname&quot;) because I was born in the US where there is a cultural expectation to have a &quot;family name.&quot; So my grandfather&#x27;s first name, which was my fathers second name, is now my &quot;surname.&quot; Otherwise, my fathers first name would have been my &quot;last name,&quot; as is the case with my cousins that were born in India.')
