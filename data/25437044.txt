It feels like a throwback to the dumbest action games of the 90s: here&#x27;s a main story and a bunch of quests that you&#x27;ll be completing on railtracks.\nYour choices don&#x27;t really matter, the world is empty and soulless, the writing is lazy and you can&#x27;t stop but keep thinking how superficial everything feels.<p>There is no emergent gameplay which is simply unacceptable, taking all the promises and descriptions of groundbreaking immersive gameplay into account.<p>Great for teenagers looking for mindless action kicks, bad for everyone else.')
