To provide an analogy there is a maximum speed anything can move at but it would be laughable if a medieval scholar had wondered if the falcon was near the maximum speed possible.<p>It seems similarly ridiculous to imagine that the human brain just happens to be close to the maximum computational power because it was what we suppose to be the most powerful instrument produced thus far on our planet.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be equal parts unlikely and strange if the most effective and compact process that can be produced in any conditions just happened to be the one that random evolution happened on in a random walk through what is practical with earths organic chemistry.<p>Even if we imagine the incredibly unlikely idea that you can&#x27;t make a more effective mind you would think you could run the same process faster than real time or more instances of it for increasingly small resources on a better computer.')
