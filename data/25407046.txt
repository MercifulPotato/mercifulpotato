We pay low teens for Oracle Java licenses.  Every year we have to audit hundreds of thousands of machines to see if it is present.  When it is, figure out if it is a public version or something that requires an extended support contract.  There are things like Adopt OpenJDK that don&#x27;t require any licenses.  Having an OS where you did not need to worry about the licensing was huge - nobody cares what you did in a docker image, on a VM, or some experiment.<p>I think we were shelling out around $300 a RHEL license, which was a significant percentage of the docker boxes we started putting together with some low end hardware.')
