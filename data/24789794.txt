Anti-ATO, content protection, botnets, anti-DDOS, hardware platform security, just to rattle a few off my head.<p>The correct security objection is to obfuscation being deployed in settings where there are decisively effective controls that could be deployed instead: where it doesn&#x27;t make sense to raise attacker costs by degrees, because those costs can be raised to intractable levels instead. I&#x27;d cite an example, but it would spawn a 500 comment thread about how Linux sysadmins manage their networks.')
