First I&#x27;d like to know what you mean by freedom. I assume you&#x27;re also considering that a) the dead have no freedom, and b) those incapacitated in some&#x2F;many ways (economic, physical etc.) are definitely going to have less freedom in the long term.I think it is anything but obvious how to maximize freedom in general, let alone with respect to a pandemic.')
