The amount of times you can write over one sector on them, and the write wear leveling algorithms, are much worse than even a $45 consumer grade SATA3 interface SSD.<p>Yes you can now boot a raspberry pi from an external usb3.0 hard drive or SSD in an enclosure. But how many people actually do that?<p>I would say that a huge percentage of failures I have seen of raspberry pis, when people attempt to turn them into low cost industrial&#x2F;embedded&#x2F;dedicated purpose headless machines, is from the microsd card failing after 6, 12, 18 months.<p>something like the raspberry pi but with a socket to plug in a cheap M.2 SATA or M.2 NVME SSD is needed.')
