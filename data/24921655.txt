Sure, that works on Windows, macOS, and X, but it doesn&#x27;t on Wayland and its your fault for expecting it.<p>It&#x27;s not that. It&#x27;s that global hotkey bindings are out of scope for a Wayland compositor. But don&#x27;t worry. An API for such things for the crufty d-bus broker should be dropping aaaaaaany minute now... then all you have to do is wait for your compositor to support it!')
