My 4 year old does better on my old Nintendo since the controls are so basic. I had to replace all the capacitors on the nes before it would work and all my old games didnâ€™t work right away they had to wiggle back and forth before making a good pin connection and I assume wear some of the tarnish off since the games since start better no messing around. I have always wondered how the game genie worked on a technical basis I will have to see if there is anything out there on the matter.')
