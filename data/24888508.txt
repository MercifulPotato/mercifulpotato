You seem to be suggesting that having more conversations about mental health <i>is to blame</i> for an increase of people committing suicide.<p>This is the exact opposite of my lived experience.<p>Conversations about my mental health and my problems are why I&#x27;m alive (and have no intention of taking my own life) today.<p>If you have a different lived experience, then fair enough.<p>But I&#x27;d respectfully suggest to take care painting with such a wide, sweeping brush next time. <i>Life ain&#x27;t binary.</i> Especially when it comes to mental health.')
