I&#x27;ve worked with huge amounts of remote metering applications that have significantly more dollars at stake. The industries that use them already have standards in place for how to deal with measurement problems.<p>If you are right then I&#x27;d hope you&#x27;d start an efficiency as a service company that covers upgrade costs up front and collects payments over time. There is a huge lack of providers in the space that are a few thousand dollar or less upgrades with payouts over about two years. You can see the challenge, you have to spend less than a few hundred dollars in overhead&#x2F;transactions over a multi year relationship!<p>The vast majority of companies in this space are targeting large facilities with multi million dollar upgrades, because it is hard to make the numbers work otherwise.')
