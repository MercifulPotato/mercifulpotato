TimeMachine Backup for 6 people, docker volumes and an excessively huge media collection.<p>The TimeMachine datasets are backed up offsite.<p>Losing this pool would be a PITA, but not critical.<p>My primary goal with ZFS is some data redundancy. At a good cost. And quick remote backup for a fraction of the pool. Not performance.<p>At one point, 2 disks died within 2 days. While there was some panic involved, the data on the server could be reproduced with some time.<p>There isn’t a best solution, that fits all needs. If there was, ZFS wouldn‘t offer all the options it does.')
