It in the rulebook of most sales folks... everywhere. Companies have special budgets for this.<p>I don&#x27;t mean some trading-only companies like Cargill who have extra prostitues budgets (at least 5 years ago that was true, and with expensive alcohol parties was the only way to do any business in places like Russia or most 3rd world countries).
