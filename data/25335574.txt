Item(by='deergomoo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607366985, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25333090, text='&gt; HTML&#x2F;CSS was supposed to separate content from looks.<p>IMO the problem is that HTML is woefully inadequate for expressing the sort of content we have today on the web.<p>It’s a document container that we’ve shoe-horned an application platform into. Much of what is displayed on some of the most popular sites  can’t even be described as “content”—it’s interface, and that’s where things fall down.<p>It’s hard to follow semantics when the only option you have is positioning and styling divs. In that regard the style <i>becomes</i> part of the content. Nested divs have no meaning, and there’s no way to give them meaning in the same way that &lt;p&gt; is a paragraph. Aria labels help on the accessibility front, but outside of that the only way to express meaning of something like a modal or a popover is visually.')
