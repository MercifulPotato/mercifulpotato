People should be mad at Robinhood for a variety of reasons, most notably that it is an online casino masquerading as an investment app.<p>I am very interested in the conspiracy theory that says Robinhood halted GME orders as part of an effort to protect hedge funds. That conspiracy was repeated by a number of legislators yesterday, seemingly encouraging ordinary people to follow on this terribly risky GME bubble. The conspiracy appears to be false.<p>If we don&#x27;t disagree, we don&#x27;t disagree.')
