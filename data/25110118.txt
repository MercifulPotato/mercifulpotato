For high frequency signal traces on a PCB there is this rule of thumb that your trace lengths must not differ by more 15cm per ns because that is how far electrons travel in one nanosecond. If you have a 10GHz signal that means you have a 0.01ns budget which translates to a 1.5mm max length difference between traces. Matching within 1.5mm is easy to do by hand.<p>Now lets talk about actual processors instead of doing an analogy. 15cm per ns is more than enough to travel everywhere inside your CPU but the vast majority of logic is localized (usually signals stay in the same core). It&#x27;s only awful if you go off package to DRAM or a second socket but then the budget is often higher than 1ns. Apple probably scores a lot of performance points here because the RAM is so close to the CPU.')
