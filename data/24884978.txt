You are expected to do your homework first. As a scientist, your role is typically to read and understand all the relevant prior work in the area first, then using this theory to derive a hypothesis for the outcome of your experiment. If you are lucky, the way the experiment unfolds might be outside your understanding, given that your understanding of the prior theory was correct, you have made a new scientific discovery which will be used to create new theory.<p>The fragment of uncertainty in this is typically very small and the process is very far from guessing your way through, hoping to find something new (whatever you found using such a method will most likely be either already known or incorrect).')
