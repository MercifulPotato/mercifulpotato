Guess it was easier that way?<p>I was painfully aware that I had to put in 12+ hour working days until I show a productive output, yep. But sadly the stars aligned against me: during the same period my wife had severe depressive episodes I had to help her through, my mother almost died and me and my wife took turns &quot;patrolling&quot; the hospital where she was laying for days, had a huge fall out with my brother during the same time, and I finally cracked under financial and emotional pressure (not going to bore you with my life story but let&#x27;s just say that the last several drops made the cup overflow). On top of that I was asked to comply with weird culture and practices that put extra pressure on me.<p>So I wasn&#x27;t able to do what I was very keenly aware that I should do to keep the job. I am still a bit sad about it because I know for a fact that the whole thing actually started taking shape and I found my motivation and energy and desire to work on the problems in detail and with good craftsmanship... but it was too late at that time, apparently.')
