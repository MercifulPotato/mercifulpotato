There&#x27;s something inherently charming about being able to run emulated games on a microcontroller. Also, because it&#x27;s an ESP32, it supports Arduino so playing around with programming it is fairly straightforward.<p>The Go has good battery life, instant-on, and has a certain DIY spirit. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible to run MakeCode programs directly on the Odroid Go but it would probably be doable for someone with more knowledge of these things.')
