Viruses do mutate constantly, but I would guess that many (maybe most) of those mutations are effectively a no-op.  It&#x27;s a mutation in a dormant region, so it does nothing.  Of the mutations that occur in an active region, some will be bad, and those mutations die out.<p>So I would think we&#x27;re really only concerned with mutations in active regions that impact viability.  We don&#x27;t really care about mutations that decrease viability, since they&#x27;ll generally be overcome by more viable versions of the virus naturally.<p>The question with this particular mutation is whether it&#x27;s a  variant or a strain.  I.e. is this new variant more infectious?  Which would make it a strain, not a variant.')
