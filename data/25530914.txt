They embody “subscription for access done right” (at least so far). I liked the app enough that I bought into that promise, and so far, the developer had delivered with excellent updates over time.<p>What I dislike is that there’s no guarantee this will be the case.<p>But to be fair, this is how reputations will be built: both good and bad. Developers who build a bad reputation will not succeed in the long run. It sucks that someone had to be the guinea pig though...<p>So while there’s risk in buying the promise, it can pay off.<p>I’d still prefer the “subscribe to updates” approach.')
