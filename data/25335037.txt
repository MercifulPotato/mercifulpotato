If there&#x27;s no copyright it&#x27;s easy for anyone to copy the work without paying, so there&#x27;s no incentive to make works for money. If copyright lasts for the entire lifetime of the author there&#x27;s no incentive to keep making new works after they&#x27;ve become successful. The ideal term should be long enough to make a profit form the work, but short enough to encourage authors to keep making new works for continual income.')
