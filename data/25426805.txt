You can take a subset of C, use a formally-verified toolchain, and write your own formally-verified C code using proof systems.<p>Or perhaps what you want is a different language.<p>It’s just that what you’re describing—having the compiler detect UB and warn you about it, but still letting you write C code—without the burden of also writing correctness proofs using some formalism—it’s just not a viable option.<p>From a usability perspective, if you turn on aggressive static analysis &#x2F; warning settings like this, what you <i>usually</i> end up with is programmers that just start ignoring warnings or turning them off, except for greenfield projects. C’s semantics don’t make this kind of thing easy. If you have a greenfield project and you are fighting the language this hard, that’s precisely the time when using a different language is the most viable option.')
