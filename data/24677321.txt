The standard graph techniques don’t explain anything useful about what’s going on.<p>The impression I got was not that they found nothing useful, but that they didn&#x27;t find broadly interconnected networks within the data.<p>If that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s likely that the transactions in the data aren&#x27;t tightly linked.<p>Which <i>is</i> useful, in that it tells us that those involved in such activities are not a <i>cabal</i> of evil elites, rather they&#x27;re disparate groups with little in common except their desire to avoid taxes&#x2F;hide assets.<p>That conclusion certainly implies that addressing these activities will be more difficult as they are decentralized and widespread, but it&#x27;s certainly not useless IMHO.')
