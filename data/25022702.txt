They interject themselves into minority problems to show how much &quot;they care&quot; but 99% the acts are only to &quot;virtue-signal&quot;, when push come to shove they will quickly align with any policy that makes their life easier, no matter the impact on the world.<p>More insidiously, the supposed tolerance and open-mindeness are very quickly thrown out of the window once a minority sub-group fail to align to their worldview. See for example the vitriolic insults received by Cubans&#x2F;Venezuelans in Florida just because they &quot;dared&quot; to vote for Trump.<p>If I were to live in America, I think I would happier and more accepted among the &quot;racist rednecks&quot; in Idaho or Alabama that among the NY&#x2F;SF liberal crowd.')
