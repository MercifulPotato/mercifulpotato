Physical left and right-click are so much more comfortable for me. That being said, 90% of PC manufactures are imitating Apple on that note. I also think things like unibody construction and the general design aesthetic are nice, but it&#x27;s a luxury. And it&#x27;s not really that valuable of a differentiator when they look the same. By contrast I have a 6 year old white plastic chromebook that my kids have dropped a dozen times and the chassis has multiple cracks held together with tape and it still runs fine. Cost $140 brand new in 2014. Software compatibility is slipping away as a differentiator as well. Web design in particular has shifted away from Adobe and Sketch to products like Figma that are web-based. Ditto for office software like G Suite&#x2F;O365. The value of mac-only software is shrinking.')
