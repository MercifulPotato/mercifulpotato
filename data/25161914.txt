The only thing that comes to mind for me is having to provide buffers for string results from OS calls, etc. In Pascal, you can return a string, assign it, append it, etc.. and never have to allocate&#x2F;dispose of them... its taken care of under the hood by automatic reference counting.<p>I&#x27;d really like to understand this... what specific type of thing were you doing when you found yourself longing for an ownership system?<p>[edit]\nIt occurs to me that anytime I have objects, they eventually trace their ownership to a single global variable. Perhaps that has something to do with this?')
