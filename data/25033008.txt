And it all hinges on &quot;which government?&quot;, &quot;is the militia well-regulated?&quot;, &quot;is it feasible to constitute a modern militia such that it could realistically resist modern state forces?&quot; and so on.   Randomly scattering black guns into people&#x27;s bedroom wardrobes does not a militia make, so if a militia is what we want, what are the processes we need to go through in addition to providing the tools to make sure that such an organisation could be effective if it was needed?  What would the command structure look like?  Training?  Membership eligibility?  And not incidentally, how does it avoid being classed as a terrorist organisation from the moment it breaks cover, rather than a constitutionally relevant political body?  All that&#x27;s in the mix.  And that&#x27;s a reasonable set of questions to pose.  I don&#x27;t have the answers to many of them, but critically, <i>that&#x27;s not how the second amendment is politically framed today</i>.  The prevailing interpretation of the second amendment is in support of individual rights, not collective.  And again, that is an intentional framing created by specific people for a specific purpose.<p>&gt; Then lets also consider that when you talk about self defense, and the possible loss of life, should we be forced to play the &quot;just enough&quot; game with defensive force? Who exactly likes gambling with their life?<p>That&#x27;s exactly the situation in most of the West.  It&#x27;s just not normal to have to expect to be both in a life-threatening situation, <i>and</i> for the correct response on your part be to kill someone.  That&#x27;s a social and governmental failure right there.')
