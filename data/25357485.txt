However we must acknowledge just how stupid easy it is to find a judge to rubber stamp warrants and in some countries they don&#x27;t even need that.<p>Privacy laws tend to focus on corporation&#x27;s being tasked with protecting it but as stated before they already are handcuffed by the sheer fact government can get the records when it wants them. Worse sycophants within government and these companies will turn it over to prying eyes for financial and political benefit or just self determined moral justification<p>So in the end only protection we have is making it too costly for anyone to use the information they obtain illegally. This means going not just after the people who leaked&#x2F;stole&#x2F;etc the data but anyone with it.<p>People vastly over estimate how much privacy they have when in fact anything you do outside your home pretty much can be observed and any government agency will be able to get that information through the courts')
