I happen to disagree in nuanced ways with her on this topic.  My business.<p>According to my coworkers, who discovered this because they saw her bumper sticker when she picked me up one day, this is because she is &quot;ignorant and doesn&#x27;t know the facts&quot; and &quot;if she knew the facts she wouldn&#x27;t think that way&quot; and that I &quot;need to talk to her and explain them.&quot;<p>They think that, due to their profession, they are intelligent, and therefore anyone who disagrees with them about a complex topic is either less intelligent or uninformed.  It&#x27;s the epitome of youthful arrogance.  Naturally, none of them have kids and really don&#x27;t see the nuance of the issue.  It&#x27;s insufferable, and at one point I was getting ready to clobber a guy who I am 100% positive has never been hit in his life.<p>Politics should be left out of work.  And yes, by convincing a broad spectrum of the American public that Trump won the election because of a few facebook ads bought by Russian assets, instead of simply saying that they had a shitty candidate, the Democratic party has essentially pressured tech companies to have political filtering on their staff.  If Facebook had Republicans working at senior levels in their company, they would have been subjected to even more harassment from Dem leaders who scapegoated them for their loss in 2016.  Facebook has former Democratic party operatives at high levels in their company.  They don&#x27;t and can&#x27;t have anyone from the Republican party.  They get unending amounts of shit for Thiel being on their board.')
