You can see juniors get very frustrated with bugs because the code they delivered was &#x27;working&#x27;. Seniors realize that software only works within well defined parameters<p>If that&#x27;s the case, assuming those juniors have relevant degrees, they weren&#x27;t paying attention in their lectures on testing. Any decent lecture series on software engineering in general, or on testing specifically, will cover that testing can almost never prove the absence of all bugs, as exhaustive testing is rarely practical. If you want proof of correctness, formal methods are the only game in town.<p>I like your hierarchy, that&#x27;s really a neat perspective on correctness, and the tongue can be returned to its preferred posture. Perhaps a fifth entry might be useful, along the lines of <i>As Deployed</i>, to cover bugs in the platform (the compiler, standard library, OS, and hardware). This might not perfectly align with <i>Working As Implemented</i>, unless the implementation is taken to include the platform.')
