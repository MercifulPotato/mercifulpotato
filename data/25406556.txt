PayPal customer service is actually quite hard to contact, because every possibility they give you requires you to log in. I found an email address somewhere, but when I wrote them telling them about my situation, I got an email that if I log in I can check their answer in the internal ticketing system. Then a few days later there was another email asking me about my experience with their support.<p>I&#x27;ll never use PayPal again. No way in hell I&#x27;ll trust a company with handling my money when they make it impossible to contact them.')
