Predictive replacement can be deferred more easily, because the system is still working; maybe you can batch it with some other maintenance.<p>A surprise failure needs to be dealt with in a more timely fashion.<p>In my experience (which I didn&#x27;t write a blog post for), monitoring the right SMART values and doing predictive replacement eliminated most of the surprise failures for spinning drives. SSDs had less failures, but I wasn&#x27;t able to find any predictive indicators; they generally just disappeared from the OS perspective.')
