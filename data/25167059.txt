It is also much easier to scale a project up by just adding more turbines. In the case of older, smaller turbines they can be replaced with more modern turbines that yield more power (called re-powering).<p>In general wind power and solar have much better economies of scale too -- the more you build, the cheaper it gets. Nuclear doesn&#x27;t tend to follow that pattern -- although there are attempts to create it via small modular reactors (SMRS).  The jury is out if that will succeed or not (early signs are not great though).')
