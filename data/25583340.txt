In your list those are NPM and Yarn. The two use the same sources and can be used more or less interchangeably. I&#x27;ve found Yarn to be the better experience.<p>Transpilers: These tools will take in your source code and apply some meaningful transformations, such as turning code using new language features into old language features. In your list that&#x27;s Babel. It&#x27;s not necessary to use any, but can come in handy. Babel is the de-facto standard when it comes to plain JS, but there&#x27;s also TypeScript (which adds a static type system to JS) and tools for other languages.<p>Bundlers: They take all your source files and link them, producing one or more &quot;bundles&quot; containing all your sources. They can also invoke the transpilers as a processing step. Those are Browserify and Webpack from your list. Others are Rollup, Parcel, ...<p>As for which you should use: it doesn&#x27;t really matter, just get some template that works for you rather than spending a day wiring it up yourself, it&#x27;s not worth it. If you want to do that for learning purposes, I&#x27;d go with Webpack, maybe Babel with preset-env, PostCSS and TypeScript if you want a type system.')
