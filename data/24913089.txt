Take a look at this graphic [1].  There was a point early on in which there was zero choice and Apple sold only one iPhone.  There were several years in which they usually offered somewhere in the neighborhood of 3-6 options.  Recently this number ballooned up and right now there are 20 options.  And this doesn&#x27;t even include color or carrier differences.<p>Honestly, I would be less annoyed by this if Apple wasn&#x27;t still selling the iPhone XR.  It is 2 year old hardware and Apple seems willing to keep selling it for another year. The only reason it is still being sold appears to be that someone in a boardroom in Cupertino said &quot;we need a product between the $399 iPhone SE and the $599 iPhone 11.&quot;  Meanwhile customers are likely better served by buying either the SE or the 11 over the XR.  This approach of &quot;name your price point, here is the iPhone for you&quot; just seem antithetical to the way that Apple used to approach products.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Template:Timeline_of_iPhone_models" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Template:Timeline_of_iPhone_mo...</a>')
