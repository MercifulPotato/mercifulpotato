Even if you pull it off perfectly, it&#x27;s:<p>- expensive<p>- difficult<p>- easily discovered by the voter<p>- possibly fruitless if the voter was on your side already<p>And even if you could make it scale, you&#x27;d have to have <i>massive</i> scale to actually sway an important election. You don&#x27;t know ahead of time which counties (or even states!) will be crucial to the election. You can guess, but you can&#x27;t narrow it down to one.<p>So if I were trying to sway the current presidential election, I would have had to alter 10,000+ votes in multiple states. If my success rate (meaning I&#x27;m not discovered) is 50%, suddenly I had to alter 20,000 votes.<p>Once you get to election fraud of that size, you become pretty easy to find, and someone is likely to notice and find you.<p>&gt; <i>Identify which are least likely to vote</i><p>This part is also impossible. If it were possible, polls would be a <i>lot</i> more accurate.')
