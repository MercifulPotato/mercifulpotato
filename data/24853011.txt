I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the case, and I&#x27;d certainly not like to rely on it.<p>If, on the contrary, you view the rise of Computers and Internet as a once in 500 years event, then the Kodak of the world were very unlucky to have achieved power at the wrong time.<p>Looking at technologies today, I see plenty of inefficiencies, but not too many potentials for a large scale market turnover.
