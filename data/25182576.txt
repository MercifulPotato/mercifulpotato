People tend to either use Nix or stack to deal with versioning or they just plan to refactor when they have to. I personally just started with Haskell, but I&#x27;ve switched a small tool from one streaming library to another and it was super easy even though each had a very different API.<p>Also, breaking API changes happen in every language, on every codebase, ask the time. At least with static types and a common linter I can refactor and be a hundred percent sure it works since it compiles, whereas in Python for example I can&#x27;t be sure unless I add tests and stuff, even then...')
