We need a fast vaccine update cycle. We also need much faster production. It looks like the mRNA vaccines have the fastest turnover cycle. IMO the government should employ emergency measures to force Pfizer and Moderna to upgrade their production facilities to 10x what they are now. Get other companies involved. Pour as much money as necessary.<p>Fortunately, it seems there is openness from the FDA to have a faster approval cycle for vaccine tweaks. Moderna is already working on a &quot;booster shot&quot; to try and increase immunity to the South-African variant.<p>I wish that we also had other therapeutic tools to combat COVID. I wonder if we couldn&#x27;t save people who are getting hospitalized by employing drugs that block the receptor the virus uses to enter cells. Similarly to the way HIV is kept under control. That could save lives and it would be more mutation-proof.')
