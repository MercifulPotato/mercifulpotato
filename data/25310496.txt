Reddit wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if they literally didn&#x27;t shut down every subreddit just because the psychotically loud minority said so. Plus it boggles my mind why they would do that. You are actively telling your users to go elsewhere. That&#x27;s literally money and engagement walking out the door. And a lot of it. Now it&#x27;s just memes, &quot;The republicans are evil again...!&quot;, and &quot;My mother who sold me to an african prince now wants a portion of the money he has, AITA?&quot; The whole karma concept is garbage. The purpose for that was curating content and moderation. Not a &quot;agree&#x2F;disagree&quot; button. Obviously it gets abused but slashdot and HN do it way better. Nobody can see your vote counts on HN and slashdot allows for more ways to mod something so that we can know it&#x27;s not just the downvote train saying the comment is dumb but because of various other reason.')
