I use, and highly recommend, Unbound[1] as a caching resolver, and NSD[2] as an authoritative nameserver.<p>A caching resolver is used for ordinary lookups. If the address for &quot;ycombinator.com&quot; isn&#x27;t in the cache, the resolver starts at the root and recursively finds the authority for the domain, gets the answer, caches it, and returns it to you. You run this for general usage, and you point your desktop&#x2F;laptop computers to this address. Google runs their public resolver at &quot;8.8.8.8&quot;, etc.<p>An authoritative nameserver is the ultimate authority on the lookup results for a specific domain. All lookups by other people eventually reach the authoritative nameserver for an answer. You run this for domains that you own, and configure it in your domain record.<p>(Both can be a bit more complicated than that, but they don&#x27;t need to be)<p>These two services need almost zero care and feeding. Set them up once, and you can basically forget about them for years. This article only discusses resolvers, which are literally set-and-forget. Authoritative nameservers only need maintenance if you make changes to your domain. (And if you don&#x27;t have your own domains, you don&#x27;t need an authoritative nameserver at all).<p>[1] Unbound: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nlnetlabs.nl&#x2F;projects&#x2F;unbound&#x2F;about&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nlnetlabs.nl&#x2F;projects&#x2F;unbound&#x2F;about&#x2F;</a><p>[2] NSD: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nlnetlabs.nl&#x2F;projects&#x2F;nsd&#x2F;about&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nlnetlabs.nl&#x2F;projects&#x2F;nsd&#x2F;about&#x2F;</a>')
