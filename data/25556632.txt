It prevents you from shooting me or overthrowing the government. Surely this imposition is just? Surely this is more benign then letting you shoot me or letting you overthrow the government.<p>Why? Because it reduces human suffering.<p>Also surely with better technology we will be able to transform prisons into rehabilitation centers and thus reduce our countries prison populations and thus become a FREER country, albeit one with less rights?<p>I think comparing our government to a beehive or a pack of wolves is ridiculous I guess you can call governments &quot;natural.&quot; Even if we consider this government natural, surely it doesn&#x27;t have a natural state. What is the &quot;natural state&quot; of a government of 350 million people?')
