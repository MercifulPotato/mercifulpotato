But if you try to make an interactive app that could be implemented client-side (AKA javascript) and attach a server to it, everybody will complain that the application doesn&#x27;t respect the user&#x27;s privacy, since it could be offline-only but it&#x27;s not.</i><p>That&#x27;s the gist of it. Don&#x27;t use JS if not absolutely needed (or at the very least, don&#x27;t make the site break without JS enabled). If needed, consider whether there is a valid technical reason why this should be a server-dependent web app in the first place - and if there is, consider supporting off-line mode where possible anyway.<p>It&#x27;s a perfectly valid position to hold. It&#x27;s a user-respecting and waste-minimizing view.')
