Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=[25541746], score=None, time=1608960119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25541550, text='Naproxen, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin are all ototoxic (damaging to hearing), so that is one concern.<p>I almost never use pain killers, but if I have to reach for one, it will be naproxen.  Naproxen is longer-lasting. It has a metabolic half life of as much as 17 hours in the body, compared to just around two hours for those others. This has advantages, one of which is simple economics. One naproxen pill works like 4 consecutive ibuprofens or acetaminophens.<p>I was prescribed naproxen in the early 1990&#x27;s, at the University of British Columbia sports medicine clinic for some wrist tendinitis. Stuff worked, so I remembered the name well. I didn&#x27;t know that just a few years after that, it had become over-the-counter. One day I googled it by name and so it goes.<p>One down side of naproxen, sort of, is that it&#x27;s not recommended for children. You will not find a children&#x27;s naproxen.')
