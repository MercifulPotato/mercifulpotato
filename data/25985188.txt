What could you reasonably advocate for in its place?<p>Very few people roll out of bed and think &quot;my application needs a high performance distributed event stream&quot;. For every problem that can be solved with kafka, there are other solutions that don&#x27;t involve kafka. Many of the alternate solutions don&#x27;t involve event streams at all. Are they better? I don&#x27;t know. That question is unknowable without looking into the problems in particular, and looking at what other technology is out there. And I say this with a lot of fondness for kafka. I really like it. I just think there are always technical tradeoffs to make.<p>&gt; any more than MongoDB competes with PostgreSQL<p>MongoDB and Postgres <i>do</i> compete with each other though! They work differently - so part of the competition isn&#x27;t around features; its around how your people think about your data. &quot;Think of your data in a way that makes sense for mongodb!&quot; say mongodb sales reps. &quot;Think of your problem as a message queue&quot; say fans of rabbitmq. They aren&#x27;t <i>wrong</i> in the general case. But there are lots of problems where I <i>could</i> use kafka, or I could use redis, or I could use a naked postgres instance. You need a much more complex heuristic to decide what technology to adopt than &quot;Should I use kafka?&quot; -&gt; &quot;Yes.&quot;[1]<p>And I say all that as a big fan of kafka. I think its API is delightful and just today I was plagerizing its API design to sort out backpressure in a system I&#x27;m building.<p>&gt; What could you reasonably advocate for in its place?<p>I haven&#x27;t used it but by all reports RedPanda is lovely: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vectorized.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vectorized.io&#x2F;</a><p>[1] Though I&#x27;m convinced the answer to &quot;Should I use mongodb&quot; is always &quot;No.&quot;')
