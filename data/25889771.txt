Apparently, the PEM fuel cell itself can get up to 60% efficiency, but there are auxiliary services (cooling, supply and exhaust pumps, etc) that most people don&#x27;t think about that drive the system down to about 47% reliable output efficiency. That&#x27;s not bad considering zero GHG emissions, and other benefits such as scalability and power density of the cells, but I&#x27;m still hopeful for significant improvements in the next decade (I suspect this may be significant offset in the form of greater H2 storage mass&#x2F;volume energy density).')
