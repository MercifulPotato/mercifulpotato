What makes this muddied is the varying degrees of intent from all the people who stormed the capital. Some saw it as a chance to kill people. Others just went to protest -- not really unreasonable since we&#x27;ve been having protests nonstop for like a year.<p>&gt; Calling both kinds of people terrorists feels sort of like calling the passengers of the 9&#x2F;11 flights terrorists too<p>I&#x27;m straining my neck to understand how you equated the litany of protesters who broke into the Capitol building (excluding the terrorists who came equipped with pipe bombs, tactical gear for hostage-taking, and who planned the insurrection for months) with innocent bystanders on doomed flights on 9&#x2F;11.')
