Worst that could happen is one punctures a lung, but they&#x27;re going to need medical attention if you get a pulse back anyway, that can be dealt with.<p>It should be clear - in an ideal scenario you&#x27;d have direct access to massage (or shock) the heart, chest compressions are approximating that through flesh, skin, and bone... The ribs&#x27; job is to protect the heart from the sort of thing you&#x27;re trying to do!')
