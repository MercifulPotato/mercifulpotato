Item(by='Jochim', descendants=None, kids=[25054333], score=None, time=1605053776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25052746, text='&gt; You think that when someone takes more than they need, they deserve to be shamed? How do you determine how much one can take?<p>Shame is a pretty good motivator for encouraging people to behave in a manner deemed appropriate by society. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an easy or definite answer for how much is appropriate. I guess the question I&#x27;d ask in return is: in the case of the woman caught on security footage dumping a whole bucket of Halloween candy into her plastic bag. Why is it that we find it appropriate to shame her and not a founder&#x2F;ceo who does effectively the same thing? Why can we not apply these same rules of decency to business?<p>&gt; If the financial incentive to start a company is reduced, there will necessarily be a cost to innovation.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily true. By spreading the fruits of successful innovation more broadly you put the people who enabled that innovation in a position to use that experience to innovate further.<p>I&#x27;d argue that model where innovation centers around founders aiming to hit unicorn status and then retire with &#x27;fuck you&#x27; money limits it in the sense that those once you&#x27;ve earned your &#x27;fuck you&#x27; money you aren&#x27;t really incentivised to innovate any further.<p>&gt; The rules and incentives for employment were very clearly outlined in the employment contract these people signed.<p>I&#x27;m questioning whether they were fair, not in this specific case, but I&#x27;m asking more generally is our approach to employment as a society reasonable and fair.')
