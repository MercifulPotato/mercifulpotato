Item(by='csnover', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607618756, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373280, text='&gt; It completely ignored the fact (explicitly mentioned in my comment) that in this case - the case this entire thread is talking about - government officials pressured the company into suppressing free speech.<p>Yes, I didn’t reply to that part because I couldn’t prove that a letter from four senators “pressured the company into suppressing free speech”, whereas I <i>could</i> conclusively prove that the claims I <i>did</i> reply to were false.<p>If you want me to opine on the “senators sending a letter equals government censorship” angle too, fine. It was a pretty typical letter from the senate. They make some claims, they ask some questions. Senators send letters like this often. YouTube had the option to say ‘we won’t commit to that’ and explain why, but they chose not to do that, despite having a pretty bottomless pit of lawyers and PR agents to throw at the problem. They also could easily have suggested that they were making a change due to inappropriate pressure from the senate in the press release, but they did not do that either. Any suggestion to the contrary is speculative at best.<p>&gt; We aren’t talking about AOL.<p>You were claiming that YouTube could lose their legal immunity through some estoppel claim, and I gave you the relevant case law which explicitly rejects that interpretation of the law.<p>&gt; Removals that aren’t in line with “clear, previously set guidelines” can be ruled to not be in good faith.<p>Please show me a single case where a court has accepted this interpretation of the immunity clause of Section 230. Please show me where in the law it says anything about “clear, previously set guidelines”.<p>&gt; We are talking about a group of partisan senators pressuring a company that has a de facto monopoly in online video distribution into suppressing free speech for no reason other than “we don’t like it”.<p>Setting aside how there are actually quite a few places where people can post their videos (Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Periscope, their own $5 VPS, etc.), the letter[0] is actually quite clear on the senators’ concerns, which were not “we don’t like it”:<p>&gt; These videos seek to undermine our democracy and cast doubt on the legitimacy of President-elect Biden’s incoming administration. Moreover, because the current president has not committed to a peaceful transition of power, misinformation and manipulated media content on your platform may fuel civil unrest.<p>&gt; you managed to hurl insults at me - saying that my “sources must be garbage”<p>It was not my intent to insult you personally and I’m sorry if you took it that way. I didn’t say <i>you</i> were garbage, I said your <i>sources</i> were garbage.<p>If you can’t accept that both the law doesn’t say what you say it does, and that courts have explicitly rejected your claimed interpretation of the law, I don’t know what else I can say. Which is, of course, the problem with misinformation and the reason why removing it is sometimes an unpleasant but necessary course of action: people latch on to falsehoods which reinforce their pre-existing world view, then refuse to accept that they might be wrong.<p>And to be fair to that point, I <i>could</i> be completely full of shit too, but it’s on you to prove that by bringing facts to this discussion and not just repeating refuted claims and making it sound like I somehow proved them by giving evidence against them.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.menendez.senate.gov&#x2F;imo&#x2F;media&#x2F;doc&#x2F;YouTube%20Letter%20on%20Misinformation%2011242020%20APM%20DA.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.menendez.senate.gov&#x2F;imo&#x2F;media&#x2F;doc&#x2F;YouTube%20Lett...</a>')
