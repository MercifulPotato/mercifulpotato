I did a bunch of statistical modeling for cloud service SLIs&#x2F;SLOs&#x2F;SLAs. This approach is good for letting people do black-box modeling. It sounds like complete overkill for recipes.<p>A recipe is not a black box. Most recipes are short and can be written on a half page of paper. If it calls for two chopped onions and you know that it takes you an “eternity” to chop onions, then add two eternities to the cooking time.<p>And as long as you are spending two eternities chopping onions, why not spend 90 seconds watching a video on YouTube that explains how to do it correctly? For most people—if you are cooking regularly, and practicing good technique, you will naturally get faster over time. If, like <i>many</i> people, you are cooking for decades, then you will be slow for only a short time.')
