We didn&#x27;t know COVID could have long term side effects until well into the pandemic. It&#x27;s a tough choice to make, what if the vaccines cause long term problems? What if I don&#x27;t take the vaccine and get COVID and develop long term problems...<p>It&#x27;s hard to trust pharma companies. I lost a lot of people to overprescribed opioids and that shook my trust in the healthcare industry.<p>I don&#x27;t at all miss the &quot;life&quot; precovid, and my job doesn&#x27;t require me to be in office or travel. My family is closer nowadays than before. So I&#x27;m not chomping at the bit to get the vaccine.')
