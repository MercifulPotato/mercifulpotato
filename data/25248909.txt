However I can&#x27;t imagine a use case for that. What is useful is a support for rotation of proxy list with every download request together with auto-updating such list.<p>As for modules - splitting each site&#x27;s support by file is an absolute minimum for sanity. Keeping up all that support in one project quickly becomes quite a chore for a single project maintainer. The whole process fetching the while project and initiating a PR on a github is also rather awkward for developer too.
