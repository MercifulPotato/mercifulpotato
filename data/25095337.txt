The SNES uses a 65816-based architecture running at ~3MHz that&#x27;s extremely hard to compile C down to while still getting acceptable performance&#x2F;code size - almost all games for it were coded in assembly language.<p>By comparison, the GBA uses an ARM7-based architecture running at ~33MHz. GCC was available for it literally before it came out. Even though I&#x27;d experimented a bit with QBASIC when I was younger, plugging away on the GBA when <i>I</i> was around 14 was how I learned C, how computers really work at a low-level, and roughly speaking, how to &quot;really&quot; code.<p>So this isn&#x27;t a GBA C++ compiler - that&#x27;s existed for ages. This is a &quot;just&quot; game engine. It&#x27;s super cool that people are still working on stuff like this - the GBA is a very fun platform to develop a game on, at a nice sweet spot between straightforward enough to get started on, powerful enough to make something cool, not so powerful that you need a team of dozens to make something impressive (for the platform).')
