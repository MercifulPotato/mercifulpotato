They provide class leading safety, range, acceleration, and don&#x27;t nickle and dime you.  The battery packs have generous lifetimes and they have an Apple like good (rwd), better (AWD), and best (AWD performance) setup.<p>Try to buy a Lexus, BMW, MB, etc and you get a huge laundry list of incompatible features that bundle in the options you want into expensive bundles.  So much so that to get even the basic safety things like rear view cameras and decent headlights laws had to be passed and companies embarrassed with poor safety ratings because their headlights were unsafe at highway speeds and much worse than a Toyota Prius unless you bought the many $k package with the fancy headlights.<p>Want a reliable car that&#x27;s likely to last a few 100k miles, 353 mile range, is one of the safest cars on the planet to drive, has a great charging networks, great headlights, generous interior room, and low cost per mile?  Get a model 3 AWD for $48k, it&#x27;s a hell of a deal, and that&#x27;s assuming your state, city, and country have no incentives.  Sure it&#x27;s one of the &quot;slow&quot; Tesla&#x27;s at 0-60 in 4.2 seconds, but still one of the quicker accelerating cars around.<p>I&#x27;d be hard pressed to name a #2.  There&#x27;s a nice Porsche, but it&#x27;s like twice as much.  The ford Mach e is somewhat similar, less range, less accel (at the same price), not as safe, and nowhere close on the charging network.<p>Chevy bolt is embarrassing in comparison, doesn&#x27;t handle, doesn&#x27;t accelerate, not as safe, nowhere close on range, not AWD, etc.')
