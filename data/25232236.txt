Years ago over a Christmas break I hand ported the Chipmunk-2d physics engine to javascript because I wanted to understand how it worked. (And wanted to have a physics engine I could use for small games).<p>It only took me about 2 weeks and it was one of my most memorable experiences of the year. I learned a few great data structures, I learned about JS microoptimization (I got an 8x speed up from the first port to the final version of the code). And I learned all sorts of practical physics - moments of inertia, rotational momentum, restitution, solvers, etc.<p>It was a silly thing to do by most standards, but acts like that make me a much better engineer.')
