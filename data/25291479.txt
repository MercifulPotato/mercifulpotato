Clients used an &quot;Englishy&quot; interpreted language to do economic forecasts, and client staff often programmed their own procedures.<p>My boss came to me one day to request that I speed up something a client had developed themselves, because it had become too expensive for them to run, and they were ready to bolt.<p>I had no desire to understand what their code did, and so treated the code mostly like a blackbox, and my job as speeding things up while leaving the transformation of inputs to particular outputs intact.<p>I had enough experience to know what the low hanging fruit were and went after those in the code. A day&#x27;s work or so, and we got a 50-90% speed-up, enough to satisfy the client. I still don&#x27;t really know what the code did. But I enjoyed the effort.')
