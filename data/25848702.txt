To me, at least at first glance, they both seem equally conceptually primitive.<p>As far as efficiency, this should be the task of the compiler. We shouldn&#x27;t have to start counting with the &quot;zeroth&quot; just to save the compiler a few cycles (or a few mental cycles to whomever writes the compiler&#x2F;interpreter).  That&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t program in assembly after all.<p>But I agree with GP, we shouldn&#x27;t start counting from 1 either, but from &quot;1st&quot;.  Keeping ordinal separate from cardinals would be closest to how natural language works and I bet it would eliminate all kind of errors and gotchas.')
