You emphatically <i>don&#x27;t</i> need to share values with someone to get along with them or work with them or trust them.<p>Focusing on values instead of goals and behaviors <i>creates</i> the environment of mistrust, because you don&#x27;t know when someone is going to decide you don&#x27;t share their values strongly enough and try to purge you.  It also creates an environment where the people you want least are most willing to lie to fit in, and it gives them a weapon to use to push out anyone they don&#x27;t like by amping up the values rhetoric.<p>If you want to build a club of terrified pretenders, filter by and focus on values.  If you want to get something done and build an environment of trust, focus on shared goals, behaviors, and outcomes, and learn how to disagree and move on where consensus can&#x27;t be reached.')
