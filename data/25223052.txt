It was in a converted factory space near the shipyard, with big windows looking out on the bay,  and skylights  in the roof. The big windows had a manual endless chain which could be used to crank them open, as did the skylights. There were also ceiling fans and a conventional HVAC system.<p>None of this was integrated into an automatic climate control system, which was amusing to see while being pitched on IoT. It would be nice to see the windows, skylights, and fans coordinated to provide a good environment without consuming fuel unnecessarily, but no. It got too stuffy when there were too many people inside, despite all that access to the outside.<p>When I saw &quot;Spatial computing&quot;, I thought this was going to be about Spatial OS, from Improbable. They built a system intended to be a back end for big-world MMOs. They burned through several hundred million dollars (from Softbank, who else?) and produced a back end nobody can afford to use. You have to host on Google and pay for every in-game event. Several games shipped using it and they all went bust within months.')
