Last year I had 180 hours of saved vacation time (4.5 weeks). I gave up 115.5 hours of that on January 1 because I didn&#x27;t use it. I expect I will lose a similar amount on next January 1st. I did get 6 federal holidays off. I used a bit of vacation to also take the day after Thanksgiving, the day before Christmas, and New Year&#x27;s Eve off.<p>I paid $8400 in insurance premiums for my insurance. I also added $5200 in pretax to my HSA account which I used.<p>I paid about 30% to taxes.<p>I&#x27;m not complaining. I&#x27;d just like to point out that my high salary (which is not &gt; $200,000) comes with some costs.')
