Fun and relevant fact:  The job title data scientist was invented at LinkedIn when they saw data analysts that needed to know R or Python skills.  These skills seemed different enough from the traditional Excel and SAS data analyst jobs at the time to warrant a new job title.<p>So did Excel not cut it, or was it a preference to use Python?  Back then Excel supported up to 65,535 rows, and would typically crash with over 8,000 rows.  I worked in that era in Excel.  One model once was split across three spreadsheets.  Only one spreadsheet could be open at a time, they would take 20 minutes each to load, and there was about a 50% chance they would crash while loading.<p>So what do you do if you need over 65,000 instances of labeled data?  For a neural network it&#x27;s nice to have a million instances, yes a million.<p>R and Python have in them what is called a dataframe.  It&#x27;s a spreadsheet, but in another programming language.  We tend to load our data into those, which is just like Excel, but without the hardware limitations.  So in many ways, today it&#x27;s just like it once was, but we get to choose which programming language to use while working in a spreadsheet, and let&#x27;s be fair, the Excel programming language isn&#x27;t exactly great.')
