It&#x27;s an absolute pain when:<p>- Lots of different kinds of nodes<p>- anything more complex dependency wise than a handful of shared Conda envs<p>- anything involving docker<p>- anything vaguely untrusted<p>- any kind of partitioning worse than 3 nines e.g. connectivity or uptime instability<p>- anything more complex than 3-5 priority levels of scheduling<p>It&#x27;s great if you hit that niche but it frankly struggles with the complexities of even moderately heterogeneous work loads.<p>It&#x27;s also just a bit dated feeling. Even though kube is complex, it&#x27;s a joy to work with compared to SLURM. Hashicorp is even better imho.')
