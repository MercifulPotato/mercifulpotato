I used to be a hard core YIMBY believer and advocated for more urban densification and taller buildings etc. etc.<p>Then one day I found out that the city was planning on building new student housing on the park where my daughter and I went to play every day. All of a sudden I found my unbridled YIMBYism becoming a lot more circumspect and nuanced and it turns out I was actually just a massive hypocrite.  Urban densification is Great! and I still believe it is the right solution (just not in _my_ back yard).<p>PS: Now that I&#x27;ve moved 2 miles down the road and no longer go to that particular park I&#x27;m far more open to the long term benefits of it being used for student housing.')
