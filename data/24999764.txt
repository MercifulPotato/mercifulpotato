Since it&#x27;s one of the most open markets, anybody can go and download all the projects that are at any point of the connection process. Last month, there were 18GW of storage planned for Texas alone. Interconnection only cares about power, not energy, so we only no GW and not GWh for these projects at the moment. The energy capacity in MWh only comes into play as they bid on the market to sell or buy energy.<p>ERCOT is only the most transparent energy market, which is why I mention it first, but other markets are also seeing massive amounts of storage planned in the coming years.<p>The other most open electricity market, PJM, shows a similar surge of renewables and storage:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleantechnica.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;03&#x2F;rocky-mountain-institute-study-shows-renewables-are-kicking-natural-gas-to-the-curb&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleantechnica.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;03&#x2F;rocky-mountain-institut...</a><p>On the rest of the US grids, which are more centrally planned by monopoly utilities, we need to be sure that regulations actually reward the cheapest energy if we want renewables and storage to win. Typically (but not always) regulators allow the monopoly utility to take a fixed percentage of costs as profit, so monopoly utilities are incentivized to choose higher cost options for supplying electricity.<p>Storage alone doesn&#x27;t care about where the electricity is coming from, so these storage projects from the grid are planned based on any sort of time arbitrage, grid congestion relief, or frequency regulation reimbursement people think they can get. This is based purely on people&#x27;s bets with their own capital and what they think the market will look like. Academic estimates and monopoly central planning is far far more conservative in storage than people spending their own money.')
