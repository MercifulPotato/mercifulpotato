Nor could it show he had joined ISIS, much less killed civilians for the group. The man&#x27;s account proved to be riddled with holes and contradictions. Even when confronting some of them, the reporting and producing team sought ways to show his story could still turn out to be true.<p>At this point, you can either believe NPR, &quot;his story was not fact-checked at all&quot;, or the New York Times, &quot;we did our due diligence.&quot;<p>One is telling the truth, and the other is lying. You can&#x27;t believe them both without descending into doublethink.')
