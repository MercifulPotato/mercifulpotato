When you enter the bus, you need to scan this QR code, but for some stupid&#x2F;smart reason Apple Pay triggers and hides this screen, and of course when you try to debug Apple Pay screen is gone, QR code is back. Trying to explain to the bus driver that this was some stupid Apple Pay interaction was quite an experience. Lesson learned: make sure to always have some spare coins with you.')
