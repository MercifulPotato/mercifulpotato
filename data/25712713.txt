Despite that, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of getting into something like a political discussion on Twitter. It&#x27;s simply impossible to know whom the mob will go after next, or in 10 or 20 years.<p>I don&#x27;t know how many others feel the same way, but I do know there are others out there. There is a non-zero chance that one of us has something really important to say, but won&#x27;t, because we don&#x27;t want to face a potential angry online mob in the future.')
