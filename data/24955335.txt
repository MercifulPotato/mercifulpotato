And so there is no slightest trace of a valid argument that science is a problem that should be disfavored.<p>Yes it is in fact &quot;just&quot; a tool.<p>The human experience doesn&#x27;t change this at all.<p>You don&#x27;t need science to rationalize removing the top half of a chimpanzee skull. People who will do a thing, will do a thing with any tool. Science, religion, politics, &quot;think of the children&quot;, plain might, anything.')
