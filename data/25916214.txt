It mostly kicks up in the morning but I have no idea what is causing it to think the air quality is bad.  For those who&#x27;ve gotten a real sensor how do you track what&#x27;s actually causing the air quality issues so you can do something about it?  I live close (1400ft &#x2F; 444m) to a major highway so I&#x27;ve wondered if that could be a &quot;source&quot; but no idea how to tell.')
