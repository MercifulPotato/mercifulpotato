Fast and easy payments will come in time with crypto, but in most developed countries the credit card system is a safer and easier consumer alternative anyway.<p>Crypto is way more than payments, it&#x27;s an entirely new financial system outside the control of existing governments and corporations. If you don&#x27;t understand why this is way more important that being able to buy a coffee easily, you haven&#x27;t been paying enough attention. There&#x27;s only so many options for long term wealth storage, and crypto represents an entirely new class, so from a hedging perspective it makes sense for all high wealth individuals to have a small allocation. We&#x27;re reaching the point where you&#x27;re at a greater long term risk not holding any.<p>As more money is stored in crypto and more trust placed in it, there will naturally be more desire from those users to be able to easily use it for consumer purchases, so give it time. But again, the most interesting stuff is what&#x27;s being built out now, which is an alternative to the legacy financial system, not a Visa competitor.')
