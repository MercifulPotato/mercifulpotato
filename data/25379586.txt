A “good, wise” “engineer”.<p>Reality usually disagrees.<p>The reality of actually having to write a complete working system in a language in which your knowledge is limited to the first page of a tutorial is even harsher.<p>When your “wisdom” and “goodness” are up against a hard deadline, or even an interview, you get the confused messages in this thread that blame companies for not hiring you, people for it understanding you, everyone else for being stupid, and the world for your unemployment.<p>May be learn what you started with first, but well, and thence to expand your knowledge in various directions.<p>But of this fancy stuff is available in almost every language. If you think clojure is special you’re in a bad place. Hickey wrote clojure in java.<p>For the record, I don’t write java or clojure anymore, and if you think clojure gives you  an advantage without knowing at least five other languages to a professional level, then you’re not getting hired anywhere near me...')
