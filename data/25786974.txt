In hindsight I now realize that my example was exceedingly poor, and apologize for that. Many people, including, speak to said that potential as if it were an inevitably good and I find that speculation to be someone taking a terribly romanticized view of someone. Especially after they were gone. Just as much as someone is capable of being great, so too could they be capable of being a disappointment.<p>And if you talk about potential, I&#x27;d also argue that no matter how much waste there is, there&#x27;s enough numbers in the world to take it&#x27;s place readily.<p>&gt;If your health isn&#x27;t so bad that you&#x27;re close to dying, then that&#x27;s also very wasteful in my opinion. You can achieve more with a healthy body. Leave the donation until after you die. There&#x27;ll always be someone in need of an organ. Even if you provide one now, that&#x27;ll just leave someone in the future without an organ you could have provided then.<p>Perhaps but bear in mind that it probably be just the one. Organ donation campaigners harp over and over again that one donor could give back life to multiple people. So is it a waste? It becomes more the trolley question more then anything else; if one person dying could save six others, is him not choosing the die the same as choosing to kill them?<p>&gt;You seem fixated on the happiness of others. Can&#x27;t you be a little more selfish?<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean. I am being selfish. A selfless man would&#x27;ve conformed to what others demanded and endured in solitary silence no matter what, doing all and asking nothing in return.')
