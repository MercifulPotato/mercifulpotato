Honestly looks more like a descendant of the XB360 language. Feels such a strange departure when the PS4 had such a beautiful and striking design from aesthetics, brand and functionality.<p>From purely aesthetics I do think the new Xbox is the better looking and more modern looking machine, although the gigantic PS5 heatsink is going to help a lot with noise.')
