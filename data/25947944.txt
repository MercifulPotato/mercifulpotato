Most of the biggest villains are indeed Boomers, simply because they&#x27;ve been at it longer and are the biggest players, but GenX behaves a lot like its parents do.<p>Not entirely. I like to think we&#x27;re a little better. But we did get away with comparatively cheap college, used it to get reasonable jobs, and put that in retirement funds where exponential growth is starting to happen. We&#x27;re still sitting in those jobs, and will be for a while.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that people blaming &quot;Boomers&quot; really meant Anybody Over 40 all along. So I&#x27;ve been kinda waiting for it to be my turn.')
