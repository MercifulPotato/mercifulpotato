But this isn&#x27;t true for many things people want to talk about today.<p>Language is just an encoding for ideas, and emojis are a new compression algorithm. Using a single character, you can now convey certain thoughts and sentiments that you previously needed many more characters to reference or explain.<p>&quot;So then just explain it!&quot; some might respond. &quot;Why can&#x27;t people be bothered to spend even a little time to write down what they think?&quot; It&#x27;s an accessibility issue. People have limited time every day to get their ideas across, and they deserve ways of conveying their ideas concisely. There is precedent for this too -- this is why we have acronyms and new words. &quot;lol&quot; and &quot;minivan&quot; don&#x27;t have thousands of years of agreed-upon semantic meaning behind them.<p>A final thought -- whether you think emojis are a terrible idea might not be relevant to whether they should exist. Letting people live their own lives to the fullest is much more important than making sure you, I, a future historian, or any other third party understands what they are saying. But you don&#x27;t have to worry about not being to understand conversations. Given what you prefer, if someone wants to address you as a target audience, then they probably won&#x27;t use emojis.')
