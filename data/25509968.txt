Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608664515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506945, text='There are some dead comments in this thread about the Swedish party called &quot;Sverigedemokraterna&quot; (which translates to &quot;the Sweden democrats&quot;) which is disappointing to see given that the gist of those dead comments is true: Sverigedemokraterna is not an &quot;extreme right-wing&quot; party. The party was <i>started</i> by people with such sympathies but they have either resigned, distanced themselves from the party or have been ousted.  The party program is largely comparable to that of the Swedish Social Democratic party in the &#x27;60&#x27;s, plus or minus a few differences. These differences are mostly adjustments to modern times, as such the party can be seen as a spiritual successor to the social democratic party of the Sweden that once was but ceased to be after Olof Palme took control and radically changed the course of the country. Before Palme Sweden was an extremely homogeneous and fairly nationalistic country, something which Palme - with the support of all parties in the parliament (Riksdagen) - wanted to end by changing the constitution to state that Sweden should not have a single dominant culture. This change succeeded but the resulting culture shock led to the rise of <i>Sverigedemokraterna</i>, a party for those who want to put the brakes on what they see as the dissolution of Swedish culture. It is also from the social democratic party that Sverigedemokraterna got the majority of their voters. Either all those people - the party polls between 20% and 25% - are suddenly &quot;right-wing extremists&quot; after having been social democrats for many years, or the narrative upheld by Politico and the referenced Wikipedia article is incorrect.<p>For those who want to have some more insight into the convoluted history of Swedish politics I recommend reading Aron Flam&#x27;s &quot;This is a Swedish Tiger&quot; [1], a book which uses a war-time slogan to delve into the history of Swedish nationalism&#x2F;corporatism.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aronflam.com&#x2F;merchandise&#x2F;f6onzxj7whzph8klyf0du6iiu80pom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aronflam.com&#x2F;merchandise&#x2F;f6onzxj7whzph8klyf0du6iiu80...</a>')
