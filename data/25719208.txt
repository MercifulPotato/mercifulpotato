Item(by='ashtonkem', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610309975, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25710442, text='&gt;  If I jump the fence on Pennsylvania Ave and run across the White House lawn with delusions of grandeur about taking over the government—and promptly get shot—it isn&#x27;t a failed coup.<p>Quantity matters. A single fence jumper is different than a thousand. One person is a nutball, a thousand is a mob.<p>Proximity also matters. We now know that the mob came dangerously close to members of Congress. In at least two instances they came within feet of members, or within seconds of passing through barricades that were not yet erected.<p>This is like your hypothetical fence jumper making it into the Lincoln Bedroom with a few hundred of his closest friends. Given that they literally beat at least two cops to death and erected gallows, there is no doubt that they intended the worst for Congress.<p>&gt; The Capitol breach is not comparable to a junta raiding a presidential palace. It was more like the lone nutjob, except there were a few more nutjobs. And a bunch of LARPers and miscellaneous morons tagging along to riot because the protestors outnumbered the cops.<p>You are building up an incorrectly narrow vision on what a coup actually looks like, then using that to declare this to be a non-coup. You are absolutely correct that this looks nothing like a Junta raiding the presidential palace, but that is <i>far</i> from the only form that historical coups have taken. More than once countries have been toppled by a mob seizing the legislature while the military stands around without an idea of what to do. Arguably that is <i>exactly</i> what happened during the August 10th insurrection in Paris, which toppled a constitutional monarchy and led to the Terror.')
