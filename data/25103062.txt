They normally talk about how &quot;this information Y is being supressed from the public because this will undermind the governments policy on X&quot;.<p>People always bring up the crazy the stuff to discredit the other things that could be legitiment. It must be some form of strawmanning.<p>&gt; Online it&#x27;s not so easy to walk away, so I prefer that you have alligator man conversations with other alligator man enthusiasts.<p>I don&#x27;t have alligator man conversations at all.
