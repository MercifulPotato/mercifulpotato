I created a new one this Christmas for one very simple reason: I wanted to be able to use Messenger, because it&#x27;s the only common denominator for my entire extended family.<p>Thankfully, it&#x27;s completely possible to use <i>only</i> Messenger, but you need to jump through some hoops. Facebook will automatically enable your &quot;normal&quot; account, so you need to disable it (not delete it) to &quot;keep&quot; the Messenger functionality while closing your profile.<p>As for FB as a social network, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ll echo the sentiment in the currently top voted comment here: nobody I know uses it that way anymore, except the oldest ones in my family. Looking at it cynically, I guess it makes sense that the generation that are the least resilient to online disinformation are also the last ones to jump ship.')
