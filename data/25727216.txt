It feels much more like seeing people in person and the fact that my new team doesn&#x27;t do that is making it harder to feel part of a group.<p>While I <i>really</i> like cameras on for calls, video quality isn&#x27;t important (to me), but audio quality really is. Bad audio whether it&#x27;s background noise, bad internet, echo etc. makes vc very tiring. The video could be 640x480 and 1 FPS and that would probably be fine - helps me know there&#x27;s a real person on the other end of the call.')
