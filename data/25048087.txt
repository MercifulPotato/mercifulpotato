Where they could work from home, live close to family, have a bike commute?<p>You are presenting a theoretical ideal that is probably close to unattainable.<p>- how many tech startups are in Birmingham?<p>- how many VCs would be OK funding a startup in Birmingham? I know we&#x27;re in COVID era now, but how long before VCs again start telling you to move to SF&#x2F;SV (or perhaps NY)<p>- how many 150k salaried tech startup jobs are in Birmingham? I&#x27;d estimate in the single digits, probably zero.')
