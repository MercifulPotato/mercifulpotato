It&#x27;s all tradeoffs. In the case of geopandas, would you rather:<p>a) have the software (silently) transform your data, making decisions on your behalf about which are the source and destination projections, datum transforms, raster resampling, line densification, and precision.<p>PRO: easy, CON: potential poor performance, accuracy.<p>b) fail because the coordinate references systems don&#x27;t match.<p>PRO: logical, type-safe, CON: Comparing coordinate systems is not a solved problem. You can have two identical (or practically identical) systems that are not equal by their representation or your programming language semantics.<p>c) try to naively attempt the spatial analysis in 2D cartesian space.<p>PRO: does what it says, leaves the responsibility to the programmer. CON: does what it says, leaves the responsibility to the programmer.<p>I&#x27;ve seen justification for all three approaches but no obvious solution. I tend to go with c) ala geopandas since ultimately the responsibility lies with the person building the system.')
