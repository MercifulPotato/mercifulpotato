In this case we are talking about registration not actually voting. You only need to register once when you move to a new area so most people don’t even need to register.<p>On top of that voter registration is available year round. This is just the last day to register and still be able to vote in the upcoming election. Again you don’t need to register for every election.<p>Also, numerous states also allow people to register and vote the same day.<p>It’s not perfect but what you read online is grossly exaggerated for political gain on both sides.')
