I do not see the SE even listed in Apple&#x27;s refurbished store anymore and I am struggling to find any documentation or evidence suggesting it is available thru Apple authorized resellers (no inventory I can find at ATT, T-Mobile, Verizon, etc)<p>FWIW I&#x27;ve been using a 2016 SE since... 2016, and I bought a spare one from Apple&#x27;s refurbished clearance in 2019 when it became clear the phone would no longer be available outside ebay&#x2F;grey market. If it&#x27;s been silently available this whole time at any authorized seller that&#x27;d be huge news to me.')
