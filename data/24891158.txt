This &quot;awkwardness&quot; pays for itself in spades when you realise that a change in a script you&#x27;ve written at the start of the project and haven&#x27;t tested since is suddendly raising an error and you have no idea at which point it broke. This is a common thing that comes up in my projects. Git even has a special command to do this for you - &quot;git bisect&quot;. I can&#x27;t imagine the pain in the arse it would be to try and roll back maybe months of changes by hand, by copy-pasting backup files, I guess, or by making new untracked changes, until you have nothing to go back to that actually works.<p>I&#x27;ve been in situations like this, like I say. Having a bedrock of committed code that I can go back to anytime I like is a time saver of epic proportions. A bit of &quot;awkwardness&quot; or even worse once in a while, is totally worth it.<p>And conflicts happen for a reason. How do you merge work of two or three members of a team without something like version control? That sounds like an even worse nightmare.')
