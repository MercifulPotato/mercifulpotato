I don&#x27;t agree because i don&#x27;t see the %-take as the issue at all.<p>Apple is framing the issue as far away from the real issue as possible - that of the device being locked down and you can only install via the app-store.<p>By conceding to a 15% cut, they&#x27;ve steered the overton window of discussion to just the %-cut rate, rather than the actual issue of having a competing app-store (or at least side-loadable apps).')
