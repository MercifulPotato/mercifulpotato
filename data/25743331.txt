Empathy would involve setting aside your own feelings and wants for a time so you could experience what the other person is feeling.  To do so, you would try to take account of the factors that have lead the other person to this point.<p>For example, if you saw a mother scold a child unfairly in the supermarket, you might consider factors such as the mother&#x27;s income or lack thereof, and how difficult it might be for her to have to admit to herself that she can&#x27;t provide what she thinks her child needs at that point in time.  Her frustration gets displaced as anger directed towards the child, but that&#x27;s not because she has ill will towards the child - its because she has no other way to dissipate the energy at that point.<p>That&#x27;s one possible example, but perhaps I&#x27;m just not getting what you are saying.  Could you give an example of what you mean?')
