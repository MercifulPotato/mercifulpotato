I mean, the AirPods Pro are already damn impressive here. You could probably do better by cramming more and more technology closer to the actual ear &#x2F;at the tip of the earbuds, perhaps? These things do cancel the low-mid end of voice frequencies quite well. I imagine with enough miniaturization you could increase the range.<p>But room-scale or free-space noise cancellation only works when either 1) your noise source is extremely predictable, or 2) your noise source is low-dimensional. It&#x27;s just never going to work for the general case unless you can somehow sense the entire <i>soundfield</i>. The entire sum of what waves are traveling in which directions. Not just a few microphone inputs. It&#x27;s going from 1D data to 3D data, the difference between a light sensor and a CAT scanner. And it needs to work at 20kHz response.<p>I guess hypothetically you could do something like wrap a room in microphones and compute the sound coming <i>in</i> in all directions, then with a very good adaptive model be able to cancel noise from outside within it. But if you&#x27;re going to draw a boundary and wrap it in a massive array of microphones... Aren&#x27;t you better off just adding insulation material? :-)<p>Edit: just as a baseline, I very crudely tested my Bose QC20 earbuds (which aren&#x27;t exactly bleeding edge tech) and I think they get about 10dB active cancellation at 1kHz, which goes down to nothing at 2kHz. Human voice fundamental frequencies are typically 85-180 Hz for adult cis men and 165 - 255 Hz for adult cis women, so this level of ANC does get rid of the fundamental and a few harmonics. I might test a friend&#x27;s AirPods Pro later and see if they&#x27;re better. 1kHz has a wavelength of ~34cm, so I think there is room for improvement here in the earbuds case. I&#x27;m not experienced enough in this field to have a good feel for the numbers beyond order of magnitude estimates, but I <i>think</i> going up to 4kHz might be doable, given that for earbuds we&#x27;re talking about cavities in the ~5cm range. Might need more mics&#x2F;drivers and more miniaturization to pull it off, not sure.<p>For those wondering, the test methodology was to play a tone, turn on cancellation (which has a delay), then turn off cancellation (which is instant) simultaneously with decreasing the amplitude of the tone, and trying to match the perceived loudness between both cases.')
