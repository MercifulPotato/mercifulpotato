Why isn&#x27;t it indexed synchronously on install!?<p>Why does it even need indexing in the first place!? Do you have any idea how few milliseconds it takes to just brute-force search through a few dozen KB of text?<p>I implemented real-time character-by-character completion and search for an index over a 100M records in a web application in 2007. Are you telling me that Microsoft, one of the world&#x27;s biggest corporations struggles to solve the same problem in a week for an amount of text that a child could index using play cards in a matter of minutes?')
