Item(by='nicoburns', descendants=None, kids=[25821220], score=None, time=1610965408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25817758, text='&gt; Chopping an onion takes what feels like an eternity.<p>It&#x27;s definitely partly practice, but make sure you have a decently sharp knife (you don&#x27;t need to get anything ridiculously expensive but you should be paying ~£20 for one knife). The cheap &quot;sharp knives&quot; you get for £20-30 for a whole set tend to not actually be that sharp and make it really difficult to cut through things like onions because they slip all over the place.')
