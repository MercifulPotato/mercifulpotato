I don&#x27;t have that kind of time :)<p>Also, I agree that past a certain point grammar becomes extremely convoluted. But I&#x27;m not speaking about complex grammar subtleties here, just basic things such as the role of prepositions, word order, basic conjugations etc. Stuff like &quot;most verbs from their past by adding -ed at the end&quot; or &quot;when you ask a question, you typically change the word order and add &quot;do&quot; &quot; etc.')
