Treating editing as a second-&#x2F;third-class citizen and not as a first- is exactly what led to this mess in the first place.<p>Again, see Tim Berners-Lee and the first, second, and third web browsers ever released, and notice what changed along the way.<p>If you cannot edit and save a web document as easily as you can read it, the system has already failed. If you have to switch mental or environment modes to do so, the system has already failed. If you have to switch to a different tool to complete the write operation (e.g. FTP client), the system has already failed. If you have to fiddle with individual files instead of discrete <i>documents</i>, the system has already failed. If you have to manage local copies vs remote copies of your documents, the system has already failed. And so on.<p>It doesn’t matter how <i>important</i> something is, if you make it <i>hard</i> (or even just harder) to do, 99% of people will not do it. That’s not on them as the users; it’s on you as the product developers.<p>Making a read-write web work as a mass end-user product means eliminating ALL the user-facing distinctions between web-browsing <i>for reading</i> and web-browsing <i>for writing</i>. Those distinctions are completely contrived and unnecessary—not to mention ultimately harmful—and the only reason it ever existed in the first place is ’cos Tim Berners-Lee was a lazy ass who couldn’t be bothered to port the authoring part of WorldWideWeb to Windows, and in doing so destroyed the very Open Web that he himself invented.<p>Talk about Laws of Unintended Consequences.<p>Like I say, think of MS Word (not an ideal example in terms of ease of use, but it is ubiquitous and an interaction model everyone understands), only instead of reading and writing to file paths reads and writes to URLs. That is the basic UX an open web requires. Anything else is just the geeks playing with themselves (again),  which the marketers and money men <i>will</i> make into their own (again).<p>..<p>I mean, it should not be hard to grasp (I am a BoVLB, so if <i>I</i> can see it…), yet so many dyed-in-the-wool geeks utterly fail to grasp it. Maybe that’s because they’re so inured to the current imbalanced system that they cannot imagine it being any other way? Perhaps because they themselves are a deeply integrated part of that system and, on the inside looking out, cannot see what all the fuss is about when that imbalance already works in their favor.<p>Alas, we do seem to be two cultures separated by a common language here, so help me understand how to explain it in a way y’all can understand.')
