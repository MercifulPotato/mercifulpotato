Thanks for sharing.<p>My understanding has always been plasma propulsion uses high energy to generate sustained low thrust without reaction mass, making it most suitable where there is high energy availability (portable fusion reactor, etc.) and a long slow acceleration is fine, that is, deep space.<p>With the atmospheric conductors, you are basically talking about artificial lightning, correct? Potentially a lot of energy, to be sure! The big questions must be how to harness it and for what uses it is best suited. Is there not speculation on this (sci fi or academic)? I seem to remember reading about this as being a “problem” to be solved as part of a space elevator design.')
