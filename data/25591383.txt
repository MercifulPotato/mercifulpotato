Just yesterday I helped a family member install firefox for their android device, and installed an adblocker, to replace their news apps with &quot;Add to home screen&quot; PWAs (they were sick of the billions of ads in the apps).<p>Now it sounds like they&#x27;re not killing the mobile PWA yet, but it&#x27;s a big selling point of firefox as far as I&#x27;m concerned.<p>I was also just starting to switch to firefox on desktop (just installed my main plugins yesterday) for my main browser, but this is really making me reconsider.')
