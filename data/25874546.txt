Item(by='rektide', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611340350, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25874174, text='Thunderbolt on Its Trial[1][2] is a recent post that mentioned some of this split, with a story of a german waiter serving allied soldiers after the war. It talked about the soldiers returning home, finding a nation which had radicalized it&#x27;s hate, a hate they demonstrably did not have. Good article in other ways, talking about &quot;being under a spell&quot;, &amp; judgment based on the extreme events that eventually boil (thunderbolt) over from longer situations (heavy weather). I feel this article will stick with me for a long time.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unintendedconsequenc.es&#x2F;thunderbolt-on-its-trial&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unintendedconsequenc.es&#x2F;thunderbolt-on-its-trial&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25838341" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25838341</a>')
