Cars aren&#x27;t exactly a cost-less enterprise. They&#x27;re expensive. So clearly these people are making enough money to help fund that car payment.<p>These people aren&#x27;t slaves to the system. They willingly are seeking their own self interests on their own time. They can quit tomorrow if they wanted to. The simple fact that they need money is irrelevant. They aren&#x27;t some serf subservient to these Gig businesses. The simple fact that they have a car and a tank of gas alone goes to show they can literally go anywhere and get a better&#x2F;stable job instead.<p>Wage slavery is when people essentially become serfs. Nobody in the US is even close to a serf. Even if they go homeless, there are plenty of homeless people that still get by every day and have the capability to move elsewhere for work. They aren&#x27;t forced to work at mcdonalds until &quot;master says so.&quot;')
