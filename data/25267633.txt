Item(by='arendtio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606844994, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25267094, text='&gt; Probably suggest arch linux to someone complaining about having to track down dependencies does not make sense, since such a person is more interested in the OS just working rather than making the OS a bit of a hobby that that they want to customize.<p>Sure, in the beginning you have to spend some time to set it up, but due to the rolling releases it has a great longevity. And talking about application integration, I prefer the package management style (even through AUR) greatly to the chaotic download some binary and execute it way windows does it. Over time your windows always gets so messy because every device manufacturer seems to think that it is cool, to bundle his device driver with hundreds of megabytes of non-sense-ware (last weekend I installed some Logitech driver on Windows, because the default Windows driver didn&#x27;t work (on Arch I didn&#x27;t have to install anything extra, just saying... yes, anecdotal evidence)).')
