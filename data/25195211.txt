Or you can go to one of the non bulk-billing doctors and a nice lounge to sit on whilst you wait.<p>Generally necessary pathology&#x2F;radiology or routine blood  tests are covered by medicare which is paid for by a levy of about 1% on income.<p>Likewise pharmaceuticals are generally fairly low cost (there are exceptions), being subsidised by the government and for low income or people with ongoing requirements can be free.<p>Private health insurance is available and encouraged by a decrease in your medicare levy, but a lot of people are finding that it doesn&#x27;t provide any financial benefit and as we have a very good public health system, does not provide any better health outcome.<p>Health Insurance is not a major concern in Australia.  It certainly is not tied to an employer and doesn&#x27;t rate on the list of things to worry about when getting a job.')
