So you either have to:<p>- Write code that’s as pedantically correct as in a traditional statically-typed language (e.g. by using `mypy —-strict`), in which case you’d be better off using a language that supports AOT-compilation, or<p>- Be prepared for cases where the runtime type doesn’t match the annotation. This is unacceptable - I hate the idea of code that tells lies.')
