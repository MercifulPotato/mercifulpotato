I was in Paris and set to leave and they went on strike.  I waited in line for hours to try and get on any flight out, and they said there was no chance I would leave that day, and I should book a hotel.<p>So we booked the cheapest thing we could find that would work with our baby, and it was 500 euros for the night.  Two hours later they called us and told us to get to the airport right away if we wanted to leave France in less than a week.<p>So we left France on small plane, and couldn&#x27;t get a refund on the hotel because it was less than 24.  All because they couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get us on that flight two hours earlier when I was at their customer service desk.')
