While we don&#x27;t know why for sure, it is entirely possible that telomere shortening actually lengthens life.<p>As telomeres become shorter, cell division becomes slower and metabolism decreases. This means that an older person&#x27;s cells will reproduce at a slower rate than a younger person&#x27;s in general. If we suppose that every cell division poses an equal chance at producing a life threatening cancer, then slower cell reproduction at a higher age would likely be beneficial.<p>Of course this is just speculation, but likely there is _some_ health benefit to telomere shortening otherwise we would not have evolved to do it.')
