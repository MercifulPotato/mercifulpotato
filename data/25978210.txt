Specifically, Darais (from Galois) et al show in &quot;Abstracting Definitional Interpreters&quot; how given a definitional interpreter you can easily create all sorts of abstractions using a stack of monad transformers. The best part of it all is that your particular chosen stack remains valid when moved between interpreters of different languages.<p>Your dream of varied static analysis can be achieved using monad transformers, definitional interpreters written in the required style, and Racket&#x27;s DSL-creation system.')
