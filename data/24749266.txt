The best you could do is know someone did not visit a site in the last ${cache_time}.<p>There are, of course, other vectors to consider, but I can&#x27;t think of any that could be abused by third parties. If anything, isolating caches would make it easier for the CDN themselves to carry out the attack you mentioned, as they would be receiving all the requests in one batch.')
