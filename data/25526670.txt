Algeria was part of Metropolitan France, the rest of what we’d now can the Empire wasn’t. All of France’s remaining extra-European possessions have every right French in the Hexagon do, and are French citizens. Algerians had it extremely easy moving to and naturalist got in France for decades after de Gaulle left Algeria. And Algeria was treated as French in law until such time as the French left. Thus the spat between the two countries in the 70s over children of Algerian immigrants automatically being granted French citizenship at 18. That was because their parents had been born in what was then France.<p>France and the Empire were not legally coextensive, and Tunisia and Morocco were never legally part of France. The generation that were born in what was legally France are done having children too.')
