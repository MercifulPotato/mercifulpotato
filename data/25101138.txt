One of the reasons D compiles so fast is because of this - the compiler isn&#x27;t even specifically optimized for speed.<p>Everyone seems to think that writing expressive code is slow, when really it&#x27;s because Python is slow and C++ is a lumbering behemoth.<p>Python isn&#x27;t even a high-level language, think about it - it&#x27;s higher level than C but the capability it has for abstraction it gives you is really just interpreted C with classes.')
