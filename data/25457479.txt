Basically zero idea about licenses outside generic FUD about the viral nature of the GPL etc.<p>The ethical-philosophical free software people are terrible at marketing and getting their message across.<p>It&#x27;s still just a small niche subculture despite the wide adoption of GNU tools and licenses. You&#x27;ll never reach further with all the silly in joke stuff like Chief GNUisance etc. You&#x27;d need charismatic frontline personalities (there&#x27;s a wide spectrum to explore between RMS and sleazy snake oil salesmen), who don&#x27;t immediately put off the general population.')
