The situation is certainly not great, with source drops, nonfree firmware blobs, etc. But it is relatively easy to grab an AOSP source-tree for your device, make some changes, rebuild the OS and install this to your phone, given an unlocked&#x2F;unlockable bootloader. In my opinion this is a highly desirable property of any system I&#x27;m using. It also enables things like GrapheneOS and CalyxOS which are Android distributions which focus explicitly on security and privacy.<p>&gt; Can the Exposure Notification Framework be trusted less than the rest of Android?<p>ENF is part of Google Play Services and thus proprietary software. It is also a hugely scary and absolutely giant bundle of software you need to keep running in it&#x27;s entirety, you cannot use just the ENF part. Play services can remotely update any software on your phone, they have also been known to &quot;accidentally&quot; not respect users (location)-tracking opt-out choices. So while I personally don&#x27;t consider googles ENF implementation problematic (from their docs, the sources are ofc not available) the rest of play services most certainly is.<p>&gt; Or does this support more hardware?<p>Apart from the already mentioned gapps free ROMS it supports modern Huawei phones (which also come without gapps). Making it work on Android 5 will probably happen (Google ENF supports Android 6+ afaik)')
