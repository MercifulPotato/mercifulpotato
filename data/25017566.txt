Furthermore, Western Digital even uses &#x27;halfway-to-MAMR&#x27; energy-assisted perpendicular magnetic recording (ePMR) for its latest HDDs. Meanwhile, everyone agrees that HAMR is the best option for the long term.<p>HAMR requires new heads and immediate transition to glass platters with all-new new coating, whereas MAMR only needs new heads and can continue using aluminum media with a known coating. Even if HAMR offers a higher areal density than MAMR, it is possible to increase platter count to expand the capacity of a MAMR drive to match that of a HAMR-based HDD. There is a catch though: thin MAMR platters will have to rely on a glass substrate.&quot;<p>This is interesting; it seems that we might be halfway between metal and glass hard drives...<p>Which brings up an interesting thought, phrased as a challenge, for all Physicists out there...<p>Given a piece of glass, ordinary glass, ordinary glass and no magnetic metal platter, my challenge is:<p>a) How do you write data to it?<p>b) How do you read that data back from it?<p>c) What&#x27;s the smallest size &#x2F; depth you can accomplish this at, and why?<p>d) Does a formula govern c, and if so, what is it?<p>e) What do you do about imperfections in the glass?<p>?<p>We currently have CD&#x27;s, DVD&#x27;s and Blu-Ray discs that use lasers to write to chemical mixtures inside of those media.<p>My challenge is -- can we do it <i>without those chemical compounds</i>, could we use simple pure glass, and if so, how?<p>?<p>(Note to Future Self: Work on this in the future... &lt;g&gt;)')
