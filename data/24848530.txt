Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=[24848683, 24855855], score=None, time=1603292628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848384, text='&gt; I wonder why any time I see these claims, they’re never accompanied by anything resembling reliable evidence.<p>Because the stories have been on all the news sites, it&#x27;s common knowledge, and thus it would be superfluous to submit detailed documentation every time it&#x27;s mentioned? I can&#x27;t help it if you&#x27;re not informed about politics and tech.<p>&gt; you on the other hand are free to vote with your wallet and your time by buying their devices and developing for their ecosystem (or not).<p>People always say stuff like that, but do they really mean it? It feels like just empty rhetoric to shut down criticism of Apple, not an actual suggestion. I&#x27;ve been a professional Mac developer for over a dozen years, my software has been enjoyed by countless people, and I&#x27;ve also provided many tech insights enjoyed by many people, including this one under discussion, as well as the Google Chrome bug story that&#x27;s been going around — that&#x27;s me too! Are you seriously saying I should pack my bags and leave the Apple ecosystem forever and no longer write software for the Mac or write blog posts about it? Is that what you really want? Is that what people in general want, for me to leave the Mac? Don&#x27;t say it unless you mean it, and are willing to drive away longtime Mac users and&#x2F;or developers like me.<p>I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy your &quot;curated&quot; criticism-less ecosystem with no actual developers who care about the Mac.')
