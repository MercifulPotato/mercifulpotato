The system pushing the vaccine is far too corrupt, and the bullying is already far too aggressive, to justify any other position. But it is still a tough decision, because the expected risk of war and fascism is pretty fucking hard to calculate.<p>By the way in a vacuum I like both MRNA vaccines and nuclear fission, despite the risks.')
