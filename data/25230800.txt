While any loss of life is unfortunate, and while the US and Israel are not without blemish, this assassination was very targeted (no collateral) and it plausibly deters Iran from advancing (and thus <i>using</i>) its nuclear weapons program. This seems like a pretty good deal on balance, at least for those who can accept that the world is not perfect and very often the loss of a single life is the best one can hope for to prevent the losses of tens or hundreds of thousands of lives.<p>Anyway, I want to steer clear of the &quot;which country is more evil?&quot; question because it&#x27;s so very unlikely to yield productive discourse (we can use enumeration fallacy to support whichever position we like <i>even if we agree on core values</i>).')
