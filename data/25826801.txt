Item(by='y-c-o-m-b', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611005026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25825266, text='My first question to a potential new employer has become &quot;what are your health insurance benefits and how much do you cover?&quot; rather than &quot;what&#x27;s the salary range you&#x27;re hiring for?&quot; (although this still comes second). If it&#x27;s anything less than 80% employer-paid coverage or they don&#x27;t offer traditional PPO plans, it&#x27;s an automatic withdrawal of my application.<p>I&#x27;ve recently found I now need to add another filter to this: &quot;WHO is your insurance through?&quot; because apparently even 90% employer paid health insurance through UnitedHealthcare still sucks compared to inferior coverage through BlueCross or Aetna. \nI had to switch primary care doctors for everyone in my family (me, wife, kids all had different docs) because none of them were in network with United. Confused by this, I called around. I found out doctors offices <i>loathe</i> dealing with UHC due to UHC&#x27;s reluctance to pay or the generally obnoxious claims process. Their &quot;in-network&quot; providers is contained to a much smaller list of providers that put up with their bullshit. I&#x27;m seriously considering leaving my current employer (which I&#x27;m very happy with) for this reason alone.<p>Lack of reliable (or any) health insurance is the #1 reason I don&#x27;t take contract jobs even though they&#x27;re more attractive to me.')
