The best programmers I know that work at companies that do technically challenging things know the topic of multithreaded data structures and algorithms pretty well, by intuition.<p>At university, I followed a course based on the book of Maurice Herlihy [1], the videos are locked. At the time, I barely passed the course because of doing too many courses. So I want to relearn the topic, properly this time.<p>So I wondered: according to you, what is the best way of learning multithreaded programming?<p>[1] He also teaches a course, the slides are here somewhere: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.brown.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;cs176&#x2F;course_information.shtml')
