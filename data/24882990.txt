I don&#x27;t think the  United States is the &quot;bad guy&quot; or the root of all evil, I don&#x27;t think the West is either. I just don&#x27;t think that they&#x27;re the &quot;good guy&quot; that routinely exercises restraint, unless you compare it to an imaginary hypothetical.<p>I don&#x27;t support China either - I don&#x27;t believe in the &quot;good vs evil&quot; narrative that was alien to the Ancient Romans and Greek pagans.  The idea that there&#x27;s historical moral progress culminating in the values of the United States is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence. In Hegel&#x27;s philosophy of right, which was fashionable in Germany, he believed that history culminated in the values of the Prussian constitutional monarchy.<p>It&#x27;s unlikely that China will become a superpower. The United States, in the next few years, will no longer hold world wide hegemony, as it seems to be distancing itself from Europe among other countries. It&#x27;s also unlikely that we&#x27;ll return to a bipolar world, similarly to the period of the Cold War. It&#x27;s more likely that we&#x27;re moving towards a multi-polar world.')
