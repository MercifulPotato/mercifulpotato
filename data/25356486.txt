I tried it and found that:<p>1. The initial setup and build time is perhaps a little long or complex for use in classrooms&#x2F;workshops but it&#x27;s fine for personal&#x2F;professional use.<p>2. Rust&#x27;s build time might not feel like a natural fit for creative coding. Even though initial build times are long (~3 minutes on an 8-core 2019 MBP), rebuilds are fast enough to create a short feedback loop. It&#x27;s not as fluid as dynamic languages like Clojure&#x2F;JavaScript, but it&#x27;s good enough.<p>3. It&#x27;s a nice way to learn Rust.<p>4.
