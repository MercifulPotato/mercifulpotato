Google&#x27;s growing monopoly, however static their operating methods have been, is no longer viewed as in the consumers&#x27; best interest and is thus now under scrutiny.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that accurate to frame this as &quot;people in power are threatened by [big tech]&#x27;s power&quot; when there are plenty of reasonable people making convincing arguments that big tech is no longer operating in the best interests of the consumer.')
