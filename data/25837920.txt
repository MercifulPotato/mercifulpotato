I suppose you would be able to estimate which stream you&#x27;re receiving based on number of callers in a conference but your outgoing stream is always going to be the same, assuming you&#x27;re not network constrained.<p>The stream is a single H264&#x2F;SVC stream which contains layers of varying quality. It&#x27;s sent to the Zoom &quot;cloud&quot; where the appropriately sized layer is extracted and forwarded to clients. It&#x27;s called selective forwarding and it&#x27;s essentially how all of the WebRTC style video conferencing solutions work once there are more than 2-3 participants.')
