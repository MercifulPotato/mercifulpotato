Still feel like it&#x27;d be more convenient to have cellular connectivity built right in though; you always have some connectivity then provided you&#x27;re not too remote.<p>I&#x27;ve considered switching to Google Fi solely because they provide data-only SIMs associated with your normal plan that I could then pop into a laptop. (Rather than making you pay twice as most providers do.)<p>Haven&#x27;t been able to justify it yet though, I&#x27;m on a pretty good grandfathered plan at the moment.')
