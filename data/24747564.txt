This does not take into account the value of the time that energy is delivered, so LCOE is not directly comparable for renewables and dispatchable generation like natural gas (though a huge percentage of the new solar and wind deploys for the next 5 years are adding storage to convert them into dispatchable resources.)<p>As for the disposal costs, that&#x27;s a fairy trivial problem.  Solar panel recycling has not really started because there&#x27;s not many dead panels to recycle; lifetimes are tending to be longer than expected. However as there is a larger source of retired solar panels, those attempting to recycle them will get a better feel for the costs of construction of new panels from raw materials versus recycled magerials.')
