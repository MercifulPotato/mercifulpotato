This part puzzled me though:<p>&gt; The operating system reads data in page granularity, meaning it can only read at a minimum 4kB at a time. That means if you need to read read 1kB split in two files, 512 bytes each, you are effectively reading 8kB to serve 1kB, wasting 87% of the data read.<p>SSDs (whether SATA or NVMe) all read and write whole sectors at a time, right? I&#x27;m not sure what the sector size is, but 4 KiB seems like a reasonable guess. So I think you&#x27;re reading the 8 KiB no matter what; it may just be a question of what layer you drop it at (right when it gets to the kernel or not). Also, doesn&#x27;t direct IO require sector size-aligned operations?')
