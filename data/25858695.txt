The real story though is the echo chambers.<p>This trump riot thing was very odd to see. For all of 2020 you could see extreme violence from left-wing riots and left-wing news sources like msnbc did not cover this at all. You CANNOT find anything about injured police or explosives in seattle on msnbc.<p>When trump rioters took control of capitol hill. MSNBC had more articles in a week about the evil MAGA riot and how Trump incited a riot than they covered about violent riots in seattle all year.')
