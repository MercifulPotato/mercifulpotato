I’ve worked for 2 of the companies in the list and they both presume to have the highest values and a nice ethic codes. They even promote things like “if you need more time to do the assigned work, don’t do overtime, report to your manager and the case will be assessed...”. But then in reality the employees keep doing a big amount of unpaid extra hours.<p>Why is that? Because the ethic code is only to show off, but internally there is continuous  pressure on the people and not doing overtime will be punished one way or another.')
