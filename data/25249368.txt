The underlying problem is the law, not the litigants. In any other field that deals with copyright, the idea that copyright protection extends to what is effectively a series of headings and summaries would be obvious. The problem is that copyright is a poor fit for software - our headings and summaries carry function to them, and changing them breaks code. In general, the law doesn&#x27;t want to grant copyright over purely functional things, or even things where functionality and creativity are frustratingly mixed. That&#x27;s why boat hulls and hardware have separate ownership regimes - copyright over them was explicitly rejected. But we also explicitly said software is copyrightable, which leaves open the question of where the unprotected function ends and the protected creativity starts.<p>Maybe in the world where Android never happened, some other company stumbled upon this rich vein of confusion, and we&#x27;re dealing with SCO&#x2F;Novell&#x2F;Attachmate&#x2F;Whoever v. Apple over who can implement UNIX APIs in their kernels.')
