I was at the same point about a year ago and wrote a small python script that posts pages that I write locally in vim to Confluence:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SabbathHex&#x2F;confluence_poster" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SabbathHex&#x2F;confluence_poster</a><p>The downside is that due to Atlassian limitation and phasing out of wiki markup it&#x27;s not possible to retrieve articles from Confluence. This script is not suitable for collaborative editing of the same page.<p>Script is quite ugly, but gets the job done.')
