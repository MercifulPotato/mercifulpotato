Total War is a turn based strategy with real time tactical battles. Online play is mostly the tactical battles so is a real time tactics game.<p>The reason you separate it there is that in a strategy game you should be able to win the war while losing every battle. You can&#x27;t do that unless you can produce units, meaning if you plan well you can outproduce your enemy and win even though he kills more of your stuff every time you fight.')
