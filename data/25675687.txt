I like having all bank account and card transactions in one place and having the budgeting decoupled from the institutions. The goal-setting features are great. And keeping a careful budget of all inflow and outflow has been pretty easy and makes it nice to set up lots of small budgeting buckets. After an initial setup, it feels like a machine that keeps my finances in order without too much intervention.<p>If you get into YNAB, also check out the toolkit[1], which gives some additional budget analysis and planning tools.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pcap.rocks&#x2F;matt1688" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pcap.rocks&#x2F;matt1688</a> (includes my referral code)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toolkitforynab.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toolkitforynab.com&#x2F;</a>')
