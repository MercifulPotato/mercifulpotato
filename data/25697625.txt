Not sure how laws are in the US, but when doing support here in germany we had to have private in-game messages reported by a participant before we were even allowed to look at them. The company obviously had a much easier time shaping the atmosphere in the public forum.<p>And if you only care about outcomes like never having a terrorist attack... well, I don&#x27;t see how this could ever happen without in-depth control by government or the like. China-style is probably the closest example we have, and that&#x27;s not a trade-off i would want to make.')
