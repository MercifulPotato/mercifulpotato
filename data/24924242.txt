G-Sync displays require special hardware from Nvidia, must adhere to a series of certifications from Nvidia, and don&#x27;t always support adaptive-sync at low framerates.<p>RTX Voice is probably not super important for a lot of people. However, as someone who prefers to not wear headphones for long periods of time, it sounds like an extremely useful technology.<p>And DLSS 2.0 is a pretty big deal for anyone with a 4K screen. I don&#x27;t have a 4K monitor, but I regularly connect my computer to my 4K TV so I would probably leverage DLSS often. I hope AMD&#x27;s upcoming solution is comparable, but I need to see it before I give them credit for it.')
