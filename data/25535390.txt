One year we tried laying the fiber for the satellite switches in the troughs and leaving it there for next year. We laid extras for redundancy. Come next year, something like 30% of the fibers were dead and we even had places where both paths were dead and we had to patch up above ground.<p>Nope. Venues and especially the people who rent them can&#x27;t be trusted with cabling. We now run our own every year, in an efficient combination of above ground and through the wiring troughs. We pull it out when we&#x27;re done though. Only a couple things -the main internet feed, which is more robust, and the line that crosses halls- stay there to be reused (or fixed if necessary, <i>groan</i>).')
