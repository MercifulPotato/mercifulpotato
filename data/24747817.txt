It looks at a correlation of existing energy  by US states, where our nuclear was largely built in the 1970s and 1980s.<p>In contrast, the academic paper looks at what has happened to countries , globally, that have tried to build nuclear since the 1990s.<p>And this is a crucial distinction, because the problem with nuclear is that economies have changed since the 1970s and we have new technologies with different costs.<p>So what if we look at what has happened to US states that, since 1990, have tried to build nuclear versus those that have tried to build renewables?<p>Nuclear has failed since the 1990s in the US, even with construction project with very strong community support and federal regulatory support from the NRC.<p>So when you ask the question that the paper asks: &quot;does building new nuclear or renewables decrease carbon more with modern economies?&quot; We see that the US recapitulates the same correlation that researchers found globally.<p>This huge bias of nuclear proponents, the inability to address the cost issue and very basic construction issues, is far more problematic for nuclear than a corrective analysis of what has happened to grids that have pursued different strategies.')
