The infection part related to communication with the C&amp;C server could be detected by AMSI if the attacker would use PowerShell or Windows Script Host, but the author uses Python.\nAll of this is interesting and can be dangerous by using offline ransomware (no C&amp;C server). But in practice when the attacker wants to use C&amp;C server then another scripting engine has to be used. If the attacker can install Python on the target machine then the Python scripts will be probably as dangerous as Phantom Malware.')
