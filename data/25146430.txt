You don&#x27;t need an Apple Developer account, or an internet connection, or anything other than macOS and a working development environment. Just go into the Terminal and type:<p>&gt; codesign -f -s - [path to binary]<p>Unless something has changed on Apple Silicon, that&#x27;s it, you&#x27;re done, the binary has a signature. It does not have a <i>trusted</i> signature, but you don&#x27;t need one. I think it was just simpler to write the OS assuming all executables would have a signature.')
