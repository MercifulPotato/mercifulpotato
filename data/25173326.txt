But it&#x27;s also the only distro I have used for probably more than 10 years where I found myself having to edit my X config to try and get something to work. At that point I just backed away from the keyboard slowly and realised it wasn&#x27;t worth my time.<p>I do still have a throwaway cheap VPS with Arch, but even then I can&#x27;t recommend it because the security story is largely non-existent.')
