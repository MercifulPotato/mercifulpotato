Only signing. Encryption is a bit of a red herring with PGP, I think verifiable signing and tooling for almost every platform and language in existence are its two real killer features.<p>Without nation-state backing, I wouldn&#x27;t trust it to keep something secure or private. On the other hand, its portability, adaptability, and compatibility is unmatched by any tool that I&#x27;m aware of. It allows you to have a portable identity that you can own and secure, and do it all in plaintext.<p>And the content, identities, votes of my forum can be migrated, cloned, copied, synchronized among any other forum like it, or used outside of it with the most popular identity tooling in existence at your disposal.
