I get regularly downvoted here for promoting free speech and denouncing all forms of web censorship.<p>Websites and their obscure “Terms of Service” and “Community Guidelines” are eroding those rights and <i>should</i> be fully compliant with the first amendment if operating in the United States, similar to how websites operating in the EU must comply with the GDPR.<p>I forgot how the United States is just about the only country with virtually unlimited free speech, so the downvotes must come from a place of envy.<p><i>Edit: Downvotes have proven my point :-)</i>')
