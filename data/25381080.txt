Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have 10 day forecasts and I believe the reason they don&#x27;t show 10 day forecasts is because they are not very accurate. That far out your better off looking at forecast ensembles and looking at what the Euro, Canadian, as well as the GFS model is forecasting. But no common, free weather websites I&#x27;m aware of exposes that info. If you live in the west you can use this site to a degree[1], although its more targeted to snow&#x2F;ski forecasting.<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;weather.utah.edu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;weather.utah.edu&#x2F;</a>')
