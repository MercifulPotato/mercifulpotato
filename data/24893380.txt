I&#x27;ve definitely had the experience many times of starting to talk a second or two after someone else finishes, only to find someone else had started talking - and all this takes is maybe 500ms of delay to become super noticable.<p>I&#x27;ve also found it extremely noticable when someone is screen sharing, and their screen share lags behind their audio several seconds often.
