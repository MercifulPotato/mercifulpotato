None of these companies will look at that and say, well this person has potential let&#x27;s give them a chance. They all will say, well they don&#x27;t raise the bar so let&#x27;s just keep our dozens of needed roles unfilled.<p>A bad engineering hire can result in worse outcomes than leaving a role unfilled because developers exert so much leverage through software. The risk when hiring developers is that they will create highly-leveraged <i>negative</i> value.<p>Taking your system design example, a poorly-designed system can:<p>- cost millions of dollars directly by failing its functional requirements<p>- cost millions more indirectly by being inefficient<p>- divert energy from other initiatives to fix<p>- dissuade other engineers from working at the company in the future<p>By this, I don&#x27;t mean to say that we should demand interviewing perfection, or that the industry&#x27;s interviewing process can&#x27;t be improved. But it&#x27;s important to recognize that &quot;having potential&quot; includes the potential for both good, and dramatically bad, outcomes.')
