There&#x27;s always an option (or at least I was always offered an option) to sell back some of the stock at the time to cover the tax, even if you weren&#x27;t exercising the remainder right away.  That way there was no out-of-pocket cost to you at the time of vesting (but you did have the option to keep all the RSU&#x27;s and pay the tax due if you wanted to).')
