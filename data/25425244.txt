It lasted about a day and now it&#x27;s absolutely fine.  Yesterday I was vacuuming and my ankle just starts hurting like crazy.  Fine in about 15 minutes.  The other day I was bending over the sink washing dishes and my left shoulder blade gave me 7&#x2F;10 pain.  Seemed to be caused by an aggravated neck extensor but IDK.<p>Getting old sucks but I suppose it beats the alternative.')
