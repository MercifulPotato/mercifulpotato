Data on this? I personally have never seen a significant delay for an OTP code to either my inbox or my email (Google &amp; Verizon). I have seen users that have an old email configured that is no longer active, but, oh, 80% of the time their cell number is a backup, so resolution is easy enough for them.<p>You say it’s insecure? Really? So the more than 30% of your users that have their password written either on paper on their desk (most commonly a sticky note or in a small notebook just hanging out on the paper pile) or in an unencrypted note taking app is somehow more secure?<p>You say it’s inconvenient? What? It can’t be more inconvenient than having to go through a password reset process once a week (which believe it or not, a TON of end users do).<p>Is any one actually measuring this or is this as an complete echo chamber of nerds that are good with password managers? Because I can tell you with certainty there’s a whole demographic, generation of humans out there where single token logins (backed up by multiple OTP at certain time or event trigger intervals) is BY FAR AND AWAY A BETTER WAY!<p>You want an example of who I think has this perfected: Affirm.com')
