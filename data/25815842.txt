On that list, most likely, is either &quot;Nazi&quot; directly, or &quot;any terms that would be associated with white nationalism&quot; indirectly.<p>This is independent of the employee being Jewish, or there actually being Nazis at the rally (there were, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be up for debate).<p>The reason I mention these very important distinction is I&#x27;ve seen language by others elsewhere online claiming, somehow, Github has become part of the MAGA bullshit storm. It hasn&#x27;t, Github made a typical HR mistake at a very inopportune time: don&#x27;t make this some political argument to score fictional points in a game that has no rules.<p>The whole thing just sounds bizarre, and I don&#x27;t think the whole story is being told, or will ever be told.')
