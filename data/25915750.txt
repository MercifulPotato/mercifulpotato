If you are long a stock you can sell it whenever you feel like it is about to lose value. When you sell covered options you may be forced to hold the stock until the contract expires. Thatâ€™s the whole point of the call: the buyer pays you the premium and in exchange you are taking all of the risk for the duration of the contract.')
