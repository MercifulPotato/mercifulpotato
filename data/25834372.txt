That&#x27;s literally the scenario that many of us are trying to build.<p>It feels like the difference here is that you&#x27;re looking at &quot;someone builds a giant public hosting service off of our code&quot; as an immoral end. But I&#x27;m saying that&#x27;s not immoral, that is an acceptable result.<p>It&#x27;s obviously not the result Elastic wanted, and I empathize with that, but... I don&#x27;t know, maybe we need to educate people more about what Open Source actually means. Maybe we need to encourage more people to use source available licenses if there&#x27;s a disconnect in how people understand the actual goals of the movement.<p>We believe that people have an intrinsic, moral right to share and reuse code. Not just good citizens who help build up the system and support us -- everybody.')
