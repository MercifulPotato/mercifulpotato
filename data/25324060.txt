In fact, she wasn&#x27;t even reprimanded as far as I know for telling other employees to stop working on DEI. She told them she wanted confidental information or she will quit on a date she would like. They said they would not give her that information and that she is no longer welcome at the company. This isn&#x27;t really reprimanding or even a normal firing. If I tell my boss do X or I quit and they say &quot;Thanks for your work, we accept your resigination and the legal notice period applies.&quot; Fair play.')
