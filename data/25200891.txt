Item(by='Naac', descendants=None, kids=[25201650], score=None, time=1606240146, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196848, text='&gt;&gt;  Is this opt in or opt out?<p>That&#x27;s the frustrating part. It reads like opt-out, but when I go check the settings on the app as per the instructions it looks like it&#x27;s already disabled. But it says &quot;Coming Soon&quot;?<p>So am I supposed to check the app for the next couple weeks until it&#x27;s forced turned-on, and then disable it?<p>Definitely not what I would call &quot;Customer Obsession&quot;. If anyone knows how to cripple the echo via firewall rules, while still keeping most of its functionality, please let me know.')
