Algebraic geometry is, roughly speaking, about understanding the solutions to systems of polynomial equations, while linear algebra is much simpler and gives complete descriptions of the solutions of systems of linear equations. Geometric algebra is a framework for working with vectors and related objects in an algebraic way---one can &quot;multiply&quot; two vectors together and extract information from this.')
