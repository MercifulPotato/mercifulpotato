In fact when India deregulated rates from some of the highest in the world (voice was around $.10 to $.20&#x2F;min) most economists argued against it saying cellphones were a thing of the rich and the tax-losses to the govt from telecom revenue were not worth it. Deregulation was called a give-away to the telco companies and the rich etc. Instead, what came about was the biggest uptake in cellular and data usage and one of the cheapest rates in the world.<p>The poor benefit disproportionately in <i>relative</i> terms from access to cheap communications. Studies show cellphone and data usage to be highly correlated to improved markers in health, economic well being, education, etc. Poorly designed top-down auctions bankrupts companies and causes under-investment in infrastructure do <i>directly</i> cause suffering to hundreds of millions of very poor people. Maybe you find it snarky to point that out but I see it as a tragedy.<p>True, you can also argue that the auction revenue would have helped clean water and other developmental activities but that is an indirect effect.')
