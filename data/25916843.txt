Canada is a deep ally to the US, with a demilitarized border, tons of trade, friendly relations, cultural sharing, and easy transit between the two nations (covid notwithstanding). Canada is a much smaller, less powerful, poorer, and less globally relevant country, but is hardly impoverished. And it seems there truly are advantages to being smaller and more independent -- Canada certainly has some strong societal advantages over the US, a better social safety net, less of a military-industry complex, better income equality, etc.')
