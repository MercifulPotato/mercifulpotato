So the definition of &quot;just work&quot; depends on the context of your particular architecture.<p>For eg: you could hook into your ORM and send change events to Typesense like another commenter pointed out; if you have an event bus, you could hook into those messages and push to Typesense from a listener; you could use something like Maxwell to get a JSON stream from the DB binlogs and write the data you need into Typesense; or you could write a batch script which runs a set of SQL queries on a schedule and batch export + import into Typesense.<p>Also, typically you&#x27;d want to curate the fields that you put in a search index, vs what you store in your transactional database, so there is some level of data transformation that&#x27;s needed anyway.<p>So long story short, it depends on your architecture!')
