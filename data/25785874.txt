So unfortunately I can&#x27;t launch an extension popup over top of the checkout, it&#x27;s just not in the browser extension APIs AFAIK. One alternative was to inject the popup in to the checkout page but I figured if this got any traction it&#x27;s possible then a checkout page host could read the data (ie, your salary) from that. Thus, I landed on the intrusive redirect. Open to other ideas though!')
