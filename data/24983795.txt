Pretty much every era has been a period of domination for the wealthy and ruling class. Within that wealthy and ruling class (which accounts for less than 1% of the population) you may be able to have a discussion about gender, but the fact remains that the vast majority of men and women -- for all of history -- have been subjugated by the ruling class.')
