They were expensive (over $100 each) but incredibly high quality, fit me like a glove, still wearable today after umpteen washes.<p>In early 2020 I ordered another one -- exact same product name, exact same brand, same size, shipped-from-and-sold-by &quot;Arc&#x27;Teryx&quot;.  It was like wearing a garbage bag; the proportions were all wrong, like it was tailored for an obese person my height.  Lower quality material and all sorts of silly zippers and patches tacked onto it in weird unnecessary places.<p>Something went seriously down the drain in terms of quality with them in the interim.  I&#x27;d probably bought over $1,000 worth of clothes from them up through 2018, all of it was first rate.  Since 2020 I haven&#x27;t bought anything else from them.')
