Wikipedia:<p>GeoWorks attempted to get third-party developers but was unable to get much support due to expense of the developer kit — which ran $1,000 just for the manuals — and the difficult programming environment, which required a second PC networked via serial port in order to run the debugger.<p>Even though PC&#x2F;GEOS is referred to as an &quot;operating system&quot;, it still requires DOS in order to load. GEOS and its applications were written in a mix of 8086 assembly (Espire) and C (GOC), both with non-standard language extensions to support the object-oriented design.[5][9]')
