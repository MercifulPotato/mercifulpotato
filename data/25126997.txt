I think it&#x27;s likely there will be a 32GB Unified Memory version for the 16&quot; MBP (which maybe will become available on the 13&quot; or Mac Mini too).<p>I think M1 would not be able to achieve the performance and efficiency improvements if the RAM were not integrated, so they&#x27;ll stick with Unified Memory for the time being. I don&#x27;t think this will be as tenable for the Mac Pro (and maybe not even iMac Pro), but those are probably much further from Apple Silicon than anything else, so we&#x27;ll see what happens.')
