Basically, it&#x27;s a native Web Proxy Debugging for macOS that facilitate developers to capture HTTP&#x2F;HTTPS traffic from their iOS or Android devices.<p>I would say that it&#x27;s really difficult. For the first year, it made less than 1k&#x2F;month, which was not sustainable, so I had to stick with my remote fulltime job at Toggl.com. Spend 4 hours per day at night and entire weekend days to implement the app. And now, after 2 years, I quit my job and dedicate myself to Proxyman. Aiming to ship iOS build and move to Window. It&#x27;s still a long journey I guess.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxyman.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxyman.io</a>')
