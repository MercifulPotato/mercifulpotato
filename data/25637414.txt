Who decides what is inclusive? The Union? I don&#x27;t want to apply the fallacy of inclusion, but if someone wears a crucifix and that makes an atheist feel excluded, who is right? I know &quot;the Union will decide&quot; but tyranny of the majority is a real thing. See the ban on burkas&#x2F;hijabs in many &quot;inclusive&quot; countries.<p>Also, if you are appealing to the public, saying that the working conditions at Google, where you are paid near the top 1% of the all workers and have free food etc, &quot;working conditions&quot; might not be the right term.<p><i>We have the freedom to decline to work on projects that donâ€™t align with our values</i><p>When do you declare your values? Is it always a moving target? To be a conscientious objector in the United States, there needs to be a demonstrable history of your objection. You can&#x27;t get drafted and then suddenly find religion. How do you stop the inevitable abuse of this exclusion?')
