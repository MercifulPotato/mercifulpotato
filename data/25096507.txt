But even with that there where the inclinations from the beginning. I mean the current state of America would have been a dream of Hamilton&#x27;s, while it would have been Franklin&#x27;s and Jefferson&#x27;s worst nightmare of the dystopia, they were trying to prevent. The reality is we got it wrong, the federalist voices were too strong, while I will give that the articles of confederation were too weak, the compromise towards the federalist was too strong. We need to get back to something closer to a confederated republic and away from a federal empire.')
