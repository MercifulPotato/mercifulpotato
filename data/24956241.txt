Item(by='pjfin123', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604188446, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24954413, text='Is there a recommended way to license a project as permissively as possible? I like the MIT license because it&#x27;s widely accepted and short enough that it can be read and understood but what if you&#x27;re OK with someone using a small (but large enough to be a copyrighted work) piece of your code without bothering to maintain the license.<p>There&#x27;s the WTFPL License (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WTFPL" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WTFPL</a>) but that doesn&#x27;t seem like a great option either. For my project (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;argosopentech&#x2F;argos-translate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;argosopentech&#x2F;argos-translate</a>) I dual licensed under the MIT and CC0 licenses even though CC0 isn&#x27;t really designed for software but it seemed reasonable. It seems surprisingly difficult to release code with no conditions besides limiting liability.')
