Key project plans were printed and stored. A visit from the ISO auditor always involved diving into the filing cabinets. Source code wasn&#x27;t printed (phew!) but the project records would explain where on the servers the software could be found.<p>Repo-based software configuration management as we would recognise it today was virtually non-existent. Projects tracked releases to customers using configuration notes that (in theory) allowed you to identify the resources required and how to recreate &#x2F; build the delivered system. We had nothing like CI&#x2F;CD - releases were few and intermittent.<p>We were disciplined and the directors were quality focussed, so the system actually worked reasonably well. The company had evolved some very good checklists for projects that were used at start-up to build the information framework for a project of a given type and size (we had three or four different generic types of project).<p>When I left ten years later the basic processes were still broadly identical, although there was less emphasis on the physical filing.<p>[Edit]<p>&gt; Similar how did people learn things<p>For software, from product manuals and usenet. For domain issues, from experts and sometimes books. E.g. when we built in ~1995 a system to support analysis of satellite constellations, the team concerned actually bought and read books on orbital mechanics and spherical geometry. I was a space nerd and still remembering being pleased at explaining to the programmers that the modelled satellites were changing speed as they orbited because the programmers had correctly implemented Kepler&#x27;s laws.')
