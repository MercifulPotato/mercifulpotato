If I say &#x27;we should nuke the moon&#x27; people laugh and move on. If Trump says it&#x27;s a completely different thing.<p>Trump spent years peddling lies and conspiracy theories, and getting right up to the incite violence line. His attempts to keep white nationalist on his side, by repeatedly having to be prodded to denounce them after showing some weird support is a problem.
