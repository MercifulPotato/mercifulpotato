Gamers in particular also seem to get overly hyped for the halo products, and treat whichever brand has better performance there very aspirationally. Nvidia&#x27;s marketing has also been especially effective at jacking up prices on the highest-end the past couple years.<p>Now that consoles are basically gaming PCs, good gaming performance for AAA titles is increasingly anchored by each console generation, so there&#x27;s a bit of a shift every 4-5 years - one happening now. There&#x27;s also an insanely large backlog of games and a huge amount of F2P and competitive games that aim to be playable on iGPUs, which have also advanced considerably over the past few years.')
