Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25703360], score=None, time=1610211228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700900, text='You&#x27;re misunderstanding my point.<p>Assault is a crime, yes, what she did was wrong - yes, of course - I agree with that.<p>But what she is being destroyed for is &#x27;racism&#x27; - not &#x27;assault and false accusation&#x27;.<p>She was being irrational (1=2) and then because of this, castigated for racism - which is a much more devious charge.<p>Also - it&#x27;s shocking that anyone is &#x27;shocked&#x27; over such a pedestrian encounter. Have HN readers never been in a fight before? Have folks literally never been in an argument?<p>This kind of stuff is &#x27;daily&#x27; on the streets, at WallMart, etc. It&#x27;s not very civil obviously, but it&#x27;s really common for people to get upset over things. We have bouncers at bars for this reason. But we&#x27;re adults and we move past it.<p>And - &#x27;false accusation&#x27; in this manner is clearly not criminal. The woman had her phone stolen, it&#x27;s reasonable for her in a hysterical state and just see the first iPhone and possibly think it&#x27;s hers. Again, not nice at all, but not completely crazy.<p>The proper response to a hysterical person who had their phone stolen, and who maybe thinks you have it is to &#x27;take the high ground&#x27; and calmly demonstrate your ownership. That&#x27;s all. I don&#x27;t expect this of a kid, but that could have happend.<p>That we have a &#x27;national story&#x27; with literally <i>Al Sharpton</i> because someone &#x27;grabbed someone&#x27;s arm&#x27; is utterly ridiculous. The kid is &#x27;seeking counselling&#x27; because someone &#x27;touched him forcefully&#x27;? It&#x27;s a farce. They&#x27;ve turned this utterly minor incident into a bad SNL parody.<p>Finally - I&#x27;m not implying their couldn&#x27;t have been racism either, this woman could possibly just as nasty as it gets, it&#x27;s impossible to tell.<p>And of course, the whole point of CNN putting this on the news is not that this specific moment is important, but that it could be demonstrative of &#x27;systematic racism in the commons&#x27; and they want to make an example out of her - but lacking any possible reference to racial motivation, it&#x27;s just plain stupid.<p>In summary - this is an example of certain parts of the media castigating individuals who may be of a certain persuasion (in this case &#x27;White&#x27;) for no reason, and I can see people getting upset over that.<p>The riot on capital hill however was not mostly a political movement of general malaise, rather, it was specifically about that certain people feel the election was stolen. It was mostly certainly not stolen, but they believe that because Trump told them so, and that&#x27;s the primary motivation issue of the violence at this point.')
