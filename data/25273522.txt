Social Media &quot;friends&quot; and separately a circle of ACTUAL friends. You would get more access to the data shared by actual friends.<p>&quot;Um, &#x2F;u&#x2F;galaxyLogic? Why aren&#x27;t I in you &quot;ACTUAL&quot; friends list? Is there something you want to tell me? Are we not actually friends?&quot;<p>I see what you&#x27;re trying to say - Facebook friends are often just random chumps you&#x27;ve met once, never or are distantly related to someone else you&#x27;ve met once - but I think a tiered system could quickly become something of burden on said friends :P')
