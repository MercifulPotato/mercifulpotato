Item(by='karmakaze', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607898800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25409661, text='I do have weak reading glasses and notice that changing focus between near and far is anything but instant.<p>I have noticed another thing though. Sometimes the text&#x2F;images are sharp but doubled-imaged a small fraction of a character apart. Part of this is likely due to extra muscle effort to maintain focus. Another part is that the degree of this effect is variable. I have drastically cut down my caffeine intake as it was getting out of hand during WFH. Since reduction in consumption and sometimes choosing tea or decaf, I&#x27;ve noticed much less of the double-imaging and don&#x27;t reach for the low-magnification (1.0) reading glasses as often.<p>Btw, does anyone use very weak reading glasses? I was thinking about getting something lower than 1.0 (say 0.75). Drugstores only seem to stock 1.25+ and I can find 1.0 at dollar stores, online I could probably order 0.75 to try.<p>Edit: a completely different theory is that taking Beat Saber fitness breaks made my weak eye less lazy since depth perception is a good part of the game.')
