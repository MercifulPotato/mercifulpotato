In practice if you don&#x27;t run MacOS yourself, there&#x27;s just no reasonable way to support MacOS at all. It literally costs hundreds of dollars to get a compatible test environment, while most other systems (including Windows) you can download and run a in VM for free.<p>In practice if the MacOS support takes more than a quick headers &#x2F; types update, it will likely need more care in the future as well. That means you need not just a driveby fix, but a continued commitment from someone to ensure compatibility. This is not out of hostility towards the users, but I&#x27;ll keep calling things that don&#x27;t work on MacOS cross-platform. (Yes, it sucks; You can vote with your money to stop that situation)')
