As soon ad RHEL forks from CentOS, CentOS will roll forward and will no longer be exactly the same as RHEL.<p>Previously, CentOS was a rebuild of RHEL. In between RHEL releases, CentOS was exactly the same as RHEL. When RHEL had a release&#x2F;fix&#x2F;backpoint, CentOS trailed until it was rebuilt from the new RHEL source.<p>The &quot;old&quot; CentOS was exactly the same nearly always (nearly perfect overlap) and the &quot;new&quot; CentOS is exactly the same nearly never (almost no overlap).')
