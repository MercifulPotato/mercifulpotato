The two people who were usually the loudest in the office, just ended up talking to each other.<p>They would quite often stop and say “it feels like we’re the only one talking here”, and then go on talking.<p>Of course you’re the only one talking, you never stop talking. It’s impossible to get a word in. If you want others to participate, give them a chance, there’s often a small delay, so giving them 2 or 3 seconds to respond would help.')
