For instance, with AVX2 and DirectCompute included?<p>Currently writing C++&#x2F;17 and HLSL. Would like to evaluate something higher-level. However, I think it’s unreliable in the long run to redistribute and support complicated packages like Python runtime or LLVM. Users mess with environment variables, update Windows, run antimalware, etc. Process startup time also matters, I don’t want to wait 40 seconds for the first output.')
