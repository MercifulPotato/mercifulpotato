As a sociological phenomenon, it&#x27;s fascinating: celebrity distilled down to an implausibly pure form, like Paris Hilton rendered into uncut white powder. But as somebody who feels responsibility to the kids in my extended family, it&#x27;s a worry. I&#x27;m not even sure how to explain to them that it might not be the best way to spend 40 or 50 years.')
