You can use it on-the-fly without modifying any repos by using the GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES environment variable.<p>If you want the effect permanently, there’s the .git&#x2F;objects&#x2F;info&#x2F;alternates file. For HTTP remotes, there’s apparently a .git&#x2F;objects&#x2F;info&#x2F;http-alternates file as well (no idea how that works though). I’m assuming these files allow multiple alternates as the environment variable does.')
