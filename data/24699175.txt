Proxy misc HTTP requests.<p>I planned to move web-hosting to Workers too but Netlify is just too smooth and I don&#x27;t see a reason to do so currently, though the recently announced free analytics product (for websites proxied through Cloudflare) might tempt me to do so anyway.<p>[0] The 50ms time-limit is for <i>cpu-time</i> and not <i>wall-time</i>.
