If you do, you&#x27;ll assume the solution is to learn more.<p>In reality, the solution is to work on your fears of failure, of looking ignorant, or of being a fraud.<p>To be clear, you always can (and hopefully will) be discovered ignorant. It happens often as you grow as a person. You should learn to tolerate that fear and see it as normal and human, rather than something to try to destroy with extra education.<p>You can also learn social skills that make those inevitable situations (where you fail or are wrong) easier to deal with.
