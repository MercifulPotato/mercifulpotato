Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=[24985063], score=None, time=1604441765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24984568, text='Let&#x27;s say your address was<p>256 Main St. Apt 10, Some City, CA, USA<p>I usually provide my address as<p>256 Main St. Unit 10-BCRK, Some City, CA, USA<p>I generate a unique code for each entity that I am required to provide my address to.<p>I usually change &quot;Apt&quot; to &quot;Unit&quot; to stump the automatic address-correcting APIs that will convert &quot;Apt 10-BCRK&quot; to &quot;Apt 10&quot;. I found that changing &quot;Apt&quot; to &quot;Unit&quot; usually stumps them.<p>The idea is that if I see another business use &quot;BCRK&quot; to send me junk mail, or list my address on those idiot people search sites, I will write a blog and publicly shame the first business for giving it out.<p>Package delivery drivers happily ignore the &quot;BCRK&quot; part and my packages still arrive as usual.<p>When giving out billing address for credit card authorization, I find usually I can skip the apartment number field and the card still authorizes just fine, so I also don&#x27;t need to tell online retailers the same 4-letter code that my bank has listed for my address.')
