They are on contract (e.g. hourly) so they can buy their own health benefits.  This is similar to other workers like doing &quot;gigs&quot;.<p>No 22 - Benefits Drivers.  \n* Every driver (irregardless of hours worked) are required to receive health benefits.<p>If above is the case, the two sides seem very polar.  Why not have a middle ground where benefits are provided to driver&#x27;s, given a contract, that they work meet 40hrs per week?')
