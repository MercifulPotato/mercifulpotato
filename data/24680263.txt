They were a frenemy at best.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s right - we were in the wrong on Iraq and that was obvious before it started.  But just like the US has had a HARD turn towards fascism, there&#x27;s nothing stopping that from occurring to our allies as well.  I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s dereliction of duty if you aren&#x27;t spying on your allies, they&#x27;re spying on us.<p>What you DO with the information gathered, in my opinion, is what determines whether you&#x27;re violating your ally&#x27;s trust.')
