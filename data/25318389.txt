Myopic, ill-informed, and narrow-minded on subjects that Russell wasn&#x27;t an expert on is another way to put it.<p>As someone who used to be a huge fan of Russell when I was young, I&#x27;d say a beginner would do themselves a huge disservice by letting their views of philosophy be colored by Russell&#x27;s bias and mischaracterization of philosophers he doesn&#x27;t appreciate or understand.')
