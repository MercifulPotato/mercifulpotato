That doesn&#x27;t seem right.<p>When I see an ad for washing machines it doesn&#x27;t make me run out and buy a washing machine. It gets me familiar with Samsung the brand so in 6-12 months when I buy a washing machine I am familiar with Samsung and buy their brand. Or it means that if my washing machine starts to sputter I&#x27;m more confident knowing where to go to buy a new one.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem enough to stop advertising for 6 months and claim no damage is being done.
