If my AI model &quot;reads&quot; a bunch of text, is the model now a &quot;derived work&quot; of the copyrighted work?  Perhaps. But of course humans don&#x27;t infringe when they watch&#x2F;listen&#x2F;read a copyrighted work and it changes their state of mind.  Perhaps the model can be said not to infringe if it sufficiently abstracts concepts of the art in question. Typically when tuning a model we include lots of counter-cases to avoid overfitting - to make sure that the model is indeed abstracting concepts.')
