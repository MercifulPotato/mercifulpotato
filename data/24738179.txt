You can choose for Apple, which is all about power politics like this news article is demonstrating, they are not here for you. Or you can choose for Android, which is one big privacy invading monster, they are not here for you either. It is a duopoly, which should (and probably does) fall under the same rules as a monopoly: the governments should fix this, the market cannot fix this.<p>It is not possible for other parties to break this market open. Other parties are relegated to niche markets without any power. Using a smartphone from a niche party will give you a very reduced experience and is for most people not a viable option.')
