I explained this to her, and she told me she understood why that would make sense, and why someone would <i>want</i> to design a system to work that way, even though it is not a system she, personally, would use.<p>Aaaand this is why she is my girlfriend. :)<p>Not to take away from your wife, I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s lovely. I&#x27;m just glad to be with someone who&#x27;s both smart and empathetic enough to understand why I do what I do, and why I like the weird computer shit I like. (My girlfriend on the Amiga 500 I bought: &quot;I like this. Why didn&#x27;t this take over?&quot;)')
