Item(by='OJFord', descendants=None, kids=[25392235], score=None, time=1607721460, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390839, text='&gt; According to this survey of Canadian nursing homes, around 87% of residents suffer from some kind of cognitive impairment such as dementia, alzhymer&#x27;s, or stroke related trauma [1].<p>That sounded extraordinarily high to me, and I think because of the subtle difference in implication (not that what you said isn&#x27;t correct) between your &#x27;such as&#x27;, and [1]&#x27;s &#x27;including&#x27;.<p>In the table below, by far the highest &#x27;characteristic&#x27; (82%) is &#x27;Dependence in ADLs (Activities of Daily Living Hierarchy Scale â‰¥3)&#x27;. &#x27;Dependence in Activities of Daily Living&#x27; is basically a description of why anyone would be in assisted living in the first place.<p>But also, there&#x27;s &#x27;cognitive impairment&#x27;, and there&#x27;s <i>cognitive impairment</i>, as it were. I don&#x27;t think if you populated a table with &#x27;reasons residents aren&#x27;t gaming&#x27; that &#x27;dementia et al.&#x27; would be high on the list, and the games those that were played wouldn&#x27;t be shooters &amp; GTA so much as puzzlers and adventure type games. At least, my grandfather enjoyed Spyro, Zelda, Animal Farm, that sort of thing.')
