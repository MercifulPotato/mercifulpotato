There&#x27;s hardly anything interesting on there.<p>The only thing I really see being alive is the Fediverse. Really happy to see that because it&#x27;s truly open and free. But in the meantime I kinda discovered I&#x27;m totally fine without social media. I don&#x27;t miss Facebook, Twitter, Instagram at all. I just use them for the bare basics now (things that require them). I still like Hacker News and one other forum but that&#x27;s about it. Oh and LinkedIn but I don&#x27;t consider it social media. It&#x27;s more like personal PR, not real sharing.<p>So long and thanks for all the fish!')
