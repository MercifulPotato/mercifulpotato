I only heard of the Internet2 (looong time ago and I understood it as a response of academia to the Eternal September).  From the Wikipedia article and cursory reading of the information provided at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internet2.edu&#x2F;network" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internet2.edu&#x2F;network</a> it isn&#x27;t entirely clear to me, whether the Internet2 network infrastructure (provided now by Level3 if I got that right) is indeed part of The Internet.  Iiuc, it uses the IPv6 protocol, but I don&#x27;t know whether nodes on Internet2 are reachable directly from nodes on The Internet (which would defeat the purpose, I&#x27;d think).  And if it is only accessible via gateways, can one still say that it is part of The Internet?  In that case, all kind of specialized networks (military, research, private&#x2F;commercial leased lines, etc.) could be considered to be part of The Internet too, whether they use the IP protocol or not.  Not sure, whether that makes sense.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m not sufficiently appreciating the internet aspect of The Internet and confuse it with the IP-only Internet back-bone. ;-}')
