The past models of BMW were really boring. The design wasn&#x27;t extraordinary that it could compete with Audi or Mercedes.<p>But the new design of the iX and 4er models are very beautiful. I must say the new grills really appeal to me.<p>It seems that the new design causes a similar reaction as Mercedes SUV design of GLE and GLC (Coupe). Mercedes took a new approach and got a lot of negative comments. But ultimately they set a new trend and their SUV&#x27;s were a huge success.')
