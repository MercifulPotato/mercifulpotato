Google doesn&#x27;t do that.<p>Same for Amazon. Very often bad reviews are for the seller or the packaging or the time for delivery. Then there are discussions from people who tell other people to review the product not the seller and on it goes. Amazon could have split - with ML I think they still could - the reviews and the seller in a way that satisfies users (seller reviews are much harder to find and not accessible at the point of product review).')
