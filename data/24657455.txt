If that is where $5000 will fix the problem, don&#x27;t talk about any other problems, you&#x27;ll just confuse management.<p>The next place to stop if that doesn&#x27;t work is, if you can&#x27;t fix &quot;Tim&#x27;s foot&quot; can you offload some things &quot;he&quot; is dealing with? Dump some of his load, work steal, etc. But these are just mitigations.')
