Item(by='dbingham', descendants=None, kids=[25577711], score=None, time=1609294955, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577518, text='A system that requires outside manipulation to keep it functioning is not a good system.<p>The fact that capitalism inevitably converges towards monopoly (and therefor the concentration of wealth and power) with out the intervention of the government (which is often very vulnerable to corruption at the hands of concentrated power and wealth) is effectively a fatal flaw.<p>This is why I am an advocate of free market socialism - a market system where companies are democratically run by their workers and the financiers are limited to a regulated return on the form of interest on their loans.<p>Democratic ownership can counter act the tendency to grow and absorb competitors, because each new worker who gets a vote waters down the votes and control of their fellows.  Plus the bigger the organization gets, the slower and less responsive it will get.  And a democratic organization run by its workers will have a myriad of motivating factors to balance, other than chasing infinite profit or return for the investors.<p>All of these factors will act to keep companies from growing to big and help keep the market in balance.  Which benefits the consumers.<p>And in the meantime the fact that the workers call the shots will prevent the kinds of labor abuses that have plagued the capitalist system since its inception.')
