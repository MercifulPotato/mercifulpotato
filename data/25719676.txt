ACH requires that the receiver provides you with their bank account and routing number, which while common in the EU, is extremely unusual and invasive in a US context.<p>You are right that PayPal&#x2F;Venmo (same company) may be an alternative for now, although they generally end up applying the same restrictions as Visa&#x2F;MC.<p>American Express ... wow, it&#x27;s been years since I did this but I think it involves actually going to an Amex brick-and-mortar location, and so wouldn&#x27;t actually count.<p>Bitcoin is equivalent to paying in a different currency, which while possible, mostly breaks the terms of the comparison, since you could argue for using some other non-crypto-currency to avoid some or all of the limitations of Visa&#x2F;MC.<p>Parler failed to meets the ToS set by its chosen platform (picked in all likelihood because its founder was ex-AWS). Had it either met the ToS by providing sufficient moderation, or picked a different hosting service, it would have had a different experience.<p>As I said in my opening comment, if there is really no alternative hosting service where Parler can allow people to openly discuss violence towards specific individuals, violence towards state actors and generally be as obnoxious and wrong as they feel like, then sure, I&#x27;d agree there&#x27;s a problem.')
