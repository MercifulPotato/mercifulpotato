He asked for advice, listened to people he trusted, and then made a decision that he took total responsibility for. He was always willing to listen, but there was no confusion about who had the ultimate authority.  Also, he trusted domain experts to do their work without micromanaging them, but didn&#x27;t hesitate to bring them into line if they strayed too far from the team&#x27;s objectives.')
