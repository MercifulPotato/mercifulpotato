But rtt from edge to basestation is 400ms wifi and 2ms for 5g, which is almost like something vs nothing. So we&#x27;re talking applications that are OK with the hardwire network latencies (here lets say 100ms rtt including the time for computing). That 400ms rtt for wifi must get the total rtt over some viability threshold, would be my guess.')
