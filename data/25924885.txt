Some people really don&#x27;t like being questioned.<p>I was porting a network management (SNMP) app to Java &amp; Swing. The app had no documentation and I&#x27;d never done anything like SNMP before. The only requirements given were &quot;make the Java app look and work exactly the same.&quot; Can do. To respect my manager&#x27;s time, I batched my questions together for the upcoming 1:1. I was told that if I couldn&#x27;t figure stuff out on my own, perhaps I should find another job. Um, ok, I guess I&#x27;ll figure it out.<p>I was trying to explain why burying blocking I&#x2F;O under layers of abstraction (Spring FTW), and just eating the exceptions (no logging), makes debugging the app a wee bit harder. The &quot;senior architect&quot; expressed surprise that someone with my experience didn&#x27;t understand design patterns and brushed me off. Um, ok, I guess I&#x27;ll just have the debugger break on every exception.<p>I considered myself tenacious, if not especially fast. And I have zero problem admitting &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;.<p>But experiences like this have made me gun shy.')
