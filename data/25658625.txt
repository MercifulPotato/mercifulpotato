Both had cars, radios, apartments with indoor plumbing, and awful haircuts, but they paid for them with different money. Any exchange rate was basically a fiction, but even if the currencies had been freely traded, these two still couldn&#x27;t buy each other&#x27;s goods.<p>Some people in India have lives similarly comparable to the west, e.g. the class who buy iphones. But the ones who make this super-cheap data interesting really don&#x27;t. I mean there are riots when the price of onions doubles after a poor harvest. It&#x27;s difficult to imagine a shared basket of goods which meaningfully captures the comparison here --- between prices experienced by those whose weekly budget can flattened by onions, and people in the US.<p>Probably a better comparison would simply be to quote daily wages alongside such prices. GDP is about US$5&#x2F;day, compared to about $175&#x2F;day in the US.')
