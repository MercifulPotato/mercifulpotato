Most developers have local environments and until Apple, having a local environment with ARM has been awkward. Docker multi-platform images is supposed to mitigate this, but they are still fairly new and I suspect many developers don&#x27;t trust them yet.<p>It would be interesting to see Apple launch am M series server. After looking at the M1 Mac mini logic board, it seems like a blade server with stacks of Mac mini boards would be fairly easy to engineer. Apple would just need to build the chassis.<p>(Not holding my breath waiting for this)')
