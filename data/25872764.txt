Don&#x27;t pick on the US, it was a universal practice.  It isn&#x27;t done now not for moral reasons (you can read the moral arguments of slave owners for a different moral perspective - it is &quot;interesting&quot;), but economic. Slaves need to be fed when they are not working, so better to let them figure that out for themselves when you don&#x27;t have a job.')
