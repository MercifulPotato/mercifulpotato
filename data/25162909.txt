We hope this will free up engineers&#x27; time to creatively solve more interesting engineering problems.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback, and are always open to chatting to interesting people with interesting ideas.<p>We&#x27;re also looking to hire in the coming months so please do get in touch if you&#x27;d like to be involved as we build the product out.')
