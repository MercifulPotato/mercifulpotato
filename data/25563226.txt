Hiring managers and recruiters get to see panel feedback, offer numbers, reference details, comms, etc ... Most ICs on the hiring panel don&#x27;t get to see any of this.  Even the candidate is left out in the dark in many areas.<p>To level the playing field, get rid of the information arbitrage.  If you&#x27;re an IC on a panel, ask for contextual details before giving your final vote.  Follow up and see where the candidate went 6-12 months after the interview.  Try to give candidates constructive feedback if you can.<p>Candidates can&#x27;t do much here unfortunately.  But the hiring managers of tomorrow are often the ICs of today.  The path towards removing bias in hiring starts with being a more proactive interviewer.')
