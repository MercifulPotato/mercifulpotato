TSLA received automative regulatory credits of 397M while it&#x27;s Net Income was 331M.<p>&gt; Automotive Regulatory Credits<p>&gt; In connection with the production and delivery of our zero emission vehicles in global markets, we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable automotive regulatory credits. We have sold these credits, and will continue to sell future credits, to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. For example, under California’s Zero Emission Vehicle Regulation and those of states that have adopted California’s standard, vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits, referred to as ZEV credits, for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements. These laws provide that automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws. We also earn other types of saleable regulatory credits in the United States and abroad, including greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuels credits. Payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.<p>&gt; We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was $0  million and $140 million as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019 was $140 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;ix?doc=&#x2F;Archives&#x2F;edgar&#x2F;data&#x2F;1318605&#x2F;000156459020047486&#x2F;tsla-10q_20200930.htm#Consolidated_Statmnts_of_Cmprehnsve_Loss" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;ix?doc=&#x2F;Archives&#x2F;edgar&#x2F;data&#x2F;1318605&#x2F;0001...</a>')
