Often this means you generate some sort of data structure which gets serialized into html by a library as a last step (e.g. React, but there are lots of other examples).<p>If you&#x27;re always using safe apis, its really easy to verify that you dont do the wrong thing (e.g. via static analysis, or even grep.
