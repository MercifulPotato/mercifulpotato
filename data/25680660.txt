Item(by='qwerty456127', descendants=None, kids=[25681327], score=None, time=1610072360, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25680064, text='&gt; Imagine telling the students to use vim<p>I can hardly imagine that. They would hate me for wasting their time they could use to learn something practical. To me Vim seems a crazy alien technology of particularly questionable usefulness (even for a keyboard-centric user), only suitable for fun and for looking cool. Unlike PyCharm or Visual Studio, Vim doesn&#x27;t just have unintuitive features available to whoever chooses to invoke those, it is and can only be operated in a completely unintuitive way, impossible to learn without instruction. And I never needed any instruction on how to use, let alone exit PyCharm.')
