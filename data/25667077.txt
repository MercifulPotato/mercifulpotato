They called it &#x27;Russian Disinformation&#x27; and in their articles repeatedly used charged language such as &quot;dubious&quot; to refer to the information presented.<p>This was done on an ongoing basis by the majority of news organizations at the time. EDIT - [3] And supported by social media giants (Famously Twitter, but Google&#x2F;Youtube did the same thing)<p>Fast forward past the election and the narrative has changed rather sharply. [1] They no longer call the story Russian Disinformation, and instead publish that the FBI is actively investigating Hunter Biden.<p>[2] As I mentioned, the same thing happened after 2001. The largest news institutions eagerly promoted that the US was under extreme threat. CNN in 2002 was publishing quotes like &quot;we don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud” and &quot;Saddam is actively pursuing nuclear weapons at this time.”<p>Then when it became clear that there was no WMD&#x27;s to be found they started giving room to the opposing narrative such as: Joe Wilson “I think it’s safe to say that the US government should have or did know that [the Niger documents were] fake before Dr. ElBaradei mentioned it in his report at the UN yesterday.”<p>Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not saying &#x27;everything is a lie and the election was stolen and Trump is telling the truth&#x27;<p>What I <i>am</i> saying is that the sources of information have proven themselves to be incredibly untrustworthy to the point where many people <i>automatically believe the inverse of what they claim</i>.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;18&#x2F;media&#x2F;new-york-post-hunter-biden-reliable&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;18&#x2F;media&#x2F;new-york-post-hunter-bi...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;politics&#x2F;hunter-biden-tax-investigtation&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;politics&#x2F;hunter-biden-tax-inv...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2011&#x2F;12&#x2F;leadup-iraq-war-timeline&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2011&#x2F;12&#x2F;leadup-iraq-war...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-54552101" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-54552101</a>')
