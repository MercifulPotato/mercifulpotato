At the same time induction on some level is just an overpriced way of transmitting electrical power from the cooktop into the cookware (not unlike the old inductive-paddle-type electric car chargers).<p>I wonder if there might be an opening for (electric) &quot;conduction&quot; cooktops. It would basically be a dedicated heat-proof and ventilated spot on the countertop with some high-current electrical receptacles (standard voltage in most of the world, but maybe wired for the slightly less common 240V in North America).<p>They might include temperature feedback (something I&#x27;d love to see in induction cooktops too, maybe an IR thermometer hitting the cookware from below), possibly with controls built into the kitchen rather than the cookware.<p>Of course this would substantially raise the cost of cookware, and in many ways this already exists in the form of &quot;a countertop with electrical outlets and plug-in cooking appliances&quot;, but maybe there&#x27;s an opportunity here.')
