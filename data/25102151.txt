These replace the wall switch but look basically like a normal wall switch. They use a combination of power line networking and RF mesh networking for automation. This is the second house I&#x27;ve had entirely outfitted with them and I love it.<p>IMHO it&#x27;s critical to maintain control at the wall switch - if I am walking into the kitchen and want to turn the lights on, I just hit the switch like any other house. But when I&#x27;m in bed and ready to go to sleep I can press one button in the app and all the lights turn off.<p>Anyone with basic electrical skills can replace a switch in about 15 minutes. I did them all myself in my first house over the course of a few months, and when I moved I hired an electrician for a few hours to just do them all.<p>The switches and dimmers are about $50 each, but they are highly reliable. I&#x27;ve had one failure out of about 40 total installed over the course of the 12 years I&#x27;ve been using it.')
