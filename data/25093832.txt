What I DO think they should do is give a similar one- or two-time leave period to single people also, and that would come with societal resources so they can do something like content creation or another project such as go back to school and learn something.<p>For example, I blog, write scientific papers, and create video content. I&#x27;m not interested in being a parent. I think it would be a great contribution to society if I got &#x27;maternity leave&#x27; time to just create content. I give most of it away for free and so far thousands of people have enjoyed my creations.<p>I think society would benefit from encouraging those who might not want to have children to choose a different path that is also distinguished and comes with societal support.')
