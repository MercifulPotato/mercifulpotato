Item(by='quasse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609358809, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583826, text='&gt; because &quot;top photography vlogger&quot; presumably pays better than 99% of all other work that involves photography.<p>Just to be clear though (I work in a field that relies heavily on niche-specifc YouTubers for marketing) - the reason that being a &quot;top niche blogger&quot; pays so well is because companies pay them <i>a lot</i> to encourage favorable opinions of their product lines.<p>I&#x27;ve seen amounts that are several multiples of my annual salary for fairly small market segment channels - and it&#x27;s not explicit like &quot;We are hiring you to post positive reviews of our products&quot; because that would need to be disclosed. It&#x27;s more along the lines of &quot;We are nominally hiring you as a brand ambassador, you will visit our HQ and make a collaboration video&quot;. But of course, YouTubers aren&#x27;t stupid, they&#x27;re not going to post negative content about brands that are paying them even if it&#x27;s theoretically for something else.<p>This is the same problem that PC hardware review magazines had back in the day - companies that purchased a lot of advertising from the parent company just happened to never get negative coverage in review articles. You can&#x27;t bite the hand that feeds you.')
