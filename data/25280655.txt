We have strong evidence that it takes truly extraordinary measures to suppress this new virus at a rate that will in fact eliminate it from a population when compared to SARS. SARS simply didn&#x27;t spread that widely because if it did that would directly contradict the <i>relative</i> ease of its containment.')
