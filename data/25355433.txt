If weather is bad in the PNW power can be move to it from other parts of the country. Texas does this with massive transmission lines that where built crisscrossing the state in the late 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s. These transmission lines allowed for a massive expansion in wind and solar without large subsidies because the electricity could be moved to wear it was needed and sold on the open market (the state operates an real time auction market to balance to help balance supply and demand).
