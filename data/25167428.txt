It is such a privilege as a civilian to get to fly with USCG crews; working with them has been one of the highlights of my life.<p>Thank you for your service, and your colleagues&#x27; as well. I agree, most people have no idea how hard USCG personnel train, and what goes on when they head out to conduct rescues.')
