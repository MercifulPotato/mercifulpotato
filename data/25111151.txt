It depends on your level of coverage but typically you would go to the NHS first and then invoke your private coverage when you have a diagnosis in order the eg skip the queue.<p>When a relative had a heart attack, he was put on a waiting list for a heart bypass - 1 year. When he invoked insurance, he got seen within a month - by the same doctor and in the same facility as it would have been on NHS.<p>In a lot of instances the private health care system is just paying the public one for advantageous access to services.')
