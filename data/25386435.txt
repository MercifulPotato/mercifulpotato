I read (and voted) on the depression thread and I think it was a pretty interesting and kind of terrifying at the same time due the high percentage of people with depression.<p>But I think this could be a better question or an easier one to answer as sometimes we don&#x27;t even know what depression is or if it&#x27;s really depression what we&#x27;re feeling or going through.
