As such Brexit may be seen to be a success. It has united the party behind a common policy (those who objected have been kicked out) and healed the division.<p>Even better (for the party) they have created a &#x27;foe&#x27; which can be blamed for Britain&#x27;s ills with political impunity. If Scotland leaves the UK - which looks likely - they will be close to guaranteed a majority in parliament. Their recent election majority has given them the opportunity to ignore, weaken or ignore controls on the executive&#x27;s behaviour.<p>For all his buffoonish behaviour and administrative incompetence Alex Johnson is a ruthless political operator.<p>I make no comment on the benefits or otherwise for the UK and its people which should be obvious by now.')
