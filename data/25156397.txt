I&#x27;m not the guy who installed it (and I started at my current company after it was setup so maybe it was complicated?) but as far as maintenance goes it&#x27;s been pretty much set and forget. Our team is pretty DevOps heavy and we never really need to do anything with it.<p>Definitely easier though than using something like Jenkins, but personally I&#x27;m a big fan of Github Actions. I&#x27;ve never used it in a production setting though, only for personal projects.')
