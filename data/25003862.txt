Did some drugs, had some mental issues (but not to the point of being insane), was down on his luck. He didn&#x27;t exactly want to stay homeless, but he preferred it to his other alternatives (which included job skill program with free housing). After a while his luck turned and he found a job that suited him and a place to stay. He probably still has some mental issues and does some drugs.<p>Idk where I&#x27;m going with this except to say it&#x27;s complicated.')
