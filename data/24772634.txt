I ran my own Reddit username first, and then read about my result (I know nothing about these personality types).  It was pretty accurate to be honest.  Then I immediately went back to that page to look up &#x2F;u&#x2F;shittymorph, but the page wouldn&#x27;t load.  I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re getting hammered by traffic right now, and hoping they&#x27;ll be able to serve more traffic due to the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer&#x27;s table.<p>Edit:  Sorry I had to.
