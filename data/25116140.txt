Item(by='sdenton4', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605556122, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25113315, text='Yeah, posting this with a different title from the page is forcing an editorialized view onto data which just doesn&#x27;t support the title. There&#x27;s no way to tell excess deaths from this one incomplete chart. I&#x27;ve flagged the post as a result.<p>That said, 12&#x2F;10 * 77.5k = 92.7k, which is at the high end for the charted period. Adding an extra month&#x27;s worth of late reports gives 13&#x2F;10 * 77.5k = 100.5k. So, probably reasonable to guess that the real deaths are somewhere between these two, which definitely doesn&#x27;t support the &#x27;no excess deaths&#x27; claim in the post title.<p>It would be nice to see something closer to the CDC&#x27;s ongoing excess deaths tracking:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;excess_deaths.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;excess_deaths.htm</a>')
