I&#x27;m helping a customer deploy Azure App Service (similar to AWS Elastic Beanstalk).<p>Jesus wept. It&#x27;s sooo fiddly to set up everything. The prod and non-prod environments need dozens of parameters that are all slightly different. Some of these are exposed as resource properties, making them obvious, some are environment variables that are nearly undocumented. Everything is off by default and has to be turned on. Logging. Monitoring. High availability. Secure parameter storage. Staging. On and on....<p>Oh, you want high availability? Sure, if you pay an extra $3K per month and switch to internal only networking, build Azure DevOps &quot;agent&quot; VMs in a zone-redundant set, and register a bunch of private DNS zones. Good luck automating this. There are template samples available, but they&#x27;ve been broken for years.<p>Regional disaster recovery? Just duplicate everything! Okay, but not like that! <i>Slightly differently</i> because replication is asymmetric and you may not want active-active. Then you have to layer stuff on top to actually fail over. But not one thing at a time! That&#x27;s a performance disaster. All or nothing, but that&#x27;s not an Azure feature, so good luck with that...<p>This is what I thought the public cloud provides: Some place to upload a ZIP file of code that &quot;just runs&quot; without me having to baby-site the infrastructure.<p>What&#x27;s actually provided is a bunch of infrastructure parts that the public cloud vendor will patch for you. Everything else is your problem.')
