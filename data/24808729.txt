But the answer there is to require them to stop banning competing products and run a neutral platform.<p>There are two issues with that. The first is it won&#x27;t satisfy the people who demand that amazon be killed. The second is that actually running a neutral platform would mean amazon could no longer ban other products (firearms, nazi materials, alcohol, dangerous chemicals etc).<p>I think the issue here is that there is no easy answer to any of the overlapping issues that large platforms represent. People don&#x27;t know what they want and often want mutually exclusive things (more safety and less restrictions). There is ban behaviour on all sides.<p>I&#x27;m concerned that mostly people seem to coalesce around the most extreme outcomes (and those are least likely to improve things). you get a lot more support for &quot;break up amazon&quot; than &quot;some amazon activities may be a utility and a natural monopoly and others not. And that requires different regulation. But there are downsides to that and they are also serious and unpopular. And we also shouldn&#x27;t throw the baby out with the bath water. And there are plenty of examples of similar issues in non-tech. So we have a systemic issue as well, though how we deal with this can inform further action. And whatever we do won&#x27;t be 100% correct&quot;.')
