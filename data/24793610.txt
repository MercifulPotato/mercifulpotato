No. The idioms are not _ideal_, but I would not consider that to be dramatically painful, not would I even say it slows down development much.<p>I think it&#x27;s very difficult to improve idioms at this point without adding complexity in the language to the point where, IMO, it&#x27;s no longer worth it. I think a strong point of Python vs other languages in the same class is that there&#x27;s a well-defined limit, both as a community language and language capabilities, as to how much complexity and rope you&#x27;re willing to give the user.')
