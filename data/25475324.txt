Remember that your parents probably said the same thing about your music, and their parents before them. We tend to lock in our favorite music in our late teens and early 20s, and while it&#x27;s okay to have a preference it&#x27;s kind of silly to ascribe immutable qualities of the music when it&#x27;s probably just what you like.<p>Or, to paraphrase something pithy a former boss of mine said: they made the best music back when I was most emotionally vulnerable, and now it seems to have gone downhill since then.')
