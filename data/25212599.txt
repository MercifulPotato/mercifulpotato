You&#x27;re right, the leanpub listing should have a link to the project&#x27;s homepage, and a link to the Github.<p>And I had removed the &quot;Fork me on Github&quot; banner thing from the nitrogenproject.com homepage, and forgot to re-add a proper link to the github.  I&#x27;ve rectified both of these.<p>Thanks again!')
