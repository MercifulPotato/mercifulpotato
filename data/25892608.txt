I&#x27;m glad they repurposed it for a more cooperative use suited to the times.<p><i>To me the architect in the article is too quick to dismiss the premise of Bell Labs â€” giving researchers privacy and pastoral views.</i><p>A great discussion point re: Bell Labs that I read in an HN thread long, long ago was that research labs of this type (Bell Labs, Google X, Xerox PARC, etc.) only arise in monopoly conditions. Basic research only becomes supportable from an organizational overhead and ROI standpoint when there is no meaningful competition to the parent organization.<p>It implies another large and very interesting question: are the net benefits of places like Bell Labs worth the costs that come with tolerating monopolies?<p>More to the point of the topic at hand: is the monolithic structure of Bell Labs, the building, worth the costs it has imposed on the shape of its surrounding community?')
