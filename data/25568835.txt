This is because at that stage, your users are no longer people who understand your code base or are even know programming necessarily.<p>You <i>can</i> do algorithm development in MATLAB or R or Julia or whatever and figure out ways to either translate the logic to Python&#x2F;C++ later or setup some kind of IPC for production software engineers to call  (platform&#x2F;orchestration stuff is usually Python or Java)...<p>...OR you can just develop your algorithms in Python and keep code comprehension and  platform integration much simpler for everyone')
