Item(by='bigbubba', descendants=None, kids=[25318259], score=None, time=1607201466, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25318114, text='I&#x27;ve seen &#x27;white&#x27; Roman Catholics from southern Italy that are far more swarthy than many Muslims from Iran or Lebanon.  And I&#x27;d be hard pressed to visually distinguish an orthodox Greek from a muslim Turk...  So yes, it&#x27;s very much a socially constructed matter.  Incidentally I believe Arabs, Persians, Turks, etc are often classified as caucasian (particularly on the US census I believe?)  So these cultural definitions aren&#x27;t even consistent within specific societal context.  I&#x27;ve even seen some racists online say that Italians aren&#x27;t white, because they aren&#x27;t nordic.')
