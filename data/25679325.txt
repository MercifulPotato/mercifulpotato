I imagine people can be blacklisted by ISPs and&#x2F;or mobile carriers. Even a landline contract is not guaranteed, right? What they can&#x27;t do is turn people away at various offices.<p>That said, I agree this kind of selective platform favoritism is (currently very minimally, but still) discriminatory. For example some people might not want to use Twitter for ideological reasons. (Let&#x27;s say because it&#x27;s a fucking cesspool that just generates tension.)')
