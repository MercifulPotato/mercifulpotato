Doesn&#x27;t matter if six months later it&#x27;s admissible or not to court, the damage would have already been done, if not legally, then mentally and psychologically on you.<p>The &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; is similar to the &quot;I don&#x27;t need a gun&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t need a car&quot; that people living in big safe cities with plenty of police&#x2F;transit say, ignoring the fact that the other half of the country is living in areas with nearby forests&#x2F;wild animals and less law enforcement and plenty of crime and everything is far apart. Plenty of people out there have issues in their lives and they do need the privacy to keep themselves sane.')
