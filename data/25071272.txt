Even people who are immersed in music can&#x27;t help to hear something new every hour.  For me, it&#x27;s a constant wave of new-to-me music.  Many free form radio stations are also layering tracks, interviews, noise, and other audio treats that make for unique experiences that may never (or should never, haha) happen again.  Just under free form radio there are countless excellent LPFM and college stations around the country - Hollow Earth Radio, nearly every college radio station from Boston to Milford PA.<p>* I also use Bandcamp for getting deeper into a genre or trying out new ones.  They write up articles that profile maybe a dozen artists that represent the boundaries of a style - whether you read them through or just listen, it&#x27;s an amazing value.  Easily on the level of what the New York Times does for classical music.  Bandcamp is obviously growing like a weird and wonderful weed the last year - I would really like them to add a few more features for building random playlists within a few criteria.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wfmu.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wfmu.org</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wmfo.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wmfo.org</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;05&#x2F;arts&#x2F;music&#x2F;five-minutes-classical-music.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;05&#x2F;arts&#x2F;music&#x2F;five-minutes-c...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hollowearthradio.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hollowearthradio.org</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csgnetwork.com&#x2F;lpfmradiotable.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csgnetwork.com&#x2F;lpfmradiotable.html</a>')
