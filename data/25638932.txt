It turned out that yes, it is in the general case, but it was totally possible to brute force the results required for the constrained task at hand on a laptop in Python and store the ~60k optimal solutions in a lightning fast key&#x2F;value store.<p>I didn’t reproduce it from memory though (but I did choose to port a Java version in preference to any of the existing Python versions I found, because it’s code was structured in a way that I grokked  much easier. Possibly due to my not totally expert idiomatic Python skills, I’m really a Perl coder deep down.)<p>(And I never had to do any whiteboard performative coding to land this gig either.)')
