What are you going to do with these intelligent but still less than human animals? Let them integrate into society and become a source of conflict? We already have enough conflict between humans over trivial matters as it is. If you add an explicit difference between two parties like a different species then conflicts will continue forever until one side is extinct.<p>If this research succeeds there will be two potential scenarios: Easily controlled monkey slaves doing manual labor or alternatively those monkeys receive extensive genetic engineering because of lack of ethics to outperform us and therefore replace us.<p>I don&#x27;t want either.')
