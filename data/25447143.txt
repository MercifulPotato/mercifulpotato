It took over five years to fill it. The second took three months. Once I filled a journal in six weeks. I didn’t write enough in in 2018 to fill one. Currently I am journaling about once or twice a week in the seventeenth volume. The previous  one took about six months.<p>The journal often is a first draft of future HN comments. It’s often a place where I work over an unpleasant realization about my blind spots. It’s where I can get pumped about a creative idea and muse on interpretations of theory that interest me.<p>What it became after a while...what it had to become...is a space where I try not to let myself be angry. A place where I don’t indulge in rage...a place where I don’t practice outrage.<p>All the journals are Moleskine notebooks. For years I am using blue Tul gel pens. Starting each entry with a date.<p>And seeing where it goes.')
