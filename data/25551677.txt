I&#x27;ve seen them zip in and out of navigation channels and between boats. Also had a few get dangerously close and cross our bow as we were sailing on a reach.<p>Also, I do enjoy the sport. It&#x27;s similar to endurance swimming and nearly every muscle in the body is worked. I found kitesurfers in some really remote banks and wondered how the hell did you get all the way out here.')
