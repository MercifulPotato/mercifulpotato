This is the default assumption in open source. &quot;You want something fixed? Fix it yourself!&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re adopting a different strategy than that, feel free to document that, but let&#x27;s not start defaulting to offering people free support, because that&#x27;ll make no one happy once maintainers start burning out.<p>I think something that has perverted the way we see open source is big companies doing open source. Of course the people who get paid by Google to work on Kubernetes has the time for answering support questions, as it&#x27;s probably a part of the reason they get paid.<p>But for us who individually do open source, or as part of non-profit work, we&#x27;ve never defaulted to providing free support to people who don&#x27;t support us back. Let&#x27;s not change that.')
