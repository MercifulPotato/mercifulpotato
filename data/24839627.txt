Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[24840047], score=None, time=1603212734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24837964, text='this is actually a good example to demonstrate my point. you don&#x27;t explicitly say when the first practice is, only that they recur every tuesday and friday. the &quot;see you next tuesday!&quot; strongly implies that the first practice is the tuesday that immediately follows, but the reader doesn&#x27;t get this needed context until the very end of the email. I bet if you put something like &quot;starting next tuesday (dd&#x2F;mm&#x2F;yyyy)&quot; in the Practices section, you would get fewer of those questions.<p>all the information is there for an active reader to figure out what they need to do, but I can see how a linear reader (who isn&#x27;t holding all the information in their head to begin with) could miss it. I had to reread the email to know exactly when the first practice would be. an <i>extremely</i> pedantic reader might be unsure whether &quot;see you next tuesday!&quot; refers to a second informational meeting or the first actual practice.')
