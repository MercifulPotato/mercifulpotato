Site creator here.<p>I&#x27;ve build Sieve to scratch my own itch, to allow us Software Developers to block recruiter contact for interviews and jobs in which we are uninterested, and maybe, just maybe some day steer the industry away from hiring practices that are considered &quot;broken&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daedtech.com&#x2F;hiring-is-broken&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daedtech.com&#x2F;hiring-is-broken&#x2F;</a>).<p>When new Job Listings are posted, the website shows the count of Job Seekers interested in their interview&#x2F;job, giving some (~pressure~) feedback if their listing includes attributes which are disliked by Job Seekers.<p>Types of Overall Feedback For Which I Would Be Most Grateful:<p><pre><code>    Additional facets&#x2F;dimensions along which to filter jobs\n    Entirely new feature ideas\n    Thoughtful analysis as to why this whole idea might fail :-)\n</code></pre>\nFuture Feature Ideas:<p><pre><code>    Real-time, updated Job Seeker count which auto-refreshes as job metadata is being inputted for new Job Postings.  Watch your candidate pool change when you specify whiteboard interviews!\n    Rich(er) text input for Job Descriptions\n    Internal messaging&#x2F;contact system, to facilitate ghosting detection&#x2F;response rate calculation.\n    Subscriptions allowing Hiring Managers pay for postings by invoice rather than than by credit card.\n\n</code></pre>\nAnd I built it using AspNet Core&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;F#&#x2F;Giraffe&#x2F;SQL Server&#x2F;WebFlow')
