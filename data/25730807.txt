Yes our scale and problem domain was about an order of magnitude smaller, but it wasn&#x27;t trivially small (optimization was still a relevant problem for us). What did people do 15 years ago before all of these could platforms did all the work for you? Do that. It&#x27;s really not that hard!<p>The analogy above is ridiculous. The problem isn&#x27;t that Rosa Parks couldn&#x27;t start her own bus line (though at the time this was probably not feasible for more reasons than just money). The problem is that she was denied service because of her race. You cannot change your race by &quot;doing it yourself&quot;.<p>If SpaceX denies me the opportunity to fly their shuttle do I have to build my own spacecraft to get to space? Yes... I do. I&#x27;m sure we could come up with all sorts of other fun examples!')
