Children are motivated in that manner. But not adults.<p>Startups, like sports, are a business. The only concern is money. That is the ends. The startup, problem, etc are just the means to that end.<p>Every founder is motivated by money. It just sounds tacky and cheap to say you did it for money, so everyone builds up some silly story - &quot;to help people&quot;, &quot;to solve a problem&quot;, &quot;cause it was a passion&quot;, &quot;to create jobs for the community&quot;, &quot;create value for others&quot;, etc. Nope. It was all for money. No need to be embarrassed about it.')
