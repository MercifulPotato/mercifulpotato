Then I&#x27;d resell the CD, say for $5, and someone else could get another 1000 listens with no money going to an artist.<p>An artist used to get around 10% minus packaging costs, so say at most $1 per CD.<p>So an artist then could get under 0.1 cents per listen, maybe vastly less.<p>Next, a song plays on the radio to millions, and the artist gets (?). I think that was quite small too. Even then, touring was where most of the money was made - the CD and radio game was to get exposure and fans, many of whom would then pay $50-$100 for one evening of listening to the band live.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how all the econ works out now without spending too much time digging into it, but making music has never been a good income stream for any but a tiny, tiny percent of artists.')
