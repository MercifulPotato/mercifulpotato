The clearest reason is that zero of these cases resulted in sedition. This argument is distracting, it is classic whataboutism. In no way is it the case that moderating the app stores and shutting down access to Parler or the President&#x27;s Tweets equivalent to condoning Clinton&#x27;s or Jackson-Lee&#x27;s or Sander&#x27;s actions. I recommend that you look at this particular case and draw your conclusions about it without complaining about the failure to respond the same way to very different situations from other people years prior.')
