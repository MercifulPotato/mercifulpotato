I don&#x27;t have a stash, and obviously I think going out to buy food is an acceptable risk, but I definitely would have felt better in March and April if I could have avoided the grocery store for a while.<p>&gt; Tbh if I had spent years prepping for a pandemic I&#x27;d be pretty disappointed with how this one went down... afaict zero prepping was necessary.<p>I mean, come on. You and I have both ridden this out with little to no disruption to our lives, but hundreds of thousands are dead, and many more are out of work, unable to afford food, close to being evicted. &quot;I&#x27;m fine so I guess it was never a big deal&quot; is not an appropriate attitude.')
