Item(by='Barrin92', descendants=None, kids=[25393392], score=None, time=1607730111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25392929, text='&gt; imagine being Slack in a world where Google, Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, IBM, etc all had different APIs you had to integrate with and their products were already integrated with each other?<p>That&#x27;s already the world we&#x27;re in except for the fact that small competitors can&#x27;t integrate with them, or reimplement clients even if they want to. Netflix runs fine on every platform of the large players. I can log into everything with Google, Facebook and vice-versa, the very largest companies often already adjust their infrastructure to be mutually compatible to significant degrees.<p>It&#x27;s really only third party incumbents who get locked out regularly, if you&#x27;re already an Apple or Microsoft you can at least partially get your way with the other big sharks. It&#x27;s the Signals and IRCs and (until recently) Linuxes of this world who have to exist at the margins.<p>I also think it&#x27;s important to point out that nobody has to <i>fully</i> reimplement a services API. If you&#x27;re one guy, and you want to make a sleek, minimialist facebook client, why not? If people prefer full featured Facebook they can go to Facebook, but at least then there is choice. I wasn&#x27;t saying either that a company can&#x27;t have huge market share in this system, just <i>that they ought to do it on the merit of their software</i>, facing full competition. Large companies that provide feature-rich experiences will still win customers who desire these features, so I don&#x27;t see the downside to my proposal.')
