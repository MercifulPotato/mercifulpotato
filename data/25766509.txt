Large, and small, groups of individuals do influence massive organizations like Google. Lobbyists do it on behalf of groups, taking advantage of their personal connections to get access to decision makers. Public action orgs like Sleeping Giants use collective shaming to influence decision makers. Activists of all stripes use protest and direct action to create change.<p>You don&#x27;t have to rely on existing assumptions about unions, or customers vs user, or many other concerns I see raised in other replies. The fundamental thing you&#x27;re trying to do is influence decision makers and a large group of people is certainly one way to do that.<p>The effectiveness of such a group will come down to factors such as how well you manage message, what access you can get, and what degree (and from how many angles) you can apply pressure and persuasion.<p>If nothing else starting a place where Google users can collect, vote on, and discuss their top priorities could form the basis of discovering how large a group you can attract, where the passion exists, and what resources you can muster toward the effort.')
