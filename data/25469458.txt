I&#x27;ve genuinely not thought about it enough to come up with another one that works.<p>EDIT: Actually the Buzzfeed model might be the best one for newsrooms. Pump out tons of free, clickbaity content. Solicit paid sponsorships for lots of that content (e.g. &quot;We try snacks from around the world&quot; then solicit snack companies in that niche to sponsor the video) and use the profits to run a successful investigative journalism section as well.')
