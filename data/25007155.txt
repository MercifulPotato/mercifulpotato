Item(by='winter_blue', descendants=None, kids=[25010223], score=None, time=1604666069, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25006730, text='<i>&gt; Bunch of javascript spaghetti code with ++i + i++ like idiotic questions and some basic SQL. Do you really guys think that calculating inside your head some shamanic expressions will evaluate objectively the engineering experience?</i><p>I feel kind of ashamed as an Indian, seeing this. These sorts of dumb and idiotic questions are all too common in India. People like to ask these sorts of silly question (that lack any depth) even in the education system in India (e.g. in CBSE and various state syllabi).<p>They obviously filter for a certain type -- a person who is good at answering arcane, meaningless useless edge case questions. Where you have idea what that person&#x27;s actual engineering and architecture skills are like.<p>The sad part of this story is that the entire Indian education system is designed to train people to attain such kinds of meaningless superficial skills. For example, most engineering entrance exams in India expect you to be <i>really good</i> at computing complicated integrals -- something that you can just ask a computer do. It fails to recognize and utilize the great depth and breadth of human intellect, and instead rewards people for simulating a CPU well.')
