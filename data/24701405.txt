Such a great tool.<p>[Vimium + i3 + vim + vscode&#x2F;vmplugin] Means that I rarely have to reach for the mouse, have a tonne of desktop real estate that&#x27;s easy to navigate and is way more comfortable.<p>Just having search, simple navigation and the &#x27;f-feature&#x27; in vimium is enough for like 99% of my use cases.<p>It&#x27;s such a pleasant and seamless experience to code in the editor, hop on over to the terminal to do w&#x2F;e, skip on over to the browser to look something up, and go back to code. The muscle memory just takes over. Not to mention all the other benefits like having to track down small icons, sometimes changing window state (e.g. unmaximize, moving things around), and how much more effort using a mouse is over 2-3 keystrokes.')
