For example, do you remember fractions? exponents?  If not completely, go back and re-learn them.<p>Then progress grade by grade will go much much quicker than the first time you learned them.  Khan Academy is a good help.<p>Someone else mentioned drills and Schaum&#x27;s.  I second that.  Drilling is even more necessary as one gets older (I say this as an oldster.)<p>Once you&#x27;ve exhausted grade-school math, you would be ready for some of the other suggestions listed by others.')
