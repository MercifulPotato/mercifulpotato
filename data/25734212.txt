Most of the neglected bikes in the US got parked long before they accumulated enough miles to wear out brake pads. I&#x27;ve got maybe 4000 miles of mostly urban commuting (i.e. much harder on brake pads than rides in the country) on my nice road bike and I haven&#x27;t changed them yet. For casual cyclists, brake pads are a lifetime part.<p>Possible exception: glazed brake pads, but still relatively uncommon. Cables and housing are much bigger wear items for most bikes. Mostly because they aren&#x27;t stainless at the low end and rust.<p>Chains will also rust, but it&#x27;s pretty hard to end up with an unsalvageable chain unless a bike has been left outside for a long time. Source: left my beater road bike outside at the curb for 9 years in Boston, including winters. Lubed the chain a couple times a year. It still runs.')
