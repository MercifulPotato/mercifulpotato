The amount of light halves as the f stop goes up, but its in steps.  1.4&#x2F;2&#x2F;2.8&#x2F;4&#x2F;5.6 . so the difference is about 1&#x2F;2 stop, not huge.<p>As you close the lens iris (the f stop # goes up) you get more of the image &quot;in focus&quot;, so focus doesn&#x27;t need to be as precise. \nBut you&#x27;ll need a minimum shutter speed so moving objects in the frame don&#x27;t blur.<p>wikipedia has a good photo example of this.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Depth_of_field#Effect_of_lens_aperture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Depth_of_field#Effect_of_lens_...</a>')
