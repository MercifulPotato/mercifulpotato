If you already know PHP and can produce results (mostly CRUD apps) and it doesn&#x27;t need millions of rps, why do we need to use another language because they are so much better ? So much better at what ? It is like saying &quot;I have a hammer, so everything looks like a nail to me&quot;. Not every web app has to be written in Lua&#x2F;Rust&#x2F;Go&#x2F;Julia etc. Each language comes at a cost. No free lunch.<p>&quot;But why should anyone start a new project in php now that we have so many good alternatives?&quot;<p>Because everything comes at a cost. You want to use Rust instead of PHP ? Sure, sounds great. Now lets go find a really good Rust developer who also understands how to host it correctly and then if he leaves, can I easily find another Rust developer ? Hmmm. You also need to account for maturity, ecosytem, hosting, maintenance etc which are all real world problems. Building a new shiny toy project ? Go ahead use whatever language you love. Again, it is about cost vs benefit.')
