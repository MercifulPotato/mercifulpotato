Item(by='mft_', descendants=None, kids=[25542777], score=None, time=1608981283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25542373, text='Fair additional point about having to spend time&#x2F;mental energy on dealing with the oil disposal.<p>Not a criticism, though - I&#x27;m very much in the same &#x27;place&#x27; as you - trying to find a better balance of what to do myself vs. outsource... and I fear I often get the balance wrong, on the side of not outsourcing enough.<p>Case in point: I recently changed my GF&#x27;s car wheels, over to the winter wheel&#x2F;tyre set. Ahead of time, it&#x27;s an easy calculation: a few minutes per wheel (I&#x27;ve got good tools including an impact wrench already) saves her a decent amount of money, plus the time to&#x2F;from&#x2F;waiting at the garage.  But it&#x27;s easy to underestimate: it may well be 10 minutes-ish per wheel, but this ignores the time spent wrestling the 8 wheels from&#x2F;to their storage space, plus the relative hassle of having to have somewhere to store them at home.  I should have probably not interfered: she&#x27;d not really have missed the money, and I could have spent that hour+ doing something more fulfilling (maybe).')
