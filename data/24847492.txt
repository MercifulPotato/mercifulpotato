Item(by='unhammer', descendants=None, kids=[24847723, 24848338], score=None, time=1603285919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24847285, text='&quot;in&quot; actually happens to mean more or less the same in German :-)<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not quite grammatical without the determiner, making it &quot;in dem Papierkorb&quot; which contracts to &quot;im Papierkorb&quot;, but then you could say that about English as well, still we don&#x27;t write &quot;in:the bin&quot;, so &quot;in:Papierkorb&quot; should be OK.<p>If you want a challenge, there are languages that prefer postpositions (&quot;Trash:in&quot;?) or case suffixes (&quot;Trashin&quot;?) or even circumfixes (&quot;iTrashn&quot;??) â€“ and some case suffixes may happen to be formally equal to the nominative for certain words (so &quot;Trash&quot; could be ambiguous between &quot;in:Trash&quot; and &quot;Trash&quot;). Happy localising.')
