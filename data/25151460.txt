The 1.50 release will have min const generics as well as stable backtraces.<p>As the releases are every 6 weeks, an individual one might seem small. But over time they add up.<p>Note though that I do consider the rustdoc improvements to be major. Previously I wasn&#x27;t bothering with directly linking to referenced items because you had to figure out html names. Now it&#x27;s very easy and I plan to write more links.')
