The idea was to embed bits of glitter in a clear epoxy matrix, and collect a &quot;fingerprint&quot; of the result when read from different angles. It would be nearly impossible to recreate the glitter pattern. I really liked the idea, but apparently they never solved the alignment problem well enough to make the &quot;easy to read&quot; part a reality.')
