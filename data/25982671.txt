That sentence only tells me that some South Asians are neither white nor black.<p>I have no idea how they&#x27;d classify e.g. Turks. I think Greeks are considered white in the US, so maybe Turks  too.<p>The other big immigrant group in Germany are Vietnamese, but they&#x27;re kind of hamstrung by mostly having moved to East Germany. (East Germans in general are economically disadvantaged.)<p>I think statistics about ethnicity would be more useful if they were based on easily interpretable categories like own country of birth, country of birth of parents, grandparents, etc.')
