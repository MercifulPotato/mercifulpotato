But the point is that weak founders with all the luck in the world won&#x27;t achieve much, whereas great founders with only a little bit of luck can be hugely successful.<p>He also points out that it&#x27;s a long journey, much longer than a downturn will last, so better to start now when you&#x27;re inspired, especially when the downturn can bring favourable conditions (like cheaper talent, rent, services, etc).<p>YC is also quite happy to back founders a second time. Off the  top of my head, Stripe, Twitch and Cruise were all founded by 2nd or 3rd-time founders. So YC&#x27;s approach is to find founders with potential, get them into their network, then support them for as long as they need to find success.<p>&gt; Is there a statistical analysis of YC and PG which shows they choose effectively?<p>Some people have tried to evaluate this quantitively or qualitatively, but most miss the point, or can&#x27;t evaluate it correctly without knowing YC&#x27;s financials, which nobody outside YC management and their investors knows.<p>YC&#x27;s approach isn&#x27;t to try to &quot;choose&quot; only the good founders. Their approach is to cast a very wide net, to invest in a huge number of companies including some very crazy-looking ones, knowing that only a handful will win big but that will yield big enough returns to more than pay for all the losses.<p>So the question is not whether they chose good founders and rejected bad ones, but whether they backed a big enough and broad enough pool of companies to get a significant number of huge winners - like, say, Dropbox, Airbnb, Twitch, Segment, Cruise, Coinbase, Instacart, Flexport, Brex.<p>Answer: yes, evidently.')
