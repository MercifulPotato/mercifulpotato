Especially if you don&#x27;t push people out of the system, like banning these people in social networks.<p>Trump voters did not want the system destroyed. They believe the election was rigged.<p>There is enough evidence of election fraud or election abnormalities. Though I believe not enough to change the election outcome.<p>It should the job of democrats (and everybody) to investigate, convince, and speak transparently about all the issues, in particular, prosecute people responsible for problems, rather than repeating &quot;orange man bad&quot;, and radicalise Trump supporters.')
