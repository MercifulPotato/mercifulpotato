Sure, a responsible broker <i>might</i> reserve a right to liquidate your position in order to limit their risk. This isn&#x27;t a responsible broker. They might also liquidate your position to limit their <i>losses</i> at your expense... or because the cabal said to.<p>We are not starting from the assumption that they (RH, Citadel, NASDAQ,etc... even the SEC) are acting responsibly, or in the interest of &quot;mom &amp; pop.&quot; They are playing heads I win, tails your lose... again.<p>The hedge funds got caught holding $10m puts with $1bn (so far) long tail risk. RH are in some sort of similar position. They make high, steady returns from such positions. Typical insider deal. When that long tail risk materializes, all bets are off... and this is not even a figure of speech!<p>The asymmetry is dumbfounding. Responsible actors! Market Fundamentals!  The hypocrisy of it.')
