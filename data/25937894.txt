Item(by='Rafert', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611805579, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25936646, text='&gt; As a port, CCS2 is backwards compatible to CCS1. You can take a CCS1 (J1772) cable and plug it into a car with a CCS2 port. And yes, the J1772 (CCS1) is by far the standard connector in the US market. I see that connector everywhere.<p>CCS type 1 (J1772) and type 2 (aka &quot;Mennekes&quot; used in Europe) are not compatible? Both are described in IEC 62196-2 so I am not sure which other connectors could be compatible here.<p>&gt; And yes, Elon could easily say &quot;Tesla is moving all production to CCS2, all future Teslas manufactured after today will be CCS2, all Supercharger stations will be retrofitted with CCS2 cables&quot;<p>This already happened in the European Union FWIW.')
