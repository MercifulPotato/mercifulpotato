First, we don&#x27;t really know how to quantify the relative value of two different species.  It&#x27;s kind of like trying to quantify the value of a book.  Losing a volume of Aristotle&#x27;s Poetics is probably worse than losing a Harlequin romance.  And second, the information is not just resident in the genome.  We can quantify how many bits of information is contained in DNA, but just knowing the complete gene sequence of a salamander is not enough to be able to make a salamander.  You need to embed those genes in the right environment, and we have no idea how to quantify the information needed to describe that.  So actually putting a number on it is hopeless.  The best you can do is look at the effort it would take to reproduce that information once it&#x27;s lost, which is essentially infinite.')
