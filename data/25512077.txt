Item(by='antisthenes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608675894, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508176, text='What irks me most about CDPR&#x27;s games, including the Witcher series is that even during the most mundane playthrough, our main character ends up being a non-apologetic mass-murderer. As a teenager, I probably would have been fine with it as some sort of power-trip, but as an adult, it strikes me as very one-dimensional and a boring way to play.<p>I&#x27;m not sure which case is more unforgivable here. Geralt, the Witcher protagonist, in the books at least, makes it a personal point not to meddle in human affairs as much as possible, and to keep it strictly business for the most part  - e.g. killing horrible monsters for coin.<p>In the game, our actions couldn&#x27;t stray further from this principle.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen in Cyberpunk&#x27;s gameplay, we are no less than a mass-murderer as well. And despite most of our kills being gang members and thugs, I&#x27;m still not sure it&#x27;s entirely justifiable. I&#x27;ve seen people indiscriminately kill civilians and cops  by running them over with cars, and suffer no real consequences in further gameplay.<p>Hence it&#x27;s quite hilarious to me when people compare Cyberpunk to Deus Ex or another stealth shooter. They must be out of their mind. The games are nothing alike. The shallowness and one-dimensionality of Cyberpunk makes it much closer to GTA&#x2F;Borderlands than a revolutionary stealth&#x2F;rpg game.<p>People were expecting a revolutionary game in the way Witcher 3 was when it came out. And that, Cyberpunk certainly isn&#x27;t.')
