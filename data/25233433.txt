I created a list of about 10 ideas, the one at the top of that list being so out there that I had to immediately share it with the team. About half of the team members loved it and thought it will be the best thing ever, and the other half thought it&#x27;s too expensive and we shouldn&#x27;t risk so much money on an unproven concept that could fail completely. So the takeaway is quite clear - there might be something there, but I need to come up with an MVP that can be tested quickly (eg: 2 weeks) and cost-efficiently (eg: two weeks of one person&#x27;s time).<p>Let me contrast that with my career from 20 years ago. My Master&#x27;s thesis was to calculate the flight performance of an aircraft that ended up having its maiden flight 5 years later. Essentially, an entirely mathematically-driven exercise where you apply a well-known methodology to calculate a deterministic problem. I got bored of that pretty quickly and went into flight testing, thinking that I could keep my mind active by being more hands-on in my work. I quickly learned that flight testing is all about reading regulations and checking the aircraft for compliance. Sure, there is some flying involved, but nowhere enough to keep you stimulated every day.<p>If you&#x27;re reading those two paragraphs above, one will appeal to you more than the other. It doesn&#x27;t mean that one career path is fundamentally better or worse, it&#x27;s more about what does YOUR mind need to be stimulated? Do you prefer nondeterministic challenges or would you rather apply existing processes and be super precise and accurate? Do you prefer quick turnaround times, or would you be happier knowing that there is 5 years&#x27; worth of budget for you and your team of hundreds of people to complete a project? Whatever your conclusion, you&#x27;re not wrong - it just has to be right for you. I think PG&#x27;s essay helped explain this.')
