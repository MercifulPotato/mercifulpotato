What do you think would have happened if, say the crowd has come in contact with AOC, for example? What would have happened if enough Dems were killed or incapacitated to change the balance of votes on certifying the election? The hundred-odd house republicans certainly made a big point of not changing their certification votes after the riots.<p>Third:\nWhen someone fires a gun at your head and the bullet misses, will you make excuses on behalf of the shooter? After all, if they were &#x2F;really&#x2F; a killer, they wouldn&#x27;t have missed, right? The bullet missed, you continued on your day, nothing should be done...')
