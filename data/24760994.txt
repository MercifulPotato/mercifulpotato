Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602547919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24760791, text='&gt; Which is it?<p>1 * 0 = 0<p>&gt; You either don&#x27;t travel, don&#x27;t travel for very long, or don&#x27;t travel anywhere interesting.<p>I would prefer you didn&#x27;t make assumptions.<p>I travel to lots of interesting places, and I have had my credit card disabled several times. Once because my idiot geography-illiterate bank didn&#x27;t know that Bulgaria was a part of Europe. Good thing I had a stack of cash with me. For less prepared travellers, the bank is doing nothing but stranding their own customers cashless in unfamiliar places.<p>In any case, my point still stands that they really shouldn&#x27;t be <i>calling</i> to verify it is me when I don&#x27;t even have my home country&#x27;s SIM card in my phone.<p>They <i>should</i> be e-mailing me instead, which is the only reliable way to reach me while travelling and SIM swapping. Most people are more reachable easily by e-mail than by phone when travelling for the exact same reason.')
