So I drag that song up and add it to my slowly growing playlist.<p>I take a similar approach, but I&#x27;ve found that the recommendation algorithm is pretty bad, so as an extra step I click on the artist and spend a bit of time listening to their other songs (and add those too, in the hopes it&#x27;ll affect the algorithm).<p>&gt; This approach has worked pretty well for me so far, but I really wish that there was a way to explicitly tell Spotify that I &quot;dislike&quot; a song and to never recommend it to me again.<p>That&#x27;s one of my main issues with the &#x27;recommended&#x27; algorithm. 90% of it is stuff I already have in other playlists, or stuff I keep skipping. I really wish the algorithm did a bit more with all the data it has, but I imagine they optimize for sales (to us or promoting artists&#x2F;labels) over our actual desires.')
