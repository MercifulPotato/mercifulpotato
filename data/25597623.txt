Most of the claims were about Russian social media campaigns. We&#x27;ll never know if those campaigns made a significant difference, but they certainly did happen. The other big thing was the DNC hack, also probably orchestrated by Russia.<p>&gt; What was found out was contact with Russia to dig dirt on Trump&#x27;s opponents.<p>I&#x27;d call that highly illegal, highly interesting, and even more worrisome than the prospect of a few hacked Diebold machines. A President who conspired with a foreign power to win election? Can you imagine the leverage that foreign power would have over such a President? With machine hacking, the President can claim ignorance. No such chance here.<p>The last guy who did that was named Richard Nixon.[1][2]<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;story&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;06&#x2F;nixon-vietnam-candidate-conspired-with-foreign-power-win-election-215461" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;story&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;06&#x2F;nixon-vie...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smithsonianmag.com&#x2F;smart-news&#x2F;notes-indicate-nixon-interfered-1968-peace-talks-180961627&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smithsonianmag.com&#x2F;smart-news&#x2F;notes-indicate-nix...</a>')
