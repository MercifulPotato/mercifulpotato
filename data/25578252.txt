A &quot;market cap&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean anything for a currency. But let&#x27;s say it did. You know that a market cap is simply defined as the most recent transaction price times the number of outstanding assets yeah?<p>2. So that means if you control the most recent transaction you control the price.<p>3. Tether is minting $1B of new coinage <i>per month</i> and accelerating. They then use this money to buy bitcoin. They structure it at opportune moments to prop the price up.<p>4. There isn&#x27;t $512B in value you can actually extract from Bitcoin. If you began to sell, the value would rapidly deflate towards zero.<p>This is part of why market cap is such a poor way of measuring a currency. A small amount of transaction volume on the margin defines a false sense of value for the community.')
