Someone who orders food from a restaurant might expect that the restaurant has recipes designed for delivery. I wouldn&#x27;t expect a top quality restaurant burger when I order delivery, but I&#x27;d still be disappointed if it were a soggy mess instead of the 5-8&#x2F;10 I&#x27;ve come to expect from decent delivery options.')
