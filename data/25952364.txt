This is common for stocks in high demand for shorts, especially one that is 140% borrowed. Unless you&#x27;re a professional trader and have access to the best brokers, you couldn&#x27;t short GME even if you wanted to (this is common, and why professionals pay big $ to have access to high demand shorts).')
