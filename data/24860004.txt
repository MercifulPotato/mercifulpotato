It makes ordinary things look great.<p>It&#x27;s not what you should take if you are truly trying to accomplish something, other than be able to change your point of view.<p>Problem with your co-workers may have been that they didn&#x27;t assume they were on drugs, that of course it will affect your productivity when everything starts looking good enough already. That&#x27;s what drugs are like, if you take drugs, be aware you will be under their influence.<p>LSD is not a &quot;performance enhancing drug&quot; like perhaps could be said about amphetamines. The effect of those is truly detrimental to your health. But they make you more productive. A fighter-pilot on amphetamine might shoot down 3 enemy planes and then get shot down themselves. Productive but not so healthy.')
