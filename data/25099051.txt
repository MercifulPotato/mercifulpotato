But it&#x27;s free!<p>Reality Capture is the opposite. Apparently (haven&#x27;t tried myself) the best in the industry, but insanely expensive (subscription-based only AFAIU).<p>Metashape Pro is my go-to. The demo is very liberal and it&#x27;s quick enough and accurate enough for what I need to do.<p>You need a LOT of ram (64 gigs is about the minimum) and the more CUDA cores the better. If you don&#x27;t have a dedicated graphics card, you can forget about doing any sort of remotely complex scan within 24 hours (e.g. a macbook). This applies to any PG software.')
