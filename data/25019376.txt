In my own lifetime the only president I was ever actually excited about was Obama. I think the only thing that does eclipse that excitement IS not having Trump anymore. I disagree with the notion that we need to be excited about a president in general because that&#x27;s what GOT us Trump. The president should be boring, and move the country forward like a normal, boring job. I yearn for a president that might pop up every 45 days (oh yeah he&#x27;s the president and he&#x27;s doing something). Instead of what we just had.<p>With Trump I feel like we dangerously moved towards having super celebrity presidents that are more interested in being King. I don&#x27;t think the US should have a King. It should have someone that &quot;PRESIDES&quot; over governments boring ass functions.')
