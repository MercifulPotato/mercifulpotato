In python this is much smoother.<p>Are you using numpy?  If so, can you give a concrete example?, in my case the opposite seems to be true.  The numpy notation seems to be much clunkier.<p>Apart from that, this sentence:<p>&gt; To get fast you need to vectorize.<p>describes a very sad tragedy of numerical computing.  It makes no sense that in 2021 interpreters for scientific languages are not able to optimize loops.  The so-called &quot;vectorization&quot; should be a non-issue in a modern interpreted language.  The running time of calling &quot;C=A*B&quot; and that of the triple loop to fill the elements of the matrix C should be identical.')
