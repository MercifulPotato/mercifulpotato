I think about all the &quot;lifestyle businesses&quot; that are examples of products that don&#x27;t need full on &quot;companies&quot; to exist.<p>I think that if you are passionate about creating a product for people to use, then you will see through on all the other aspects of making that product survive and be used.<p>Otherwise, what you&#x27;re interested in is &quot;development&quot;, and big places like Google will give you plenty of experience in doing that.<p>This is not a value judgement. Personally, I have no problem working at a company where I&#x27;m paid to engineer products from the ground up. Maintaining things is boring. But that&#x27;s just me.')
