Item(by='nendroid', descendants=None, kids=[24880365], score=None, time=1603557405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880188, text='&gt;Crossing the line while fighting terrorism was not an acceptable action by the USA but I think it&#x27;s a false equivalency to compare it to forced internment, torture, and reeducation of an entire population.<p>I think it&#x27;s a fair comparison. The amount of innocent bystanders killed by the the US military will be much more than what happens in concentration camps.<p>The difference is the wording. War sounds not as bad as re-education and concentration camps. This is because you&#x27;re use to it. Change the word from war to slaughter, because that is what war is.. slaughter. It&#x27;s not even an exaggeration... if you&#x27;ve ever seen a bomb or a bullet massacre a human being into a bloody mess, slaughter is a very appropriate word.<p>When you change the word you&#x27;ll realize that war and re-education live on relatively the same level of extremism. Perhaps war is even worse than re-education or concentration camps.<p>The US slaughtered many soldiers and innocent bystanders in Iraq and afghanistan to end terrorism. The Chinese tortured and re-educated many people to end terrorism.<p>Which is worse?')
