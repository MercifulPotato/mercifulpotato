I started with just combinatorial logic (I was 3 after all!) but in one week I graduated to sequential logic.I still remember the spark of pride on father&#x27;s eyes when I showed him the ALU I just created, he still told me  to do better. Several ISA and micro-architecture later and half a dozen of languages created ( I remember fondly Beethoven,it was OO, this was before Simula) I started to get good at it. But then Gerda, my dear _Lehrerin_ had to go back to Germany (something about her father) and I had to start first grade so I set those juvenile games aside. I think they still somehow shaped the gentleman I am today.<p>Yours fondly. Oneupyou McGill')
