With some uncertainty of course.<p>I would argue that making these causal inferences without formal proof is actually somewhat essential and desirable, so long as assumptions and uncertainty are recognized, and that they lead to further probing (informed by such inference).<p>Many people seem to think science is about &quot;finding the truth&quot; (ie.: obtaining &quot;first-order&quot; information about the world), and that&#x27;s certainly one way to see it... But I think it&#x27;s more interesting to think of science as being all about finding, quantifying and describing uncertainty.<p>This might seem pedantic, but you don&#x27;t need to abandon all uncertainty in order to make causal inference. I think we&#x27;re saying mostly the same things, in different ways and with different implicit assumptions about what it means to do science. It&#x27;s obvious from your answer that you also understand all of this very well.<p>PS.: I have an MSc in biochem: not claiming to be a great scientist, but I do have formal training so I&#x27;m at least familiar with the matter :)')
