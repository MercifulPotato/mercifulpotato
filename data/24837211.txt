This is especially true if a casual seeker is unfamiliar with the terminology used while reporting these figures.<p>Incidentally, it is also worth noting that one does not have to believe that the numbers are cooked up to believe that they are misleading.  Having a consistent definition is important when comparing figures, unfortunately having a consistent definition also means that the reported numbers may not reflect societal expectations over time (e.g. regarding retirement or multiple income households).')
