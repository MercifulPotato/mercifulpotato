Changes to files&#x2F;dirs too worked as expected as far as I can recall (disclaimer: most recent Amiga experience -&gt; 1994). It was also possible to create assigns programmatically with calls to the Amiga DOS library, see &quot;dos.library&#x2F;AssignPath&quot; in <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amiga.nvg.org&#x2F;amiga&#x2F;reference&#x2F;Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide&#x2F;node059A.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amiga.nvg.org&#x2F;amiga&#x2F;reference&#x2F;Includes_and_Autodocs_2...</a><p><pre><code>    NAME\n     AssignPath -- Creates an assignment to a specified path (V36)\n    \n       SYNOPSIS\n     success = AssignPath(name,path)\n     D0                    D1   D2\n    \n     BOOL AssignPath(STRPTR,STRPTR)\n    \n       FUNCTION\n     Sets up a assignment that is expanded upon EACH reference to the name.\n     This is implemented through a new device list type (DLT_ASSIGNPATH, or\n     some such).  The path (a string) would be attached to the node.  When\n     the name is referenced (Open(&quot;FOO:xyzzy&quot;...), the string will be used\n     to determine where to do the open.  No permanent lock will be part of\n     it.  For example, you could AssignPath() c2: to df2:c, and references\n     to c2: would go to df2:c, even if you change disks.\n    \n     The other major advantage is assigning things to unmounted volumes,\n     which will be requested upon access (useful in startup sequences).\n    \n       INPUTS\n     name - Name of device to be assigned (without trailing &#x27;:&#x27;)\n     path - Name of late assignment to be resolved at each reference\n    \n       RESULT\n     success - Success&#x2F;failure indicator of the operation\n    \n       SEE ALSO\n     AssignAdd(), AssignLock(), AssignLate(), Open()</code></pre>')
