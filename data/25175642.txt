Because, you know, element of surprise. So it&#x27;s normal to be attacked with no declaration of war, but then to declare war on your attacker or in defense of your treaty partners.<p>Like Pearl Harbor, where the Japanese attacked without declaring war, then the US declared war on Japan, then Germany declared war on the US as part of their treaty with Japan.<p>The problem that Japan and Germany faced was you don&#x27;t declare war on an enemy that you can&#x27;t bomb, and who has 10x more oil than you do. Oops.<p>So yes, Germany did start WW2.<p>To be fair to the German people, they were used to monarchy&#x2F;autocracy. Democracy in the 1930s was not looked upon as an entirely positive thing as it is today in the West. So they were fine going along with whoever the strongman was, similar to Russia and Putin today.<p>&gt; the harsh treaty of Versailles made to WW2<p>It actually wasn&#x27;t harsh compared to previous treaties that favored Germany, although politicians find fig leaves for war convenient, and one can object to any reparations at all.')
