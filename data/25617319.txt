If it&#x27;s a motorway or similar road, the electronic emergency signs will also show the reduced speed limit [1].  On a motorway, they&#x27;re often on a gantry, i.e. completely impossible to miss.<p>I think I read somewhere that it&#x27;s someone&#x27;s job to make regular checks that the temporary signs (and covers) are still correct -- they are an important part of the worker safety requirement for the construction crew.<p>When a speed limit changes, the rule is for the sign to be shown on <i>both</i> sides of the road.  There are then repeating signs for the current limit at some regular interval.<p>The UK is dense enough that having expensive electronic signs on all motorways isn&#x27;t an unreasonable cost; I understand that&#x27;s not practical in the USA or Australia.<p>[1a] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;midlands-news&#x2F;article10103766.ece&#x2F;ALTERNATES&#x2F;s810&#x2F;0_Drivers-ignored-stop-signs-during-an-emergency-on-the-M6-Stock-picture.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;midlands-news&#x2F;arti...</a><p>[1b] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ageas.co.uk&#x2F;globalassets&#x2F;solved&#x2F;30072018_road-safety_road-signs-cropped.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ageas.co.uk&#x2F;globalassets&#x2F;solved&#x2F;30072018_road-sa...</a> (possibly this style is no longer used, I drive very rarely in the UK so I&#x27;m not sure.)')
