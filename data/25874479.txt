E.g. using state machines for the cocos search makes an on-line very lazily written implementation human-verifiable at a read. I would like to see an example that doesn&#x27;t have such a contrived nature.<p>Edit: Now I see in part II&#x2F;III where the title actually comes to fruition and there is a state machine oriented generator is made and used. That still doesn&#x27;t satisfy me about part I, honestly I would have just skipped it in retrospect.')
