You have a high prior for police stops existing in general, and a low one for people randomly lying about it, so a stranger saying there&#x27;s one that way is compelling evidence to you.  You have a high prior on the existence of treausure nearvy, but a low one of the existence of treasure worth the effort of finding, so me telling you you could get rich quick isn&#x27;t compelling evidence to you.')
