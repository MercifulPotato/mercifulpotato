The doctor there administered an epi and then called 911 to get an ambulance to the nearest hospital.<p>We ended up getting a &gt;$2,000 bill for a 10 minute ambulance ride because the ambulance company was out-of-network. The ambulance company then had the audacity to send the bill to collections before the 30 day pay period even expired...<p>So yea, even if you have good insurance you can still get bit by these issues in emergencies! Unfortunately, this new bill does not even address the out of network ambulance issue.')
