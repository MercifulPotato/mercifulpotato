And it is obvious that return-type overloading is not usable in situations where the desired return type is not known, as in the auto example.<p>As for the template error messages, since this is just one layer of templates, I suspect that they will be quite decent - especially considering that even one std::string-related error message is easily a few lines of almost completely irrelevant gibberish (does anyone actually use non-default char_traits???).')
