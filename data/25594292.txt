ReelValley was even a commercial effort.  (This is only to supplement the parent comment, not contradict.)<p>Your mileage may vary, but several times I&#x27;ve tried some single threaded thing in both Rust, C++ and Nim and the Nim came out faster (e.g. [1] had final Nim version 5.0 ms, C++ 27 ms, Rust 42 ms), not putting much effort into any, and is likely more readable to someone brand new to the language.  Writing generic data structures &amp; algos in Nim is also a true breeze&#x2F;pleasure.  Anyway, they are all &quot;fast and maybe-safe by default&quot; and all respond similarly to optimization care.  There is no obvious performance disadvantage (and compiling times are much better in Nim, yielding scripting language-like code iteration).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24817594" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24817594</a>')
