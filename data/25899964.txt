My particular model (Ford C-Max Energi) has pretty low EV only capacity (20ish miles, if you stay under 60 mph and relatively flat), and the battery interferes with cargo space, but if you got the capacity up to about 50 miles, that would do a lot of people&#x27;s (non-covid) daily commute with a single charge (either overnight at home, or during the day at work; but you wouldn&#x27;t need both). And when you need to go farther, 500+ miles per tank, 5 minute fillup.')
