Item(by='pmlnr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611393640, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25880867, text='Matrix.org - built on matrix, a federated, but somewhat fat protocol -, or one of conversations.im, quicksy.im, blabber.im, www.jabber.de, etc, all built on xmpp.<p>EDIT the point with these is tricky, because they are not all-in-one solutions. People these days tend to think that an app&#x2F;program == the service, but this is so not the case. I&#x27;ve tried telling people they could use other programs to access gmail, but it was like talking to a wall, and this is  serious issue in this - the instant messenger - case as well. I have no idea how to tell people that it&#x27;s possible to use _something else_ as an interface. Somehow most of them understand that there are different browsers to access the internet, but they don&#x27;t apply this thinking to other protocols and services. Hence recommendations for services who provide their &quot;own&quot; apps, conversations being the root, quicksy and blabber being derivatives.')
