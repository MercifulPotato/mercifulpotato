Artists&#x2F;Labels get a a very small slice of money from every play. As a Spotify consumer you do not pay for the right to play the track offline - if you did, the Artist&#x2F;Label would get a bigger slice. If you want to play the tracks offline, just buy the non-DRM MP3 from Amazon or some other place.<p>For people saying the Labels take all the money anyway, there are many independent artists on Spotify who deserve your money if you play their work.<p>Most of us here are hard working professionals in our fields - how would we feel if someone said at the end of each week, &quot;Thanks for what you did, it&#x27;s really useful, but I&#x27;ve decided to not pay you, but I&#x27;m going to keep your output anyway and use it forever.&quot;  We wouldn&#x27;t stand for it, and nor should music artists have to.')
