Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=[24947881], score=None, time=1604097613, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946007, text='&gt; As an example, &quot;improper enforcement of the law&quot; might suggest that something was enforced which wasn&#x27;t the law.<p>No, you can&#x27;t keep making up new meanings for words. &quot;Enforcement of the law&quot; means that law was being enforced. When you add &quot;improper&quot; in the front of it, it means that law was being enforced improperly. For example, when a police officer harasses a person on the pretext of enforcing the law, that would be improper law enforcement.<p>&gt; This whole discussion was about whether pindab0ter made a valid point. It&#x27;s not clear to me you are interested in understanding the point made. Maybe it&#x27;s easier for you to label it as a fallacy.<p>If pindab0ter wants to come here to clarify that they actually meant that OP is a valid example of enforcing a CoC, I will take their word for it. Otherwise, I&#x27;m not going to entertain &quot;hidden meanings&quot; for the words that they already spoke, I&#x27;m going to assume that they meant what they said.')
