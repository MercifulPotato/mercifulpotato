Figma didn&#x27;t discover those use cases by spying on users, they did it by talking with users and working WITH them. You know, using that whole consent thing?<p>The issue isn&#x27;t collaborating with your users and involving them in the design process - do that! It&#x27;s awesome and it&#x27;ll generally help you make better products.<p>The problem comes when you want to harvest intelligence from your users WITHOUT cooperation. If you need to do that to be &quot;productive&quot; ala Google, then yes, you are going to be hampered by privacy. That&#x27;s a tradeoff for users to make, and it&#x27;s only a real tradeoff when we aren&#x27;t dependent on the moods of Google or Facebook but instead can rely on the underlying technological basis.<p>And you can be very interoperable and maintain privacy - but your users will need to choose to enable that interopability. Facebook can &quot;promote interopability&quot; by linking my Instagram and Facebook, or forcing me to use Facebook on Oculus and that is interopability - but it&#x27;s sort of by force and not in a way that is acting with my consent. On the other hand, my email I send with Protonmail is perfectly interoperable - I can email anyone and get email from anyone, import and export emails and use whatever client I want - as long as I choose to allow it to be by decrypting my emails.')
