With ChiefOnboarding, you can easily design timelines for new hires. Add to do items, courses, badges, introductions, custom text&#x2F;Slack&#x2F;email messages, create user accounts (i.e. Google and Slack) and so much more. You can drag and drop them into the timelines and then re-use those timelines for other new hires.<p>You can onboard new hires through the Slack bot or through the web portal. ChiefOnboarding is available in multiple languages and uses timezones (even per new hire - for remote companies).<p>It used to be a SaaS, but a few months ago, I decided to make it completely open source. I still provide hosting for customers, but you can deploy it on your own servers if you want (docker-compose file included for easy deployment).<p>Documentation (under &#x27;How to&#x2F;Demo&#x27; there is a transcript of a demo with screenshots and all): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.chiefonboarding.com<p>Source code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chiefonboarding&#x2F;chiefonboarding<p>Let me know if you have any questions&#x2F;feedback!')
