It wasnâ€™t the main thing but he did claim it.<p>Ah, ok. I personally find that part uncontroversial, winter swimming clubs are pretty much thing where I live and they claim same thing. The thing I perceived as controversial&#x2F;disbelieved were breathing techniques, superior body control and wild health benefits. Again, winter swimming clubs here claim health benefits too, but you are supposed to become less vulnerable to common cold and such rather then curing diabetes or cancer.')
