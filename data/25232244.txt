Diller underlined many times how he struggles to remember, but has as a result learned to perceive ground truth through experience instead.<p>I&#x27;ve confirmed this in a number of conversations with founders and other professionals, so it is possible the formal research surfaces more. Here are a few of stories from people I know:<p>1. A left handed, night owl, bathroom builder with horrible memory, who loves his work and can easily find a way to improvise to achieve the right results on projects, even if volunteering in a different country with different materials and house structures (wood vs brick) where he doesn&#x27;t speak the language.<p>2. A doctor with amazing memory (can recite most movie lines ever heard and medical books ever read) who becomes timid and conservative about any new approach unless the best possible route is taken.<p>3. A founder who has benchmarked their brain on different tasks with different amounts of sleep deprivation. They have noticed in some states (nap, and high protein no-carb meal after sleep deprived state) the brain kicks into gear and comes up with amazing solutions to previously un-crackable problems while in other states repeat tasks flow much faster without over-think.')
