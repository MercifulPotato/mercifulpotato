Item(by='leshow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610385103, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25728241, text='&gt; I remember my first attempts at programming and being annoyed that I can&#x27;t add a string and an int; ever since that little bit of housekeeping of using types made sense to me and I can clearly see how it eliminates entire classes of errors.<p>Type inference doesn&#x27;t make these errors go away.<p>And about your other point, it&#x27;s unfair to look at just a simple case of writing &quot;string&quot; or not as the only thing inference provides. Although I&#x27;d argue that leaving out types where possible helps readability-- it&#x27;s really the more elaborate cases or intermediate steps during a longer transformation that inference helps with. Not to mention the fact that inference in closures is also really nice.')
