Obviously you&#x27;ve got companies like Anker that&#x27;ve been around for a good while, but, in my opinion at least, it can be tough to distinguish up-and-coming brands pumping out great products from not-so-great brands producing junk.<p>For instance, I&#x27;ve bought stuff from Aukey and Ravpower that&#x27;s worked well so far, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call those name brands yet in the US, unlike Anker.')
