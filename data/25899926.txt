Site stability and reliability trump how convenient it is for marketing content creators to release changes. Better to have a site that doesn&#x27;t have the latest change than a site that is completely down, or worse a site hacked because of a vulnerability in the CMS. Is that true for every site? Absolutely not! Although it seems like it would be for whitehouse.gov.')
