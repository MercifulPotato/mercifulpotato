I didn&#x27;t ever expect to have that much money and due to working a lot and having horrible workplace politics and coworkers, I am completely burned out.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to do both with the money - it&#x27;s been 6+ months and I really haven&#x27;t changed much in my lifestyle and with burnout - I certainly don&#x27;t want to continue working under the same conditions but at the same time I love what I&#x27;m doing.<p>Would much appreciate any advice, I don&#x27;t know any other place to ask.<p>edit: The reason why I consider continue working but on less hours is that I&#x27;m working on my dream job and grow&#x2F;learn a lot of things in the field and I think that leaving I may miss this opportunity')
