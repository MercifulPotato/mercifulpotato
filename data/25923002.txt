With employers being so sensitive, how can the cost&#x2F;benefit analysis ever really result in a determination that it&#x27;s a good idea to be active on Twitter&#x2F;Facebook (or Gab, Parler, TheDonald.win, etc.)?<p>Maybe that&#x27;s part of what makes things get so extreme on those sites. The most reasonable people know enough not to risk their livelihoods by jumping in and posting, and that leaves the less reasonable people to just sit there and escalate.')
