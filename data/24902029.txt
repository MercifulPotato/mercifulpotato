Thinking about Julia like you might think about incremental C++ builds isn’t exactly right. A somewhat useful analogy though is that Julia is kind of like C++ template code. This is why it is so flexible, but also why compilation isn’t very cacheable. This is also why it is tricky (but possible) to do ahead of time Julia builds.')
