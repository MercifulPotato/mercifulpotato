But it seems to me that the best way to find the truth (with a small T) is by rationality; the alternative is <i>ir</i>rationality which seems unlikely to be effective. My hope is that, by collaborating using the tools of reason combined with our own personal Truths, humanity could do our best by everyone involved. I don’t know for certain that it will work, but it seems like the best way we’ve got.')
