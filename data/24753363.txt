Neat to see some similar lines of thinking.<p>Some questions:<p>- Is the project open-source?<p>- Why no github signin?<p>- How do you search for X but only in Y language?<p>- How are you going to deal with duplication?<p>- Will you be doing a full 2D spread of combinations? E.g. writing to a file is pretty common - perhaps you can create a relationship between languages so that you can see how it&#x27;s done in other languages from the same page.<p>- How will you handle cases where there are multiple ways of doing things?<p>- Is search broken? &quot;Write to a file&quot; is the first entry there without searching, but searching for &quot;write to a file&quot; shows no entries.\n- How will you handle cases where environment matters? E.g. writing a file in Javascript is going to be different between web browsers and Node.js, and force-inlining a function is going to be different between clang and msvc, etc.')
