I work on large truck engines for a living, but know a small shop about 35 miles down the road that claims to be  an &quot;authorized&quot; Tesla service center...one of the few in the midwest.<p>while other automotive manufacturers have robust supply chains and networks, tesla doesnt. most of your parts (bearings, panels, drivetrain) all come from California and only from the factory.  It means they can save a ton of money by foregoing a traditional network but in return, repair shops are often on the hook for weeks or months of outstanding invoices waiting for parts, and have to gingerly explain to customers why their new model X will take 4 weeks to get the window fixed.<p>This isnt to say Tesla uses a ton of custom parts!  chargers and electronics are all rebranded (or stock) webasto.  parts for the brakes are Ensco or industry-standard (mexican) forged parts. you <i>can</i> work on these yourself but god in heaven help you if Tesla finds out you didnt go through them. In some cases parts for the car are significantly <i>better</i> in the aftermarket.  You can improve steering and handling significantly if you eschew Elons pet rebranded control arms.<p>From what Ive heard, be very careful with the giant television in the center console.  repair parts (if youre not from the golden coast) can take months, installation or replacement is a bear, and the controller for the unit has to be shipped back to Tesla before they will even send a new one.')
