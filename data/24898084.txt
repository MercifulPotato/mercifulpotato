Consider a book author who has a monopoly on for profit publishing, but anyone else can publish for no profit.<p>The book author’s expected profits would plummet as it would be the wild west in production.<p>What you’re really saying is “we should pay massively less for vaccine development”. Which again, sounds nice, but....why would anyone have developed a vaccine? It’s a complex project which costs billions and has taken 12+ months while taking resources away from competing projects.<p>The public money is an incentive to get people to put those considerations aside and devote all their resources to vaccine development. This is a sensible public investment in a return to normalcy.')
