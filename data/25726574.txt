Or &quot;I remember that one day someone told me that he had the same problem as me, but who was it and what was his solution?&quot;<p>Otherwise, we are used to share thousands of links and snippets with my friends that we usually discuss. A lot of time, after a very long time (sometimes years), for some reason we remember that something or link about a topic was discussed long time ago, and then it is convenient to look into the history with keywords to find back the links and what was said at that time!')
