Therefore, the Fed has not been printing money.<p>When the Fed buys assets (government bonds, Fannies, etc.) from a bank, the bank gets back &#x27;bank reserves&#x27;, which are just a number in the bank&#x27;s Federal Reserve account somewhere.<p>Those reserves can&#x27;t be lent out. The bank can make no change to its lending, because it&#x27;s a one-to-one swap (highly liquid government treasury -&gt; bank reserve). A bank&#x27;s constraint against lending more is its equity reserve ratio, which is unchanged by Fed asset purchases.<p>Again, this is <i>not</i> printing money; functionally speaking, US Treasuries are already &#x27;money&#x27; to a bank (they are extremely liquid, widely traded internationally, safe, and in many contexts actually preferable to cash), so swapping a US Treasury with cash is just turning one type of money into another; no net creation.<p>There&#x27;s a simple reason the Fed doesn&#x27;t clear up this confusion: the central bank prefers people to <i>think</i> they are printing money, because credibility is important to their effectiveness. And the Fed doesn&#x27;t actually print money, because they don&#x27;t have the legal authority to do so. This is why Powell is regularly getting in front of Congress to urge more stimulus spending: he knows it&#x27;s the only way to get dollars directly into the hands of ordinary Americans.')
