While it might seem less necessary if the goal is to &quot;learn deep learning&quot;, it is highly relevant if your task is to &quot;solve this business problem&quot;.<p>Our perspective is the industrial one. And while there are certainly many complex business problems where deep learning is required, there are more cases where a traditional approach is sufficient and actually the better solution (e.g. due to the memory footprint, latency or other reasons). We routinely work on both kinds of problems on a day to day basis, but we would never go straight to deep learning approaches if simpler and faster traditional methods comprise a better solution in a given use case. So, our employees are expected to know both and to be able to judge when to apply which approach.')
