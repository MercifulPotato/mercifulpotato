Item(by='kingosticks', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607607459, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373290, text='Thank you!<p>&gt; but I could have easily just not understood a similar option in PiMusicBox<p>No, you are right, we never had that feature. It would have been the next step  if the project was healthy. Or Spotify Connect, of course (although less interesting personally as we&#x27;d have to stop using Mopidy).<p>I had thoughts of a reboot which was much more focused around multi-room (using snapcast or the equally impressive looking SoundSync) but I looked around at Volumio, HiFiberryOS etc and didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be bringing anything new to the table so why fragment the space. Perhaps something built around SoundSync would be interesting as that would provide Chromecast support but I am not sure that on it&#x27;s own is enough. Plus the idea of my USP being something as locked-down as Google&#x27;s Chromecast is unpleasant.<p>Also, this might sound bad, but I would like to head away from a project that is too focused on inexperienced users. The support gets too much and you very rarely get any contributions back.')
