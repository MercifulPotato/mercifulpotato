Or why make it free to use forever ? Why not release it under a license that states usage is only permitted as long as the author allows it, i.e. for a limited trial period ?<p>My point here is that you can be pragmatic and say:<p>If some people want to build a free world, fine, I agree with that idea in principle and I will provide my work to them for free.<p>On the other hand, most people want a paid world, which is also fine, I might as well provide my service to them as well and benefit from it.<p>You&#x27;re not doing as much as releasing stuff under GPL-only would, in that you&#x27;re giving people that pay you an out, but it seems to be better than nothing. Plus, it&#x27;s a more positive approach than GPL, in that it&#x27;s not actively &quot;hurting&quot; people that don&#x27;t want to join the open source community (by not providing them any option to use the product), it&#x27;s simply giving an advantage to the open source users.')
