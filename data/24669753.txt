Item(by='thewebcount', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601702748, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24669488, text='&gt; I wonder if it really actually makes things easier to improve yourself<p>Yes, significantly, at least for me. I tried repeatedly to use a calorie counting app where you enter every food you ate. It had all kinds of conveniences for scanning barcodes, and saving meals you regularly ate, and had every chain restaurant&#x27;s data. It was such a pain in the ass to use. Manually entering everything, even with the ability to scan barcodes, was too tedious. And it was always inaccurate. How many grams of potatoes did I have when I cooked dinner tonight? I have no idea!<p>With the watch, I just click a button to say I&#x27;m going for a walk or a run, and it tracks my heart rate and knows my weight and height and does a fairly accurate calculation of my calories burned.<p>It also was a lot more fun than entering calories into an app. I would get little badges for making progress and rewards for reaching a goal. It wasn&#x27;t much, but it was a reminder that I was moving forward. I ended up &quot;closing my rings&quot; every day for 2 years straight (minus one week where I had the flu). That&#x27;s the most exercise I&#x27;ve ever done and the most consistently I&#x27;ve ever done it.')
