It&#x27;s so easy to use and works great on a trackpad. I&#x27;m going to start using it in my meetings.<p>Nice job!<p>------<p>EDIT: After playing with it for a bit, I have some feedback :)<p>- Sometimes, I accidentally press Z instead of shift, or vice versa. I would love to have undo! Backspace or delete hotkey would be perfect.<p>- For selecting colors, it would be great to just be able to press 1,2,3,4 (rather than cycling through).<p>- I often forget what color I have selected. Perhaps the cursor could be colored to indicate this?<p>- When typing text, my first instinct was to use the arrow keys to move the cursor around, but this doesn&#x27;t work. Also, it&#x27;s hard to select where the cursor should go to edit.<p>- The shift and Z hotkeys are great. But I don&#x27;t quite understand selecting the tools. If I can just hold down Z to erase, why would I ever select the eraser tool? It seems like the most efficient approach is to only ever have the text tool selected, so that at any time I can click to create text, but otherwise I use Z&#x2F;shift to draw.')
