I find some of its design rather inspired. Its been massively helpful and surprisingly easy to use. Even for some relatively complicated tasks.<p>We are hitting the limits of its capability. Which is when applications get complicated or end up with lots of code. The javascript you write in your tool is running inside many layers of retool javascription and encapsulation.<p>But at this point if we decide to move such an app out of Retool, then the business logic is already written.')
