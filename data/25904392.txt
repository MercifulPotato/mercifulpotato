At the time of the grant, you get nothing.  A year later, you get X&#x2F;Y dollars worth of stock.  Another year passes, and you get another X&#x2F;Y dollars worth of stock, and so on for Y years in total.  If at any time you leave the company, any stock that hasn&#x27;t vested disappears into the aether.<p>Sometimes, you&#x27;ll hear this described as &quot;golden handcuffs&quot;.  You get more money, but it is money that disappears if you ever leave the company, providing an incentive to stay.  This is, fundamentally, a wrong way to view the stock grants.  Instead, they should be seen as a temporary raise of X&#x2F;Y dollars per year, that expires after Y years.  The money isn&#x27;t yours until the stocks vest, and until that point is nothing more than a commitment to give you stock at a later point.')
