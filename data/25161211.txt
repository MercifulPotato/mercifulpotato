Of course the LED&#x27;s can last 100k hours.  Most last much longer.  The power supplies built into the lights will only last as long as they were designed to last.  There are a myriad of programs that can simulate and calculate how long the circuits powering the LED&#x27;s will last, based on component specifications, voltage, current and thermal dynamics.  If lights last a fraction of what was advertised, that is entirely by design.')
