We literally have more civilian owned guns than civilians.<p>Meanwhile in Germany it is estimated there are 5x as many people as civilian owned guns, and over 60% of the population wishes to increase restrictions on gun ownership.  The idea that you should want to own a gun to defend your home or person is nowhere in the national discourse.<p>When it comes to rape and violent crimes, Germany is more of the rule than the exception.  Europe is generally at similar rates to Germany.  The USA is an outlier.  Within the USA, areas with more of a historical honor culture (for example the South), have higher murder rates than areas without (like New England).  Internationally, all countries with murder rates above the USA&#x27;s also have a belief that it is your individual responsibility to defend yourself.<p>For a source of all of this, and more, read <i>Enlightenment Now</i>.  Seriously.  There is a very strong correlation, which is likely causative, behind violent crime rates and a belief that you are responsible for protecting yourself and your loved ones from a violent world.')
