It&#x27;s hard to know because there is so much politics involved that it&#x27;s hard to get a good read on my opinion.<p>Tax all meat, especially beef, based on the amount of &quot;pollution&quot;(carbon,water usage in low water areas, etc.) each &quot;unit&quot; of that meat takes.<p>At the same time, invest in nuclear. It works. There are now small nuclear stations being developed that are <i>allegedly</i> fallout proof.<p>Move to electric cars and as much electric power as we possibly can, powered by the nuclear(and to whatever extent we can, wind, hydro, solar).<p>We need to tax <i>bad</i> industries that are clearly causing us harm overall and use those taxes to fund startup costs for <i>viable</i> <i>good</i> industries like renewable energy. No reason it can&#x27;t be competitive IIRC, it&#x27;s just so behind in capital compared to fossil fuel.')
