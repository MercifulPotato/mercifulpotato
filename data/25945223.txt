Item(by='gintoki927', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611854781, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941431, text='What upsets me is the fact that selling isn&#x27;t halted. If only buying is halted, it&#x27;s obviously going to cause the stock to plummet. Retail investors who bought AMC, GameStop, Nokia, or Blackberry are going to fear losing a lot of money and sell. If everyone does that, the stock price decreases. It&#x27;s obvious manipulation in favor of hedge funds shorting the stocks. I really hope Robin Hood gets hit with a class action lawsuit. I don&#x27;t want to sound greedy because I&#x27;m losing money, but the way this is being dealt with is beyond unfair. Losing money for a stupid decision is fine by me, but joining a movement like this and having it shut down by force is absolute bullshit. How can hedge funds be allowed to manipulate the market but we can&#x27;t come together to fight them?')
