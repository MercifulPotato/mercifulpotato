It’s an illusion that holds most of the time, but nevertheless it isn’t real.<p>When the market is under stress, the illusion falters &amp; the plumbing starts poking through the gaps. If you want to be able to buy and sell shares with very fast confirmation at the prices quoted in the market then you need intermediaries who can extend the credit that enables that transaction to happen. When the market is under stress, that credit becomes more expensive &amp; liquidity falls away. This isn’t a conspiracy or the result of collusion, it’s a consequence of the structure of the market.')
