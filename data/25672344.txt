I work on this project.<p>Don&#x27;t worry, the breathing system does not rely on the Rasberry at all.<p>We use an electronic board that was made on purpose by a Medical company and relies on STM32 hardware.<p>This board sends telemetry to the Rasberry PI and we have a Rust based interface that shows charts and some controls.<p>If the Raspberry fails, the Firmware still run fine, and you can still change the settings on the machine using physical buttons and a LCD screen that is directly connected to the firmware')
