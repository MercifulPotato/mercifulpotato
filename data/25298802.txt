Where are the process node ahead chips from the competitors?</i><p>Not if you still don&#x27;t beat them cleanly. The end result is what matters. Also, being able to pay more than other people isn&#x27;t a technical feat.<p>&gt;<i>On top of that, it&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s own SoC design, it has its own GPU design and co-processors, tons of work into making speed optimizations all around (from the buses to memory handling), and came with a new OS release, a port to the new architecture, a bridge layer for iOS apps, and a perfectly capable x86 translation layer.</i><p>Half of that is software, which I didn&#x27;t mention, and the rest is par for the course. The buses and interconnects in a Zen chip are far superior, which you notice as better I&#x2F;O.<p>&gt;<i>Which mainstream PC chip in actual laptops&#x2F;desktops people use has unified memory and doesn&#x27;t use sockets&#x2F;DIMMS?</i><p>You didn&#x27;t mention Sockets&#x2F;DIMMS, but literally any AMD APU has unified memory, and use memory DIMMs. Seems like the best of both worlds to me. Just as good memory performance, and it&#x27;s upgradeable.<p>&gt;<i>That&#x27;s a moot point, since they still carry all the x86 baggage in microcode, since tons of bad decisions leading to things like Spectra. ARM doesn&#x27;t.</i><p>AMD is not affected by Spectre. ARM also uses speculative execution.')
