Maybe I&#x27;ve overestimated the impact of a ~13bn fund evaporating and breaking a clearing house and the liquidity crunch from all their leverage and the linked derivatives. Not sure what hedge fund leverage is these days. Surely it can&#x27;t be at 2008 levels. We know about Melvin, not sure about others in there.<p>As I interpret it, it&#x27;s not clear what institutions have exposure to these at-risk funds and their leverage who are still short GME, and this is what causes liquidity problems. Not 2008 level, but could be Fed intervention level.<p>The admin can bail out those funds for a trivial line item by taking on the RH user shares. If they don&#x27;t intervene, I&#x27;m suggesting this is the domino for a crunch.')
