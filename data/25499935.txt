Item(by='ntsplnkv2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608586858, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25497563, text='&gt; There are well-paying jobs that don&#x27;t require a university degree. Skilled trade jobs exist and are in high demand. Tech careers with IT, networking, software, and hardware exist for those that put in the time, whether that time is on school grounds or at home.<p>I knew someone would make this comment, they always do. The trades don&#x27;t pay nearly as well as you think you do, put enormous strain on the body, have bad hours, etc. Most tradesmen that make big money either work insane overtime, or own their own business because they&#x27;re the top 10% in their craft.<p>Also the idea that it&#x27;s like what it was when you grew up, where you just work hard in your support job and then you magically become software engineer and make big bucks simply doesn&#x27;t happen anymore. It&#x27;s like winning the lottery.<p>My grandfather made a great living in the trades. That is until he got cancer from exposure doing it.')
