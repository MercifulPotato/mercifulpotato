It&#x27;s simply impossible to &quot;hire 146 engineers&quot; within any reasonable time frame, let alone get them all organized in a way that you can manage them effectively (and don&#x27;t forget the project managers&#x2F;scrum masters&#x2F;etc that would need to be hired too). Deloitte, OTOH, has an entire existing business model based on taking vague business requirements and having huge teams of project managers&#x2F;developers&#x2F;consultants&#x2F;advisors&#x2F;etc ready to go at nearly a moments notice.<p>$44 million is an egregious number and I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s that high, but I&#x27;m betting at least part of it has to do with the fact that this was a website with an accelerated timeline, which probably necessitated a premium.')
