The Dem&#x27;s economic policies in recent years are stinkers. I don&#x27;t like the idea of raising taxes and creating new money-pit departments and thinking the government can fix stuff like education at the federal level. The idea of mandating people to purchase a healthcare product was also abhorrent. I&#x27;d much sooner get behind something like a single payer&#x2F;universal coverage and kill off the useless insurance industry.')
