If you really want to deeply understand something, it&#x27;s a whole process of connecting up existing facts and schemas in your brain. That happens more smoothly over time by processes like seeing metaphors. A good teaching metaphor always involves a description of how the metaphor fails. Learning from metaphors is not a weakness, nor is it the only plank to build a house of knowledge on. Eventually, you will need to understand the mechanics too, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with starting with metaphor, or examples, or visualizations, or interactive simulations, or any other teaching scaffold.<p>Also, don&#x27;t gatekeep the field, unless you have a citation that proves that modern teaching techniques have really led to a decrease in quality of software engineers. I really doubt you have any concrete measure you can point to that won&#x27;t be anecdotal, but if you have one I am interested in hearing why you think you can strongly believe that folks have gotten wore over time because we got better at teaching.')
