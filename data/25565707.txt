If you think anger can be managed, kept from the surface, have defenses constructed against it and the like, is that not more or less an informal meaning of &quot;eradicate&quot; what compared to how society casually sees anger?<p>There&#x27;s value in specificity but I think you jumped pretty quickly to &quot;delusional&quot; in response when as you&#x27;ve seen you both share a decent deal of middle ground. The questions that arise to me from reading this exchange:<p>1. At what point is anger &quot;practically&quot; removed from someone?<p>2. What methods can achieve that? Which are healthy to the longterm mental state of a human being?<p>Personally, my greatest tool against anger is understanding + my belief in determinism. You can&#x27;t be angry with a person for something they did not choose, and understanding how it happened leads to a larger issue or trend that you can then decide if it is worth spending time correcting or not. That understanding transforms anger into macro frustration, which I find is less harmful to others and I can constructively process into problem solving, which I find to be pretty healthy.<p>Did I literally eradicate my anger? Not even close. Does anyone see or experience anger as we practically recognize it? Nope! So in terms of the actual world we live in, I very much did remove anger from my actions.<p>My larger point here being that you have to bring practical readings to the table, even in the comments section of a philosophy piece :)')
