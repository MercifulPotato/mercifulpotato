To match the current block subsidy with the current block  size limit when miner subsidy runs out the average transaction fee will need to be &gt;$127.<p>$45mil daily revenue &#x2F; 350,000 txs per day<p>OR, you could increase the block size limit to 10mb, allowing 3.5mil txs per day, or 100mb allowing 35mil txs per day. Then the average fee paid per tx is significant lower.<p>The reason this was argued against by blockstream was because a bigger blocksize means more storage is needed by the miner and more txs means better hardware and bandwidth to process them, effectively pricing out normal people from running full nodes.<p>Essentially, the ability for normal people to send a transaction cheaply is being sacrificed so that normal people can setup a full node. Counter intuitive imo.')
