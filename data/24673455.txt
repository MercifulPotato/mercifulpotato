They work by reducing the other colors to balance with the reduced colors.<p>There are lots of reddish brown things that are actually red. I wear mine daily, but if I didnt, I wouldnt miss them.<p>With the glasses on I can see subtle red tints that I cant normally notice.  For whatever reason it doesnt help much with green.')
