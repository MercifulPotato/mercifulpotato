FOSS alternatives are for developers and power users that want a computer like someone wants a project car.<p>I say this as a happy Linux user at home. But I need to use Windows for work because of multiple programs that do not run on any other target. In school (this has changed a bit) I need to use Microsoft PowerPoint, Excel, and Word.
