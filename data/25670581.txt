It&#x27;s either those who do have enough money not to care about the cost or the so called aspiring ones: who don&#x27;t have money but want to fit in or relate to the better off groups. It reminds me when the latest Iphone came out( the most expensive version). Guess who bought it? Our CEO and a member of my team,who was probably on the lowest salary in the company.
