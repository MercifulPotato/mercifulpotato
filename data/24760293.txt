Like ~2% death rate is really really high for a flu but it&#x27;s not the black plague or anything. If you&#x27;re a young-ish healthy adult with a normal immune system then (statistically speaking) quarantine likely didn&#x27;t benefit you at all.<p>The thing that makes COVID novel is that it&#x27;s extremely contagious. Your part in quarantining is not spreading it to the more vulnerable&#x2F;unlucky people in your life.
