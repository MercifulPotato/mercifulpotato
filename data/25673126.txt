So somewhere someone has to be doing some deciding of who gets a platform. Protocols can&#x27;t magically solve that problem.<p>I think there is something to giving people options on what moderation they want distinct from having to limit who they can communicate to, but all of the current attempts at that don&#x27;t do a good enough job, they all offer technical solutions, but no <i>real</i> solutions.<p>What you really need is for one of these protocols to get a particular instance that does an amazing job of &quot;no nazis, no one telling you to die or that you shouldn&#x27;t have human rights&quot;, <i>while</i> giving you the room to move and remain on the protocol if the instance you are on starts to limit you or you start to disagree with the moderation.<p>Of course, this begs the question of who is going to be doing that moderation and why. <i>That&#x27;s</i> the hard part, not the decentralised platform.')
