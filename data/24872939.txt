Spamming undos in open files is fairly easy. If the editing ends up being a real fix, then you upstream it and install again. There&#x27;s also considerations about jump-to-definition and similar tools, etc.<p>You can&#x27;t accidentally commit your debugging (unplug edits package.json and there&#x27;s no replug command) and you don&#x27;t end up with 3 unplugged folders for the same package (that&#x27;s a whole can of worms on its own). There&#x27;s also some yarn 2 specific pitfalls regarding __dirname in local packages, symlinking semantics, etc.<p>Anyways, getting way too into the weeds here, I better stop now lol :)')
