Does a Visual Novel take 10 hours to beat, or 2 minutes? I&#x27;d argue the latter, but I know plenty of people would disagree with me.<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; says the webadmin, &quot;I&#x27;ll just implement a voting system and take the average&quot;. But now they&#x27;ll be claiming that it takes 5 hours and 1 minute to beat, which <i>everyone</i> disagrees with.<p>The best system I&#x27;ve seen is SteamHunters&#x27; &quot;Shortest&#x2F;Median&#x2F;Average&quot;, which gives you a pretty reliable indicator of what&#x27;s possible, what&#x27;s typical, and how much of a difference there is between optimal and casual play, respectively. It&#x27;s by far the most comprehensive dataset out there, but unfortunately only mono-platform so probably not too useful for sites like igdb.')
