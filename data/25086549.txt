She&#x27;s just saying that he won because of dirty tricks (voter suppression, intentional promulgation of falsehoods), which is plausible.  Certainly within the bounds of an opinion one could legitimately hold.<p>&gt; 66% of Democrats believe that Russia directly hacked and manipulated vote counts in the 2016 election<p>Sure.  A fair percentage of Democrats would probably say that they think that Trump is Satan incarnate.  That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that Democrats do in fact recognize the fact that Trump won the 2016 election.  Republicans by and large are not conceding that Biden has won the 2020 election.  (They also deny basic facts about climate change, COVID, etc.)')
