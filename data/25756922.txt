As I said, I do that myself with a pfSense firewall&#x2F;router into Unifi switches and APs with multiple VLANs and routing between them. I&#x27;ve also done it with an Edgerouter + Unifi switches and APs, and a Mikrotik router too. Of course the Unifi controller doesn&#x27;t control a non-Unifi router, but you can set up whatever VLAN arrangement you want in the Unifi controller and then set up your router to match and do whatever inter-VLAN routing you want separately in its own interface.<p>It is <i>not</i> all nicely integrated together if you use a separate router (obviously), but it&#x27;s not like it makes it impossible. It&#x27;s not even difficult... at least not any more than it would be in any other setup.')
