Use the last known good version, fix wat you need to, even if you are the only one person on earth interested in that piece of software. Maintain it. Or just find someone else who is doing it (that&#x27;s a &quot;fork&quot;).<p>I&#x27;ve stopped using a lot of proprietary software and apps due to this, though examples are fading from my memory. On Android, I think I can name at least ES file explorer and Touchpal that went down the Adware hole.<p>Nowadays I only use FLOSS. Not even GAPPS. OSMAnd (which I donate to) is pretty nice and featurefull, it suits me as a maps power user, but it can be a bit daunting. There used to be a maps.me fork on F-Droid, but it was recently removed: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;fdroid&#x2F;fdroiddata&#x2F;-&#x2F;merge_requests&#x2F;7951&#x2F;diffs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;fdroid&#x2F;fdroiddata&#x2F;-&#x2F;merge_requests&#x2F;7951&#x2F;d...</a><p>Looks like the maps.me community is reorganizing, and hopefully it will re-emerge stronger and more resilient that it was before. Also, lessons learned with this might be useful to other projects.<p>&gt; And who knows when the currently best fork will get taken over by the next wallet software huckster?<p>This is the reason why you should pick a project with strong guarantees: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;intro&#x2F;why_debian" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;intro&#x2F;why_debian</a> leads to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;devel&#x2F;constitution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;devel&#x2F;constitution</a>\nOnly running open source software is my way of making sure I can escape lock-in and always have a way out.')
