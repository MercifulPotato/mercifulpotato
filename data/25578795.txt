What you are doing should be a crime, and in many jurisdictions it is... some of them punishable by death.<p>You believe the penal experience is the same as &quot;doing nothing&quot;... not rehabilitating one&#x27;s self... not reflecting... just a pointless exercise.   Why not just slit their throats or gas them?  They were convicted of a crime after all, right?  &quot;Nothing&quot; isn&#x27;t a punishment, is it?  What&#x27;s the point?<p>You&#x27;re a monster who spreads disinformation, and after your profit McConnell repeals section 230, you&#x27;ll find yourself convicted and incarcerated soon enough.  Free living expenses though, right?  You&#x27;re welcome.')
