Right now the cost is still cheaper for most on land, that will change, especially if we move to new planets but definitely if we don&#x27;t due to population.<p>Necessity will fuel the innovation here and solar&#x2F;light innovation will be a big future industry.<p>Writing off vertical&#x2F;indoor farming is like writing off other fuel choices or EVs, until it happens everyone said it was impossible but necessity changes the impossible mainly due to changes in cost&#x2F;investment and returns, as well as new technologies made possible over time.<p>Lots of examples of successes already besides in marijuana. Essentially just green houses that can be stacked like modular farming.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interestingengineering.com&#x2F;13-vertical-farming-innovations-that-could-revolutionize-agriculture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interestingengineering.com&#x2F;13-vertical-farming-innov...</a>')
