If you expect your ethicists to prioritize having a stable career and avoid potential career-limiting moves, I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;re supposed to do their job. I would honestly be skeptical of a self-declared ethicist who&#x27;s very good at climbing corporate ladders and has never gotten themselves in trouble with those more powerful than them.<p>Whether she was overly saber-rattling is, I think, not a meaningful discussion. &quot;How could this ethicist have managed to keep her job&quot; is a straightforward and uninteresting question: don&#x27;t make any waves, don&#x27;t challenge anyone too senior, make the company look good in public. &quot;Does Google value talented AI ethicists who are genuinely committed to their work and are willing to sacrifice their career over it&quot; is a much more interesting question.<p>Google found that there was a credible allegation that Andy Rubin raped another employee, and they figured out how to keep him around for years, until word got out, because he was valuable to the company. (And then they gave him a $90M exit package.) Timnit Gebru got fired while she was on vacation for simply being impolitic. That shows how much Google valued her work.')
