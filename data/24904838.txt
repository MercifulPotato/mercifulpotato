I had no idea what was it about. I had never attended a &#x27;skeptics&#x27; conference before, only tech stuff. That night at the reception, I met all sorts of interesting characters.<p>Then this old guy with a cane came up, with a long beard like ZZ Top. I asked him &#x27;who are you&#x27;? and he said &#x27;I&#x27;m James. I&#x27;m a magician&#x27;. We chatted completely normally for like two minutes and we both moved on to other people. He was completely natural, absolutely not offended that I didn&#x27;t know who he was, even if he was the force behind the conference. He was genuinely interested in what were my reasons for attending and my personal story.<p>I did get to meet many of my heroes in person during those days, and I even scored some 1:1s with them, Richard Dawkins, Neil Degrass Tyson, Michael Shermer, Lawrence Krauss and Bill Nye. But after all this time, my fondest memories are those minutes with Mr. Randi. If I had to make an analogy, he&#x27;s the most Yoda-like person I&#x27;ve ever met.<p>His life will continue to be an inspiration many. Me included.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richard_Dawkins" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richard_Dawkins</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Amazing_Meeting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Amazing_Meeting</a>')
