Otherwise maybe sit back and consider exactly why it&#x27;s interesting that a professor of philosophy rattles off all of these biology facts in an attempt to back up the hilariously-bullshit utterances:<p>&gt; The fact that no species has evolved more than two biological sexes is also a puzzle. It would be quite straightforward to engineer a species that has three, but none has evolved naturally.<p>This is straight-up wrong, and he attempts to use the nomenclature of &quot;mating types&quot; to dismiss the obvious counterexamples. He&#x27;s attempting to be some sort of deep thinker about genetics, but he&#x27;s reaffirming the idea that somehow there&#x27;s only ever two sexes, which is literally binary gender theory and has already been debunked.')
