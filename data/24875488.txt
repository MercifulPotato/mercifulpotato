You might get a max output of &quot;$15&#x2F;MWh&quot; or &quot;$112&#x2F;MWh&quot; but that&#x27;s only a portion of the picture.<p>Firstly Nuclear is X amount of power essentially on tap 24&#x2F;7 where X is between some Min and Max value. From what I understand this makes grid management much simpler and reduces storage, transmission, and conversion losses. Even in the best case situation of &quot;renewable&quot; energy you&#x27;ll see, in the absolute best case claimed by pumped hydro storage, you&#x27;re seeing about an 87% efficiency.<p>Suppose you had a nuclear power plant that could output 100W consistently. Suppose you wanted to build a similarly efficient &quot;renewable&quot; energy source. How much more peak power would it need to output to be competitive? If we assume the power source is 0% efficient at night and 100% efficient during the day, off the bat, you&#x27;d need to generate 200W continuously during the day. Then you&#x27;d need to generate an extra 13% on those extra 100Ws to make up for storage losses (1.13*100 ~= 113). That means 100W from Nuclear is ~= 213W &quot;renewable&quot;. Obviously this is a terrible calculation and not at all accurate but it&#x27;s just a sample of some of the math that needs to be done.<p>Another factor that I&#x27;ve been skirting around is that &quot;renewable&quot; sources of energy are often not so renewable. Specifically things like like solar require a huge amount of rare metals &amp; complex fabrication. Right now none of those externalizations are represented in the price of solar because there are no carbon taxes in countries that manufacture them.<p>Money in this case is a proxy of what needs to be measured and should not be the only factor we optimize for.')
