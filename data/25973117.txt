You&#x27;re suggesting that, as a casino customer, you could say &quot;you can&#x27;t shut this table down! I was going to make back my money on the next hand!&quot; which is pretty funny.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is at all like a bank that won&#x27;t let you withdraw your money. I think it&#x27;s like a brokerage that has to post 100% collateral --- out of their money --- for every share of GME that you ask it to buy, doesn&#x27;t have the money to post that collateral, and thus can&#x27;t buy any more GME for you.')
