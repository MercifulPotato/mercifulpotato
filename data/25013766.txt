You clearly used a pattern (accumulator) with wich you are familiar.<p>Do you agree that most imperative programmers would not come up with this solution on their own, if you didn&#x27;t teach them the &quot;accumulator pattern&quot;?<p>For me personally a tutorial with a lot code like that would be interesting.<p>Showing me another version of a recursive descent parser doesn&#x27;t teach me anything, because I know how to write it (with recursion!!!) in an imperative language...')
