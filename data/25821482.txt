Item(by='wegs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610975883, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25820086, text='&quot;-I like to think of HR as an abstraction layer between management and employees, whose basic function is to shield management from having to interact with the employees.&quot;<p>This sounds cynical, but it&#x27;s not nefarious at all:<p>1) As a manager (at various points in my career), I have better things to focus my time on than sick policies, vacations, sick leave, or similar. I&#x27;d rather focus on mentorship, growth, strategy, and technology. Outsourcing the menial stuff to someone else means I can manage people better. Plus, they&#x27;re more likely to do it right. If I have a 16 year old intern who is a resident of Ohio working remotely whose parents are on an H1B visa who wants to do an unpaid work-sponsored training program beyond their 40 hour work week...<p>2) As a manager, I have no background in how to resolve legal issues. If an employee engaged in improper behavior (harassment, theft, etc.), the last thing you want are amateurs handling this. It&#x27;s a relief to offload that onto professionals, both for the manager (who doesn&#x27;t want the stress or liability) and the company (who doesn&#x27;t want the liability).<p>... and so on.<p>HR is the company&#x27;s agent. It&#x27;s not your friend. It&#x27;s job isn&#x27;t fairness, anonymity, or justice, but to protect the company. It&#x27;s still a necessary function and having it there is not evil, so long as employees don&#x27;t go in with the expectation HR is some impartial judge. It&#x27;s not. A lot of kids come in and treat it that way, and get into a lot of trouble.')
