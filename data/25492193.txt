To use my previous analogy: If a random person shows up to a physicist claiming to have invented anti-gravity, then they aren&#x27;t going to get much respect.<p>Similarly if someone claims that it&#x27;s a moral positive to walk into random people&#x27;s houses and murder their babies, I don&#x27;t have to respect that.')
