The ELF binaries generated need to declare themselves as FreeBSD binaries. A C compiler set up to produce Linux binaries won&#x27;t do that. Maybe also they depend on a specific compiler (FreeBSD is using clang lately). When you build FreeBSD you also build a compiler so maybe this part isn&#x27;t such a big deal.')
