(And - dare I ask - what does that then mean about your stance on the Nazi&#x27;s policies?)<p>What the Chinese allegedly did to the Uighurs, or what the Nazis did to the Jews, is categorically wrong regardless of how it was justified; nobody has the right to sterilise or kill innocent people. But it&#x27;s reasonable to argue that when a bunch of people come together to form a &quot;country&quot;, they have a right to decide who&#x27;s allowed to enter that country. Discriminating based on country of origin is not unpredecented: it&#x27;s already way harder for an Indian or Chinese to get an American visa, for instance.')
