Try to become well known for something else. Start a youtube channel on something unrelated to your business. It could be about cosplay, blacksmithing, or a million other things that are not obvious money makers and don&#x27;t need to be for you. I find that content creators work really hard but also find it extremely rewarding, and I think you&#x27;d find that it exercises different muscles that you aren&#x27;t used to.<p>I can think of so many things I&#x27;d try if I were wealthy. I&#x27;d produce a fantasy movie or TV show. I&#x27;d get my pilot license. I&#x27;d learn to sail and have a multimonth voyage. I&#x27;d setup my own creative studio to build practical effects for film and tv. I&#x27;d buy land and learn bushcraft on it and build a little castaway home using only the land.<p>None of these have anything to do with my career in tech. Do you not have anything similar for yourself?')
