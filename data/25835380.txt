Leveraging a strong position isnâ€™t and Amazon is a long ways from a monopoly.<p>That really depends on interpretation, which has shifted over time and continues to shift.  IIRC, recent interpretations of some types of anti-competitive behavior have been rather literal and required something very close to a literal monopoly, which has had the effect of neutering antitrust law in all but the most blatant of cases.<p>My understanding is that it&#x27;s arguable that it&#x27;s anti-competitive to leverage market share advantages more broadly (e.g. antitrust law could be used to constrain&#x2F;break-up a <i>duo</i>poly).')
