And you&#x27;re right, murdering a few members of Congress isn&#x27;t likely to just completely overturn the government. It&#x27;ll certainly continue to destabilize things though, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to try and explain why murdering members of Congress while they move to certify an election would be destabilizing to political processes but maybe I will judging by how this conversation is going.<p>I&#x27;m also not inventing the whole thing out of thin cloth. People were arrested with caches of firearms near the Capitol. There is video evidence of gallows being constructed out front. You&#x27;re ignoring reality to suggest these things never happened. These aren&#x27;t fake reports, these are some of the few indictments which have so far been unsealed. I don&#x27;t watch cable news, I don&#x27;t get all my news from blogs. I read court documents. I read actual statistics. Go read the real, raw data.<p>As for the cop, it seems like you&#x27;d also argue car accidents don&#x27;t kill people its the internal hemorrhaging that happens from completely unknown causes. Clearly the people beating the cop didn&#x27;t intend to cause him harm, that&#x27;s just how they say hello! You seriously think the protesters beating him with metal pipes didn&#x27;t intend to cause him harm and potentially kill him? Do you go around being friendly and start hitting people in the head with metal pipes?')
