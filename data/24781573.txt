How do they charge? How do you actually hear the audio when it doesn&#x27;t actually go in your ear? Since it doesn&#x27;t go in your ear, can someone next to you hear your audio -- is it private? What part swaps out? What&#x27;s the battery life? What&#x27;s the price? How much is the base price, and how much for each swappable part? Etc. etc. etc.<p>From the website alone (ignoring your HN title), I&#x27;d assume you haven&#x27;t made these yet and you&#x27;re just trying to gauge demand. But assuming you actually <i>have</i> made them... please show them off not just on the fashion side, but on the functionality side! Give us all the info please. :)')
