I get that I&#x27;m in the minority here, but I can make it on the leaderboard a lot of the time if I try. But trying to get on the leaderboard stresses me out and ruins the fun, so I instead do things like start a bit late to sabotage myself.<p>I still make it on the leaderboard sometimes if I get too excited about starting right away or if it&#x27;s a particularly hard problem and I get lucky figuring it out. That stresses me out a bit. I&#x27;d be happier if the leaderboard weren&#x27;t there.')
