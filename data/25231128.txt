I think another way to partition the world is into zero-sum and non-zero sum situations. In non-zero sum situations it&#x27;s more important to be correct than novel, but in zero-sum situations it&#x27;s important to be both correct and novel.<p>One example I like to think about is the following: imagine having two boxes (A and B), one on each side of a football field. Exactly one of the two boxes contains a million dollars: box A contains the prize with 99% probability and box B contains the prize with 1% probability.<p>Suppose you&#x27;re standing at the center of the field together with n other people and are told to race to get the million dollars (first person who finds it wins). You have to decide whether to run for box A or box B since they&#x27;re in opposite directions. If n = 0, it&#x27;s clearly in your best interest to go for box A, but as n grows, the probability of you getting to box A first drops since you&#x27;re competing with other people, meaning that at some point you ought to actually go for box B.<p>This is a toy example of where it&#x27;s not sufficient to be right, but it&#x27;s also important to be novel. If each person was awarded its contents (rather than just the first person to get there), there&#x27;d be no rush and you ought to go for box A. In other words: in zero-sum situations you need to be both right and novel, but in non-zero sum situations it&#x27;s sufficient to just be right.<p>I think the example of academia in the article is not quite right for two reasons. As pointed out elsewhere, the incentives in academia are actually quite twisted which means that there&#x27;s actually more incentive to just be verbose than to be novel, but additionally I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really zero-sum. It&#x27;s true that if you&#x27;re working in a crowded space, it starts approaching zero-sum and then becomes a game of novelty. However, if you&#x27;re not in a crowded space (e.g. interdisciplinary stuff) you can actually be quite successful by discovering rather mundane things (you might say that this is just being novel on a different axis, which I think is reasonably accurate, but the point made in the article was that the discoveries have to be surprising).')
