The problem with Apple is that a) it sells a lot and b) its product are probably the best ones.<p>But we can&#x27;t say there&#x27;s no alternative to Apple products - there are a lot. They&#x27;re just not as good as Apple&#x27;s.<p>Tesla is the best electric car. Is anybody thinking about splitting it up and claiming they&#x27;re anti-competition? Some few luxury car brands (BMW, Mercedes, Audi) command an awful lot of the high-end car market, and offer some features that cheap cars don&#x27;t have (e.g. Mercedes PRE-SAFE). Should they be split up?<p>A monopoly is something different. We wouldn&#x27;t blame Rolls Royce for making the &quot;best cars&quot; at the highest price level.<p>Of course, if Apple sold their phones for $50 and their M1 laptops for $300, there could be a case for pushing other solutions out of the market. But this is NOT going to happen; the cheapest Apple phone on the market (iPhone SE) is 2x the price of a decent midrange Android phone, and the cheapest Apple M1 laptop (MB Air) is 2x&#x2F;2.5x a cheap windows&#x2F;linux option.')
