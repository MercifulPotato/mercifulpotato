There might be some clues in the surrounding texts, but perhaps someone would need to train it specifically on similar (un-redacted) documents?<p>Also, the other way around, marking parts as viable-for-redaction and then having GPT3 generate text to fill in those gaps would be a really insidious way of redacting content. I&#x27;m guessing a GAN-type network could even generate the visuals that are appropriate to the document that has been redacted..')
