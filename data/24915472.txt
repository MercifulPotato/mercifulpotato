Lots of flexibility, much more stronger, cheaper, upgradable, etc. I&#x27;m already connecting my laptop to a display and mechanical keyboard and mouse. Specially now we work from home and probably continue doing so which I enjoy a lot, I can just put the laptop aside for rare cases I need a mobile computer.')
