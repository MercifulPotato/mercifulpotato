Many problems can be solved without a scalable solution&#x2F;product for a few customers. Hack together a presentable solution&#x2F;deliverable. Call it your beta program and do it for free.  Set KPIs and collect metrics on your successes. Leverage those successes as references. Now that you&#x27;ve used those successes to get some money and build a team start releasing versions of the solution and convert your beta users to paid customers at a discount and incentives them with more discounts for any new paying customers they can refer.
