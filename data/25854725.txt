Going from 1 murder to 2 murders is the same percentage change as 100 to 200, and in general they&#x27;re dealing with so few events that it&#x27;s hard to distinguish some meaningful change from expected variance.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not as easy to track but it&#x27;d be interesting to see if attempted murders saw the same spike. This increase could merely be a result of overtaxed hospitals saving fewer people.')
