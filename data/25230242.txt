Item(by='auganov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606495753, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25228274, text='&gt; Bryan Caplan in his book The Case Against Education suggests that employers value college degrees partly as a signal of conformism, and that that&#x27;s the reason college is so hard to replace.<p>Perhaps, but in high-skill fields most qualified people will be graduates regardless. Whatever you think of college degrees as an employer, most of your employees will have them.<p>It&#x27;s not entirely obvious demand for formal education is driven by the industry.<p>It&#x27;s tautologically true that college signals conformism since most  (in a given field) go. And companies may indeed use it as a signal for conformism (or lack of the opposite). But it doesn&#x27;t necessarily follow that the industry actively thinks college is uniquely good at creating this signal.')
