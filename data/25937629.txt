The same reason you don&#x27;t need global objects in an OO language is the reason you don&#x27;t need global data structures in an imperative or functional one.<p>Your Sword class doesn&#x27;t hold a reference to a NetState object, but then, my Sword struct doesn&#x27;t need a reference to a NetState struct, either.<p>If I were to climb the reference hierarchies back to my &#x27;main&#x27; function, I would find a common ancestor, just like in OO if I were to climb my reference hierarchies, I would get back to the class with my &#x27;main&#x27; method. But that doesn&#x27;t imply global state; it&#x27;s all scoped down in the code where I defined and use it.')
