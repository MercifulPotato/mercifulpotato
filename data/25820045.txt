Later you can work on parallelizing the process<p>For most meals I start the slowing-cooking item first and then start on the others once it is in the over &#x2F; pot or similar. E.g. a roast joint. I&#x27;ll get it in the oven and then prep the roasting veggies (e.g. potatoes and parsnips), get them in the oven and then start peeling the green veg (which only need cooking for a few minutes). Over the years I&#x27;ve learned how long things need and how long I take to prep them, so my timings usually work out.<p>Chinese cooking (or at least my take on it) is my main exception: given the short cooking times of some things, and the large number of ingredients &#x2F; dishes, I tend to prep everything first, and then start cooling simultaneously.<p>The other obvious exception is using my smoker, where a meal might stay in it for more than 5 hours. I say &#x27;meal&#x27; rather than &#x27;meat&#x27; because I also use the smoker to cook chilli and tagine.')
