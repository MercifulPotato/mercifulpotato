On Chromium, I launch, type in a site, hit enter, and wait and wait as it finishes <i>actually</i> starting up. FF takes longer to appear but is ready to browse as soon as it does. Or at least it did until some time in the last year or two, at which point it started taking a page out of Chromium&#x27;s book. But honestly, I don&#x27;t do cold starts that much so it doesn&#x27;t bother me much one way or another.')
