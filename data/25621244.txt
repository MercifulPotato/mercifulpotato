Maintainers are volunteers which are keeping up to date just few software packages. Leaders are choosing a general direction of a distro.<p>IMHO, something similar can be applied to science. Leaders can chose a general direction of a collection of papers, while maintainers will work on small areas, keeping them consistent and up to date with new research.<p>For example:<p>- LIGO&#x2F;VIRGO discovery of gravitational waves means that the speed of light in vacuum is not constant. It&#x27;s constant in &quot;steady&quot; vacuum only.<p>- Discovery of Higgs boson means that vacuum is not an empty space, because Higgs field is present everywhere.<p>These recent discoveries significantly changes the field of science, so a bunch of classic paper must be updated or discarded in favor of new ones.')
