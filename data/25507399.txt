Offer your digital goods packaged in a good service, and people will buy them (see: Netflix). Make it annoying to get your digital goods (through hostile &quot;anti-piracy&quot; software, bad UI, paltry device support, etc), and people will pirate instead.<p>I&#x27;d argue the current trend towards exclusives &#x2F; market fragmentation on video is one such example. Having to buy, then search through 5-6 different streaming services to get what I want is a form of friction, which is non-existent on pirate sites that have everything, for free.<p>The music industry has got it mostly right, IMO. There are a few players (Youtube Music, Spotify, Apple Music) but they all have mostly the same catalog. They compete on service, not catalog. I&#x27;d like to see a similar shift for TV &amp; movies, but it doesn&#x27;t look likely.')
