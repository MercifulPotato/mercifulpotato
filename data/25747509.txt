We shouldn&#x27;t let Facebook off the hook with just letting them delete inconvenient stuff.<p>We should press them till they pay for their great power by picking up the responsibility of education.<p>&gt; I can type out a hundred lies faster than you can fact check even one of them.<p>Yes, but you can&#x27;t convince people of so many new different stupid things at this rate. Novel lies are rarely the problem. Most dangerous lies are not new. There&#x27;s nothing new about antivaxxers for example. Trumpism works by the same rules that nazi propaganda worked. Snake oil. Flat earth.<p>How many new lies of this level of impact can you invent and publish and can you really do it faster than people can correct you if their voices are properly amplified?<p>&gt; Besides we’ve already seen that facts don’t matter to a lot of people. They don’t care if something is true or not anyways. All they care about is having their world views reaffirmed.<p>Facts don&#x27;t matter to them unless they understand them. Truth matters to them immensely. That&#x27;s why they hold the (wrong) beliefs they hold. They care about being right. What they lack is education in the form and on the level that could reach them. For some of them, providing them with it might be very hard. But you can&#x27;t give up and just censor whatever. It doesn&#x27;t work. It didn&#x27;t work. What works is education.')
