Item(by='function_seven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605661297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25131796, text='&gt; <i>It certainly is harder to rationalise caring very much about PredictIt when you notice that &quot;Trump NO&quot; (Donald Trump is not elected to be the next President of the United States of America) costs about 85¢ right now, even though he&#x27;s lost and the resolution will pay $1 for that 85¢ &quot;gamble&quot;.</i><p>I just tried to buy a bunch of these. When I clicked [Submit Offer], I got this message:<p><pre><code>    We have reached the maximum number\n    of traders on this contract.\n</code></pre>\nAll proxy markets are giving me the same message. (Will VP be a woman, EC vote margin in 60-99 bucket, etc.)<p>&gt; <i>But again, liquidity. That market is not very liquid, so you likely shouldn&#x27;t think too much of it.</i><p>Exactly. So this &quot;86¢&quot; appears to be totally meaningless now. If I can&#x27;t buy at that price, then anyone holding it can&#x27;t sell. There&#x27;s no action here.')
