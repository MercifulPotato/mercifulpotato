So youâ€™ve got your 60 hertz AC wave; 60 times a second the AC power flow is changing direction. And all of the generators, all of the power consumption within each zone is doing that synchronously. But the east is doing it on its own. The West is on a different phase. Same for Texas.<p>Folks may not realize that power is transmitted in three phases in the US. AC power is essentially a sin wave, and we use 3 different &#x27;phases&#x27;, which are just shifted sin waves so that we basically always have at least one phase providing power at any time.<p>Every generator hooked up to the grid must be synchronized to the same 60 hz phases. There are devices called &#x27;phasors&#x27; that assist in ensuring generators are lined up with the grid. And now there are networked versions to help coordinate across large regions.<p>But if two grids are on different phases, then there will be serious problems in connecting them together -- mostly that generators will be fighting against each other and potentially causing damage to things on the grid expecting clean 60hz power. It gets complicated pretty quickly.')
