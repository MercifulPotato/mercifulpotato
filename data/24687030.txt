It&#x27;s more accessible, the cars are all a lot closer in performance and nobody seems to run away with the points.<p>The problem?  The lack of straight line speed means you have to build smaller tracks and a lot of the drama of Formula 1 is missing.  You don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re watching the fastest cars in the world and it feels like a major compromise.  If you put those cars on a track built for current Formula 1 cars it&#x27;s going to be a complete snooze-fest.<p>What makes racing so attractive to fans is the perception (hopefully not that reality) that these drivers are defying death and&#x2F;or major injury in pursuit of victory.  Even if they&#x27;re relatively safe, the speed itself triggers the lizard brain inside all of us that keeps most of us from attempting to travel at 200+ MPH.')
