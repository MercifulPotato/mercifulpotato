I&#x27;m currently searching for a word for the rods, all trimmed to the same length Ã  la Procrustes, that constituted <i>fasces</i>, and will report back here if I manage to find it.<p>(a different motto, <i>unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno</i>, not only mentions the relation of the parts to the whole, but also that of whole to its parts: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24661326" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24661326</a> )<p>Edit: so far I&#x27;ve learned only that the axe was the <i>securis</i> and that holders of high office would have their servants put the <i>fascis</i> on the ground, instead of holding them aloft, when they wished to emphasise they were on the people&#x27;s side of an issue.
