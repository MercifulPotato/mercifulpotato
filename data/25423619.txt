Trace length is a marginal factor in memory performance&#x2F;latency, and having the memory on-package versus only slightly further away doesn&#x27;t mean much. I&#x27;m not sure exactly where the idea that having the memory on-package was so beneficial came from, especially considering the M1 actually has fairly poor memory latency (though within the expected normal range for LPDDR4X):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a><p>As far as HSA&#x2F;unified memory architecture, PCIe 4.0 has enough bandwidth to comfortably access main memory for applications that support it (and vice versa with GPU memory), although I imagine most high-performance GPU workloads will do better primarily operating on dedicated GPU memory (especially given that a single M1 core can already saturate the memory controller on its own).')
