I just did an upgrade this year to something way more current.  Using my old computer feels &#x27;sluggish&#x27;.  Last year this time I would have said the same as you about that same computer.  The new computer is from cold power off to useable desktop in under 5-10 seconds.  The old one was more like 60.  If the computer is serving your needs then there is no issue really.
