I think it could be possible in a scenario similar to that video game (Solid Snake?) where countries fight each other in highly mechanized&#x2F;autonomous fashion - limited loss of life, but high economic costs until one collapses. But yeah, probably more likely to be a cyber war or cold war scenario. Technically we are in a loose proxy war with Russia based on what&#x27;s going on in Syria.')
