Absolutely zero bullshit or bureaucracy surrounding that.<p>I hate few things more than self-obsessed incompetent circlejerkers in positions of power in large established bureaucracies. Institutions, governments and large corps are filled to the brim with these kinds of people. They can often talk a fair game but can&#x27;t execute.<p>Those are the true cults.<p>The whole startup and venture capital world attracts non-conformists and pace-makers by definition, and they&#x27;re goal is to create new cults or disrupt the old cults.')
