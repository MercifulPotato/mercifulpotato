There&#x27;s way too much fraud and useless crap (but &quot;World First Ultimate Crap&quot;).<p>Finally, it&#x27;s not _all_ bad.  The highlights: Klauf Light Bar (use them daily), Exploding Kittens (have played a few times), THIMBLEWEED PARK (love it), [Pocket]Chip, Nebia Shower, Kuroi Hana Knife Collection (use daily), Stingray Non-stick pan (use daily. Note, a 2nd campaign from the Kuroi Hana Knife people).')
