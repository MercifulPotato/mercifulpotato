We call that Java Disease.<p>Using C++ as a &quot;better C&quot; leaves almost all the potential benefit on the table, leaving you hardly more productive than you were in C. Coding C++ as C++, you can be worlds more productive, making the compiler do most of your work for you, and leaving the bugs behind in the code you didn&#x27;t need to write.')
