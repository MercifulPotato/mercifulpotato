Item(by='emptyparadise', descendants=None, kids=[25808704], score=None, time=1610865429, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808592, text='I like the premise of a single universal port but over the years it turned out to be kind of bullshit because there is no single &quot;USB Type C&quot; - there&#x27;s 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, USB4, Thunderbolt and god knows what else. There are all sorts of weird incompatible peripherals and even cables that at best will not work and at worst will fry your device. I like USB-C (whatever variety it is that allows for docks with display connectivity) as a docking port, but it failed to solve the connectivity problem otherwise - it&#x27;s the same mess of weird ports underneath, but now without the ability to quickly guess with a good degree of confidence if a device will work with your computer or not based on the port shape.<p>I think I&#x27;d much rather have both USB-C and standard USB-A&#x2F;HDMI&#x2F;SD card ports.')
