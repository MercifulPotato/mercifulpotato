I don&#x27;t mind that they&#x27;re wanting to share those views, but I wish I could follow just their subject matter content. And by the same token, it would also encourage people to be able to post those non-subject matter tweets, if they knew that people wouldn&#x27;t have to unfollow them if they preferred to avoid politics. Allowing people to choose to bifurcate what they follow a person for enhances the network, I think.<p>And I should say, it&#x27;s not even necessarily about politics. I&#x27;m not a huge sports fan, and in the same way, I would like to be able to unfollow posts about sports, etc of friends on Facebook.')
