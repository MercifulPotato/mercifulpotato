If the Pi would come with a similar book it would be fantastic.<p>Maybe there are other books that fill that niche for the Pi?<p>In general I find it very hard to get my kids coding (especially as their English isn&#x27;t good yet, and many languages don&#x27;t have German documentation). There are some fancy books, but it turns out there are a lot of details in coding that most books can&#x27;t cover.')
