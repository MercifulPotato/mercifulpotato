I guess that&#x27;s technically true (and eventually you do need to start), but I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people continue to code in very inefficient ways because they actually don&#x27;t know that a better way even exists.  If you&#x27;re not starting because you&#x27;re not done learning, you&#x27;re probably not doing it right, but if you&#x27;re done learning because you&#x27;ve started, you&#x27;re also not doing it right.')
