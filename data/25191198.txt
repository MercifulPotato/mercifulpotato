It played a significant role in inciting the April–July 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi.<p>Widely listened to by the general population, it projected hate propaganda against Tutsis, moderate Hutus, Belgians, and the United Nations mission UNAMIR. It is widely regarded by many Rwandan citizens (a view also shared and expressed by the UN war crimes tribunal) as having played a crucial role in creating the atmosphere of charged racial hostility that allowed the genocide to occur. A working paper published at Harvard University found that RTLM broadcasts were an important part of the process of mobilising the population, which complemented the mandatory Umuganda meetings.[2] RTLM has been described as &quot;radio genocide&quot;, &quot;death by radio&quot; and &quot;the soundtrack to genocide&quot;.[3]')
