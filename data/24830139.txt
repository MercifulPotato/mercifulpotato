As of July 2020, Discord had over 100-million monthly users. At last count, netsplit.de reports 360k IRC &quot;users&quot;. That&#x27;s not even 1% of the Discord user base and it&#x27;s shrinking every year. No new significant IRC communities have emerged in at least a decade because it&#x27;s a dying protocol while Discord adds millions of users every month. Yes, IRC is an alternative to Discord but it&#x27;s not a competitor (to Discord, or any other protocol) by any stretch of the imagination.')
