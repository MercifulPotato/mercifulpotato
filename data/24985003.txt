(Here&#x27;s a 5-min video tour [2] of it if you&#x27;re interested.)<p>Despite all that they were quite proud of their a massive inventory of paper from all over the world and testing they did with it. This included environmental (humidity&#x2F;temp) testing after acclimatizing the paper for several days. They even went out of their way to get paper mills to custom create some of the crappiest papers they&#x27;d run across. I think the explanation was basically poor quality, rough paper leaves particles all over everything and causes rollers, drums etc to wear out faster.<p>Depending on your usage, it&#x27;s at least worth considering when you&#x27;re buying paper and looking at saving a few dollars on the cheaper stuff.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;garage.hp.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;business&#x2F;boise-test-lab-hp-printers.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;garage.hp.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;business&#x2F;boise-test-lab-hp-print...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;242827801&#x2F;8322d83960" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;242827801&#x2F;8322d83960</a>')
