If you MRI cab drivers their brains are slightly different. Evolutionarily it makes sense why direction would be particularly important.<p>My dad drove a cab in grad school to pay the bills, and even now his sense of direction (which should be relatively close since we share genetics) is relatively absurd; stuff like “I drove past this place 7 years ago I remembered it was a left turn here”.<p>So we might be slightly off track with the GPS example.')
