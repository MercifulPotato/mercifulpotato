I would agree if you limited your claim to hard science--areas where we can nail down the best theory by lots of data and controlled experiments--but many areas that are called &quot;science&quot; are not amenable to that.<p><i>&gt; by the very nature of us speaking about it, it can&#x27;t be an existential crisis</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree with that either.<p><i>&gt; I believe we as society need to come back to a view of seeing science as a general good, without the need to produce some immediate measurable outcomes</i><p>I agree with this, but I would also add that science should be viewed as a tool for finding good predictive theories, <i>no matter what those theories end up predicting</i>. Unfortunately much funding of science now is given with the expectation that a particular kind of result will be what &quot;science&quot; predicts.')
