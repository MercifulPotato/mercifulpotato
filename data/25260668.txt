It took more than 3 years of evenings and weekends to get something worth releasing.<p>I&#x27;ve also worked on forms with a rule engine for nearly 3 years almost full-time (started in 2017). It&#x27;s a hard problem. There are some commercial no-code and low-code solutions.<p>For forms with a rule engine you really want to have some debugger included that visualizes the data flow. Somehow people think one just has to author rules and then it&#x27;s finished. And errors never happen.<p>I take a lot of inspiration by the work of Chris Granger, Bret Victor, and the &quot;Future of Coding&quot; community. But also the UI&#x2F;UX of Notion and ObservableHQ.<p><i></i>Edit:<i></i> Fix typos.')
