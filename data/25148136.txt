I&#x27;ve been using Tailwind one a medium-large solo project and I can confidently say the whole project is MUCH better designed than it would have been without Tailwind, while still looking very custom.<p>Tailwind is not the one true way to do CSS, but it saves me from myself. I think of Tailwind vs Regular CSS how I think about TypeScript vs Regular JS. I <i>could</i> do everything and more in JS, but I&#x27;d make so many more mistakes along the way.')
