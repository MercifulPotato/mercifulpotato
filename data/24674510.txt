Item(by='notafraudster', descendants=None, kids=[24674683], score=None, time=1601757519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24674449, text='RE #2:<p>(First, thanks for everything!)<p>Our regular routine at the time: Imagine production and dev are even. We add 5 regular commits to dev. We PR merge dev -&gt; production. We do not do squash and merge. We do not delete dev. Dev and master are now even but master has the merge commit as well.<p>Flash forward several years. Looking at history, we now see each of those 5 commits for a run of about a year appear multiple times (at the peak, 5 times). The exact same commit, same commit message, etc. This is supposed to be impossible with git and we don&#x27;t know what caused it, but assume that it was a user error either trying to resolve #1 or just by people who didn&#x27;t know how to merge merging. Whatever error caused it clearly occurred a few times because for a while the commits appear 5 times, then 4, then 3, then 2, then back to normal, so I suspect whatever the cause, it happened 4 times, duplicating a range of commits each time.<p>We&#x27;d like to go back and de-duplicate, keeping the whole history that led us to now but only having 1 of every commit. I don&#x27;t fully care about branch history. I just care about blame and about commit counts for all the people who worked on the project. I am fine with the commit counts falling with the duplicate commits removed, but just not falling to 0 like it would if we started from scratch.<p>We are not worried about local copies (it&#x27;s a collaborators-only repo that there&#x27;d be no reason for uninvolved people to fork) and right now we have no collaborators since the project is grant funded and we don&#x27;t have an active grant.<p>That&#x27;s half the reason I&#x27;m trying to clean up these nuisance issues now before other people are involved again.')
