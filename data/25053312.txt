China&#x27;s economy is so large because of its status as an exporter. If countries stop importing it loses much of that status.<p>And again with leaving the US out - do you live in a world where the US doesn&#x27;t exist?<p>&gt; India is simply not that big of a challenger. It is counterbalanced by Pakistan, and has swathes of internal problems, as well as a dysfunctional economy.<p>&quot;nation has problems, more at 11.&quot; Every nation has problems. So what?<p>India on its own isn&#x27;t a 1 to 1 challenger. So what? Your point is irrelevant - India ISNT a 1 to 1 challenger. You rely too much on the strawman.')
