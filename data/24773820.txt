The really good thing about Gatsby is that it makes moving between pages more efficient because it only downloads the content that changes and then it leverages React to seamlessly transition the parts that change when you move from one page to another. It does that really well. The problem is that a lot of websites that use Gatsby are blogs, and that&#x27;s not how people read at blogs; most of the time people go straight to a page from Google, and then go back to Google after they&#x27;ve read that page. They don&#x27;t move around the website. All that JS to make that happen nicely does nothing.<p>That&#x27;s certainly the experience I had when my website was Gatsby based. I was sending people a chunk of JS that that just didn&#x27;t benefit from. If Gatsby suits your visitor model then it&#x27;s a great tech choice, but I found that something <i>even more</i> static (11ty in my case) worked better for people who came to my website.<p>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, I get 4 100s in Lighthouse. :)')
