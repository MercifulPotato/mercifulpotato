Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605660641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25123187, text='<i>&gt; Police officer isnâ€™t even top 10 dangerous job in this country.</i><p>Overall, no. But the overall averages conceal a <i>huge</i> variation in risk by locality. I agree that &quot;it&#x27;s a dangerous job&quot; doesn&#x27;t excuse shooting innocent people or their pets. But the danger of the job in particular localities should not be underestimated.<p><i>&gt; Changing their mentality from a warrior to a guardian also does wonders in lowering use of force.</i><p>Can you give specific examples? I agree with the general idea but I have not seen much actual data on specific localities where this is done or what effect it has.<p><i>&gt; almost half the country think those who got shot by police probably deserved it</i><p>Citation needed.<p><i>&gt; Almost the same crowd protests wearing masks as stepping on their liberties.</i><p>The protest is not against wearing masks where it makes sense to do so; it&#x27;s against being ordered to wear masks whether it makes sense or not, and subjecting people to criminal penalties for non-compliance. For example, according to some orders (fortunately for me, not the one currently in effect where I live), you are subject to arrest for simply walking out your front door without a mask on, even if you remain on your own property and nobody else comes anywhere near you.<p>And don&#x27;t forget that the same cops whose corruption and lack of judgment you and I both deplore will be the ones to enforce these orders. Frankly, it strikes <i>me</i> as illogical for people to be talking about defunding the police on the grounds of corruption on the one hand, and talking about issuing draconian orders that would have to be enforced by those same police on the other.')
