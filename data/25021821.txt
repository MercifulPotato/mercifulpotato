From Apple&#x27;s perspective, this sort of precedent could lead to entire app ecosystems bypassing the app store via streaming. It would be a workaround to Apple&#x27;s refusal to allow third party stores on iOS. The same risk doesn&#x27;t apply to more constrained and static content like video, books, and music.<p>I feel its important to mention that the issue is not quite as clear cut as this, since we have interactive Netflix movies and an ecosystem of web-based apps via Safari, but this seems to be Apple&#x27;s rationale.')
