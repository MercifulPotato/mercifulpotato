The &quot;devil is in the details&quot; with respect to the UX for these kinds of tools. The visualization or 2D image by itself is somewhat less useful without being able to snap to the corresponding part of the hex or IDA&#x2F;Ghidra disassembly.<p>I do think adding a 3rd dimension to the visualization probably adds somewhat more utility as well. The recently released open source package for CantorDust seems to omit the 3D visualizations which were shown in the demo linked here.')
