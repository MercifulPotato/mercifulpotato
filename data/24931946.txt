Everyone that I know of in consulting or freelancing is actively approaching people, drumming up conversations and trying to find things that they can help with to get their foot in the door. Once you&#x27;ve delivered on some projects with those clients, then they&#x27;ll typically start coming back and asking for more, but it&#x27;s not realistic to think that you&#x27;ll get people cold-calling you asking for your services simply because you talked to them on LinkedIn for 10 minutes.')
