I understand it didn&#x27;t work out perfectly, but I don&#x27;t really understand why they are getting so much flak for it. I&#x27;d much rather have a bunch of cables and devices that at least try to meet an official spec than to have a bunch of proprietary implementations that make no effort at being compatible.')
