The campaign that was launched by the same spin doctors that launched tobacco companies&#x27; disinformation campaigns.<p>They were very clear on how they did this, and it&#x27;s been amply documented in the media, just not super well known still, somehow.<p>They tied climate change denial to a political identity, because politics is how we turn off the rational part of our brain and activate the tribal defense mechanisms. Get your tribe to attack media vehemently anytime climate change is in the media. It makes news editors very nervous about covering the topic, because of the extremely virulent attacks. Even to this day, the media avoids bringing up climate change on relevant topics because they are scared of political blowback. This is the sort of &quot;political correctness&quot; that ends up harming society greatly.')
