We&#x27;re talking about mature codebases. Rewriting it again in C would also give you a chance to start fresh with better tooling, lessons learned, paying back tech debt, etc. Even still, you&#x27;re going to introduce new bugs in the process. You might fix a few hard-to-address architectural issues, but all of the other bugs would be easier to fix in the original codebase than by rewriting the whole thing.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that a rewrite is never justified, but rather that the argument that we should rewrite in Rust simply to avoid bugs has little weight.')
