The first spurt changed over in 1582, and was exclusively Catholic countries. Most of Protestant Europe then changed in 1700, in a second spurt. The third spurt was the Anglosphere, switching in 1752, and Sweden, switching for good in 1753. The final spurt was Orthodox countries changing over during and after World War I.<p>There is an additional wrinkle to comment on, which is that not every country started their year on January 1. And when a country changed their year start to January 1 is often not the same as when they changed from Julian to Gregorian.<p>In the absence of more specific information, it is usual to assume that an unlabeled calendar reference is a Julian date reference (starting on January 1) until October 4, 1582 and a Gregorian date reference from October 15, 1582 onwards, with October 5-14, 1582 not existing. It should be noted that this calendar does not correspond to any actual calendar used by any polity in actual history that I am aware of, but it would tend to be less confusing than actual historical calendars.')
