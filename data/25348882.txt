Nor that RHEL doesn&#x27;t release sources anymore?<p>If that&#x27;s true, I wonder how Oracle got some of their 8.x releases out much earlier than CentOS. (Oracle Linux 8.3 2020-11-13 vs CentOS 8.3 2020-12-08, Oracle Linux 8.0 2019-07-19 vs CentOS 8.0 2019-09-24.) I&#x27;m assuming here without verification that both track the RHEL 8 point releases.')
