You aren&#x27;t a mental health expert. I have seen more than a couple of people come back from the edge because of medications. We use pills for other issues like heart disease, diabetes, etc and people live a relatively normal life. The brain is just an organ. Sure some people would be better off without medication, but lots more would be dead or locked up in a mental institution. Lots of people have chemical imbalances and no matter how much &quot;lie back and tell me your problems&quot; they get they will never be well. Are medications over-prescribed I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true in some cases as well.')
