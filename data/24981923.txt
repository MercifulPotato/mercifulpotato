Item(by='mkingston', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604425383, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24978391, text='Yes, that is definitely how it should be. Unfortunately the normal state of affairs is not the state of affairs in much of suburban New Zealand. I left Auckland eight years ago, and at the time rent was cheaper than mortgage payments with a ~20% deposit. The housing market is speculative, profits are on capital gains, which until recently were untaxed on land, and still &quot;enjoy&quot; exemptions. I understand for example, that if one holds a property for more than five years, it becomes exempt from capital gains tax. This seems far too easy a loophole to exploit. I suspect, although I&#x27;m not certain these days, that there is also a considerable supply problem driven in part by (1) the Christchurch earthquakes (2) a subsequent reassessment of building safety in Wellington resulting in many buildings being deemed unsafe and consequently closed (3) zoning policies.')
