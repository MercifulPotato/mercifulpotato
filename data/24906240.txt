It has no autocompletion yet [0], and you cannot copy-and-paste code in it like IPython and Julia&#x27;s REPL, as it does not respect the original indentation. (Tried to copy-and-paste the first example in Nim&#x27;s webpage [1] and it failed because it inserted indentation at wrong places.) For the record, IPython has the `%paste` command, and Julia&#x27;s REPL automatically detects when code is being pasted (this would however be less relevant, since Julia&#x27;s language is not indent-based).<p>I am not sure if it supports plotting libraries Ã  la matplotlib, however. If it has this capability, it might be still interesting in its present state.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;inim-repl&#x2F;INim&#x2F;issues&#x2F;14" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;inim-repl&#x2F;INim&#x2F;issues&#x2F;14</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;</a>')
