That&#x27;s the point being made. I think the sentiment that Biden (or any other Democrat) will not act because of some associated guilt or support of past Democrat decisions, idiotic. He will not get pardoned because the media (and public at large) don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an issue that is more motivating than other hot-button issues. If there&#x27;s enough public support, I would be more ready to believe the needle will move under a D than an R.')
