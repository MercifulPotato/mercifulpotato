They know that the world is watching, and this is a big marketing opportunity. They will make a profit, but long term goodwill is more valuable than any profit they could make selling to billionaires, so I doubt anything will go to auction.<p>The hospitals treating Saudi princes are real hospitals. So they can win auctions if it comes down to that, because they are invited to them while the rest of the black market isn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t think real vaccines will come to auction though.<p>There is one thing left: vaccines that have approval issues. Any vaccine that is somewhat effective by not enough (The Oxford vaccine at 65% efficiency is questionable). The Russian vaccine. Any of many that haven&#x27;t started phase 3 trails yet. Any vaccine that has safety issues. All are candidates for someone to &quot;leak&quot; to the underground. You will have to consider the risks, but it might be worth it to get it now and then in a year when the better vaccines come to you get that too.')
