Loving the initiative, he told Richard to prepare a presentation, and he set a meeting in 2 weeks time.<p>So he didn&#x27;t really just walk in like the title implies. Still it&#x27;s a remarkable journey. It invokes a certain nostalgia about a past where anyone could move up through the social&#x2F;corporate ladder and if that is still the case. Personally, I wonder if that time really ever existed or if these are 1&#x2F;million changes of luck.')
