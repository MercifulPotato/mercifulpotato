Googling it it appears that the author means that Substack is “bland”, is that a correct interpretation?<p>Anyway, I found the article very uninsteresting. A lot of words and intellectual quotes to justify their reasons to prefer blogs than paid newsletters, while specifically targeting one company (while paid newsletter is larger than just Substack).   I left the reading without learning anything interesting. A quite milquetoast reading if you will.')
