The type just provides some help for normalising and converting them to and from their canonical form.<p>The only DB I know of with actual UUID optimisations is MS SQL, and that would be a bit of a trap, because its optimisation is to re-order the bits so the timestamp part of a classic UUID is at the front when it&#x27;s stored...which means trying to store a ULID as a UUID in MS SQL would actually be <i>slower</i> than storing it as plain byes.')
