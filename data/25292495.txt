It doesn&#x27;t go up from 1&#x2F;24 to 1&#x2F;165, it goes from 2.5&#x2F;24 to 2.5&#x2F;165.<p>Computer software waits a lot more than it did in 1977. That&#x27;s why 240hz displays feel much more snappier even if it&#x27;s supposed to be less noticeable -- you&#x27;re waiting for same 3 frames, but they pass by much faster.')
