Item(by='coder543', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604077659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944304, text='&gt; why not just ignore it then?<p>Because it&#x27;s misleading and&#x2F;or missing the point. As stated. Why would I want more people to read something that I believe is misleading?<p>&gt; Clearly it&#x27;s not &quot;fine&quot;<p>Once again missing the point. The prevailing opinion on HN is what will get upvoted, and a lot of other stuff will get downvoted. I have seen that prevailing opinion be <i>hilariously wrong</i> before.<p>If you want to be heard with an unpopular opinion, you have to make a compelling argument... you can&#x27;t expect to be upvoted to the top just because you&#x27;re sharing an opinion. It&#x27;s rare for a comment to be lukewarm enough for <i>no one</i> to feel strongly enough to downvote it. It&#x27;s going up, going down, or it&#x27;s on a thread no one is reading. Downvotes don&#x27;t mean people hate the person leaving the downvoted comments; it&#x27;s just a tool for disagreeing with comments.<p>&gt; This is my last comment on HN.<p>Because people disagreed with you? People even left explanations, but that wasn&#x27;t enough.')
