I don&#x27;t know Python well so I can&#x27;t speak to it.<p>My working theory: each language does modules in a different way. People think &quot;Oh, a module system, I know this&quot; and then run into issues when it works differently than their language. Just a theory though, I have not been able to validate it, or to figure out an explanation that works for all people.<p>And yes, more generally: as Rust continues to grow, more and more people will hit more and more edge cases, and they cannot always be fixed, thanks to being backwards compatible. That&#x27;s just how things are as they grow up. More and more users also brings more and more use cases. It&#x27;s a feedback loop.')
