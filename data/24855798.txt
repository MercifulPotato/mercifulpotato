I asked some SWE friends of mine who told me that they didn&#x27;t take it seriously due to the wide prevalence of _brain dumps_ all over the Internet. A few said having it on your resume may actually <i>hurt</i> their careers or job-seeking because potential employers who were on-the-ball took a dim view of them because they were so easy to obtain, so and automatically assumed anyone who advertised the fact they had one when they already had a degree in CS and&#x2F;or good industrial experience at the very least had misplaced priorities (so I guess if you have it as a single line-item on your resume in 9pt text buried at the bottom that&#x27;s okay, just don&#x27;t make it a heading).<p>What&#x27;s amusing to me is that after working at Microsoft in Redmond for a few years at the start of my career as an FTE SE in DevDiv - I didn&#x27;t know anyone who had such a certificate. If no-one needed one to work <i>at</i> Microsoft on the very tools these certificates are for, what&#x27;s the point?')
