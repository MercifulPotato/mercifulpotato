Is there a trick to that?<p>Not sure how the magic mouse works, but there&#x27;s &quot;drag hold&quot; on the trackpad. You &quot;double tap and hold&quot;. Tap once, and on the second tap you don&#x27;t lift your finger off the trackpad, but start moving it around.<p>Conveniently located <i>outside</i> the trackpad settings, in Settings -&gt; Accessibility -&gt; Pointer control -&gt; Trackpad options -&gt; Enable dragging. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;oSrPyDB" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;oSrPyDB</a><p>You may have to activate tapping (as opposed to pressing the trackpad).<p>&quot;Without drag lock&quot; actually does lock, but only for a short time. &quot;With&quot; locks until you click again. &quot;Three finger&quot; is new to me, never tried it.<p>edit: screenshot')
