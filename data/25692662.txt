I suspect the actual reason for banning him is for hundreds of tweets he made during the last four years for which a normal user would be banned, but he was protected against banning for &quot;public interest&quot; (read: additional traffic to Twitter). These two tweets are just a lame excuse. It would be better if they were honest about the reasons for the ban. But let&#x27;s be real - no matter what he tweeted now at the end of his presidency he would be banned on Jan 20th. They just sped up the decision a little bit because of what happened few days ago.')
