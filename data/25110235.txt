On linux reaper works fine with zero config with my steinberg audio interface, and a 2 input behringer mini audio interface as well.  The only thing stopping me from installing debian on my thinkpad is the difficulty with connecting MIDI devices in Reaper, and maybe that the VST setup needs messing with WINE.  Other than that, the linux experience is vastly superior and lower friction for me.  WST makes using windows at all viable for me.  It&#x27;s much nicer than when I looked at running windows last which was admittedly &gt; 15 years ago.')
