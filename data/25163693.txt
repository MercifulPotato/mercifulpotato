I have a rpi4 for a small home-automation project that I haven&#x27;t really started.<p>If anyone knows of an alternative that&#x27;s in the $100 (US) price range, runs linux, and will make my life easier, I&#x27;m grateful for suggestions.<p>Oh, and it needs to play nicely with a USB-to-ZWave dongle and one of the major open-source home-automation packages that can do lighting controls.<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention that I want it to reside in a closet that has very little ventilation. So I&#x27;d be leery of deploying a cheap used x86 system, even if the price way right.<p>EDIT2: Holy crap I&#x27;m being high-maintenance here. I should just do a damn Google search like everyone else.')
