I found WSB through a random comment of yours about Tesla&#x2F;WSB in January 2020, read a lot about options, liquidated my portfolio in February, bought puts on SPX and DAX and made €400k after taxes in a few weeks.<p>It&#x27;s kind of crazy that your random comment on HN lead me down this path. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a reader of HN since 2008 or so – exposure to randomness ;)')
