What real evidence of fraud is there?<p>&quot;Trumps moral compass seems far better than the shifty and obstructionist Georgia Secretary of State&quot;<p>I never commented on the Georgia Secretary of State&#x27;s conduct and frankly, that&#x27;s not under review. If the President had just asked for the review of votes, that would be fine. Instead, we received the exact number of votes that he needed, statements to the tunes of: &#x27;Fellas, what are we gonna do here? I only need 11,000 votes&#x27; and to do &#x27;the review with people who want to find solutions but not with those who do not want solutions&#x27; or something to that effect. Claiming that someone stuffed ballot boxes does not constitute evidence.<p>Furthermore, this does not change my comments about the pardons either but that&#x27;s not really the point under discussion.')
