You can comment&amp;like a pic&#x2F;prompt that the other person will see\n2. Girls can &#x27;invite you&#x27; to initiate the conversation<p>Ultimately the types of girls to use bumble in my college, home town, and when traveling aligned with the types of girls I like. I know hinge is super popular in major cities like LA&#x2F;NYC. But in the suburbs of SoCal 90%ish of hinge girls seemed socially awkward and I did not find their pics&#x2F;writing prompts attractive.<p>Yeah girls do tend to drop &#x27;hi! :)&#x27; on bumble. You just have to be clever when responding to it. I treat it as she is signaling me to make the &#x27;opening move&#x27; which sets the tone of the whole conversation.<p>You can always unmatch (on any dating app) if the conversation stales.
