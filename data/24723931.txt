We need to better articulate why disassociating from emotions isn&#x27;t better because simply pointing out that the child&#x27;s emotional needs aren&#x27;t being met doesn&#x27;t mean anything when emotional disassociation is truth to these people raised in these institutions.<p>(just to be entirely clear, I agree with you wholeheartedly, big picture we just need to understand where the person you&#x27;re replying to might be coming from in order to articulate an argument that has some meaning to the other individual)')
