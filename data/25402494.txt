Sorry if my above comment was dismissive and callous. Honestly, it is kind of sad as a society, that&#x27;s what ends up being valued more highly.<p>&gt;knowing that a girl could rely on her beauty to makes thousands of dollars exposing herself to strangers.<p>That&#x27;s not really anything new. Such things have always existed.<p>To be honest, my comment was mainly in reference to the business model itself. It&#x27;s hard to compare a salary or wage with lots of money from donations or subscriptions.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s people on onlyfans that make barely anything and there&#x27;s lots of software engineers with high paying jobs.<p>&gt;Damn it, I have a two year old niece, I guess me and my brother better think something fast, so when shes a teenager she&#x27;ll be interested in STEM.<p>I dunno, teach her self respect and explain the value in success using ones talents and abilities as opposed to exploiting their appearance or bodies.<p>There&#x27;s always been the option for girls to do the second one. I&#x27;m glad your teacher and people like her are trying hard to give girls more options like the first.')
