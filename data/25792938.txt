More of my contacts have joined Signal in the last week than they had in the last year. I&#x27;d be surprised if any of them were ex-Parler users.<p>Parler was pretty much the antithesis of end to end encrypted and secure, and Signal serves a very different purpose to Parler. From what I&#x27;ve seen on Parler, their average user would dismiss Signal as being produced by commies and therefore evil, due to its Open Source license.')
