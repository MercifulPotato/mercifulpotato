Basically, a fitness metric. With Chess, you have the obvious win&#x2F;loss metric, and also number of turns and possibly time. With math, how do you quantify the level of interestingness between 2+2=4 and p=np?<p>This isn&#x27;t a snarky question, by the way. I&#x27;m genuinely interested in how this might be done.')
