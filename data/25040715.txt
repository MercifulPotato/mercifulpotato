It&#x27;s the additional hardware that becomes a problem: QEMU&#x2F;libvirt hardcodes its hard drive model to include the word &quot;QEMU&quot; (although there is an unmerged patch to make that configurable), and although I don&#x27;t know how graphics work in a VM, it&#x27;s far easier to create a higher-level graphics device than e.g. emulating Intel graphics.')
