Item(by='meowface', descendants=None, kids=[24936937], score=None, time=1604010360, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24935080, text='I don&#x27;t agree at all. Quoting another comment I made:<p>&gt;For example, here&#x27;s a screenshot of a few of the emails in question: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;XNQarwF.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;XNQarwF.png</a><p>&gt;Is this a smoking gun of corruption of any sort? Obviously not. But could it raise some questions, before an important election? It could. If someone had completely fabricated this email, in my opinion almost any rational person would, at least once, somewhere, say or write that it was absolutely completely fabricated.<p>&gt;Additionally, someone on this exact email thread corroborates that the email thread is all real, and claims that &quot;H&quot; is Hunter Biden and &quot;the big guy&quot; is Joe Biden, which seems plausible given the email context.<p>The smartest move, if they&#x27;re true, is to be silent. The smartest move, if even a single email is doctored, is to protest that it&#x27;s fake.<p>There&#x27;s already been tons of reporting in non-left-aligned media about the emails and the fact that his silence is suggestive of them being real. If he were to deny it, the very little bit of reporting that NYT etc. did about it, suggesting it&#x27;s likely disinformation, likely from Russia, could be even more strong with its claims that it&#x27;s total bullshit.<p>Combined with the corroboration of the person in that email thread, and the fact there isn&#x27;t anything that interesting in the emails (why doctor something so boring? like with the DNC emails hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence), I&#x27;m happy to bet money with you that they&#x27;ll be proven to be legitimate within a few months. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s proven at all, but I think it&#x27;s more likely than not.')
