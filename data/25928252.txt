There seems to be many reasons to dislike the company, even as a happy customer.<p>One thing that stuck with me is this:<p>&quot;The IKEA group has a complex corporate structure, which members of the European Parliament have alleged was designed to avoid over €1 billion in tax payments over the 2009–2014 period.&quot;<p>It seems easy to sell cheaper if you just pay less taxes.<p>I&#x27;m not hating IKEA, but it&#x27;s obviously not black or white.')
