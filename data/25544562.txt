If the flight is outside the rules, you submit the paperwork and wait for a response. I&#x27;ve done this 5 times the last year and won more than the flight cost, even those times I received a hotel and replacement flight. It makes EU flight planners very careful, I imagine, due to the expense of losing an entire flight income and more.')
