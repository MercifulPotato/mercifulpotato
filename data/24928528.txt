Constantly dealing with resizing “collapsars”, GBLs, poor visual compatibility with the host OS, a fragile threading model and piles and piles of unfixed bugs and glitches was a nightmare. It might have worked if you had a specific end user environment but it was a PITA for anything else, and deployment was even harder.<p>There are a few things I definitely miss from my 20 years as a Java dev, but the half assed and under funded Swing UI is not among them.<p>Give me HTML+CSS+JS any time.')
