At 4am one person can be vast overkill, but you can’t get away with zero people.  The same is true as you keep scaling support, having level 1 vs level 2 is really about filtering problems ever more efficiently and having enough work where that’s actually needed at 4AM on Christmas takes scale.<p>Which is what economies of scale mean, just a huge range of sub linear costs all lumped together.')
