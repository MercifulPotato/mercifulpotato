Being able to only speak from the top of a mountain in Colorado in 1789 would have severely limited the potential of the population to hear you (essentially, to zero). Being able to speak &quot;only&quot; from one&#x27;s own blog only makes discovery difficult, it does not limit people&#x27;s access post-discovery.<p>Secondly: you appear to consider FB&#x2F;Twitter etc. to be &quot;virtual public squares&quot;. They demonstrably are not this. At the very least, it would require legislation to make them so.<p>Thirdly: even given the 1st amendment, even physical public squares have distinct limitations in how they can be used. For one thing, they do have geography. Any given public square is a long way from most of the population in a country of any size (even more so in countries like the USA that span thousands of miles), meaning that a particular public square is not effectively accessible to most people. As a corollary, most of the public will never be present in any actual public square.<p>They also have geometry: there are limits to how many people can speak in them at once.<p>Finally, in a public square you still cannot do the equivalent of yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theater, along with presence of simple noise limits for many possible public square locations. These things work very differently, or are non-existent, for written communications.')
