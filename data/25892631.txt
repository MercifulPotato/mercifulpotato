The ones who didn’t rewrite their code to be compatible with the existing software called python, or the ones who didn’t rewrite their code to be compatible with the existing software that uses python?<p>I don’t have any rights to python.  If I chose not to rewrite my code for python3, I am increasing the fragility of the world.<p>However the same is true for the python maintainers.  If the maintainers were interested in maximum anti-fragility, Python3 should have been a fork.<p>I’m not making any sort of moral judgement here.  But I think it’s obvious both from the actions of devs not rewriting their software, and python being willing to make breaking changes, and that everybody seems to be blaming each other (and have been for a decade), that the goal here wasn’t really to create long lasting tools.')
