In these programs foreign units conduct combat operations with US operational guidance. However, unlike 127e programs the Special Night Squads and the Gideon Force in Ethiopia were directly led by conventional British officers and non-commissioned officers embedded in those units.<p>...<p>&gt; Two insights appear to have particular salience still today. First, the use of irregular forces largely made up of foreigners with a backbone of British officers and non-commissioned officers was a force multiplier that had dramatic impacts in multiple theaters for the British.<p>The article seems to argue that the US should emulate the British use of troops made up of colonial subjects commanded by the titular &quot;British masters&quot;. But unlike the British colonial empire, the American sphere of influence is mostly comprised of sovereign countries whose governments might object to foreign-controlled guerillas operating in their territory primarily to protect American interests. So I&#x27;m not sure whether that&#x27;s really an &quot;insight of particular salience still today&quot;.')
