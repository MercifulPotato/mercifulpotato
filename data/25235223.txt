Item(by='Thorrez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606536980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227145, text='&gt; would the person being bombarded by strangers be able to distinguish?<p>If it&#x27;s via email you could see the domain in the email address. Back before email, journalists might contact people via phone, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s so easy to tell then. I assume the email&#x2F;phone call&#x2F;facebook message starts off with an introduction saying something like &quot;I&#x27;m a journalist with such and such a newspaper...&quot;<p>&gt; does it matter if they could distinguish if the person reaching out is saying they&#x27;re going to put all their personal information online in an even more digestible format so that more people will harass their parents on Facebook Messenger?<p>Do you think the personal information is irrelevant to the story? Do you think this is a story that shouldn&#x27;t be covered? I think it&#x27;s an interesting story, and giving some info about the characters in the story helps make it more interesting. It&#x27;s generally considered proper form to contact the subjects of your article, so I would think it would actually be worse if the journalists didn&#x27;t contact the people in the story. The purpose of putting the info about the characters is certainly not so that people will harass their parents on Facebook Messenger. It&#x27;s not like they included their email address, phone number, link to a Facebook profile, or physical address. I don&#x27;t consider stuff on my Linkedin profile to be creepy. My Linkedin profile is my brag page; it would be great if journalists were writing about stuff on my Linkedin profile.<p>&gt; grifting creeps.<p>Are they worse than journalists 50 years ago? Would you consider all journalists grifting creeps?')
