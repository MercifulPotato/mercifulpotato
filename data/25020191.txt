There were some really vocal never-Trumpers like Graham who flipped to become extremely loyal supporters.  Why?  What makes someone become that fiercely loyal to a man they absolutely know will not show any loyalty to them?  It has to be power, he knows something, I guess.  In the case of Graham, it can&#x27;t be proof that he&#x27;s gay, that wouldn&#x27;t surprise anybody, even his own constituents.  So it&#x27;s got to be something far more devastating.')
