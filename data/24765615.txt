Optimizations like cache efficiency and branch predictions are important and often trump big O considerations, but are mostly engine-level issues. If you are normalizing for the average programmer, the #1 reason why their program is slow is that they&#x27;re using the wrong algorithm (often implicitly with e.g. library functions or database queries). If anything I&#x27;d like more people to be aware of how to reason in big O terms rather than less.')
