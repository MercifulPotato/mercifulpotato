Or on the ground practical challenges.<p>Hobby farmers in India should stick to fruit orchards(coconut&#x2F;mango) or spices.<p>The govt incentivises small farmers a lot. Also, in India..you can’t buy farmland unless your family..father or grandfather has been a farmer or land owning farmer. Indian origin foreign citizens cannot buy farmland. Altho some states are trying to change it(Karnataka where Coorg is being one of them)<p>I am disappointed with this article. It has the opportunity to create new farmers and guide them but ended up like rah rah self help fluff piece.')
