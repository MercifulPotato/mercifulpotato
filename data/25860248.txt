Especially if there is any lag between detecting say radio waves or whatever they find interesting and a ship showing up.<p>The other consideration is visiting other stars may be possible and extremely expensive.  Colonizing at say 0.001c is possible, but very slow and likely requires generation ships.  Hardly worth it so your descendent can visit some primitive culture who might not be around when they get there.')
