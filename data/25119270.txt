Even &quot;https&quot; and &quot;.dk&quot;.<p>Localized scripts are exclusionary to everyone else who has no hope of typing them or even identifying them in a unicode table to copy and paste.<p>A funny situation happens in China where even the most computer illiterate old person can type latin letters on a PC with enough patience just by matching appearance to their keyboard, but many old people are utterly blocked from typing Chinese characters because that requires learning a special input method which is almost a whole nother language itself. Before smartphones, they had to write them with a stylus on a writing tablet to get around this problem.<p>Half the English alphabet is excluded from domain names too. When are we getting capital letters? Let&#x27;s just tolerate never having them and not worry, same as those other languages&#x27; odd letters. ExpertSexChange.com and PenisLand.net could use them.')
