It&#x27;s the total set of these five things that makes me take for granted that I&#x27;ll have a stellar experience with the new Max headphones. This is not a complete explanation of why they&#x27;ll be indispensable, but it should help convey why competing products aren&#x27;t, in my case.<p>1. Apple&#x27;s Bluetooth hardware implementation has been top tier for me in multi-device use, in a mixed Apple and non-Apple environment, with predictable steps to resolve any issue I encounter, across the Beats and Apple headphones products that I&#x27;ve used since 2017.<p>2. Apple&#x27;s minimal-choice approach to their headphones provides the bare minimum necessary to operate them in on-device functionality, which removes all opportunities for hidden settings, unusual interactions, and other &quot;am I at fault?&quot; interactions with my devices.<p>3. Apple&#x27;s noise canceling implementation is strong enough to cancel out general background noise without preventing me from hearing someone speak to me, and weak enough that I can forget that I&#x27;m wearing headphones with noise canceling enabled, and doesn&#x27;t induce nausea in me the way that new (but not old) Bose QuietComfort headphones do.<p>4. Apple&#x27;s frequency prioritization for their products is more natural and less modified and bass-heavy to my ears than Beats and other popular products in the market, which aligns with the customizations I requested for my modified DT770s when having them recabled to balanced XLR.<p>5. Apple&#x27;s surround virtualization algorithm has been better to my perception than that of Astro A50 headphones (the previous contender for best in class), while causing neither confusion nor nausea when used for extended periods of time.<p>EDIT: And to save time on replies, here&#x27;s a per-item FAQ for each of the above, so that I might save folks some time on back-and-forth.<p>1. Yes, I have experienced significant Bluetooth frustration issues when combined with Apple beta operating system releases, and at one point was able to diagnose a 5GHz wireless interference issue that was fixed before general release to the public. Yes, the original AirPods v1 had sporadic issues, that were resolved by firmware and hardware updates. No, those issues didn&#x27;t cause me to give up on Apple. Yes, I&#x27;m aware that other people have issues with Apple products. No, I&#x27;m generally able to resolve any issues within a few seconds. Yes, once in a while the audio blips out, as do my non-Bluetooth wireless headphones as well.<p>2. Yes, I know they don&#x27;t use aptX with Android. No, I don&#x27;t care what codec they use to communicate with my devices, even the Android devices. Yes, I&#x27;m aware that aptX is higher quality than Bluetooth AAC. Yes, I have a 192&#x2F;32-int lossless DAC stack for my wired headphones. No, I&#x27;m not trying to simultaneously multi-pair my wireless headphones, or share them between multiple iCloud users or etc. Yes, I know that competing headphones can do all sorts of complicated things that I don&#x27;t desire them to do for me. No, I don&#x27;t want to be able to modify any settings on my wireless headphones.<p>3. Yes, I can still hear people talking. No, I don&#x27;t get perfect silence on airplanes, even with -27dB custom-molded in-ear earplugs underneath them. Yes, the first time I tested the new QCs, I nearly barfed. No, I don&#x27;t have that problem with the old QC-15s. Yes, there are settings for the &#x27;level&#x27; of noise canceling on the new QCs, see also #2.<p>4. Yes, I know that Apple owns Beats. Actually, I have &#x27;Beats Pro Studio Wireless 3&#x27;, the one entry in the lineup that doesn&#x27;t amplify bass like the rest of the Beats line is prone to doing. Yes, I prefer balanced sound in my listening experiences, both with wireless and wired headphones and in my car.<p>5. Yes, I know that the Astro A50 when combined with a modern Xbox and Dolby Atmos for Headphones no longer uses the A50 algorithm but instead uses a version of Atmos specifically tuned for my exact headphones. Yes, I know that Apple is using Atmos somehow as part of their virtualization experience. No, I don&#x27;t expect Atmos to upgrade the notes in my music to sound higher fidelity. No, I don&#x27;t expect that I&#x27;ll get the full Spatial Audio experience on most of my devices. Yes, I know that it&#x27;s possible to tune virtualization algorithms to create a better headspace, see also #2.')
