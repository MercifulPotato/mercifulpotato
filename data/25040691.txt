Or do break out the Hail Mary cheat - what have you got to lose?<p>This is almost the critical pass&#x2F;fail decision in my opinion, because in the real world, on actually difficult or unsolved problems the correct decision is to escalate, clearly communicate you have an issue, and either be directed to someone who can get you unstuck, or inform resource allocators that additional resources will be required to fulfill their request.<p>There is nothing more destructive to organized, value producing work than to vouchsafe that it&#x27;s a&#x27;ok hunky dory when it isn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I made it through some of my own coursework by the skin of my teeth because I could at least describe in enough detail where I was coming up short that the instructor had confidence that with more time and experience I&#x27;d get it.<p>At least, I think. I&#x27;m still a bit fuzzy on thoss last couple years of college from the sleep deprivation. I get bits and pieces of lucidity in between the recollections of &quot;Oh God, I need sleep.&quot;<p>Theoretical Comp Sci is still &quot;that one class I&#x27;m not sure if I really got anything good out of besides intuition into what is and is not a candidate for being computible&quot;, and Linear Algebra was &quot;I&#x27;ve killed more trees writing out the work for these  problems than anyone should reasonably have to.&quot;')
