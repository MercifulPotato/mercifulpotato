You just can&#x27;t remove the measurement from the phenomenon.<p>In our reality (&quot;to us&quot;), light doesn&#x27;t make sense if it&#x27;s not measured, and the result of that measurement is not light itself, but the product or outcome of the interaction of the measuring device&#x2F;method and whatever &quot;light is&quot; (when not being measured), if light can even exist without being measured (which is unknowable).')
