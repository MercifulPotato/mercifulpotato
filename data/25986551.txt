While most people would probably be able to download an XMPP client and sign up for an account, you&#x27;d lose them once you start explaining that they can&#x27;t send encrypted messages to their friend on another server because that server doesn&#x27;t support the necessary XEPs.<p>The importance of usable security seems to be ignored here, as is often the case in technical circles.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-ecosystem-is-moving&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-ecosystem-is-moving&#x2F;</a>')
