I’m literally being forced to “thedonald.win” or some other sh<i></i> to find broadened perspectives.<p>Perhaps some insight as to why people have trouble believing scientists at the moment... they told everyone “masks and gloves don’t work” (to keep supply for essential workers) then told everyone “make your own masks” (btw studies going back to the early 1900s says masks will work if it’s droplet based) we also now have evidence masks don’t work. We knew this would be the case because back in January and February they confirmed it was airborne. Multiple studies since confirmed this. Basically the virus can survive in the air and our cloth masks aren’t good enough. Part of Biden’s transition team said that on Joe rogan’s podcast in March.<p>Then we had the whole “don’t go into crowds” followed by “oh protests are for a good cause, so it’s okay” and stuff like that.<p>The reality is that the public shouldn’t trust what they are being told. Literally everything has been a lie thus far.')
