When you select&#x2F;unselect DLC&#x27;s, it will often trigger a download to happen (although small). With Dota, they deliver support for OpenGL &amp; Vulkan basically as DLC&#x27;s.<p>So the mechanism to have modular game delivery already exists in steam, they can just repurpose it and give it a different label, or bake the options into the Install dialog so you can choose the parts you want upfront.<p>And yeah, other launchers are a pain (with proton), I agree.')
