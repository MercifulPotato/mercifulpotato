Rather than a small profit on 100% of transactions they make significant profit on some low percentage of transactions.  Making 10k on 1 in 1,000 transactions = making 10$ on every transaction.<p>If closing early generates more profit then they don’t win or lose, just executing the trade at close for the customer.<p>However, if waiting generates more profit then they can always say they executed early while waiting and then pocket the difference.<p>They could even even pick a mid point at time X, then compare some random time period before and after the transaction looking for a hypothetical less profitable execution time.')
