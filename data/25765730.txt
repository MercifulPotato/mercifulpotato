They&#x27;ve already shown they can handle effectively renting a phone.  And we know for sure their car isn&#x27;t going to be cheap.<p>What I suspect they&#x27;re going to do is make it so you can only finance through them with the option to trade up after five years.  They&#x27;ll take the car back after that time and either refurb and resell it themselves or offload that to third-parties.  That gives them steady revenue for years with comparatively high margins.<p>And, like Tesla, they&#x27;ll sell direct.  No dealerships for the Apple Car.')
