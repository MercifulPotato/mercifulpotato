I don&#x27;t find any of these things to be enough of an advantage to outweigh the advantages of having it  in browser.<p>&gt; You don&#x27;t use a task bar on your computer?<p>Nope.<p>&gt; You would never want to be able to alt-tab to a programming IDE or music player?<p>Having these in browser means 1 less window to keep on the desktop taking up space so I don&#x27;t need to alt-tab as much. I can see both my IDE and my browser at the same time.<p>&gt; [ .. Atom, more interactive app section ...]<p>I don&#x27;t use Atom or VSCode (electron-based editors) so this isn&#x27;t an issue for me. But I can totally see wanting these to be as native as possible, so using them that way makes sense. So I&#x27;ll 100% concede the point for code editors.<p>For data I use Firefox containers to keep that things compartmentalized sufficiently so there to no need to worry about polluting local data stores.')
