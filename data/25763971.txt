It&#x27;s desperation.<p>There are ways to self experiment that make some sense and there are a lot of ways to self experiment that are a good way to get harmed with little hope of upside and describing people who get badly messed up this way as &quot;heroes&quot; is probably a good way to increase the odds of more people getting badly messed up.<p>I wish there was more support for reasonable self experimentation as an alternative to &quot;You are so completely and thoroughly fucked and no one will help you&quot; but I really don&#x27;t want to see something like this glorified as <i>heroics</i> because that will tend to get a lot of pushback against more reasonable methods of self experimentation and make it harder to find a constructive path forward.')
