I used to do it all the time; I think that because I have heard of something, I somehow know how it works or how to use it. For me, it&#x27;s kind of like going &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ve seen that meme before!&quot; and somehow going meme++ in your head, so of course I am &#x27;more familiar with it&#x27;, but I am doing that for advanced topics I have no demonstrated practice in. I am much better now at realizing my incompetence, but I wish it could be studied in more detail, instead of people just looking at someone who is demonstrating confident incompetence and going &quot;Dunning-Kruger?&quot; &quot;Dunning-Kruger!&quot;.')
