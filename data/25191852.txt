I wear one in my workshop when alone all day. I semi-regret donating all my N95 masks last spring - I still cannot get good replacements and I&#x27;m allergic to sawdust.\nThere is no harm in wearing a mask when you don&#x27;t need to. there is harm in messing up some borderline cases. So just get used to it on your face and forget about it.')
