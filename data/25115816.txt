To me it seems that by putting distribution first, or focusing on problems to solve, that you typically end up with markets or problems you are personally not really excited about. I&#x27;ve done this exercise many times. I can either work on something I think is cool and there is a niche market for, but does not really &quot;solve&quot; a problem but addresses a &quot;want&quot;, or I can work on something I have zero interest in but for which there probably is a market and clear distribution model. If I like adventure games, and want to make one, those don&#x27;t solve a problem, and it&#x27;s a niche market with a lot of competition (gaming in general). Or I can work on some online tax prep software for expats. Niche market, addresses a problem, zero personal interest, probably a big market.')
