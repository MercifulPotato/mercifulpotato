Item(by='xxpor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603235898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24838980, text='&gt;Google pays off phone manufacturers to sign onerous contract preventing them from installing other app stores or displaying other options on the home screen or during the setup process<p>GOOD<p>Here&#x27;s the problem. You want to make it illegal for google to stop phone manufacturers from installing even more crapware than they do already? How would that be a win for anyone besides Samsung&#x2F;LG&#x2F;Sony&#x2F;etc? Encouraging even more fracturing of the Android ecosystem and the lack of updates? Google is protecting consumer welfare. This should be encouraged, not looked at skeptically.<p>This is not the MS in the 90s situation where manufacturers couldn&#x27;t install Linux instead of Windows. This would be MS saying you can&#x27;t install BonziBuddy and sell it with our logo and services on it.')
