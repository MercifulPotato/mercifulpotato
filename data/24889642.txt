The executive role is already multifunctional - you need to were multiple hats on the same day or even at the same meeting.<p>The biggest problem most of the executives have is time. It is a problem even for a single company. I don&#x27;t think any company is interested in a part-time CEO&#x2F;CTO. Some exceptions are possible (Jack Dorsey, interim-CEOs) but no more than that.<p>However, for ICs this trend will happen. People are not limited by a location and can do Consulting type job in any location. It is a great opportunity for businesses as well - to hire part-time the best of the best.')
