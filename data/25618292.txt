Item(by='bawolff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609635368, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25611743, text='&gt; Regarding Sabine, it seems if one cannot win an argument then discredit those that do not agree, is that it, is that the way?<p>You were the one who brought up that she was a physicist, and appealed to her authority. Whether or not she is the right type of physicist for this subject matter seems quite relevant. Ultimately though, appeals to authority are always weak arguments. They are better than nothing, but fundamentally, experts are people - you can probably find at least one expert who holds whatever view you want. A single expert (even if it was in the right field) in the entire world agreeing with you doesn&#x27;t exactly mean much. Its much better to concentrate on the arguments that the experts give.<p>&gt; During this Covid-19 pandemic I just witnessed how much we really know, science was was changing opinions by the hour<p>It was a brand new virus. The media was often overstating the certainty of what scientists were saying. Most of the time scientists were saying - this is our best guess at the moment, but this is new so its just a guess, and the media reported that as - Scientists 100% sure that X is what you should do.<p>&gt; Should I just mention uranium glass?<p>What about it. Its generally considered safe if made correctly. (That&#x27;s honestly a weird example, because there is so many radiation based products in the early 1900&#x27;s that were ridiculously bad ideas. Uranium glass is probably not one of them, even if I would definitely prefer not to have uranium in my kitchenware)<p>&gt; What if interferes vitamin D production, and then impacts all other issues connected with lack of vitamin D<p>What if it causes dinosaurs to resurrect back to life, and velociraptors eat us? Without a theory as to how or why it might possibly effect that, you&#x27;re basically shooting blind and you could say the same thing about anything.<p>&gt; Why is so hard to accept that &quot;we do not know&quot;?<p>&quot;We do not know&quot; is not a single category. By some standards we do not know anything (perhaps excepting &quot;cognito, ergo sum&quot;). We don&#x27;t know if the sun will rise tomorrow, if cause preceedes effect, whether or not we live in the matrix, etc.<p>But just because we don&#x27;t know anything for sure, doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t know some things more than others.<p>I think fundamentally, we are talking past each other because you are arguing &quot;we don&#x27;t know&quot;, where I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the relevant question since that is always true. We obviously don&#x27;t know for sure. The question is, do we know enough that use of the technology is reasonable. I think your argument would be more convincing if you set goalposts for what would be enough knowledge, in your mind, for you to consider 5g &quot;safe&quot; (And those goalposts be consistent, so that the other things you consider safe, already meet those standards).')
