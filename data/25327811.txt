There is the same amount of indirection in both solutions.<p>The first solution does pointer-&gt;structure-&gt;pointer, the &quot;elegant&quot; solution does pointer-&gt;pointer-&gt;structure. The reason the first one may be easier to read is because the C syntax &quot;prefers&quot; it, as it is a more common construct.')
