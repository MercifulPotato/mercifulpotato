A lot of indie artists pressed a small run of CD&#x27;s for a couple grand and never even broke even. Still happens today. I have multiple wannabe artists in my family.<p>For a lot of people making music should really stay a hobby. They are not very original in their music and lyrics. Or simply not very good. Or very good for a small niche. It&#x27;s still possible to succeed, but not just by putting out CD&#x27;s and expecting to sell them all for a nice profit. You need to explore the other options available. Like teaching, living room concerts, blogging, vlogging, etcetera.<p>If it&#x27;s purely about producing and getting your art out to people, there has never been a better time. Just do what you like to do and get it out there. Who knows, you&#x27;ll be streamed a lot somewhere, like my brother in law&#x27;s songs are streamed a lot in Brazil without ever visiting that country.<p>Many open source developers are happy working on their hobby for &quot;free&quot;. Some artists should do the same.')
