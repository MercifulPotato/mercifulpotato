I was using the desktop app to chat with a friend, and while we were able to get some end-to-end encryption working, it was a huge pain the butt, and if two software engineers struggled this much to get the damn thing working, there&#x27;s no way in hell that I&#x27;m convincing my parents to use it.<p>To me, we have to accept the incremental wins where we can get them; getting my parents on Signal means that they&#x27;re <i>not</i> on WhatsApp.<p>I <i>am</i> a believer in federation, honestly, but the fact of the matter is that there&#x27;s a reason that XMPP hasn&#x27;t taken the world by storm, and people have gravitated towards centralized stuff: it&#x27;s just easier, and not everyone is a software engineer.<p>That said, I would love to be wrong about this....if we can make Matrix&#x2F;Element approachable by anyone, I would support that.')
