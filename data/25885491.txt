There will be a lot of accidents if it&#x27;s released widely during this period (yes much more than human driver accidents. aside: there seem to be a lot of Tesla fans who think humans are much worse drivers than they are). This is what Google saw a decade ago when their self driving cars started getting good and their drivers started being irresponsible, so they decided to start from the idea the driver couldn&#x27;t be a crutch and the car always had to be able to do something safe. Getting this level of robustness is why it seems to some that they&#x27;ve made no progress in 10 years.')
