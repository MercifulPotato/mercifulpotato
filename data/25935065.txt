When you need it to work a little bit different you&#x27;re usually either just out of luck, or the added flexibility makes whole api very complex (and usually buggy, as it goes hand in hand). It&#x27;s just super hard to make things very high-level and simple, while still flexible enough.<p>Having a number of simpler functionalities that you&#x27;re free to compose any way you like is for me preferred approach anytime. Most of the things that you mention can be solved with fairly simple wrapper libs doing just one thing (tracking state of connection, tracking errors, batching requests, etc.). Perhaps not in a perfectly reusable way, but good enough to allow easy recycling from project to project, and it&#x27;s way easier to use and debug and adjust than if we had one huge built-in service object to handle it all.')
