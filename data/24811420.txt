A third-party hub does work, but my Macbook seems to recognize each different hub configuration as a new device, so every time I disconnect a USB-A peripheral, the screen flickers as it reestablishes a connection. Inevitably, my internal sound card is no longer recognized. If I disconnect the pass-through USB-C power cable, the screen goes black and takes 1-2 minutes to reload the login screen. Performing an NVRAM reset seems to fix most of these issues, but I now have to do it every few weeks.<p>The Apple-branded USB-C ecosystem is a  giant mess right now.')
