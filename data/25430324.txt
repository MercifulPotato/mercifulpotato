Go spend any time at &#x2F;r&#x2F;Bad_Cop_No_Donut&#x2F; and you too are forced to acknowledge police brutality. A tremendous amount of evidence makes it clear. Worse yet, it&#x27;s not new. Police brutality has been ongoing forever, what changed recently is that everyone has a HD camera in their pocket and are recording.<p>So why wont that change? There has been some minor things like body cameras; but race isnt consideration. Their brutality is against white people all the same. The fix will only come when the police are no longer employed by the state.<p>Right now you have broken liability. Police officer brutalizes someone, but he isnt required to keep personal insurance. So the next liability goes to the derpartment but they dont have insurance neither, then it goes to the government itself. So the government is incentivized to cover for itself.<p>Privatize police and suddenly you broke the chain. Government can outright put anti-brutality right in the contract. When a brutality event occurs, the government is happy to investigate and punish the brutality.')
