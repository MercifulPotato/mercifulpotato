But I do enjoy playing with other not-very-good players. I am better enough than my children to never lose to them so far. But I would like them to enjoy the game. It doesn&#x27;t seem very fun if you don&#x27;t have some reasonable chance to win occasionally.<p>This creates a situation where I have an incentive to cheat very creatively so that my child has to work for it and doesn&#x27;t detect the reverse-cheat that allowed them to win.')
