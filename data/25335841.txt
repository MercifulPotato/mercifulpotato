Modern &quot;science&quot; running amok with people more concerned with attempting to prove themselves correct than find the truth doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>&gt; Popper&#x27;s falsification is a pretty unrealistic account of how science actually works<p>That&#x27;s the rub though. A pretty strong argument can be made that &quot;science&quot; is <i>not working</i> and that &quot;scientists&quot; have lost their way, if you look at things like the reproducibility crisis.')
