I was in the Web Dev unit for 4 months and a Team Lead for the remainder. I got a job early so didn&#x27;t get to do Labs or Computer Science, though I&#x27;ve heard they weren&#x27;t great experiences. I&#x27;m not 100% looped in what&#x27;s happening with Lambda anymore (they removed the Alumni from the student Slack channels), but I hope they&#x27;re able to turn things around.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I did enjoy my time there. It helped me get over anxiety around tackling projects, and it gave me a taste of what fast-paced learning looks like. Was also able to use what I learned for Pioneer and YC. That said, it does feel weird to be on the hook for â‚¬27,500 - for what was effectively 4 months of instruction in my case.')
