The first implies that he was a patient, he was there for the purpose for which the hospital exists, the second implies he went to that location for some other reason (such as bringing flowers, or working there).<p>Likewise &quot;went to school&quot; (as a scoolchild) vs &quot;went to the school&quot; (to collect someone, or to teach). &quot;At university&quot; (a student) vs &quot;at the university&quot; (physical location, for any reason). &quot;Went to prison&quot; (as a criminal) vs. &quot;went to the prison&quot; (to visit his brother, or to fix their telephones). &quot;Does she go to church?&quot; (to church services) vs. &quot;did you go to the church?&quot; (to see the stained glass).<p>&quot;Go to the doctor&quot; is a bit different, the doctor isn&#x27;t an institution, he&#x27;s a person. Although I think that implies you went for medical reasons, if you stopped by to pick up some paperwork, you might say &quot;I have to stop at the doctor&#x27;s&quot; i.e. his rooms. But maybe that&#x27;s also because you would probably talk to the receptionist anyway. But &quot;went to the barber&quot; implies you had a shave, while you might &quot;stop at the barber&#x27;s&quot; to pick someone up.')
