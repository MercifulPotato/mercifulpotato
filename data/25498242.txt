They clearly use some form of content based recommendation (extracting features from the music itself) blended with other methods. It seems to make an honest attempt at serendipity (songs&#x2F;artists you may like but would otherwise be unlikely to discover).<p>I still think recommender engines should always enable some form of user tuning. If it doesn’t, then the recommender is a tool for services to control your behavior rather than the other way around.')
