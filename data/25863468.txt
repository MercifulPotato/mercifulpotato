Lightning strikes everywhere he goes, that&#x27;s not by accident. No one is that lucky - no one. I said on my investing blog that Keller would get pushed out by Intel&#x27;s shit corporate structure and I was right. Intel isn&#x27;t rotten, its gangrenous, and there&#x27;s a lot of tissue that needs to be excised if the patient is going to be saved.<p>Everyone who listens to Jim Keller ends up with better products and more sales. Every time. Without fail.<p>If you think that isn&#x27;t being the &quot;real deal&quot;, there&#x27;s something wrong with <i>you</i>, not Jim.')
