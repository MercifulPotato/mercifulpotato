There is one pretty good reason for executing programs on real hardware: because we&#x27;re still pre-error-correction, errors are rampant, but they are hard to model correctly. After all, if you could model them, you could simulate quantum mechanics, and then... why were you building the thing? So, simulators have to make some strong assumptions. Running programs on real devices can teach us more about the physics of those devices and about how compile programs for them.<p>There&#x27;s one other really good reason: it&#x27;s fun!')
