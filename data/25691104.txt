Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=[25691281], score=None, time=1610143335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691071, text='&gt; But I don&#x27;t think it was a coup as it wasn&#x27;t even planned<p>What? It just so happened to magically line up when the Senators &#x2F; Congressmen were tallying the electoral votes? It was a planned march. It happened on the day of the electoral tally for a REASON. This is beyond symbolic: they wanted to overturn the election.<p>And they still do. The next march is Inauguration day, but this time I think people will be more prepared and better defended against it.<p>With luck, maybe we can knock enough wind out of their sails and prove to them that this behavior is unacceptable. But this is not the time to feign ignorance or become apologists for their cause.<p>They are still proud of what they accomplished (!!!). They were harassing Senator Graham just a few hours ago (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;iheartmindy&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347616155394043904" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;iheartmindy&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347616155394043904</a>). (EDIT: Twitter has removed comments. Good move, but it means you aren&#x27;t seeing the planning that&#x27;s going on from those crazies anymore)<p>Now is the time to prepare and defend. They&#x27;re throwing down the gauntlet for Inauguration day, so we need to defend ourselves and our democracy. (EDIT: DC National Guard is debating M4 rifles or 9mm Berettas. They&#x27;re taking this threat seriously)<p>&gt; Maybe some of them actually wanted to get in<p>They live-streamed themselves getting in and bragged about it on Twitch and Youtube. By their own words they&#x27;re trying to keep Trump as President.')
