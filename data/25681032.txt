Having a bird&#x27;s eye view of every single account, transaction, investments, net worth, etc. is &quot;totally useless&quot;? No.<p>If you can get it to actually connect to things (I have 2FA on most accounts, and since Mint scrapes the sites and stores passwords in plaintext, it doesn&#x27;t know how to handle this) and tag everything properly (MCC&#x27;s vary pretty widely). I think that the promise of Mint is great, but in reality it falls apart as soon as you have more than a few accounts, or start using anything that wasn&#x27;t originally built in (e.g. 2FA).<p>That all said, I follow the same general principles: autopay everything in full, invest money first, live within my means (with certain exceptions that are the &quot;budget&quot;).')
