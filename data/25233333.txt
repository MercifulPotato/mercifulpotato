I am not talking here about bright ideas... I am talking about something that is really bitch to implement (quite frankly I would rather take tinycc and mutate the c source (same goes for go source code) before compiling than going the LDE and Mistfall way but there might be something that I have missed in all those years) and I would love to see something that is beyond this. And imho, no, various payloads&#x2F;drivers&#x2F;rootkits&#x2F;uefi&#x2F;...,  etc. doesnt come close in level of complexity. They are just bright ideas, but please I really would love to prove me wrong.<p>I would love to give some other example next time instead of 20+ years old piece of code. Please share the knowledge.')
