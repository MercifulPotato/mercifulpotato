The fact that they don&#x27;t do it perfectly is not a rationale for killing it or providing it with infinite resources.<p>I think that&#x27;s a naive perspective. Google did not create the database to be nice to other vendors, and it also did not make it available to them for that purpose.<p>An Internet-wide blacklist represents strategic leverage over competitors (or maybe even dissonant voices, should the need arise) and an massive source of data collection probe points. These facts were certainly brought up internally and deemed worth the risk when the massive legal liability of this product was assessed.<p>Therefore, because of the pervasiveness of this system, it needs to be handled responsibly. They are not doing anyone a favor by making sure it functions correctly. Google is well aware of this, because they don&#x27;t need regulators and lawmakers gaining yet another excuse to try and dismantle them.')
