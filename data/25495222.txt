Worked great.  Then Big Sur came along and I had to upgrade MacPorts.  This involved uninstalling installed packages, upgrading the base MacPorts, then reinstalling the packages.<p>Imagine my surprise -- because I didn&#x27;t fully consider these actions -- when my terminal session started ignoring my commands partway through that process.
