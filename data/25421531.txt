But that&#x27;s because I was cheap.<p>I even took regular, non sleeper night trains. Sleeping on seats is not as good as on beds but much than on planes or buses. These tended to be really cheap.<p>One interesting thing they did in France was to run high speed trains at low speed through the night (iDNiGHT). The idea was to get an extra &quot;free&quot; slot. Really cheap (I think I paid something like 10â‚¬ for a ~900km trip) but not the most comfortable. Still managed to sleep. I liked these but few people did, so they cancelled the service.')
