Couldn&#x27;t they have released those Zen2 parts as refreshed 4000 series, which they are?<p>This feels like they&#x27;re trying to scam less knowledgeable consumers. WTF is going on at AMD?<p>Also, the Zen3 iGPU is still Vega not RDNA2. WTF AMD?! They could integrate RDNA2 in the console Zen2 APUs but the PC Zen3 chips are still running a GPU from 2017 which is based on an architecture from 2012! How is this possible, it just seems crazu to me.')
