So I know the first step is simply to get employed for stable income- I don&#x27;t have the mindset to run a business. I also don&#x27;t know many people in high <i>or</i> low places- I like to keep to myself whatever chance I get.<p>But regardless, is a 10 year plan from zero to FIRE feasible? Can people still FIRE under 50 if they started their financial plan just before 40?')
