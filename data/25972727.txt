I can agree with a lot of it, here&#x27;s my take on it:<p>&gt; It doesn&#x27;t matter what the label is; any label that attempts to stratify programmers is a &quot;myth&quot;.<p>I can agree with this, but the thing is this is true regarding anything nowadays, whatever you say someone, somewhere will find displeasing. the &quot;10x&quot; label however, to my argument, is &quot;10x&quot; worse than other labels such as &quot;star&quot;. perhaps you don&#x27;t take this phrase too literally, but it does sort of &quot;quantify&quot; in people&#x27;s mind the concept of 1000% productivity, which can be interpreted as unattainable.<p>my goal is to let people accept their mortality - there is some output you can produce which is optimal, 100% or so. it is much more rational to think your output is 10% and you can progress from there. at least in my mind, it is discouraging to say &quot;your 100% is still not nearly enough&quot;<p>I guess the point is - rhetoric speak matters.<p>p.s. I just love sigma-3 programmer. can I get to sigma-5? ;)')
