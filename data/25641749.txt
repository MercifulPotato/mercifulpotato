Item(by='pfdietz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609817748, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620734, text='One can redefine functions on the fly in Common Lisp.  One can retain the source associated with compiled functions (even if the Common Lisp doesn&#x27;t natively support that, by augmenting DEFUN via the macroexpand hook).   I have done just this in an in-core mutation testing framework for Common Lisp, which creates and tests hundreds of mutant versions of a function, automatically.<p>In general though, there&#x27;s little good reason to edit Common Lisp code in core.   Common Lisp is a language with structure at the character level (reader macros); reading in a form loses all this.   This is unlike Interlisp, where everything, even comments, were s-exprs and could be edited in memory with sedit.')
