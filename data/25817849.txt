All it did was incentivize programmers to quickly hammer out superfluous, inefficient, bug ridden code that would just bite them in the ass later rather than concentrating on writing quality code. I think that&#x27;s all that would end up happening with MS Teams tracking. Once employees figure out the game, they&#x27;re just going to spend as much time as they can chatting, posting messages and scheduling pointless meetings rather than doing actual work.')
