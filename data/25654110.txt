We stayed in Cascais before heading to Lisbon (both were stunning and the people extremely friendly - Cascais was like a mini-Lisbon on the sea to me). In any event, we took a little sunset sailboat ride and the young gentleman at the helm said he was from the Azores. He said it can be quite remote, but he thought it was one of the most magical places he&#x27;d seen and implored us to visit. It&#x27;s #1 on our list as well.<p>Also, I have half a mind to visit Paratay, Brazil. All I know is the song Paratay by Mia Doi Todd (1), but as I listen to the lyrics, that&#x27;s enough to get my wanderlust stirring.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;QID5HNlSMjw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;QID5HNlSMjw</a>')
