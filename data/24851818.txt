Item(by='TheDong', descendants=None, kids=[24851962, 24851895, 24851890], score=None, time=1603312234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24851510, text='Presumably the alternative to &#x27;a password manager as a service&#x27; is &#x27;a local password database and password manager which is not a service&#x27;.<p>This can be something like password store, or keepass, where the attacker needs both your password database unlock key &#x2F; gpg passphrase, but also needs access to the database &#x2F; gpg keys, which means either physical access, or at least access to your local files.<p>I think there is some merit to pointing this out. If 1password allows anyone to make login attempts against their service, that means some bored teenager with a botnet can make attempts at your password.<p>I use password-store, and I could tell you my gpg passphrase right now, but you still couldn&#x27;t access any of my passwords. You&#x27;d need to get access to my yubikey and my psasword repository before you could do anything with that passphrase at all.<p>I think it&#x27;s true that a setup like mine, which requires a physical hardware token to decrypt my passwords, is more secure than a password service, however I also think the parent comment is totally wrong. 1password without a hw token isn&#x27;t the most secure option, but it&#x27;s way better than password reuse on random sites.')
