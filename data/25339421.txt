It looks to me this is a case of a donkey led by a carrot on a stick (investors are the donkey here). What I never understand is what happens when a new situation that the system did not previously train for happen? what if this situation is deadly? Will all the Uber cars decide to jump off a cliff because of a wrong signalization or bad weather? What will the Teslas decide?\nNature is very capable of creating 1 thing and multiply it, but it does not. The reason is it is more secure to have variation. If a problem happens, it will not affect every member (same what is happening with COVID by the way)\nCreating a mono-brain will soon prove disastrous. You just need a previously not seen situation or a crazy guy that gets imaginative and that will induce the death of hundreds')
