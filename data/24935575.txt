Sadly, sports is the one big thing that still prevents most people from cutting cord for real, but I prefer the current &quot;multi streaming service&quot; world a lot more than the old cable world.<p>As I said in another comment, you can just keep one subscription active at a time. It is way cheaper than cable and you can still rotate pretty quickly.<p>If something really good comes, you can subscribe to both for a short period, but most of the time you can do pretty well with just keeping one active.<p>I wish a Netflix-for-sports existed already, though. I always had to keep the basic cable just to watch my team&#x27;s football (soccer) games because you can&#x27;t get those in any other way.')
