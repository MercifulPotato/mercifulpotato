Simplicity is probably the best reason for wanting one.<p>If you&#x27;re getting a dumb TV because it stays off your network, but then get ipTV dongles and boxes for it, then you effectively have a smart TV on the network.<p>I have one and like it a lot. The remote control is beautifully simple. There is no complicated menu structure; it took all of five minutes to go through all the screens, to discover all that can be tweaked. The remote has dedicated buttons for switching among the HDMI inputs: power it on and hit the button for the input that you want.<p>I like the separation: the TV is the TV, and the box or dongle is the box. You can ditch the dongle and get another one, while keeping the TV. You can take the dongle on the road and plug it into another TV wherever you are.<p>The dongle has its own control mechanism (own remote, or smartphone). This simplifies things. You know what is a TV setting and what is an IPTV setting, and talk to the right piece of hardware with the right remote.<p>There is fault isolation. If your IPTV dongle or box fries itself, then it&#x27;s just the box. If it&#x27;s integrated into the TV, then the whole TV is toast.<p>You can ditch the dongle&#x2F;box in a few years and upgrade to different&#x2F;newer one, while keeping the TV. If you&#x27;re happy with the size, colors and resolution, and the thing works, there is no need to update it. It will work fine with whatever you&#x27;re interested in four years from now.')
