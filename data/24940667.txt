In an era of politic-driven pseudo-scientific paper, I was wondering :<p>1. Why ramadan is not explicitely told in the title.\n2. Why using &quot;dawn to sunset&quot; which is not helpful at all to make generalisation (scientists usually have a clock).\n3. Why the diet during the night is not explicited (at least in the abstract).\n4. Why this would have different results if the diet is during the night or during the day.<p>All of this makes me suspicious that this is a kind of retro-science propaganda to make Ramadan looks healthy and justify the religion.<p>I maybe wrong but the abstract raises too many flags to not care about this hypothesis.')
