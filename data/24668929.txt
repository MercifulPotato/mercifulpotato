I think you didn&#x27;t understand the point.</i><p>I assume you&#x27;re using sarcasm in the first part there, but that in turn it&#x27;s you who aren&#x27;t getting the point. All companies may not have backups, but all companies <i>could</i> have backups. And the industry as a whole could be taking far more measures to mitigate ransomware, it&#x27;s not some impossible problem. As well as prevention measures, ransomware is quite detectable actively because it necessarily changes the entropy of stored data in extremely obvious ways that a watchdog could detect. Or there could just be automated systems that constantly sample backups and verify they&#x27;re restorable. If companies don&#x27;t do that and choose to externalize some of the costs onto society (by funding criminals who will go on to hurt others in this case) it&#x27;s completely appropriate for government to step in and stop them. There are lots of situations where people and organizations are expected to exercise <i>reasonable</i> diligence or face the consequences.<p>In contrast, at least for now backing up humans is not in fact an option. People aren&#x27;t being lazy or failing to make reasonable efforts by failing to back themselves or their dependents up because that just doesn&#x27;t exist. It&#x27;s not the &quot;same logic&quot; at all, and how you made the mental leap of equating perfectly reproducible digital data with <i>children</i> is a real question.')
