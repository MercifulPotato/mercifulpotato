Just FYI.<p>It does help with &quot;boring&quot; tasks a little bit, in a sense, but they&#x27;re still boring an uninteresting. It&#x27;s not like I get a dopamine hit every time I do a piece of paperwork.<p>I usually describe it like this: for me ADHD sometimes makes things that are necessary for human life _really_ hard. Things like taking a shower in the morning or having breakfast, getting up to get water while working etc.<p>All these things take a toll on my day, I still do them but I feel like I&#x27;m doing something that I _absolutely_ don&#x27;t want to do and at the end of the day I don&#x27;t have any patient left for stuff that actually require my effort (e.g. listening to my wife when she&#x27;s frustrated with me).<p>With medication I feel better about doing these necessary things so I can get to the end of the day without hating myself. That doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m gonna eat all the bullshit that gets thrown to me at work!<p>It&#x27;s also not all roses, Ritalin is hard to manage, at least for me. I need to make a conscious effort to not devote too much of my attention to uninteresting details, etc. But it&#x27;s not like it takes away your free will!')
