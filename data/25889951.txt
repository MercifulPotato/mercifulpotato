Responses that are normally in minutes take hours etc.<p>That seems entirely reasonable to me. If I&#x27;ve been asked something by a coworker and for whatever reason I believe that they&#x27;re AFK&#x2F;offline, then responding to their message&#x2F;email is going to be a lower priority for me.<p>I&#x27;m not going to stop whatever I&#x27;m in the middle of doing to give an immediate response if whoever asked me isn&#x27;t going to read it immediately. I&#x27;ll finish what I&#x27;m working on, or reply when I&#x27;m taking a break.')
