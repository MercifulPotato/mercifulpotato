Amazon and netflix generally work easier than piracy. My, um friend, has radarr + usenet + plex, and its work pretty well 80%.  But subtitles are often a problem. Unpacking&#x2F;par checking sometimes takes forever. Sometimes the decoder in plex doesn&#x27;t really work. Sometimes the movie has been DMCA&#x27;d off the use net servers. Private trackers involve sucking up to to 15 year old polish kids who run their service like the Stazi.<p>You can usually find everything you want, but sometimes it requires some time.<p>I don&#x27;t have a large 4k tv, so maybe I&#x27;m not appreciating how bad the streaming movies look.<p>But Netflix, Amazon, itunes, Vudo, etc. are all way easier services to use.<p>Second, they are targeting the masses, who probably like a 30 second preview for another show and don&#x27;t care how 4k is encoded. In my experience, about 50% of people with high def TV&#x27;s didn&#x27;t even set up high def cable packages.')
