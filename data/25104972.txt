It is making me see what&#x27;s at stake, which is basically this:<p>&gt; So the real cost is more than the money I lost. I made my girlfriend stay home for a year, we didn&#x27;t do anything, we didn&#x27;t buy clothes and ate the cheapest food, etc.<p>---<p>&gt; I got much more from the articles that I wrote here on Indie Hackers than from any of my projects. And I did those in a couple of hours.<p>I know you don&#x27;t like that it only took a couple of hours. But if you got more from them, why not go further into that? 80&#x2F;20 etc.<p>&gt; Every time that I want to promote something, my stomach hurts.\nIf I share an article on Reddit I feel anxious for a week.\nWhen I go to a Facebook Group to suggest my apps, I feel sick.\nIf I send a private message on Twitter or Linkedin, I can&#x27;t sleep.\nAll the time I think people are going to hate me, tell me that I am an idiot, a con maker, that my ideas are terrible, that I suck.\nAnd they did many times, and I can&#x27;t handle that while making $0.\nSo, I quit.<p>That sucks. I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for these signals as well. If I have them, then I either try to find a growth hacker type of person, or quit as well.<p>&gt; I always wanted to write more. I love it. But I felt that I couldn&#x27;t write if I wasn&#x27;t successful. But I guess there are no rules.<p>Indeed, there aren&#x27;t. When you write, you get to set the frame and tone of your message.')
