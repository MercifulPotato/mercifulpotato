That&#x27;s the most absurd use of that word I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s a hobby. Hobbies cost money. People don&#x27;t have the god-given right to play piano, just like they don&#x27;t have the god-given right to fly a plane. Pianos cost money. Pianists need money to make a living. It&#x27;s not gatekeeping, it&#x27;s just the plain economics of a highly complex musical instrument.')
