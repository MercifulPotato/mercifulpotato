Nix is pretty wall layered, and while it has plenty of UX problems, it&#x27;s quite easy to predict what it will do.<p>Bazel has the classic problem of new well-funded software of being more polished than architected, and so feels like working with an amorphous blob where all that polish turns on you when you do something weird and now it oozes unforeseen complexity and interactions.')
