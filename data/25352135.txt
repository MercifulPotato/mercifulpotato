And really, while the development has been &quot;in the open&quot;, it hasn&#x27;t engaged the public until now. To that end, it&#x27;s not possible to engage in a &quot;bazaar&quot; approach off the bat, whether or not that&#x27;s a goal of the project.<p>Having been active in Go development and seeing some of the issues there, I understand what you mean. I don&#x27;t think we state anywhere &quot;this is clearly a cathedral model of development&quot;, but I think we&#x27;re pretty clear on it:<p>* We have a section of documentation on project governance <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fuchsia.dev&#x2F;fuchsia-src&#x2F;contribute&#x2F;governance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fuchsia.dev&#x2F;fuchsia-src&#x2F;contribute&#x2F;governance</a><p>* We have a section of documentation detailing different kinds of contributors, acknowledging that there are kinds of contributors with special powers, and also reserving the right to revoke contribution privileges in some cases: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fuchsia.dev&#x2F;fuchsia-src&#x2F;contribute&#x2F;community&#x2F;contributor-roles#specialized-roles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fuchsia.dev&#x2F;fuchsia-src&#x2F;contribute&#x2F;community&#x2F;contrib...</a><p>To the extent that you can look at these as a set of policies, follow all the policies, submit a change, and have that change rejected, I think that is unfortunate. I think this is much less likely if you first engage with the stakeholders, and having opened up mailing lists, we&#x27;ve made it simpler to do that.<p>However, the &quot;bazaar&quot; is also a bit of a myth in this regard. I&#x27;m not really aware of any open source projects where I can go submit a PR without talking to anybody and have the expectation that it&#x27;ll be merged without discussion. I can fork the repo, but that&#x27;s also already the case with Fuchsia.<p>&gt; the fact they are only now taking potential contributions<p>We were honest about this too, and our documentation used to explicitly say that we did not accept external contributions.')
