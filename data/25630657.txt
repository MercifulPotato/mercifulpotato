That&#x27;s what unions generally are, or am I misunderstanding your question. Denmark have&#x2F;had unions for &quot;office workers&quot;, engineers in general, steel workers and more. They are in the same industry, mostly, but they don&#x27;t work for the same company.<p>The members of these unions are generally unrelated, they just have jobs in the same sector of industry or very similar education.<p>I think the weird part is when a union just represent the people working for one particular company.')
