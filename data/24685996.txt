First let me say how much I appreciate this library, it really helps with X.<p>When I, or anyone else in this thread advocates for adding a life story into a bug report or the like, then you can bring in your stories about stories and it&#x27;ll be relevant.<p>&gt;  Is the message you want to convey simply that I should not volunteer my time to helping people?<p>Quite obviously not, it&#x27;s that you should stop comparing yourself to those in life threatening, intensely time pressured situations and try to be more pleasant to those you&#x27;re responding to, not trying to find excuses around doing so. You work in a pleasant environment, with low pressure, and are well rewarded, you definitely have the time to be well mannered.<p>&gt; maintainers who prefer ass kissing are egotistical and dominating<p>It&#x27;s not about &quot;ass kissing&quot; but <i>basic</i> respect, and if you wanted to provide an example of how not to exercise restraint and apply any semblance of etiquette, that would be a good one. Do you ever wonder why development is a &quot;sausage fest&quot; instead of the emergency room?')
