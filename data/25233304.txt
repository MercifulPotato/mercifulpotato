The amount of photons and particles that actually hit that bubble and enter the expanded space within is absolutely tiny. The energy requirements to do otherwise are just flat out ridiculous. If humanity ever develops a practical warp drive it&#x27;ll have to use this &quot;bubble&quot; approach one way or another or there&#x27;s something seriously wrong with the theory of general relativity.')
