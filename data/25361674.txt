The process is the same even in other states; I&#x27;ve never seen a Tesla store with a stock of cars just there on-site ready to buy that day, you always order online (or, I suppose, the salesperson orders online for you, and maybe that&#x27;s illegal in Texas? I dont know).<p>And, frankly, this is how <i>most</i> new car purchases work. Every one I&#x27;ve purchased or been a part of; they don&#x27;t end with you driving off the lot in a new car, they end with you waiting a week or two for the car to be delivered. I imagine some dealers have a limited stock of new cars in common configurations, and you <i>could</i> drive off in one of those, but that&#x27;s the minority of purchases in my experience.')
