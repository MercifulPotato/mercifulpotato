Item(by='HexagonalKitten', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608753899, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504505, text='&gt; This seems contradictory.<p>Because there are two entirely different things - one is producing an unbiased bitstream from a potentially biased one (the topic of the article) and the other is keying an individual encryption.<p>When you&#x27;re trying to generate a bitstream and you expect uniformity (ie, a prng) then seeing obvious non-uniformity over time is a sign that it&#x27;s biased. You need the type of algorithms from the article to unbias it while preserving the actual entropy. This is what a system&#x27;s designer should be doing to produce useful output from a hwrng in the first place.<p>But, looking at an individual piece of randomness, <i>a</i> key, you shouldn&#x27;t be looking for uniformity at all. Here you want all zeros, all 1s, and any mix, to be equally possible.<p>&gt; Interesting. Why do you hash the ECDH secret then?<p>Well, EC is a bit magical and I don&#x27;t know. Wikipedia says that it prevents &#x27;weak bits&#x27; from the handshake. That means correlations, but I don&#x27;t know why this is true. At any rate uniformity here means what you think, that it&#x27;s not a random bitstream and should not be used as such.')
