They’re being discussed on CNN. The New York Times. Fox News. In courts of law.<p>And actually, when the facts are discussed in courts of law what we find every time is that there is <i>no</i> evidence of fraud in any meaningful way. And, that the legal arguments being made don’t make any sense and may actually be asking for something illegal.<p>The question of a private company choosing to censor right wing anti-democratic propaganda (I think that’s a precise description even if it’s an unpalatable one to you) at the urging of some politicians is a different and tricky question.<p>I think it’s important to note that there have been threats of violence against state-level civil servants and their families. Threats which YouTube videos like the ones we are discussing foment.<p>But to say it’s not being discussed is just another lie.')
