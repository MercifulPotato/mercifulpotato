Corporations cannot act (they have no hands, and no brains), and thus they cannot break the law.  It also is relatively difficult to throw a corporation in jail for a criminal violation.<p>Even a much more informal association of people, a &quot;criminal conspiracy&quot;, cannot be criminally charged as a single abstracted entity: the individuals who <i>performed</i> that conspiracy must be charged.')
