If it&#x27;s the attackers fault, you don&#x27;t have to wonder if your insurance is good enough. You don&#x27;t have to examine if you keep your software sufficiently patched. You don&#x27;t have to examine if your company&#x27;s custom internal infrastructure is resilient or if it&#x27;s one giant shared CIFS drive full of sensitive customer data without backups.<p>Often, taking security seriously feels like directing a certain amount of resources for uncertain returns at a domain that <i>feels like</i> it should come for free. Software engineering <i>feels like</i> it is like manufacturing, where you produce artifacts and ship them. It&#x27;s jarring to recontextualize this as actively engaging in an adversarial, human-driven domain.<p>Between the two, our fellow users are heavily incentivized to find ways that they and people like them are blameless. It&#x27;s a way to avoid engaging with what can feel like an impossible problem. Without attackers there wouldn&#x27;t be any cybersecurity issues, right?')
