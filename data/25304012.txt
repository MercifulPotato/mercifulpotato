And if you don&#x27;t have a specific brand font, you should really just use web safe font stacks that leverage local fonts. System fonts look a lot better these days than they used to.<p>Basically, does anyone who&#x27;s doing serious work use Google Fonts anyway? I just assumed it was a thing that mostly hobbyists and personal websites used.')
