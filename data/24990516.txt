The researchers analyzed fMRI scans of the brains of 40 newborns, all less than a week old, who were part of the Developing Human Connectome Project, to identify the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA).  In newborns and pre-literate children, the VWFA is already connected to language centres, which predisposes it to the application of recognising word forms.')
