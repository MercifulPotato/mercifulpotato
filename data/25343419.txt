Then, by extension WOLG, it NOWADAYS actually makes no sense at all to continue using ELO, because significantly better algorithms have long since come along. Two by now both ancient examples, check the first one for why &amp; how ELO sucks even for its original intended usage, and check the second one for a tremendously improved version:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;project&#x2F;trueskill-ranking-system&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;project&#x2F;trueskill-r...</a> (2005+)<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;publication&#x2F;trueskill-2-improved-bayesian-skill-rating-system&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;publication&#x2F;trueski...</a> (2018) (Citations: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?cites=10179469592728174863" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?cites=1017946959272817486...</a>)<p>Oh and, as one may guess, neither of these examples represents the State of the Art in this sector (Check the citations above for that.).

Assuming of course that users want to find partners, as opposed to good opponents. Albeit:<p>One might speculate algorithmically supplying well-matching opponents instead of potential partners, while (mis)labeling them as more potentially likely compatible than by chance partners would make for a tremendously better—albeit highly amoral—repeat business model on part of the platforms, at least in the relative short-term, wouldn&#x27;t you say?')
