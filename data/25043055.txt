Salaried teams spend all day inventing cover stories - that&#x27;s why they exist as institutions.<p>We&#x27;re told there&#x27;s some elaborate other system at play yet they never make a decision or recommendation which goes against the margins and stock prices of the corporations funding the think tanks. Instead, if there&#x27;s multiple options they always seem to conclude that the most profitable is the best.<p>Until this impeccably consistent 1000 batting average is broken we can be forgiven for suspecting it&#x27;s all just manufactured nonsense.')
