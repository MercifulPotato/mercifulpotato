As I understand it, the two main selling points are providing a foundation for mathematics and a framework for automated theorem proving, but:<p>1) We already have a perfectly good foundation of mathematics. It&#x27;s called ZFC [1], and it does everything we need it to do. If all HoTT does is give a theory that&#x27;s mutually interpretable with ZFC, that&#x27;s not interesting (at least to mainstream workers in the foundations of mathematics, who would rather tackle substantive problems).<p>There are also people like Per-Martin Lof who want to use HoTT as a vehicle for doing mathematics with intuitionistic logic, and in particular denying the law of excluded middle, but at that point you&#x27;ve let the mask slip and you&#x27;re advocating something that interests approximately zero mainstream mathematicians.<p>2) It&#x27;s not at all clear HoTT, or type theory in general, is the best solution for formalizing mathematics. It could be, it couldn&#x27;t be, but this is ultimately an empirical question . Some comments on the state of the field are given in [2].<p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xenaproject.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;09&#x2F;where-is-the-fashionable-mathematics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xenaproject.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;09&#x2F;where-is-the-fa...</a>')
