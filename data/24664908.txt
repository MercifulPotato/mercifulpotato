Item(by='kd913', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601659929, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24664074, text='&gt;Using an old 3rd party Java PPA is as foolish as it gets, as there is an official OpenJDK PPA that supports all the JDK versions for many Ubuntu releases. I&#x27;m also skeptical of the statistic you mention, since Canonical doesn&#x27;t publish rankings, and download stats need to be retrieved via API on an individual repository basis.<p>It was from a podcast from Canonical&#x27;s apopey who described precisely some of the technical decisions behind snap and why they never bothered to open source it after the disaster that was open sourcing launchpad. He knows the statistics because most of these 3rd party PPAs were hosted on Launchpad that was only run by Canonical.<p>&gt;Relying on extremely incompetent users to make a general point is a strawman, not to talk about defining PPAs as &quot;random people&quot;, as many software products have official repositories or affiliations (I take you don&#x27;t use PPAs).<p>Systems like this should be designed for 99% of users. PPAs were designed for 0.1% of system admins, and developers, not users. They are absolutely awful UX design, they are inherently unsafe, and unreliable.<p>Expecting users to vet that software is safe just because the source code is available is flatly a stupid idea. 99% of users for any piece of software will have no idea what they are looking at and are incapable of vetting it. Have you vetted manually chromium, vlc, firefox, vscode etc?<p>Publishers on PPAs don&#x27;t test against every distribution, and if they publish a package or dependency that breaks system libs than users are stuffed. Users would have little recourse. I doubt every ppa owner tests 14.04, 16.04, 18.04, 20.04 and 20.10 builds to check their ppa won&#x27;t break anything.<p>&gt;If we talk about the past and present, there has been no malicious attacks (or in number so small, that it&#x27;s hard to find reports). So much for the &quot;worst of the worst&quot;.<p>Which has inspired both RedHat and Canonical to try and move towards flatpaks&#x2F;snaps instead? The reason malicious attacks aren&#x27;t there is because ppas aren&#x27;t that popular because for good reason people tend to main repos.<p>Already on snap there was evidence of people bundling a cryptominer that was detected by Canonical. You think nobody has ever attempted to build&#x2F;publish malware through ppas? Please.<p>&gt;If we talk about the future, there&#x27;s no reason why a web of trust can&#x27;t be built. &quot;To reiterate&quot;, lots of PPAs are official, including the OpenJDK one, so if the PPAs approach happened to get traction, it&#x27;d be really a matter of software authors to build their own or to appoint somebody to do.<p>My web of trust is purely Canonical. I chose it when I downloaded their OS. I trust their repos and snap store. I don&#x27;t need to trust random Russian PPA for any reason. If a dev wants to publish something newer, put it on the snap or flatpak store or I won&#x27;t use it.')
