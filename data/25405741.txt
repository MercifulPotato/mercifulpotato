Item(by='gioscarab', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607857723, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25397985, text='I think the article misses that the HP 9100A was developed after HP acquired the patent of Olivetti Programma 101 and its italian r&amp;d electronics laboratory. Programma 101 was the first personal computer ever made and the first to actually fit on a desktop. It was also the first to use the magnetic card that was able to read and save programs, the precursor of cassettes and floppy disks or the first memory format based on &quot;magnetic paint&quot;. The patents and the laboratory sold to HP were fundamental to fuel the revolution of the following years and to make the HP 9100A. Italians won that race at the time, more than a decade before Gates and Jobs. I had the luck to become friend of one of the engineers of the machine, Gastone Garziera, his funniest quote when he finishes to describe his masterpiece is &quot;Very very easy, as americans say&quot;.')
