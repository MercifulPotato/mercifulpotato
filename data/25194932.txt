Whereas Japan (with the 0.00%) only counts people sleeping rough). Comparing unemployment rates has similar issues.<p>Comparing these kinds of rates between countries on an absolute basis is largely useless. However, the change in these rates can give insight on how events (political, economic, etc) have changed the demographics and socioeconomic status of countries.')
