Item(by='908B64B197', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608750857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506542, text='&gt; My peers and fellow classmates were doing exactly as he described in the book: taking “bird courses” instead of challenging ones, only taking the minimum requirements for their degree and avoiding the optional challenging electives, memorizing &#x2F; begging &#x2F; borrowing &#x2F; stealing &#x2F; cheating their way to the best grades possible in their classes at the expense of actual learning.<p>That&#x27;s why I love pass or fail.<p>Some places (Stanford does) let you take classes as pass or fail. That incentivize students to try something a little out of their comfort zone. If it doesn&#x27;t work or they end up not liking it it&#x27;s not a big deal. Same thing goes for the first semester at MIT.<p>&gt; In the COVID era of online classes, class averages have gone way up. The academic integrity offices of most faculties have been overwhelmed with cheating cases. If the true purpose of education is to better oneself, why are so many people taking the opportunity to cheat at a time when schools have less ability to monitor for it? This is a question that vexes me endlessly, as a student trying to get the most out of his education. I have been taking as many challenging courses as I can, and plan to continue doing so for the remainder of my degree. I don’t cheat and consequently I find myself well below the high class averages.<p>Caltech had tremendous success with take home exams. They select incoming students based on their desire to learn and honor. Maybe your institution is admitting too many students?')
