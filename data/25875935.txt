Meaning you may only see their pages 10x a month or similar even without a paywall.<p>The hope with the paywall is if you keep seeing it, you&#x27;ll go ahead and pay to unlock it, and the amount you&#x27;re paying offsets the transaction fees.<p>1000 users each paying 20 cents for ten articles (so assuming -double- the rate you propose, and charging only at the end of the monthly billing cycle) is still a loss of likely around 1&#x2F;4th the revenue even with a cut rate payment provider (due to the large fixed cost of 2-4%). So might make $50. It&#x27;s -negative- if using something pleasant to integrate with (because they will charge for that convenience with a larger fixed cost, like Stripe, who will charge $.30 + small percentage per charge), unless you work with them to design a new pricing model for you.<p>Converting 50 of those thousand (so just 5%) of those people to paid users at $5 each is going to be north of $200 you keep, even if you use Stripe and don&#x27;t negotiate anything.<p>And for those users that -will- load up a news site intentionally, the economics are even starker; a subscription means you&#x27;ll likely go to their site, and stay there. Pay-as-you-go pricing incentivizes you to not visit the site, and instead find other, cheaper news sources.<p>AWS pricing works because of the scale of the resources people tend to use, and that for businesses, using those resources = additional revenue. It is spending money to make money.')
