They have a fully open and documented REST API, a simple but effective local web interface, and any Cloud connectivity is completely optional.<p>I have never had one fail (N=25). Since installation, I have never had one drop off the WiFi or require a physical visit for any reason at all (one is installed in my boiler and it takes an hour to get it apart, so I really appreciate this!). I honestly don’t think a single one of them has missed a single rest API call in the time they’ve been running.<p>When initially installing them, this can be done from a mobile next to the unit, at which point you join them to your WiFi.<p>I’m not in any way connected with Shelly, just a very impressed user of their stuff.')
