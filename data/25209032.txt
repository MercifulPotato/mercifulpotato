The plugin is quite popular in community so I think it&#x27;s unlikely it contains actual malicious code (in fact I&#x27;ve contacted the developer and he said he has done some fixes for Apple&#x27;s security policies recently). Imagine my shock when I open an old project in Ableton and suddenly some sounds just don&#x27;t work. This really sucks, I don&#x27;t want to worry about whether my music will work five or ten years from now (I can imagine I may I want to remix some old piece). I suppose I can err on side of safety and export all tracks to wav.<p>However, it&#x27;s not an isolated problem. It feels that every other week something happens that undermines my confidence in Macbook as good device for making music.')
