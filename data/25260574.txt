I&#x27;ve certainly seen mailboxes grow, because they were receiving messages faster than I was processing them, and i had to rethink my design. But that isn&#x27;t an issue with the mail going into the mailbox; that&#x27;s an issue with my not scaling out my receivers to fit the load. As I mentioned elsewhere, that may seem like semantics, but to me it isn&#x27;t; it means the language&#x27;s working that way makes sense, and it&#x27;s rather an issue that I created a bottleneck with no way to relieve the pressure (as compared to messages that can&#x27;t be handled and just sit there causing receives to take longer and longer over time).')
