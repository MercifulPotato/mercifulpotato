Item(by='Qwertious', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610864786, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808459, text='&gt;Picasso had a saying -- &#x27;good artists copy; great artists steal&#x27;<p>I obviously can&#x27;t say what Picasso thought that meant, but I have a theory on what it actually means:<p>&quot;Copying&quot; vs &quot;Stealing&quot; refers to how well you break it down and use the underlying components of a design. &quot;Copying&quot; is more or less just mimicking the feature with a few tweaks, whereas &quot;stealing&quot; is redesigning it from first principles based on what the best ideas in it seem to be, and <i>making it your own</i>.<p>For example (not necessarily a good one, I don&#x27;t claim to be a &quot;great artist&quot;), take regenerating health in COD: the idea <i>appears</i> to be removing persistence between engagements, by resetting health back to full after you&#x27;ve stopped being shot.<p>Okay then, why not have regenerating ammo or regenerating grenades?<p>Well, it <i>looks</i> like it&#x27;s a stealth nerf against really good players - after a few fights without being killed, you have to fight without grenades, VS freshly respawned players (who statistically are the players who die more often) who <i>do</i> get grenades. Unless the player was conserving grenades through early fights, which is also a disadvantage (if self-imposed).<p>Okay, what can we do with this?<p>Well, if you&#x27;re playing a highly competitive game then perhaps add &quot;regenerating grenades&quot;, else add some sort of bonus score for getting killstreaks.<p>If you&#x27;re making a more casual game, then you can amp the regeneration effect up by giving more low&#x2F;single-use items that are essentially a quiet buff for newbies who&#x27;ll die before they get a kill anyway.<p>Maybe you could add a pool of none regenerating health to limit the effectiveness of it on pro players, without removing it entirely? Like armour that you spawn with, that blocks e.g. 10% of damage but slowly breaks as you take more and more damage?<p>Point is, this all started with regenerating health, yet now it&#x27;s informing grenade stuff. If you&#x27;d just directly copy&#x2F;pasted &quot;perFrame: health++&quot; with minimal changes then you&#x27;d miss out on a ton of useful tools here.<p>EDIT: also, you could take the mechanic in a different direction entirely - what would happen if everyone <i>lost</i> health outside of battle instead of <i>gaining</i> health? Maybe combine that with gaining some health after every kill, so people are forced to get into battles to stay alive?<p>Or, what if health was <i>always</i> regenerating, instead of only regenerating when you&#x27;re not being shot at?')
