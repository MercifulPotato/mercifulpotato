Open source doesn&#x27;t work like this. What you argue for may have merit, but it&#x27;s not open source. Just give it a new name and allow it to flourish under that name. I&#x27;ve recommended &quot;fair source&quot; ror &quot;ethical source&quot; before, for example. Someday we may find that this new movement makes open source obsolete! But until then, terms are important, and the members of the open source community would appreciate it if you respected that.')
