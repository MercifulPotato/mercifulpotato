Why does nobody point out, as written in the speech, the fact that prior to PCR Kary explained the process of PCR to all of the biochemists around him in great detail, and nobody even raised an eyebrow. nobody believed him. How could anyone call himself a biochemist if they couldn’t recognize a biochemical revolution after being slapped in the face with it by the person who invented it? There wasn’t a single missing step according to Kary, the entire process was mapped out and consisted of procedures and chemicals that already existed. This amazing paradox is lost on most people. They overlook it just like those fools overlooked PCR-on-a-silver-platter.<p>It’s the dark truth. Most scientists and doctors are basically frauds. They just memorize what the real scientists have figured out so far.')
