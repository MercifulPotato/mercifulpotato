You could then weight downvotes based on how legit the reasoning of the downvoter is (does everyone think you&#x27;re full of shit when you say it&#x27;s trolling?) and also based on whether you tend to downvote for reasons that are not actually worthy of a downvote (you just disagree with the post).')
