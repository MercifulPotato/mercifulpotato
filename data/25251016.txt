I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to a system where you&#x27;re confined to a DAW. Your entire computer becomes one big modular DAW that you can combine nearly endlessly.<p>Most perspectives on Linux audio tend to come from an angle of &#x27;working with what you got&#x27;, and looking own it as some sort moral handicap. However your comment sings a different tune. I really appreciate you inputting your thoughts here, as it concisely put together what I&#x27;ve thought all along but never assimilated. There is no reason why Linux shouldn&#x27;t be a percived as a first class audio production system. Perhaps the only thing holding it back is the time investment it takes to understand the modularity, along with learning Linux itself.')
