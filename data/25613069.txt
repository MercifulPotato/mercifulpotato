The text (date) recognition, like &quot;4pm shopping&quot;, should in its current state just be removed. I honestly don&#x27;t know though if it&#x27;s intentional, to create a place for companies like Todoist in the App Store. If the text recognition and user interface in Apple&#x27;s Reminder app would be better, I wouldn&#x27;t use Todoist anymore.')
