The way things are done now are nothing short of broken, PCI and more, and all the glue holding the shattered &quot;window&quot; panes together certainly doesn&#x27;t lead to anything secure or even a &quot;window&quot; you can see through. I&#x27;m certain there are millions that will disagree, job security of course, but when one has maintained critical uptime services on M$ as long as I have one begins to question there must be a better way. Solve your own problems first I always say as I am currently architecting that path, the sixth time of my career actually but this occurrence is different entirely.')
