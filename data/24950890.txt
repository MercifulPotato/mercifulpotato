It really does raise the prices of goods and drains consumer income and forces an opportunity cost of not investing in retirement, and not paying down mortgage faster (for example). It&#x27;s almost always better for consumers to lay out the capital up-front and own the item.<p>For businesses, the calculation is different. Maintaining appliances, or cars, or coffee machines, means redirecting resources (that you&#x27;re already paying for) away from building widgets to something that isn&#x27;t your core competency. Plus you get a bit of a discount because you&#x27;re working with pre-tax capital.<p>Again, it&#x27;s why car leases make sense for business, but are a terrible deal for consumers.')
