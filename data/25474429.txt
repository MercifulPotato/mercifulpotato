Colloquially it&#x27;s applied to things that &quot;do nothing,&quot; or have only a psychological impact but in reality the placebo effect continues to work even when people are fully aware that what they are taking is a placebo:<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;jebm.12251" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;jebm.12251</a>\n2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S1526590015000334" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S152659001...</a><p>So the situation is more complicated than &quot;figment of your imagination&quot; or &quot;wishing it away&quot; (this doesn&#x27;t work and isn&#x27;t what placebo is referring to by they way - you have to actually receive a treatment even if that treatment has no direct effect) - it&#x27;s clearly a real biological effect. Just the mechanisms are more obscure.<p>There&#x27;s obviously a limit to what placebo effects can accomplish even if they can be positive, and I think the goal &amp; point made is that because surgery is inherently risky, there should be an expectation of benefit over and above what can be accomplished with risk-free methods; ie., that surgeries which are shown to be only as effective as placebo should probably not be performed.')
