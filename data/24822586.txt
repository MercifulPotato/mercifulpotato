The city is theirs. If you are not one of them, you are only visiting. The city will never truly be your home. It&#x27;s possible to buy into this class, but the cost of doing so is intentionally kept so high that it&#x27;s unreachable to all but the extremely wealthy.<p>Has the city always been like this? I don&#x27;t know, but I wonder if maybe it has... if the various waves of hippies, post-hippies, ravers, hackers, and tech bros weren&#x27;t just visitors permitted to crash on the couch for a little while.<p>There are many other cities all over this country where you are permitted to become a true resident, often for a very sane price. I don&#x27;t get this feeling in most other cities.')
