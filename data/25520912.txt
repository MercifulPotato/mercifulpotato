Your time is only worth money (opportunity cost) if you&#x27;d <i>otherwise</i> be working on some money-making opportunity.<p>If it&#x27;s 1. Hiring someone for $25&#x2F;hr to mow the lawn while I work on a contract that&#x27;s making me $200&#x2F;hr, I&#x27;d choose to hire the gardener.  If it&#x27;s 2. Hiring someone to mow the lawn while I play video games, I&#x27;m better off if I mow it myself.')
