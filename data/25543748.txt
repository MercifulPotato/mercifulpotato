This is useful terminology because researchers know that there are other efficiency losses that need to be improved on, and that this one can now be considered ‘finished’ (although, some even look at other effects to try to go above efficiency ‘maximums’ that appear fixed at first glance: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mit.edu&#x2F;2019&#x2F;increase-solar-cell-output-photon-2-electron-0703" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mit.edu&#x2F;2019&#x2F;increase-solar-cell-output-photon-...</a>).<p>Note: For OLEDs, although the QE is high, the light output efficiency is not very high due to internal light guiding effects.')
