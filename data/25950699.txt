Please refresh to see the changes.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t that be configurable?  It seems like &quot;catches your attention very frequently like a distraction&quot; is actually not the right behavior for this.  Seems like the goal should be to call attention to itself <i>just</i> enough so the notes aren&#x27;t forgotten and are brought to mind to be started during a distracted moment.<p>I like the idea, but probably won&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s not a desktop app.  Some random ideas:<p>1. Color changing is a good idea.  Kinda skeptical about the font mattering much.<p>2. Moving location is probably a good idea.<p>3. Probably should pop itself up occasionally to be in front of the active window.<p>4. Probably should avoid popping up in front of &quot;work apps&quot; (e.g. an IDE, Excel) and pop up more frequently in front of &quot;distraction apps&quot; (e.g. web browser).<p>5. Steer users towards one thing per note.<p>6. Occasionally in specific situations (e.g. long time with browser active), the pop up should be unclosable for a short time.')
