Item(by='toxmeister', descendants=0, kids=None, score=6, time=1606566985, title='Show HN: Thi.ng â€“ open-source building blocks for computational design', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='The first stage of the new http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng website is live, an up-to-date &amp; hopefully more useful springboard to the 250+ projects and overview of my opensource activity since 2006...<p>Work is ongoing, collecting &amp; re-organizing projects, assets, documentation and extracting interrelationships (incl. older work &amp; music projects (e.g. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;synstack related), clients&#x2F;people...). Aim is a proper archive of the past 20+ years of outputs &amp; encounters.<p>This is the first website update since 2015. As the timeline visualizations show, building(http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng) &gt; marketing(http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng) - maybe unusual these days, but hey... :)<p>The entire site is generated w&#x2F; tools from the http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;umbrella collection, e.g. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;egf (graph file format), http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;csv (semantic CSV parsing), http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;transducers (functional data transformations), http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;defmulti (multiple dispatch for template engine), http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;hiccup (HTML&#x2F;SVG generation), http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;viz (timeline visualizations), http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;color (heatmap gradients)<p>There&#x27;s also a massive spreadsheet (148k cells adjacency matrix) to centrally define &amp; manage the 570+ tags used to categorize the 257 projects&#x2F;repositories and to batch update their package files (edits ongoing, much fun!). The tag&#x2F;project relationships are compiled into an HTML list with project IDs stored as base90-encoded data attributes for each tag in the tag cloud (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;#tags)<p>The timeline visualizations are generated directly from local Git repos, package files and associated metadata stored in a number of linked http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;egf graphs. The site toolchain will be released in due course...<p>Last but not least, any constructive feedback (good or bad) is very welcome! The next phase will include more individual project details, images, making-of docs, videos, xrefs etc. Currently, just a step in the right direction...')
