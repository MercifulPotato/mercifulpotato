And if they were, they would also be suppressing reported economic growth...<p>Surely by suppressing inflation they are increasing reported economic growth.<p>If the dollar value of the economy increases 10% with no inflation, then that&#x27;s 10% growth, but if inflation was also 10%, then that&#x27;s 0% real growth. So if the economy grows at the same dollar rate, but you manipulate the inflation number lower, you get more apparent real growth.')
