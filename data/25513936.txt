My MacBook Pro, which doesn&#x27;t have WiFi 6, can get speeds up to 900 Mbps over 802.11ac, so the design of the entire system is extremely important.<p>The landscape of WiFi technology is a complete joke. The consortium and the manufacturers market this crap about 802.11ax being faster, but that&#x27;s only under ideal, lab conditions. In real-world environments, it&#x27;s worse than black magic that sometimes works and sometimes doesn&#x27;t. 5Ghz has such terrible penetration power that it&#x27;s almost useless. You can barely use a single 5Ghz router to serve a 70m^2 home at acceptable performance. Unlike many houses in North America, homes in Hong Kong are typically built in concrete with rebar, and 5Ghz signals just get absorbed to oblivion within 3 to 5 meters. If you want top WiFi performance in your whole home, you need multiple access points and wire through the wall. But wait, what was the promise of WiFi again? Less wires! The irony!')
