You need to be highly motivated, otherwise it will be a painful experience. I concur with others saying that you either do it now or never. After you go out and start making big bucks it&#x27;s really hard to give up your salary for a PhD stipend.<p>- Most of my friends coming out of their PhD talked about starting a company and virtually all of them would have been preeminently qualified to do so. Yet, in my experience very few PhDs do it. Once you did a PhD, people expect you to continue to look very successful, which often makes people risk-averse.<p>I think you should go with whatever you really want to do the most. But remember that most chances never return (even if people try to convince you otherwise).')
