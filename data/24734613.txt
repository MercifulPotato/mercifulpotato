Employees are literally planning virtual walkouts because they felt that <i>Coinbase didn&#x27;t virtue signal enough</i>.<p>&gt;I am not in the know about bay area culture but that does not match my limited view from the outside.<p>Your limited view is in total contrast to reality. I&#x27;ve lived in the Bay Area for the past 8 years, and attempting to consider outside viewpoints that may be controversial might as well make you a Nazi sympathizer. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;14&#x2F;us&#x2F;berkeley-ben-shapiro-speech&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;14&#x2F;us&#x2F;berkeley-ben-shapiro-speec...</a><p>&gt;My focus on for this comment was not politic conversation in the work place but on how removing a large mechanism of knowledge and understanding transferal in the work place would have political consequences for society.<p>This is a non sequitur. No one is suggesting removing knowledge transfer and communication at work. People are suggesting limiting the amount of political activism at work that&#x27;s outside of the scope of what you were paid to do (the company&#x27;s general mission).')
