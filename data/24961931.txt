Item(by='ljm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604259820, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24961485, text='XML isn&#x27;t the most enjoyable thing to write (although we don&#x27;t seem to have a problem when it comes to HTML and JSX). There&#x27;s the whole debate around when to use attributes or children, and all that, which I can see would be a problem if the schema is poorly defined.<p>But then, it&#x27;s not like YAML is any better with how confusing its whitespace rules can be, and all the short-hand ways of avoiding explicit syntax (see: do you indent arrays in a hash or not? What&#x27;s up with having to double-indent in some cases but not another?). And given the length of many yaml-based configs, it becomes pretty much useless once you&#x27;re a thousand lines in, which you&#x27;ll easily approach with a CI config.<p>At least with XML, you could actually attach a stylesheet to it (even just CSS) and you&#x27;d automatically have a human readable version of the file, without having to bother with converting YAML or JSON or whatever. That&#x27;d simplify the generation of a lot of internal dashboards.')
