I&#x27;d put it at under 25%.<p>I don&#x27;t find that surprising because Google is a mess. They&#x27;re a very poorly run organization, making decisions that make no sense at times. Their inefficiency and&#x2F;or incompetence is probably the only reason why they haven&#x27;t wreaked havoc on all of the markets they have their hand in. And the various monopolies they do have are, as monopolies usually are, immune to stupid decisions that would kill most other companies.<p>I think it might be because their corporate culture of being the good guy&#x2F;&quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; is incompatible with the reality of their situation. Like cognitive dissonance at a corporate level. I wonder how many of their employees in positions of power are still living in that fantasy, and making decisions based on it?')
