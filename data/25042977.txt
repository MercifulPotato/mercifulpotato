It&#x27;s as if the article were saying:<p>&quot;If 1 is pronounced &#x27;one&#x27;, why is 11 pronounced &#x27;eleven&#x27;? My dictionary doesn&#x27;t list &#x27;ele&#x27; OR &#x27;ven&#x27; as a valid pronunciation of 1!&quot;<p>While jukujikun are really common in names (including place names and person names), they&#x27;re not specific to names. For instance, 啄木鳥 (kera) meaning &quot;woodpecker&quot; is more kanji than syllables, and 今日 (kyou) meaning &quot;today&quot; is also jukujikun.<p>Jukujikun need to be learned like any other word (you&#x27;re not going to be able to read it correctly the first time you see it, but that goes for any other kanji reading you&#x27;ve never seen before), but they would not surprise a native Japanese speaker (&quot;today&quot; is not a rare word in Japanese).')
