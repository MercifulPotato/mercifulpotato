Anyone sufficiently motivated to see strong connections between the actions of AWS booting Parler and Robinhood restricting trades is going to be so accustomed to seeing everything through a fact-lite &#x27;us vs the man&#x27; lens that it barely matters what corporations <i>actually</i> do. And those tempted by actual violence have had other causes to attach themselves to over the last 12 months anyway.<p>Also this isn&#x27;t people &#x27;asserting themselves financially&#x27;, this is people mug punting on a stock that wealthier and more financially savvy people who got in early are happy to unload their stock to. There will end up being people quite relieved they didn&#x27;t get to execute their plan to put their life savings into peak-price Gamestop.')
