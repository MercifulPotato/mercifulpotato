I have been on the same track, successfully too, for other types of pain (neck, shoulder and back pain). I post this here because this is an evidence based technique and think people should at least know that this is a possibility.<p>10&#x2F;23&#x2F;2008<p>&quot;Hi all,<p>I have been battling computer related RSI that runs from elbows to fingers for 10 years. It started 2 weeks into my first software programming job out of college, and has been a constant disability since. I went through ergonomics, biofeedback, drugs, acupuncture, physical therapy, 5 jobs, Carpal tunnel surgery, a year of rest, voice Software, foot pedals, hands free mice, you name it.<p>I finally gave up software and changed careers 2 years ago to a more Sales focused job and still couldn&#x27;t keep up with the typing. The only thing that has worked is having a full time computer assistant who sits with me and does what I say paired with a tablet PC that does handwriting recognition. Its dreadfully embarrassing in the workplace, slow, frustrating and just plain no fun. I got a rhythm though, got back on my feet and all went well for the last 2 years until a few months ago my throat began hurting (i talk all day now) and I was diagnosed with acid reflux.<p>With no arms and no voice, my future looks bleak and it has already been bad for almost a decade now.<p>I have officially given up on western medicine (my parents are doctors) and begun to explore alternatives. I stumbled on to Sarno and this newsgroup on Monday, read Sarno&#x27;s book today. Does it really work? I mean, I have had non-stop, permanent, 24&#x2F;7, life altering pain for 10 years. It has been my constant nemesis, battle, and focus.<p>It seems too good to be true.<p>I definitely have the personality traits, the onset of pain coincides with a rough first job out of college and my history of back spasms, shin splints and now reflux seems to fit the symptom imperative. I want to believe but can someone recover after this long of continuous computer pain?<p>-Dan&quot;<p>source: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tmshelp.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5187" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tmshelp.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5187</a><p>=====================<p>12&#x2F;12&#x2F;2008 (8 weeks later)<p>&quot;Hi,<p>I had 10 years of 24 hour a day, 7 days a week chronic pain in my fingers, wrists, forearms, arms, elbows from typing, mousing, and using a computer up until 12&#x2F;12&#x2F;2008 as a computer science student and as a software engineer. I believed I would live with it the rest of my life. It took me 8 weeks to fully recover.<p>I am an interesting case because I don&#x27;t have any major trauma&#x27;s in my childhood or daily life that led to TMS but just a generally stressful family and a high achieving, perfectionist attitude.<p>I grew up with a solid family unit, a very close identical twin brother, I was good at sports, school, had high self esteem. I went to college and was the captain of the track team. I found computer science and loved it. Things were on the up and up.<p>My parents got divorced when I was in college but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother me and transitioning to the working world. I was in a cubicle typing away and I didn&#x27;t like it but I &quot;sucked it up&quot; and did my job the best I could. I started getting pain while typing&#x2F;mousing and nothing ergonomic, or medical seemed to help. I plowed through the pain and kept working. I tried everything for 10 years. It was awful, bad, horrific and depressing all wrapped up in one. I finally gave up and left computers behind to be a project manager, and then a headhunter. But the pain was permanent and it still followed me no matter what job I did and how little I used a computer. My quality of life was pretty low. I found TMS 6-7 weeks ago and the recovery began.<p>I wrote an entry the day I found the TMS diagnosis and checked in along the way so the best way to learn my story is to read it below:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tmshelp.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5187" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tmshelp.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5187</a><p>I think I have a personality conducive to this type of pain defense mechanism. I am high-achieving, I have an intense and high achieving family, but I have a sensitivity to what others are feeling&#x2F;thinking that governs much of my decision making.<p>I think the key is reading enough information (posts, books, etc) that you are 90% sure that this is possible and could be your diagnosis and then get ready to do some serious crying. Its a personal journey that ends really well and it starts with writing down or talking about all the crap that has ever happened in your life. I started with when my twin brother got surgery when we were 4 years old - my earliest memory - and ended with my boss telling me that the phone system I installed sucks. And it had 1500 items in between. I feel flushed out now and clean and ready to tackle the world. This newsgroup has been helpful and the process is hard but I honestly believed I would have to live with this my whole life, and now I don&#x27;t. My phone number is at the end of my thread listed above. Call me, I would be happy to tell you about it live.<p>- dan&quot;<p>source: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tmshelp.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5301" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tmshelp.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5301</a>')
