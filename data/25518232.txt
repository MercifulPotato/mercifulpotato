Cherry-picking three of them to tell a story seems a bit fishy to me. SPARC and POWER aren’t exactly taking over the world. SPARC is still around in the same sense that MIPS is still around—you can still buy SPARC CPUs—but the ISA won’t be on your radar unless you’re interested in very specific applications or if you’re a retrocomputing enthusiast.<p>I’m not sure whether the ownership changes can be attributed as causes or as <i>symptoms</i> of ISA market failure here. My understanding is that somewhere from 2000-2010, the cost of developing a cutting-edge ISA + an associated line of CPUs got too expensive, and companies like SGI were priced out of the market.<p>In other words, MIPS wasn’t sold off <i>and then</i> it failed. SGI needed to get rid of MIPS because it was too expensive, and without the backing of SGI, MIPS was doomed to a “cheaper, older-generation” CPU niche. There but for the grace of god goes ARM, which happened to find a new niche because it was already optimized for a use case (low power consumption) that people started really caring about in the 2010s.')
