Item(by='zaroth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611240658, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25858390, text='There’s a lot of country out there in between those two coasts.<p>The FCC has to set a baseline number for what it determines meets the statutory definition of “advanced telecommunications capability”.<p>Practically by definition this number is going to be set based on what’s possible to provide over several miles of copper (long distance DSL).<p>&gt; <i>We find that the current speed benchmark of 25&#x2F;3Mbps remains an appropriate measure by which to assess whether a fixed service is providing advanced telecommunications capability. We conclude that fixed services with speeds of 25&#x2F;3Mbps continue to meet the statutory definition of advanced telecommunications capability; that is, such services &quot;enable users to originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video telecommunications.&quot;</i><p>The statutory definition is not whether you can download that iOS update in under 30 seconds. I think it’s hard to argue that 25&#x2F;3Mbps is not a reasonable <i>minimum</i> for “originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video” when the engineering specs for HD streaming are actually within that envelope.<p>You can move the goalposts and say it needs to support <i>4 concurrent high quality video streams</i> in a single household, but keep in mind the statutory language was written in 2006, and even as of one year ago no one would have reasonably claimed the minimum viable service level should be set anywhere near that high.<p>I think it’s reasonable to say that in light of the massive shift to remote work and remote learning it’s worth reassessing the national minimum standards for broadband across our 3.5 million square miles of land. That’s a job for Congress to change the standard.')
