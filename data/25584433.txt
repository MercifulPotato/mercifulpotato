New York City gets 65 million visitors a year. Los Angeles get something like 50 million. All of South Korea — never mind Seoul — gets just under 18 million. And let&#x27;s not even talk about New Zealand. Other than the hobbits, who&#x27;s going there.<p>In the United States our numbers are skewed by places like NYC and LA. The rest of the country is doing much, much better, overall. Moreover, we&#x27;re a free country. Yes, I realize that, on paper, South Korea, Thailand, New Zealand are also. But the kind of contact tracing and other measures that has gone on in some of these countries is simply unacceptable here, and rightly so.<p>I stand by what I&#x27;ve said. We are destroying this country in an effort to &quot;save lives.&quot; Your suggestion is what? More destruction?<p>If you read the original paper from the Imperial College, you&#x27;ll note that death estimates in the United States were from 200 thousand (if we followed their recommendations) to 2.2 million (if we did nothing). Remember, these were estimates. But you will see that we are close to the low end in actual numbers. So, when you say that the idea of death being inevitable is simply wrong, what exactly are you basing that on? Can you answer that? Where do you come up with your assertion?')
