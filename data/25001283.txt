Because the Bitcoin was illegally acquired (through hacking) in 2015, the statute would have expired this year, even though the underlying crime (hacking) only has a 2 year SOL.<p>According to the filing, the last transaction involved in the hack was in November 2015, so the statute probably would have expired this month.')
