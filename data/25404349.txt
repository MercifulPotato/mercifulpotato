When I was a kid, a nearby department store (Fred Meyers on 39th and Hawthorne) used a large-scale DECT system for employee-to-employee and paging. Each staff member carried what was essentially a ruggedized cordless phone with an earpiece and they heavily used DECT&#x27;s &quot;intercom&quot; handset-to-handset feature to talk to each other, and it was all on a PBX with their outside phone lines. I believe it was a Panasonic system. Panasonic seems to still offer such a setup that uses IP for coordination between the multiple DECT &quot;cells,&quot; but I&#x27;m not sure what was in use at the time. I remember it giving me an overwhelming feeling that my home&#x27;s DECT cordless phone was a disappointment to the technology&#x27;s capabilities.<p>For that matter I once had a job where I had a WiFi IP phone that I carried around, but I think cellphones have gotten cheap enough for corporate users that the wind is out of those sails. I keep thinking about buying one of those on eBay...')
