You&#x27;ll hit a floor where it could reduce costs, but not remotely enough to justify it.<p>You&#x27;re assuming that satellites are so expensive that the difference between Falcon 9 and Starship is not relevant but we don&#x27;t know this. Satellite hardware is usually very expensive but SpaceX is building them internally as a series product so they might be able to drive the marginal cost&#x2F;unit much lower.<p>It&#x27;s safe to assume constellation bandwidth (and potential revenue) scales linearly with total payload mass, meaning it is proportional to ($satellite_cost_per_keg + $launch_cost_per_kg). Unless satellite cost is much higher than launch cost there are benefits from switching to a cheaper launcher.<p>Since Falcon 9 design is mostly frozen and still requires throwing away an upper stage for every launch it has a price floor of its own. I honestly wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if launch is already more expensive than satellites.')
