You cannot just disrupt other people&#x27;s business arrangements for any reason at all.  Depending upon the circumstances, you open yourself up to claims of tortuous interference.  I think there&#x27;s an argument to be made here that this is exactly what Amazon, Apple, and Google all did.<p>Section 230 protections doesn&#x27;t apply here either.  It does protect against civil suits, but only for <i>good faith</i> attempts at removing <i>illegal content</i>.  It&#x27;s fair to question whether Parler has done a good enough job in that regard. If not, then the appropriate parties should sue Parler to force it to clean up it&#x27;s act.  But there is nothing inherently illegal about Parler, so there is no reason why these platforms deserve protection for thwarting the many perfectly legitimate users on the platform.')
