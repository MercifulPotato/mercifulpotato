Even if your VPN connection has 100% uptime they can do the traffic analysis I mentioned but since it&#x27;s almost certain that there will be some non-VPN requests they would already know that you have at least one Apple device.<p>The underlying issue here is that the kinds of things you&#x27;re worried about happen in the browser. Using a VPN adds reliability and performance issues but it doesn&#x27;t prevent this kind of basic identification and very, very few people aren&#x27;t going to leave some kind of far more identifying cross-site activity which would uniquely identify them rather than just narrowing it down to one of the most popular consumer brands.')
