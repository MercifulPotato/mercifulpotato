At this point, you&#x27;ve probably also damaged your relationship with the team; perhaps not irreperably but it will take some humility and some hard work if you want to catch back up.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s time to look for a different role? You may get a salary cut in the process, you may not, but either way for your mental health it&#x27;s worthwhile. Maybe you need to move into a role as a product owner, or coordinator, or even get involved with training.<p>Regardless of what you do, the time is nigh to take control of your life and find yourself a role that you can feel like you&#x27;re positively able to contribute to without having to do the parts of the work that are causing you anxiety right now.')
