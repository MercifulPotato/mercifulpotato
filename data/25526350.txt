Instead of just journal references, he littered this page with incredibly useful hyperlinks to difficult to find things such as the raw data for the Munsell colour chart and the Luo-Rigg data!<p>This should also be mandatory reading for people <i>not so serious</i> about computer colour, because heads up: If you do any kind of arithmetic on RGB bytes, you&#x27;ve screwed up <i>much</i> more than you think you have! It&#x27;s one of the most common examples of the Dunning–Kruger effect.<p>Need a nice gradient of colours to represent something graphically, such as low-medium-high values? Go to this page first.<p>Need to blur a background picture? Go to this page first.<p>Resizing images? Read this first.<p>Making colour schemes for a web page theme? This page first.<p>Adding a &quot;colour picker&quot; control? <i>Definitely</i> read this first.')
