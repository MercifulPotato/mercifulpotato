I&#x27;m on Parler and frequently see posts (I presume from left leaning folks) trashing the right side (e.g., Trump). Those posts are allowed with no issues. It is true that most opinions are right leaning (some viciously so), but that IMO reflects more on the members than on the moderation policy. Discussions on Twitter have a similar mix (left leaning to rabid Trump bashing), and I honestly don&#x27;t find any difference in the fervor, except that Parler is right leaning and Twitter is left leaning.<p>The general tendency these days, fed by narratives from interested parties like the media, is to mash all right leaners (pretty much any one supporting the conservative ideas and opposing the Democrats) as clueless, racist, redneck, neo-Nazis (a bit of hyperbole here, but you see what I mean). Once you think that way (that &quot;they&#x27;re all nub jobs&quot;), pretty much anything from leaking their user info to shutting them down to throwing them in jail would seem OK. Please, please don&#x27;t fall into the trap and accept the &quot;all right is nuts&quot; narrative and decide for yourself.')
