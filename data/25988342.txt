So?<p>&gt;<i>Actually when you&#x27;re in Safari you&#x27;re using their OS and SDK too why don&#x27;t they get a % cut of purchases and software there too?</i><p>Well, technically you&#x27;re not using their SDK. Just the OS and the browser engine. The SDK is just the JS runtime.<p>That said, they could. And people could use another platform.<p>&gt;<i>Just interested why one scenario is considered the norm yet these two others that fall under the same justification seem absurd.</i><p>In the end it&#x27;s a business decision, with historical (e.g. computers didn&#x27;t have this model in the past, phones&#x2F;consoles&#x2F;etc did), market, and other considerations.')
