A wise man once said that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.<p>I&#x27;m sure it has nothing to do with President Obama leveraging the IRS to explicitly go after conservative groups.<p>I&#x27;m sure it has nothing to do with Obama extrajudicially murdering an American citizen.<p>I&#x27;m sure it has nothing to do with Obama wielding the espionage act to prosecute whistleblowers more than all previous presidents combined. Bonus points for him wiretapping dozens of AP reporters. Yet when Trump tweets a meme gif of him knocking down a pro-wrestler with CNN overlaid on the person&#x27;s face, he&#x27;s treated as if he&#x27;s destroying the 1st amendment and calling to violence; yet Obama is putting actual intense pressure on newspapers for writing bad stories about his administration.<p>I&#x27;m sure it has nothing to do with Obama&#x27;s anti-semitism displayed in so many ways including paying Iran to continue building a nuclear weapon, legitimizing baby-wielding terrorists, or cutting the legs out from under Israeli led coalitions in the region.<p>I&#x27;m sure it has nothing to do with Obama setting back race relations, found by polling data, to pre-Obama levels by propping up dirtbags like Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin.<p>I&#x27;m sure there is some racism in there, but your claim that it is the pure and simple story is literally fantastical.<p>NOTE: There&#x27;s also racism the other way, demonstrated by the number of black voters who voted for Obama but wouldn&#x27;t vote for H. Clinton. Or is that too dirty a secret to mention? I haven&#x27;t run the numbers, but my bias is that the number of I&#x27;ll-only-vote-for-the-black-guy, as a percentage of population, is roughly equal to the I&#x27;ll-only-vote-for-the-white-guy, as a percentage of population.')
