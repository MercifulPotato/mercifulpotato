In reality - this &#x27;advice&#x27; is the revelation that anyone in  middle management makes when they get into their 30&#x27;s. Everything is making sausage, nothing is obvious except in hindsight, getting anything done is kind of hard, the company has limited ability to innovate on the margins, and social organizations are made of people, which means &#x27;it&#x27;s political&#x27; that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad, it just means you have to think about it differently. Middle management is hard, especially for those in staff positions without &#x27;direct power&#x27; and are not high enough up to have meaningful legitimate authority for the scope of a project.')
