Companies that feel free to abandon those principles are inviting the possibility of becoming one of those kinds of companies.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s a purely utilitarian argument. If Tesla is abandoning basic honesty in its accounting, then it&#x27;s likely that there will come a day where, almost out of nowhere, the company collapses. We saw this with Wirecard recently, so this is not a unrealistic claim. This is arguably the worse possible outcome of an investment.<p>My own views are very much secondary to what could happen if this continues. You should view this problem entire on the premise of what the real-world risks are, and how it could affect investors.')
