I wanted something that made it not only easy to view the photos, but to also see the location on a map, to zoom in easily to that location, to easily see the order of the photos and the trajectory of the travel as well as see the date&#x2F;time the photo was taken and make it easy to share with others. I also didn&#x27;t want to have to download any software and I wanted the free option to still have a lot of good features.<p>As a result I decided to create my own webapp. It satisfies all the above as well as converting the GPS data to a human readable location (Country and City) and calculates approx &quot;as the crow flies&quot; distances in km.<p>Yeah, I know, this is like the worst time in the history of humanity to be promoting an app that allows people to show off their travel photos given all the COVID restrictions in place now. I&#x27;m kind of hoping that people have some old geotagged photos of holidays they might want to share or perhaps they&#x27;re still doing a lot of travel within their own countries.<p>A demo of a web page with some photos can be seen here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapipedia.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;u&#x2F;drdave&#x2F;demo.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapipedia.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;u&#x2F;drdave&#x2F;demo.html</a>. There&#x27;s some documentation at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapipedia.com&#x2F;help_import" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapipedia.com&#x2F;help_import</a><p>Photos can be imported from the local device or via a public link Apple iCloud, Google Photos, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox and Flickr. Make sure the original photos are being used as often when photos are resized or compressed the location data is stripped away.<p>You can try it with as many photos as you like for free if you don&#x27;t want to save the page&#x2F;photos to the server. You can also save up to 100 photos in (one webpage) to the server for free and the page will expire after 30 days (create as many pages as you like).<p>Perhaps don&#x27;t try importing too many photos on your first test so you can quickly see if it&#x27;s working and get a feel for how long you might have to wait if you want to import more photos. Avoid selecting videos as they won&#x27;t be mapped and they could massively increase the amount of time you have to wait for the photos to get mapped.<p>Warning: some browsers, like Safari and some Android ones, strip away geotag metadata when you import photos into a webpage. If you have this problem try zipping them first (and importing the zipped file), or get a public link to a cloud platform (you can kill the public link once the photos are imported). Or copy the photos to a computer and upload using a different browser.<p>I&#x27;m fully expecting people to find bugs. Every time I test it on another device I seem to find more bugs but now I&#x27;ve run out of devices to test it on and all known bugs have been fixed. I&#x27;ve been driving any relatives, friends, and strangers on the street nuts because I&#x27;m always grabbing their device to do testing! Well, I was joking about the strangers on the street ... but now I&#x27;m going to strangers on the internet ... i.e. YOU. I&#x27;d love for you to contact me with any feedback, or just to say hi (always happy to hear from a fellow nerd): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapipedia.com&#x2F;contact_us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapipedia.com&#x2F;contact_us</a>. Thanks!<p>Cheers,<p>David')
