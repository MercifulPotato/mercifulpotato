The curved design of the kinesis is way better for reducing strain than the flat style of the moonlander&#x2F;ergodox. If the only factor is programmability, then I think that factor may be overexaggerated in how important it is. Know that anyone who wants to riposte that last point should realize that I&#x27;m not a novice to making my own keyboards or programming them. While layers seem like a good idea, it&#x27;s very difficult to actually come up with enough usecases to find them more useful than just the ability to remap keys and record macros, both of which the Kinesis Advantage 2 can already do.<p>I also find having two separate pieces a bit annoying since I&#x27;ll tend to want to fidget with them instead.')
