Item(by='chrsstrm', descendants=None, kids=[25706797], score=None, time=1610234725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700135, text='I built a small voice communication portal I&#x27;m calling Rally Call [0] that will be submitted to the Digital Ocean&#x2F;Dev hackathon tomorrow [1]. Rally Call is intended to be a backup group communication portal that can be used in emergencies and situations where use of cell phones is lost. It is essentially a group voicemail-box that runs on Twilio. If you and your group had the foresight to sign up for an account, you could use Rally Call to let others in your group know your status (&quot;Hey everyone, I&#x27;m OK. I made it out and am staying at a friend&#x27;s house&quot;) or to organize (&quot;Let&#x27;s all group up and meet at uncle John&#x27;s house in two days.&quot;). You dial in from any touch tone phone and enter your Crew&#x27;s Account PIN to access the account where you can listen to or record messages for the group. Only one Crew member needs to register for an account and can share the dial-in number and account PIN with anyone they want in their Crew.<p>While the project&#x27;s intent is a backup comm system for emergencies, it could obviously be used for any number of purposes. I still have a couple things to button up before submitting, but it&#x27;s mostly done and should be a solid MVP by this time tomorrow.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chrsstrm&#x2F;rallycall" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chrsstrm&#x2F;rallycall</a>    \n[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;devteam&#x2F;announcing-the-digitalocean-app-platform-hackathon-on-dev-2i1k" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;devteam&#x2F;announcing-the-digitalocean-app-platf...</a>')
