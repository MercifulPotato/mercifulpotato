As far as I can tell it&#x27;s not an issue of a properly or improperly operating appliance, but rather NO2 is an unavoidable byproduct of gas combustion.<p>I can&#x27;t locate the exact sources now, but it&#x27;s apparently very difficult to vent the NO2 to the outside with a range hood as the hood is so far away from the flame that a massive amount of airflow is required. This introduces an entirely new set of problems where makeup air must be provided to avoid depressurizing the house. If it&#x27;s hot or cold out bringing this makeup air is a huge waste of energy as heated or air conditioned air is exhausted and unconditioned air is brought in.<p>My quick solution for now was to replace the range with two portable induction cooktops which have been working great. I&#x27;ve been happy with now they provide the fast temperature response of gas although there was a bit of a learning curve at first.')
