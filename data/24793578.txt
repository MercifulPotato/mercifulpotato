My old NEX-5 doesn&#x27;t work with this new Sony software, and I was thinking about getting a new interchangeable lens camera mostly for webcam use. I think the right prime lens with a huge aperture could go a long way to making me look more presentable in video calls. In this environment it&#x27;s an investment in your appearance, similar to buying nice clothes, a gym membership, etc.<p>Unfortunately there&#x27;s very little information out there about things that are relevant for this application like resolution of HDMI out, ability to disable onscreen displays, latency, autofocus performance during HDMI streaming, overheating during continuous use, speed&#x2F;convenience of power-on sequence, etc.<p>Does anyone here have a setup with an interchangeable lens camera as webcam that they really like and recommend?')
