The fairness doctrine was abolished with general support.<p>&gt; Reporters argued that they, not the FCC, should make decisions about balancing the fairness of stories. They believed that the fairness doctrine had a chilling effect by deterring them from tackling controversial issues rather than worrying about whether they could meet the FCCâ€™s fairness standards.<p>&gt; By the 1980s, the fairness doctrine was losing clout. The deregulatory nature of the Reagan administration and the technological advances that were rendering scarcity arguments moot combined to pressure the FCC to abandon the doctrine. In 1987 the FCC formally abolished it.<p>(from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtsu.edu&#x2F;first-amendment&#x2F;article&#x2F;955&#x2F;fairness-doctrine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtsu.edu&#x2F;first-amendment&#x2F;article&#x2F;955&#x2F;fairness-doctri...</a>)<p>The fairness doctrine only <i>ever</i> applied to broadcast media, it never applied to cable or print media, which FB and Twitter are conceptually much closer to. Nobody ever (seriously) argued that a book publisher should be required to print rebuttals to a recent title. Nobody ever (seriously) argued that cable media had to follow the same pre-1987 FCC guidelines.<p>So, yes, I would say that attempting to apply a policy (and note: policy, not law) that was abandoned more than 30 years ago to internet messaging systems <i>is</i> a niche view.')
