The direct route is an unpaved road cutting across the countryside near two tiny villages if you can call that a &quot;road&quot;: more than half of the year it is an unpassable mud trap. The locals regularly need to use their tractors to get the hapless Google Map followers out of it. It&#x27;s so ridiculous it became a national sensation.')
