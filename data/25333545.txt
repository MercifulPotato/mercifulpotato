You can totally make your own components ala bootstrap (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;extracting-components" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;extracting-components</a>).<p>What this make interesting, is that you can do it at HALF.<p>For example, you can decide that &quot;components&quot; only are the shapes, but you must supply colors and dimensions. Or are colors and dimensions, but your must supply the shape (etc: As building block, you can mix-match).<p>----\nP.D: I&#x27;m building a niche ecommerce platform and TailwindCSS is far easier to theme than bootstrap, by a long shoot. Specially because in my case, my customers only care for &quot;colors&quot; than overall shapes, so I can hand-code the site visual structure and left colors and cosmetics open.')
