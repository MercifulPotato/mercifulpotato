It strikes me as if the people designing auth mechanisms and APIs and people designing usable UX are different species with different goals and value systems, and this leaks out all the way up to the user.<p>In many ways this is just growing pains.  For years people willingly handed their name&#x2F;password to third party apps and sites, and this granted those sites full auth.  This was too permissive, but extremely easy for people to understand, even for non-techies.<p>With things like OAuth, OS level capabilities in iOS and Android, etc., we&#x27;ve now got to break down these &quot;scopes&quot; into slices that are flexible enough to write useful software against without being too broad, too revealing of the underling software architecture (brittle), and too confusing for the user.  I think this is actually a really hard problem.')
