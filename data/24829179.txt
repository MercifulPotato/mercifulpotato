I know this because a friend of mine who is an average player got flagged that way after a stretch of games he won handily, including one against me where I checked computer analysis and noticed he made zero incorrect moves. A red flag popped up next to his screenname, I asked if he was aware of it and he said he couldnâ€™t see it and got no notification of it.<p>I love the shadow flag method for cheaters because opponents can avoid games with them and the cheater may never figure out what the problem is.')
