The project leadership continuously makes weird decision rooted in the believe that Gnome is THE Linux DE and everyone should dance under their flute.<p>This is an issue I&#x27;ve found scaringly true.<p>I&#x27;ve debated with some of their lead developers and they really seem to lack perspective. I once talked about that I don&#x27;t run either <i>ConsoleKit</i> or <i>PolKit</i>, this being before <i>logind</i> existed, and Bassi was competely convinced that I had broken my system and did not know what these things did — for surely everyone would run them, and would use the features he listed they would bring.<p>Of course, there is also McCann&#x27;s immortal quote “<i>I have no idea what</i> XFCE <i>is or does sorry.</i>” — this is one of <i>GNOME</i>&#x27;s leads who in 2010 apparently did not know <i>XFCE</i> even existed.<p>Talking with many of these persons often leaves one quite stunned at how they can be so ignorant about what goes on outside of their little bubble.')
