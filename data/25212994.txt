Item(by='sliken', descendants=None, kids=[25213607], score=None, time=1606331311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25212819, text='Dunno, the M1 CPU package is tiny, thin, power efficient, etc.  It&#x27;s got 4 memory chips inside the package.  I don&#x27;t see any particular reason why a slightly larger package could have 4 memory chips on one side, and 4 chips on the other to double the memory bandwidth and memory size.<p>However the M1 is already pretty large (16B transistors), upgrading to 8 fast cores is going to significantly increase that.  Maybe they will just go to a dual CPU configuration which would double the cores, memory bandwidth, and total ram.<p>Or move the GPU and ML accelerator offchip.')
