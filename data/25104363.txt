I feel you.<p>My girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me when I was considering proposing. It totally knocked me off the rails for some time. Suddenly all my ideas for what the future held turned to dust. I can&#x27;t imagine how much more of a gut punch it must be after 13 years, especially in our current world.<p>It&#x27;s hard to suddenly have to try and define yourself, your life and your future without including that other person. It takes time, and effort, and a certain amount of deliberate action. Be kind to yourself, and take your time.<p>Covid makes all this so much harder. One of the things that helped me was getting involved with a local theatre company (doing the tech side of things). Just being with other people really helped, and doing something new was invigorating. I&#x27;m guessing that sort of thing isn&#x27;t an option right now, but perhaps consider something like that next year. In the meantime, anything you can do, join or take part in that can give you a bit of purpose and structure to life outside of work will help. But I know all that is easier said than done right now.<p>If you need someone to unload on let me know. I didn&#x27;t always have that and it sucked.<p>The only other thing I&#x27;ll say is watch out for the booze and food. I feel lucky to have not fallen into alcoholism, but looking back I was closer than I realised at the time. It always gives me the chills thinking about how things nights have turned out.')
