Item(by='tjohns', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607630936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376285, text='&gt; There is a solid case that citizens requesting weather data should have such requests fulfilled at no or minimal cost, similar to GPS services (a public good) or FOIA requests.<p>I totally agree that weather data should be provided for free as a public service. The NWS is one of the true gems of the US government.<p>That said, this view isn&#x27;t universally shared. Many other countries&#x27; meteorology services charge for access to data - especially if you want access to the raw model output. Most famously, the US&#x27;s GFS output is provided for free while the EU&#x27;s ECMWF output requires a paid subscription.<p>If open access to weather data is something that&#x27;s important to you, please make your voice heard!')
