We live in a society. Someone has to keep the water running, the lights on, and the food growing. You can wave your hands and say “robots!” as if there doesn’t need to be anyone to create, manufacture, program, maintain, and improve them. But the bottom line is someone has to do SOME AMOUNT of labor. If you want to sit on your ass in front of the Netflix box, play video games, and eat fast food 24 &#x2F; 7 there is still someone that has to put in some modicum of effort to let you be a self indulgent useless entity.<p>In my opinion, the people who still do work should be rewarded. And IMO lazy people who don’t want to work should be stigmatized, but that’s apparently a brutal violent opinion for 2020 tech forums.<p>Why should you find a job you like? It’s human nature to want to contribute. It’s why we have crazy complex civilization rather than hunter &#x2F; gather subsistence. You shouldn’t feel “accomplished” for doing jack shit other than masturbating and laughing at content others created.<p>Think about who you respect. Who are your heroes? Musicians, artists, filmmakers, inventors, politicians, etc.? Not a single one of these people you respect sat around all day doing jack shit and writing articles about how unfair having to work is.<p>How about you do something worthwhile with your life and stop leeching off of society? You get one life, don’t waste it bitching about having to work. Find something you like doing and work towards that, or die having done nothing but consume what others created.')
