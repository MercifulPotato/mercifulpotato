Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25747342, 25741632], score=None, time=1610409693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25739240, text='<i>&gt; Learning QM consists of learning to silence your objections to the fact that none of the things you&#x27;re being asked to believe make any sense.</i><p>Yes, but the <i>reason</i> you&#x27;re learning those things is that <i>that is the way reality actually works</i>. That&#x27;s what happens when you actually do experiments. Richard Feynman once remarked: &quot;quantum mechanics was not wished upon us by theorists&quot;. We have QM because physicists were dragged to it kicking and screaming by <i>actual experiments</i> that showed them that reality does not work the way classical physics describes. And the reason all those difficult mathematical tools have to be taught is that that&#x27;s the only way physicists know how to build models that make correct predictions about what happens when you do those experiments.<p>In other words, yes, you can say QM doesn&#x27;t make sense, but that&#x27;s because <i>reality</i> doesn&#x27;t make sense--at least not if &quot;make sense&quot; means &quot;works the way my human intuitions, which never evolved to deal with quantum phenomena, say it should&quot;. Yes, reality <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work the way our human intuitions say it should. That means we have to retrain our intuitions--which is what a lot of learning QM is really about.')
