I personally was diagnosed with ADHD later in life and from the moment I took my first dose the transformation on my abilities was profound.<p>ADD&#x2F;ADHD medication is one of the true success stories of mental health treatment. Unlike depression, bipolar and other conditions if a person suffers from ADHD, in the vast majority of cases, they will improve and improve significantly with medication and the improvement has a rapid onset from the first dose.<p>I actually choose not to treat it in myself for a long time because I had already suffered thru schooling and it was not until a life event stacked so much responsibility in top of me that I imploded to the point where I could not put one foot in front of the other that I decided to actively treat it. Immediately I look back at all the struggles I had especially in schooling and realized I choose the hard path.<p>So while I agree that we are over-drugging boys, I agree ADD&#x2F;ADHD is over diagnosed and I agree that school sucks for all boys even the ones that do not have focus problems. I want to lend my voice to caution about rejecting medicating those that do have a legitimate disorder as looking back I realize I did myself a disservice by rejecting being drugged.')
