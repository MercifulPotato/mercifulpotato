The reviews clearly show the M1 Macs, including the MacBook Pro outperform most &quot;desktops&quot; at graphics-intensive tasks.<p>&gt;So no, M1 is not comparable to a Threadripper, it&#x27;s not even close, even if it consumes a lot more energy<p>Um… nobody is comparing an M1 Mac to a processor that often costs more than either the M1 Mac mini or MacBook Pro. However, the general consensus is the M1 outperforms PCs with mid to high-end GPUs and CPUs from Intel and AMD. Threadripper is a high-end, purpose build chip that can cost more than complete systems from most other companies, including Apple. However, it&#x27;s at a cost of power consumption, special cooling in some cases, etc.<p>&gt;Who cares if an M1 consumes less energy than a candle if I can buy 64GB of DDR4 3600 for 250 bucks and render the VFX for a 2 hours movie in 4k. Another 300 bucks buy me a second GPU<p>The MacBook Pro has faster LPDDR4X-4266 RAM on a 128-bit wide memory bus. The memory bandwidth maxes out at over <i>60 GB&#x2F;s</i>. And because the RAM, CPU and GPU (and all of the other units in the SoC) are all in the same die, memory is extremely fast.<p>From AnandTech; emphasis mine [1]:\n&quot;A single Firestorm achieves memory reads up to around 58GB&#x2F;s, with memory writes coming in at 33-36GB&#x2F;s. Most importantly, memory copies land in at 60 to 62GB&#x2F;s depending if you’re using scalar or vector instructions. <i>The fact that a single Firestorm core can almost saturate the memory controllers is astounding and something we’ve never seen in a design before.</i>&quot;<p>It can easily render a 2-hour 4k video <i>unplugged</i> in the background while you&#x27;re doing other stuff. And when you&#x27;re done, you’ll still have enough battery to last you until the next day if necessary. According to the AnandTech review [1], it blows away all other integrated GPUs and is even faster than several dedicated GPUs. That&#x27;s not nothing; and these machines do it for less money.<p>&gt;vertical products are an absolute waste of money when you chase the last bit of performance to save time (for you and your clients) and don&#x27;t have the budget of Elon Musk<p>&gt;The M1 changes nothing in that space<p>This is not correct… seeing should be believing.<p>Here&#x27;s a video of 4k, 6k and 8k RED RAW files being rendered on an M1 Mac with <i>8 Gb of RAM</i>, using DaVinci Resolve 17 [2].  Spoiler: while the 8k RAW file stuttered a little, once the preview resolution was reduced to <i>only 4k</i>, the playback was smooooth.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HxH3RabNWfE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HxH3RabNWfE</a>')
