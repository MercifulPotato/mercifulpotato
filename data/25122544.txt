Cases today translate directly to deaths in the 2--4 week future, at a best-case rate of 0.5% CFR and far more plausibly 1.5--3% CFR, based on present reported cases.[1]<p>2. US <i>new</i> cases per capita are <i>at least</i> on par if not worse than Europes&#x27;s.<p>3. EU daily case rates are trending <i>at worst</i> flat, and are generally decreasing.<p>4. US case rates are rising, at an acellerating rate.<p>The US <i>today</i> reports 158,363 new cases (7-day average), and a 3% CFR.  In ~2--3 weeks, likely daily deaths will be 2,375--4,750, or 7.5--15 per million.[2]<p>Germany, to use your favoured example, reports 18,363 new cases (7-day average), and a 2% CFR.  In ~2--3 weeks, likely daily deaths will be 367--550, 4.4--6.6 per million.[3]<p>All Europe reports ~220,000 new daily cases (16 Nov 2020, <i>not</i> smoothed).  in ~2--3 weeks, likely daily deaths will be 3,300--6,600, 4.4--8.8 per million.[4]<p>To provide an analogy, you&#x27;re laughing at Europe being in a ditch whilst the US is racing toward a cliff&#x27;s edge.  <i>Assessments of present health or wealth must include obvious future consequences or risks.</i>  You entirely ignore these, and reframed the initial criterion to do so.<p>Your analysis suffers from presentism and risk blindness and is utterly flawed.<p>________________________________<p>Notes:<p>1.  I&#x27;ll ignore the fact that <i>reported</i> fatalities undercount true COVID-19 fatalities as demonstrated by overall excess deaths by about 30% per an August 2020 <i>New York Times</i> report and other independent studies and data.<p>2. Using 1.5--3% CFR.<p>3. <i>Also</i> using 1.5%--35 CFR, despite Germany&#x27;s lower experienced CFR.<p>4.  Again at 1.5--3% CFR.  Based on reported values, whic <i>undercounts</i> recoveries, experienced CFR is ~4%.')
