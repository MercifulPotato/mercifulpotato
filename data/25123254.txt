That seems to have more in common with Abrahamic religions than from the first look of it. Like you we also believe there are other creatures that are immaterial: different ranks of angels and demons. What differs them from the God though is they were created by the Creator. We believe that this Creator is a person whom we can interact with, and that makes the search of divinity a fascinating journey, not just a mind game or scientific project. It&#x27;s a relationship with two sides.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by rational religion or compatible God? Like someone said in this thread that even our rational thoughts have unrational presuppositions at their bottom. And trying to make God compatible with our thoughts means reducing God to fit into our minds. He is infinite and eternal being. In one sense we can&#x27;t even say that God exists as our existence lies in Him.<p>I understand why people are sceptical to organised religion. But from my viewpoint and experience Orthodox Christianity offers a thousands of years of experience about who is the Truth and how I can participate about His life and become like Him.')
