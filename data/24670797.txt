It also returns so called google id, which links all of  your data. Instead of running this set of weird scripts you can open hangouts in browser, click &quot;New Converstation&quot; and start typing emails, then look in dev tools.<p>Then it just opens <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;contrib&#x2F;+person" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;contrib&#x2F;+person</a> id and there are your reviews on google map with locations obviously.<p>Then it tries to fetch your public albums from google photos using same technique, but that does not work anymore. When it did work, it extracted meta info from public albums. That&#x27;s pretty much it.')
