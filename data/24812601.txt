Item(by='ColanR', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602963860, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24812542, text='&gt; There has to be a rule for rules to broken. English orthography is practically irregular (although it&#x27;s vaguely, chaotically regular if you subject each word to an analysis based on most probable language origin.)<p>I mean, yeah. The rules governing English are a combination of the rules governing a couple other languages.  A large fraction of English follows French rules - might as well ask the French language to fix their spellings to make phonetic sense. The work put into that would translate directly to fix a lot of English.<p>&gt; Also, it&#x27;s far worse than this. The Normans changed the spelling of English words that were unpronounceable to them by adding a bunch of letters. One I remember is that the reason the &quot;-shire&quot; suffix is confusing is because before the Normans it was just &quot;-scr&quot;.<p>Personally, given the entymology of English, it makes a lot of sense to preserve the original, applicable, rules of the languages English is comprised of. Otherwise, it would be like rewriting either Norse or French to fit the other - as you mention, that&#x27;s even worse than the combination of languages in the first place.')
