Item(by='ColanR', descendants=None, kids=[24812826], score=None, time=1602963860, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24812542, text='&gt; There has to be a rule for rules to broken. English orthography is practically irregular (although it&#x27;s vaguely, chaotically regular if you subject each word to an analysis based on most probable language origin.)<p>I mean, yeah. The rules governing English are a combination of the rules governing a couple other languages. Divide up the vocabulary according to the applicable rules, and I&#x27;m pretty sure you end up with a fragment each of the French, Saxon, Norse, etc. languages, and within those fragments the rules make as much sense as they do in the full versions of the respective languages.  E.g.: put &quot;rendezvous&quot; &amp; &quot;accomplice&quot; in one pile, &quot;loan&quot; in another, and the rules of each pile would be internally consistent, and consistent with the rules of French and Norse respectively...accounting for language drift, of course.<p>A large fraction of English follows French rules - might as well ask the French language to fix their spellings to make phonetic sense. The work put into that would translate directly to fix a lot of English.<p>&gt; Also, it&#x27;s far worse than this. The Normans changed the spelling of English words that were unpronounceable to them by adding a bunch of letters. One I remember is that the reason the &quot;-shire&quot; suffix is confusing is because before the Normans it was just &quot;-scr&quot;.<p>Personally, given the entymology of English, it makes a lot of sense to preserve the original, applicable, rules of the languages English is comprised of. Otherwise, it would be like rewriting either Norse or French to fit the other - as you mention, that&#x27;s even worse than the combination of languages in the first place.<p>Edit for clarity.')
