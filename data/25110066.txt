It may be the case that demand in the art world defies the expectations of rational choice theory that demand will be a function of utility realized by the buyer if they are successful in the transaction, but prices are still driven by supply and demand.<p>&gt; Lots of people get to wanted status simply because they knew the right folks or were lucky.<p>How demand is generated and whether or not it is rationally-grounded has no bearing on whether supply and demand “flesh out”.<p>&gt; It isn&#x27;t so much originality or that there wasn&#x27;t a supply of art.<p>It&#x27;s that art works that you consider adequate substitutes for each other are not considered adequate substitutes by a sufficient subset of buyers such that the availability of tons of generic art at cheap prices does not drive down the market-clearing price of less-available in-demand art.')
