Roughly 50% dedicated trail, 25% on-road lanes, and 25% &quot;the trail is just gone, use your GPS to find the next segment&quot;. It&#x27;s a lot of packed gravel as well, not paved.<p>I had no idea it was going to be part of something bigger. At least on that portion, it&#x27;s not nearly as complete as the official map suggests.')
