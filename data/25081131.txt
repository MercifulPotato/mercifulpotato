Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605265895, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25077147, text='There is a third class of problems in coding that, at least for me, takes most of the time - definitely more than exploratory work. That class is what I call <i>code bureaucracy</i> - the part where you write code that shuffles and transforms data between components, or manages components. The components themselves may be well understood and already built, but they&#x27;re probably nowhere near each other and have incompatible interfaces.<p>Note it&#x27;s not the same as &quot;glue code&quot;. Writing glue code is a small subset of code bureaucracy, that happens only at the boundaries. True code bureaucracy begins when you discover that two components that need to communicate are on opposite sides of the system, and you need to carefully route a new path between them through half a project.')
