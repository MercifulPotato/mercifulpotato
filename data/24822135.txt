Seems like section 4e:<p>&gt; Exemption for certain services.â€”The obligations under this section shall not apply to a product or service by which a large communications platform provider does not generate any income or other compensation, directly or indirectly, from collecting, using, or sharing user data.<p>would cut iMessage (and any other Apple service) out. I guess the argument could be made that Apple indirectly generates income from collecting data and making it available across their devices as a form of vendor lock-in, but that&#x27;s shaky.')
