Maybe the real question is why there are developers the prefer coding in Ruby. In my case, I barely used C++ in the mid 90s and only read some examples of Rust and Haskell. I can&#x27;t really tell anything about Haskell. Rust and C++ look too hard to use, I don&#x27;t want to care anymore about all that micromanagement stuff. I&#x27;m really with Matz on this. I&#x27;m not with him on making types more prominent in Ruby. They are also micromanagement and I don&#x27;t plan to use those new features. There are plenty of languages with that kind of typing, there is no need to have another one.<p>Actually I&#x27;m doing most of my money with Elixir and Python now. Elixir is nice except for deployment, like all the compiled languages I know. Python is much like Ruby but with weird design choices. Oh well, I guess that people coming from Python could say that the weird one is Ruby.')
