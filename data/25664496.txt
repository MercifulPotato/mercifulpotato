Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609976923, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25661674, text='&gt; How did we arrive to this point where a huge chunk of the population is in one reality and another huge chunk of the population is in another reality?<p>It&#x27;s always been that way. We&#x27;ve been at war with each other since the very beginning. North vs South. Federalists vs Anti-Federalists. Nativists vs Pro-Immigration. Protectionist vs Free Trade.<p>Heck, just a decade or so into the republic a vice president and a secretary of treasury had a duel.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Burr%E2%80%93Hamilton_duel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Burr%E2%80%93Hamilton_duel</a><p>The easiest tell is in the name. &quot;United&quot; States of America. If we were so united, we wouldn&#x27;t have the need to put united since it would be self-evident.<p>The only times we&#x27;ve come together, briefly, is when we have a common enemy - whether it is natives, blacks, germans, japanese, russians, chinese, mexicans, etc. For a brief few weeks, the country was united after 9&#x2F;11.<p>&gt; Segregation of information sources? Politicization of media outlets? Self-reinforcing social bubbles? A combination of all of them and more?<p>Nope. You can have the same information and two people are going to come to two different conclusions. Forcing the entire country to watch CNN or Foxnews isn&#x27;t going to solve the problem. It is just going to antagonize one side even more.<p>You can argue that it is impossible for a country as large as the US ( or china, russia, india, etc ) to be &quot;united&quot;. Too many people across too vast a territory to keep everyone&#x27;s interests aligned. Heck, you can argue that these aren&#x27;t really countries but empires too. And all empires eventually crumble.<p>But the truth is that huge chunks of the population have lived under different realities in the US since the very beginning and has continued ever since.')
