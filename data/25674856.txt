Apple burned their bridge with Nvidia a long time ago, to come crawling back now would be a sign of weakness from the company.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t entirely understand how an eGPU would work on an ARM device. First of all, Apple would need to decide if the GPU can use unified memory, which is a double edged sword. If they choose to allow it, they would be creating a gaping hole in the security of their device. If they chose to use discrete memory, however, things would get really interesting. It makes me wonder how developers would maintain feature parity across M1 and external GPUs.')
