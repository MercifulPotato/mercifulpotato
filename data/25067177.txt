So while you could probably make a career as &quot;the tech guy&quot; at that kind of company, it&#x27;s likely to be an unrewarding position with limited opportunity for growth. (On the other hand, it might be a stable position, particularly with a big company in a lucrative industry like finance). Consulting for companies like that has more potential, but only if you&#x27;re good at negotiation, as you&#x27;ll likely face a lot of clients who want to nickel-and-dime you.')
