Unfortuanatly, when you go to those sites, you still can read ancient greek inscribed on monuments, despite the fact that they want you to believe otherwise.<p>This is a true story: When the Greeks were fighting for their freedom from the Turks in 1800&#x27;s, the Turks were using the Parthenon in Athens as their &quot;fortress&quot;. But they ran out of ammunition and started removing the metalic wedges used to hold the Parthenon together so they could make bullets. Seeing that, the Greeks send them ammunition so they would not destroy it completely. Not to mention of course that years before, the Turks let British remove parts of Parthenon and relocate them to England.<p>2500 year old Aphrodite is used as a magnet for the money-loaded tourists and not about saving the ancient greek culture.
