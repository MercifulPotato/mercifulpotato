So I&#x27;m not actually targeting the bottom of the developed world, I&#x27;m targeting the top of the developing world, if that makes sense. This price point gives me a healthy margin, and it opens up publication opportunities to the worldwide Fortune-5,000,000. It allows the 20-person agencies in developing countries to set up a Ghost blog without thinking twice, both for themselves and their customers. That isn&#x27;t happening with the current official Ghost pricing.')
