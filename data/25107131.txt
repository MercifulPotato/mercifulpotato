After nearly 13 years of usage I am a happy user of Windows 10 now. My reasons are:<p>* Horrible font rendering that makes me not even want to code<p>* Terrible application support<p>* Audio and touchpad support is noticeably superior on Windows<p>* Small things that you have to tinker with in order to get everything set up<p>But the most important thing is that I am just tired of tinkering. Nowadays I just want to open my computer and get on my programming job and have everything just work. MacOS seems to be a good compromise though (Application support and UNIX subsystem for programming)')
