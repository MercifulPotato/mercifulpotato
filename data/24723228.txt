Its purpose is roughly equivalent to TCP: provide a reliable byte stream transport over an unreliable datagram service (IP, though QUIC prepends a small UDP header mostly for compatibility with existing infrastructure).<p>You might be thinking of the HTTP server push functionality. That was introduced with HTTP&#x2F;2 and has been deployed for years already over TCP transports (i.e. totally unrelated to QUIC).<p>Due to how advertising networks work, I&#x27;d be surprised if anyone used server push in the way you fear.')
