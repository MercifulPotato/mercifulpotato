Item(by='supergirl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603448538, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24867537, text='&gt; What proportion of startups are founded by women? Only with this statistic can we draw a fair conclusion<p>The conclusion is pretty clear and damning for Nordic countries: for WHATEVER reasons women don&#x27;t get funding.\nYou can complain that the cause is not fully explained by these statistics. But the conclusion is pretty clear.<p>Btw, the article does try to explain the numbers more:<p>&gt; All male teams made up 83% of the startups but they raised 93% of total funding, which means that they raised larger sums.<p>&gt; For all-female teams, the opposite was true. On top of the female-founded startups finding it difficult to raise any money at all, the 6% of startups that did, only received 1.3% of the funding.<p>I only skimmed the article. I&#x27;m not sure if these numbers show how many women founders got NO funding. I think it&#x27;s common sense that women founders are very rare. But I don&#x27;t see how you can take consolation in this explanation.')
