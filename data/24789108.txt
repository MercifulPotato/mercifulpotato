Watch Guy Steele&#x27;s &quot;Growing a Language&quot; talk for my rationale.  We want a language that can continue to evolve and introduce or research new programming language technology.<p>ARC is scope-based memory management computed at compile-time.  It is deterministic and not stop-the-world.  If you want to influence the memory management for performance reasons, it&#x27;s quite trivial to do so by manipulating scopes.  There are also knobs and levers if you need direct control of individual allocations.<p>ORC is ARC but with the tiny addition of a cycle-breaker.<p>ORC will be the default because it&#x27;s more convenient than ARC while capturing all of the benefit.  It simply adds calls to the cycle-breaker that you may be uninterested in typing in yourself.')
