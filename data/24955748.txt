Developer B writes the new implementation based on the spec.  If B has any questions, she cannot take to A directly, the questions are routed through a lawyer to make sure that nothing copyrighted is exchanged.  (that last part might be overkill, but if the other party is Oracle you might want to use it).<p>If the developer who does the rewrite uses the original as a reference, it will be likely that enough of the structure will creep through that the project will be at legal risk.')
