To me, the BLM movement had every quality of a terrorist movement--burning, looting, murdering, for <i>months</i> while demanding policy changes.  That&#x27;s textbook terrorism.  But no one--absolutely no one--in the public sphere defined it that way.  Nancy Pelosi literally kneeled before the BLM movement.<p>I suspect a person won&#x27;t call violent actors terrorists if one of two things are true: They are successful, or if you are on the same side.  For BLM and the establishment, both conditions were met.<p>For those on the right, just having Cletus post a comment, &quot;Hang the bastards&quot; is sufficient cause to destroy a company overnight.')
