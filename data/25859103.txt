This is a perfect example of how brainwashed Americans are about &#x27;government is the problem&#x27; they will gloss over unethical medical malpractice by professionals and blame &#x27;the government&#x27; instead of being a little introspective about why a shitty unethical culture like this is not only allowed to continue but in fact expected. Its as if citizenship is some archaic ideal from a long-gone era to be replaced with rational utilitarianism where every actor is cynically out to screw over everyone else. and in the next sentence, as if aiming to create the perfect non sequitur, bemoan why &#x27;management by metrics&#x27; does not work')
