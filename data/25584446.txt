Item(by='slx26', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609353024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25584183, text='Yeah, I think this is a good point that doesn&#x27;t appear often enough in discussions about work in modern life. For example, when talking about work week length or women joining the workforce, people rarely stop to debate about the historical evolution in the time required for <i>other</i> tasks. On one side nowadays we have some nice appliances like washing machines that save us a lot of time. On the other we have increased bureaucracy to deal with. We <i>need</i> more complex machines like cars and smartphones and computers. There&#x27;s more to choose, and also more to decide. There are some mixed elements, like food delivery. It can save us time, but it also lowers the quality of life for most people. If you have kids, the modern expectation is that their time should be 26 million times more structured than it used to be 30 years ago. And as clothing and other goods are more readily available, there are also higher expectations around that, and around the food they eat, and around pretty much everything. The activities they do, the activities we do, the related requirements, keeping in touch with the news, etc. Sure, you might not care or ignore some of those, but in general, there&#x27;s an inflation in life complexity and decisions unrelated to our jobs. And even inside jobs, there&#x27;s this trend of ever-growing expectation of productivity and inflation of expected education and whatever. When we discuss work, we need to discuss it in the context of the current world, not compare it naively to a part of what we did in the past. And we often make silly comparisons that don&#x27;t really account for how much the world has changed in a few years.')
