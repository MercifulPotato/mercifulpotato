Item(by='inopinatus', descendants=None, kids=[25365450, 25366440], score=None, time=1607549103, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25365075, text='I was sold on hey.com&#x27;s UI design already because it&#x27;s using &lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt; for dropdown menus.<p>The really fun part, though: the summary content isn&#x27;t just a  menu icon, it&#x27;s a trigger for some (currently unpublished) Turbolinks variant.  The menu content is loaded (and subsequently 304&#x27;d) dynamically as a server-rendered partial (sans layout).<p>Most tellingly, if you visit the menu content&#x27;s XHR URL with regular browsing then hey.com renders that menu as the sole content in a page layout.<p>We can&#x27;t see the server-side parts yet, but if that becomes an out-of-the-box end-to-end behaviour within Rails, then in conjunction with Stimulus 2 and Action Cable I&#x27;m stoked about the possibilities.  Especially so since I have a mission to replace all my dropdown &amp; modal boilerplate with &lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt; and &lt;dialog&gt; elements, and I like to build services that still work if JS is disabled.  But it&#x27;s also good for mundane stuff like progressive form validation in line-of-business apps.')
