Trump never said &quot;storm the US capitol&quot;. Twitter&#x27;s official reason for banning him was for glorifying violence by tweeting that “The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” and that he wouldn&#x27;t be going to the inauguration.<p>If you can twist that into supporting the rioters and calling for violence at the inauguration, I don&#x27;t see how you can&#x27;t see calling for the destruction of Israel could cause people to be anti-Semitic.<p>If Trump tweeted that Mexico was cancerous tumor on America that has to be removed and eradicated, it is possible, and it will happen, do you think Twitter be cool with that? What if he had previously endorsed the genocide of all Mexican people? What if Americans had commonly been committing terrorist attacks against Mexicans?')
