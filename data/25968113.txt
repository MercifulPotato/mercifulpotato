Item(by='anticristi', descendants=None, kids=[25968162], score=None, time=1612004601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25967816, text='I agree with you analysis, but is this necessarily bad (or rather, is all of this bad)?<p>As a young researcher, my peers and I already noticed the &quot;customer-ification&quot; of academia. Taxpayers are investigating in academia, either via tuition fees or research grants, and expect to see returns: Either more jobs, more competitive national economy or a better life.<p>So far so good. Unfortunately, too much &quot;customer-ification&quot; leads to job insecurity for more junior academic members and kills &quot;moonshots&quot;. However, without &quot;customer-ification&quot; the system ends up with dinasors that do research &quot;for fun&quot; on taxpayer&#x27;s money, with no real return.<p>Now, I&#x27;m unsure how much &quot;customer-ification&quot; is healthy. I would argue that both too little and too much hurt. I was fortunate enough to see some of my more junior peers striving with &quot;just the right&quot; amount: They managed to get themselves on R&amp;D boards of companies, yet do research on fundamental theories. Think &quot;to truly make airbags reliable, we need a theory on controlling non-linear systems of type X&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what happened in the case debated here, but I genuinely hope that the departments that are under thread have some evidence for their usefulness (e.g. public outreach for medieval literature, joint-articles for pure math).')
