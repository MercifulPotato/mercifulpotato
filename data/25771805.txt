They cover a lot of stuff. I didn’t even know what fail2ban was when one of my VPS’s got hacked. Went through all their docs, they cover a lot and really helped me understand how much I didn’t know while at the same time providing guides on getting up to speed.<p>AWS won’t tell you about those things because they sell you security, so you remain a dumbass about those things indefinitely.')
