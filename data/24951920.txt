Sweden, for example, switches several weeks before the US in the fall and spring leading to a bizarre situation where the two countries are only X-1 hours apart instead of X hours. It has the strange (but sensical) effect of also moving meetings by one hour on Swedish calendars. But only meetings that were created by Americans! If the meeting was created by a Swede it moves one hour on the American calendar. This inevitably leads to some confusion. So we already have this problem, whether or not there is DST or not wonâ€™t really make it worse.')
