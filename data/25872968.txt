Technician (carpenters) goes to clients home to repair furniture in the middle of nowhere, so no internet. Adds the necessary paperwork which is pictures, declarations, contract (signed and scanned) to the Clients table. This company was employing hundreds of such technicians throughout the many counties of Germany, each with a laptop on them running this app which was the backbone for getting paid&#x2F;do the work. And was not uncommon to have more than one carpenter go to client home and do the repairs. Since each carpenter was paid according to its own work, each of them would create entries in their local Clients table and when getting back to HQ their work was manually uploaded to central DB, and only after that they got paid. I automated that (that was the job, to eliminate the thousands of hours that carpenters were wasting manually).<p>So given the above scenario, how is this system going to achieve that? Same table, and same client details even in table Clients, just different rows for different carpenters (foreign key to table Carpenters).')
