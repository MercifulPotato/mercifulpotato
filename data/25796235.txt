I think it&#x27;s something we&#x27;ve all had experience with.<p>At my first job, I had a horrible boss. A friend tried to speak up against him and was promptly fired. Turns out he was a relative of the CEO and was thus unfireable.<p>Just a few weeks ago I also spoke to someone who told his experience of reporting someone for sexual harassment at a major tech company, just to learn that they were well aware of it but refused to do anything because of good performance.<p>We should absolutely consider the role uninions can play regarding unfirable employees.
