Roughly speaking, if you pick a point in space and a particular direction in space from that point, there is a continuous infinity of possible straight lines in spacetime that point in that direction in space. One endpoint of that continuous infinity is the worldline of a light ray. The ball&#x27;s path is somewhere in the middle of that continuous infinity.')
