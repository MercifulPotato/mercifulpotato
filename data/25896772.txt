Also, debugging logs for that same purpose can be great.<p>&gt; Speak directly to your audience of future more junior engineers.<p>Often enough, that person might be yourself. I&#x27;ve been very grateful about my own comments in code areas that handled some obscure edge cases.<p>&gt; That means every jump to another class and every jump to an interface with multiple implementations is a distraction.<p>Not to mention multiple layers of abstract base classes. I&#x27;d say „write your code such that you&#x27;ll only ever need one IDE jump out of the current scope (and back in) to figure out what&#x27;s going on“')
