It even has options to ease the case when decompressing in the same memory range as the compressed data so that you can load data in RAM and decompress in-place.<p>I actually used it in a project (not yet open-source, but based on my open-source framework <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cpcitor&#x2F;cpc-dev-tool-chain" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cpcitor&#x2F;cpc-dev-tool-chain</a> which integrates exomizer).')
