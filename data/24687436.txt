Even Marquez is not going to win a race on a current generation Aprilia, and I&#x27;m not sure there is anyone <i>other</i> than Marquez who can win races on the current Honda.<p>edit: regardless, Dorna has done a great job making MotoGP competitive and MotoGP has to be at or very near the top of the list for the best racing on the planet.')
