Now we know.<p>It was known [1], but only by theorists, and theorists aren&#x27;t the ones building compilers and implementing real programming languages.<p>Obviously the Rust community has achieved an impressive feat of engineering, and I&#x27;m extremely grateful for that. But using a substructural type system to avoid needing a garbage collector is not a new idea, just one that Rust has successfully popularized.<p>It takes a long time for ideas from the programming languages theory community to reach the mainstream.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.ioc.ee&#x2F;ewscs&#x2F;2010&#x2F;mycroft&#x2F;linear-2up.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.ioc.ee&#x2F;ewscs&#x2F;2010&#x2F;mycroft&#x2F;linear-2up.pdf</a>')
