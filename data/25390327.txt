Can you build a nuclear reactor in less than a decade cheaper then storage and renewables? The evidence indicates no. But if you can, <i>the world would love that, just demonstrate it&#x27;s possible.</i> Until then, it&#x27;s hydro, batteries, renewables, and demand response full speed ahead.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451419&#x2F;lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-140.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451419&#x2F;lazards-levelized-cost-o...</a> (Lazard LCOE 2020, pages 3 and 11 are most relevant to our subthread discussion)<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energycentral.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;ec&#x2F;world-battery-production" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energycentral.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;ec&#x2F;world-battery-production</a> (&quot;As of Dec 2019, the number of lithium ion battery megafactories in the pipeline has reached 115 plants.
