Zoomquilt 1 [1] was created 16 years ago, in 2004. I sometimes see people bemoan modern development as being inefficient, and in this this case it really seems to be true. When I view Zoomquilt 1, the framerate is steady and CPU usage low. When I view Zoomquilt 2, Firefox spins up to 100% CPU use, the fans start going, and the framerate is somewhat choppy.<p>And as far as I see, the functionality of both is the same. Sure version 2 may have higher resolution images and some hue transformations, but surely 16 years of hardware improvements can handle that without consuming a whole core.<p>Morning moan over. Also, this is first and foremost a piece of art, and this comment shouldn&#x27;t take away from that. I just think this is an interesting comparison that is relevant on HN.')
