I cringe at some of the decisions that were made and how close you may have came to absolute ruin not just for yourself but your family as well. I hope the lesson people take from this isn’t “Never give up” but rather that startups are harder than you think and posting on forums is more of a crap shoot than a guarantee of any useful traction. Calculate that risk carefully to yourself and dependents and see if it’s <i>really</i> worth it.<p>Imagine if you were trying to launch right around the beginning of 2020.
