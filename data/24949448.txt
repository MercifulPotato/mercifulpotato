Item(by='shakna', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604124114, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24949150, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t mean to disparage your assertions, and fully agree with your ultimate point of not letting it get to you. That said, I look forward to the FM&#x2F;a test being more widely recognized.<p>FM is young. Keeping up to date on it is something I&#x27;ll leave to my specialist, living with it doesn&#x27;t require knowing the latest or greatest, so I don&#x27;t find it disparaging at all.<p>I mentioned the FM&#x2F;a test in particular because it&#x27;s FDA-approved under 21 CFR 866.5700 [0] back in 2012, which generally means it has moved beyond the experimental stage (the notification exception is because it isn&#x27;t a take-home style test, only a doctor can use it). There&#x27;s another blood test in the early experimental stages at Ohio State (Stage II) as well, and one from Oxford (Stage II) at similar stages.<p>Unfortunately, you&#x27;ll find that the Mayo Clinic doesn&#x27;t tend to keep up to date, either. They provide some good high-level information on the disease, but because of how young it is, the effort required to keep up to date on a deeper understanding, such as diagnostic options, is probably not worth it to them.<p>That and a lot of research into fibromyalgia runs into walls and funding problems. We don&#x27;t have a great understanding of the disease, but we&#x27;re getting there. The stigma of it being over-diagnosed is probably the most harmful part to research, when that no longer seems to be the case.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;cfr&#x2F;text&#x2F;21&#x2F;866.5700" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;cfr&#x2F;text&#x2F;21&#x2F;866.5700</a>')
