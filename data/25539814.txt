I have a python script that polls it when the screen goes to sleep or when I request a re-calibration using redshift.<p>It used to be automatic but it&#x27;s not stable because there&#x27;s only one point of measure. If I stood up and cast a shadow on the screen it decided that the whole room has gone dark and dimmed the screen to be invisible.<p>The only reason why I prefer that over doing it manually is the white point balance. It beats sitting around with a piece of white paper eyeballing it to match white on the screen.')
