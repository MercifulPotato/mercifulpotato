The flagships aren&#x27;t that much better than the $300-400 phones)<p>But I know a lot of people who think the iPhone is the premium phone experience, and if they&#x27;re going to spend over a thousand dollars on a phone, it&#x27;ll be an iPhone.<p>My point here is that for many people, the iPhone is objectively better.')
