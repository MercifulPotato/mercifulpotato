In the field of software these days, we don&#x27;t do much learning from prior art. It&#x27;s just too hard to keep up with it all.<p>Heck, I recall this happening with rubygems -- the introductio of the dependencies API to efficiently get the minimum data needing for resolving dependencies before downloading actual packages, and then several iterations on it -- and I can&#x27;t find any actual documentary evidence of it to share right now. I don&#x27;t know how anyone WOULD use it as prior art; the source code for a fairly complex project in a language you aren&#x27;t familiar with isn&#x27;t going to work, even if you knew to go look for it, which why would you.')
