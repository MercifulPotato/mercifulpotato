Go to therapy. Form new habits. Make sacrifices in your schedules to give your spouse what they need. Try and try again and see what works. Because your not just fighting for you, your fighting for your kids.<p>P.S. given that I am in a marriage that is approaching a decade in length, I can assure you that I know just how shitty things can get in a relationship between two people :-)')
