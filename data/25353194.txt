I think over the last 1-2 years there weren&#x27;t a lot of other choices.<p>Knowing what I know now, I think if you are successful something like k8s is required to scale and you are running non trivial apps.  For trivial stuff I&#x27;d go serverless plus some kind of managed app platform as much as possible.<p>For non trivial, there are stripped down k8s distributions out there that would work and let you work in portable containers.  I&#x27;d think pretty hard about something like Rancher to get started, and &#x27;graduate&#x27; to GKE &#x2F; EKS &#x2F; AKS when you hit scale with at least 100&#x27;s of VM&#x27;s.  You need to keep it in containers to plausibly make the switch though and not require a rewrite later.   I think Rancher deploys on all the major and smaller cloud vendors, is small enough to run on your desktop, still do development, and adheres to the API standards you&#x27;ll care about later.')
