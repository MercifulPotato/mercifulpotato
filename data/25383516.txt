I don&#x27;t have much patience for jank and I don&#x27;t usually go through multiple play throughs of a game like this.<p>And since, I haven&#x27;t been able to get my hands on one of the new GPUs at an acceptable price, I would probably wait for at least a few months before purchasing this.<p>Looking at the bad press coverage CDPR got for handling their staff, I am tempted to think that they haven&#x27;t handled their success with the Witcher series very well. Video Games production, in general, seems to rely a lot on careful management and highly organized work. So mishandling developer issues, like they have seemingly done, is very short sighted.<p>I hope they learn their lessons, as far as management is concerned and settle in for the long haul on this. If they can demonstrate good faith as they fix this game&#x27;s issues, the real Rockstar type money would come pouring in for the sequel of this game.')
