It&#x27;s common, but it still sounds wrong to me.<p>When I look for new jobs, I find a couple of companies (3-4) that match with what I&#x27;m looking for exactly, read up on the companies, tell them explicitly how I fit into what they need and write them personally. I have a 100% success rate when it comes to interviews, and most of the time I get a offer, but drop out when my counter-offer is too high.<p>On the other side of the fence (as someone who does hiring), if the application looks like something that can be easily copy-pasted and the applicant has no idea about the company itself or tried the product when I follow up, then the candidate very quickly goes to the bottom of the list.<p>Instead of focusing on useless parameters like &quot;CS degree, top-branded college&quot; and so on, try to focus on writing high quality applications for a few selected companies you know you can help. I&#x27;m sure your success rate will improve then.')
