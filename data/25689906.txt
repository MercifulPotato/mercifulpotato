Much more sensitive data than I share with Facebook.<p>I don&#x27;t give facebook my health, location or payment details. Apple gets all of that <i>and</i> extracts a fee.<p>I don&#x27;t give a shit about advertising, advertising is always about the aggregate.<p>What I care about is someone getting access to <i>my</i> data directly to do something with it. For me, my main fear is hackers and corrupt insiders.<p>Facebook is going to spend the next five years transforming from a naive company that is&#x2F;was loosey goosey with peoples data, to I suspect a fee extracting privacy first AR platform. You might laugh, but look at microsoft, look how they have changed.')
