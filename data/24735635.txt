It takes about 2 years to sound not like a dying cat on the violin (you can ask anyone), and about 3-5 years to sound &quot;ok&quot;. Vibrato itself take about 5-6 years to develop. Intonation (whether you are playing the right note) takes about 2 years to get a sense of, and 3-6 years to say &quot;ok I know when I&#x27;m off&quot;, and about 15 years (ie more than your 10 year example) to say &quot;ok I know how to improve&quot;.<p>At 10 years, a violin player is just getting over being a beginner into a moderate level.<p>Relying on a 1 year old violin player to teach you to play is begging for injuries (yes - playing the violin is an unnatural position and there are ways you can permanently injure yourself - imagine not being able to type ever again because your hands hurt) and possibly permanent burnout from the whole &quot;learning to play music&quot; enterprise.<p>No. In violin learning make sure you find someone who at least has gotten past the initial hurdles themselves to mentor you.<p>I can understand if you use some example like writing or journalism or photography to explain the &quot;curse of knowledge&quot; but violin playing isn&#x27;t one of those things.<p>I play the violin on an amateur level, and am about 7 years into my journey. I am only now at a level where I am able to give some tips without having to indemnify myself from permanently disabling people who ask me to teach them.')
