I got a Lumia 1020 because it made a clear setting point other than &quot;it&#x27;s 5% faster&quot; with the insane camera design.  I think it replaced a Galaxy SII LTE variant which was a quivering mess software wise.  I then got a 635 when the screen broke and it was too costly to repair locally, and a 640 when they were selling them for like 30 bucks on Black Friday one year.<p>I appreciated the consistency in design and that even the cheap devices like the 635 felt quite snappy.  They also seemed a bit more coherent with update support.  Yes, the no WP7-&gt;8 update path was a huge mistake, but I think by the end they were updating the OS for all WP devices (capable of being updated) centrally, rather than relying on the OEMs; the WP10 update betas I tried seemed competent enough but there was a growing sense their heart wasn&#x27;t in it.')
