The greatest threat for the average person isn&#x27;t climate change, it&#x27;s going broke. When you&#x27;re living paycheck to paycheck, dumping every penny you earn into rent, food and (in the US) student loans and basic healthcare, are you really going to vote for the people who want to raise your taxes, ban the cheap crap you buy and regulate their employers who will pass the expense down to you in order to keep their margins high?<p>No, all of those things are immediate dangers to your ability to survive. Add to that the constant threats that terrorists&#x2F;immigrants&#x2F;communists... are &quot;coming to destroy our freedoms&#x2F;way of life&quot; and people have so many more (both real and fake) threats looming over them that the distant and (to some) uncertain threat of climate change is basically at the bottom of their priority list.')
