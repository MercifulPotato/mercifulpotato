Public perception of market competition isn’t relevant to antitrust law. That the public is more aware of a company’s anti-competitive behavior doesn’t somehow absolve or even lessen the potential liability for the anti-competitive behavior.<p>Or perhaps I just don’t understand the point they’re trying to make? I’ve yet to come across this antitrust&#x2F;branding argument where the rationale has been explained but I’d definitely be curious to hear the legal theory.')
