Previously, modal popup options (i.e. for saving docs) could be selected via Option-letter, i.e. &quot;Save _a_ll&quot; could be selected with Option-a. Their new popups which may or may not be prettier force you to either use the mouse or turn on &quot;Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls&quot; globally and tab around. Neither of these options is as elegant as being able to select what you want with a single command.')
