You do not mean (AB&#x2F;C)D, because if you did, you could write the equally short ABD&#x2F;C. If you&#x27;re appending a multiplication by D after AB&#x2F;C, you could write AB&#x2F;C×D. Meaning is borne by contrast.<p>In any case, the practice of writing &quot;&#x2F;2π&quot; is pervasive enough that asserting that &quot;PEMDAS&quot; implies ordering explicit division left-to-right with implicit multiplication is at wrong at best.')
