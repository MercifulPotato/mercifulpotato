It&#x27;s akin to swearing off all liquids because of a lactose intolerance when consuming milk.<p>Veganism relies on the assumption that commodification of animals and products created by animals is considered unethical and should be rejected. I don&#x27;t disagree with the sentiment to a degree, but I also don&#x27;t agree with it absolutely. I do feel the need to point out that there is a Nirvana Fallacy within veganism itself, as it fails to truly define what is considered an &quot;animal&quot;, and what is considered &quot;commodification&quot;, and this is where conversations frequently turn into splitting hairs. <i>Many</i> animals (humans and not) engage in symbiotic relationships. Dogs will guard a home, and as a result, will be fed and protected by people in that home. It&#x27;s how families work, friends, etc.<p>If a sheep sheds wood, naturally, is it anti-vegan to use that wool to create a coat? What about skinning a dead cow (natural causes) for its leather? There&#x27;s a ton of gray area.<p>Veganism, at face value, is an idealistic platitude based on a beautiful notion, but it doesn&#x27;t work <i>on its own</i>. There are a lot of great things about it, but it has never held much sway in my mind besides, &quot;That&#x27;s a cool idea, and I like seeing strides being made to make it easier to make &#x27;vegan&#x27; choices, but I cannot bring myself to promote it&quot;.')
