The altitude was irrelevant in gameplay except for the falls and the elevators. I mean two objects weren&#x27;t allowed at (x,y,z1) and (x,y,z2). Just about that time I remember &quot;Descent&quot; and it was much less playable chiefly because it was full 3D and on higher levels often didn&#x27;t give any &quot;ground&quot; reference (i.e. axis z was not special at all).')
