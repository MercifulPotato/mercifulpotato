I never said there wasn&#x27;t any reason for conflict. I can see how feces and needles in the street might engender momentary disgust. But a brief comparative examination of one&#x27;s lot in life should be enough to turn that disgust toward pity and gratitude rather than contempt.<p>But the persistent pattern has been to use prisons and jails for the homeless until there is an outcry. Then there is a cessation of incarceration and a turning into the streets. This is followed by conflict from homeless and homes cohabitating.
