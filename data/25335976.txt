If you look at 7nm options, A12Z and AMD Ryzen 7 4800U, the former has better single thread, but the later has much higher multicore.<p>Unfortunately, I could not find any data on TDP of A12Z under full load, so it is impossible to guesstimate at the moment which design is superior.<p>UPD. Actually, there&#x27;s this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested&#x2F;5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a><p>If I am to believe the successor to 4800U will gain 10% perf  from switching 7nm -&gt; 5nm, design-wise it matches M1.')
