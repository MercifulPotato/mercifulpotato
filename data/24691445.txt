Anyone more healthy than that would feel the need to squirm and get up long before one would form.<p>Also, the way we sit in a chair isn&#x27;t exactly activating any muscles over just laying down or reclining in a La-z-boy. For that reason I do like the idea of sitting on one of those inflatable yoga balls.')
