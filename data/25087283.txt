Yes, I realize those are extensions - but that kind of control or extensibility isn&#x27;t even possible in Safari.<p>Which is actually the biggest reason I don&#x27;t use Safari, it has no support for profiles or user-chosen cookie separation (multiple different accounts for GSuite, etc).<p>As for Chrome just getting patched with zero-days - fine, but remember that Safari doesn&#x27;t have the concept or ability to do Site Isolation the way Chrome or FF do, Chrome uses the macOS sandbox the same way Safari does, and there have been plenty of Safari CVEs as well. Chrome is usually the last to fall at Pwn2Own; pointing out &quot;oh they just patched a zero-day CVE&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean much, especially since Apple pushes Safari updates far less often than Chrome does, and will often leave desktop Safari unpatched for weeks after iOS has been fixed.')
