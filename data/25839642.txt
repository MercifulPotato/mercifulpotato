I _briefly_ tried Chrome, but swiftly returned to Firefox.<p>Half my extensions are still broken on Firefox Android. I&#x27;ve been using Firefox desktop on my PinePhone off-and-on and not only do all of my extensions work, but it&#x27;s snappy and has a superior UX. I can actually access and manage my bookmarks with a sane interface.<p>And yet even desktop is sullied. Each major version tries to hide my bookmarks, or something equally egregious, and Mozilla frequently abuses my trust by promoting products and services through privileged channels.<p>It&#x27;s getting hard to justify using Firefox.')
