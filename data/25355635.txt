The creations themselves are apples and oranges...<p>Off-topic: Am I being overly sensitive today or could Altwork have responded better to this?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the write-up going through the different prototypes, it was very insightful. But the above paragraph seems very defensive. Paul in no way attacked Altwork, merely stated that their products are beyond his budget at the moment. Instead of saying that Paul&#x27;s DIY project is &quot;in no way a comparison&quot; to Altwork&#x27;s products, they could have commended Paul on taking this project on in the first place, highlighting the difficulties it comes with and how their product solves them. Just seemed unnecessarily defensive.')
