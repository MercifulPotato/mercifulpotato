Fingerprints are something different to both usernames and passwords.<p>In The Netherlands you can be forced to give your fingerprint to unlock your smartphone. You cannot be forced to unlock your smartphone via PIN, or share your password.<p>&gt; For example you can change both passwords and usernames but you can&#x27;t change a fingerprint.<p>Yes, you can. Your fingerprint can be unreadable under circumstances. With sandpaper you can remove it. Certain (physical) labour can damage it. Both of these are temporary. You also, supposedly, have 10 fingers, so in that regard you can switch (e.g. use a less common one, or one which isn&#x27;t temporarily damaged). Other day I accidentally used a razor to damage my index finger, used an adhesive bandage, and had to add a different finger to my smartphone. I wonder if you can use your toe.<p>&gt; Also fingerprints are more difficult to discover than usernames.<p>Inaccurate, and untrue. They&#x27;re all over the place. This is Bob&#x27;s phone. I wonder where Bob&#x27;s fingerprint might be. Might it be... on the phone? &quot;Oh, what a surprise, I didn&#x27;t expect that!&quot;, the forensic analyst exclaimed.<p>I would argue the following: a PIN or fingerprint should not be used to protect serious data. One could, for example, perfectly fine use a PIN on their smartphone, for authorization of unimportant data. OSes are not yet able to make this distinction though. Moreover, any time you use a password in a public place which isn&#x27;t one time, a camera can copy the data.<p>Slight tangent: other day I heard about a creep who stood on the bottom of a stairs, to make pictures below skirts of women. These pictures were then distributed between other creeps. I immediately imagined that being my daughter, and that thought scares the shit out of me. Given the advancements of things like cameras we need to think different with regards to security and privacy.')
