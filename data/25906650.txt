If the targeting company has a cookie of its own in the same place as a chumbox then the company is able to map everything Taboola knows to everything they know.<p>Given the efforts of Apple, Google and Mozilla to choke off this type of tech (third party cookie tracking) it&#x27;s interesting their valuation is this high. I guess they can still make much of counting anonymous visits and mapping them back to IPs for sale.')
