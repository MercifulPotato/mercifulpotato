By saying no, I don’t really give a fuck about what he’s thinking about me (will he like me, dislike me, resent me, respect me?) but I can only do that because if I were out of a job tomorrow I could still keep paying my rent and eat without skipping a beat. I’m not a millionaire either but I have built my life so that basic expenses can be met for a long time no matter what and that is in part because whenever I’m working for money, I get a better salary than most people in the country.<p>Of course you can also not give a fuck about what others think do you without money but it’s a lot more uncomfortable I’d think. Everyone enjoys having food on the table and a roof over their heads.')
