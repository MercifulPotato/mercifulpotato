They had two lawsuits they filed against competitors, both AWS and SearchGuard because they have basically been making money off of Elasticsearch. I don’t think those lawsuits are going well so they changed the rules, and will likely do so again if they lose money to competitors. I don’t trust them, in particular I don’t trust their founder and CEO. He lied to the community and is cashing in in the community’s work.<p>Calling the blog post “doubling down on open” is an insult to the community’s intelligence. They should be more “open” and honest about what their doing and why instead of playing the victim.')
