We&#x27;d get a call going, put the phone in the microwave and close the hatch. See if the call drops. The tech back then was 900Mhz GSM.<p>I lost that bet.<p>While we were at it, we tried all sorts of metal containers one can find in a household, and couldn&#x27;t find anything that would make that GSM call drop.')
