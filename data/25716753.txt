Watch it.<p>[a] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kristallnacht" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kristallnacht</a> -- Arnold also alludes to but doesn&#x27;t explicitly mention earlier events in the 1930&#x27;s, such as the Reichstag fire <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reichstag_fire" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reichstag_fire</a><p>--<p>PS. Normally I would flag messages by politicians without a second thought, but I think this one deserves to be on HN given its personal nature, its historical context, and the unprecedented circumstances.')
