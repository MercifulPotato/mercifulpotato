This box is  very silent. This is a custom build not an off-the-shelf server.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;louwrentius&#x2F;storagefancontrol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;louwrentius&#x2F;storagefancontrol</a><p>There is a whole &#x27;cottage industry&#x27; of people modding&#x2F;hacking their COTS server (HP&#x2F;Dell) to make them more silent, but that&#x27;s another effort, so:<p>&quot;bezint eer gij begint&quot; (Dutch)<p>Or: really consider your options and consequences before buying a rack server...')
