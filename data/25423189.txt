A slowly loading video is better than a 404ing video in Reddit’s trove of aging but still relevant topics.<p>Also, users complaining that it’s not as fast as Youtube (your evidence) doesn’t mean it’s “not working out for Reddit.” It has perf&#x2F;UX issues but it’s a huge boon for the users that click in to a topic with a video that would have otherwise 404ed.')
