Were I to compile reform proposals, I&#x27;d avoid such silly errors.<p>&gt; <i>jobs were lost</i><p>Which jobs are we talking about?

So should we start treating them as employees?<p>--<p>I&#x27;m often reminded by Winston Churchill&#x27;s wisdom advocating the rebuilding of their damaged Parliament exactly as before:<p>We shape the buildings that then shape us.<p>Markets, economies, society, beliefs are human things, made by humans, to benefit humans.<p>We can build the society we want, if only we found the courage.')
