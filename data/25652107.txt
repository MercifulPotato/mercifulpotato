I wish the Iranian government would choose to be a good citizen of the region and the world, for the sake of their people.<p>Ever since the revolution they took a purposefully antagonistic stance towards the US for their own ideological reasons. The sad reality (for Iran) is that the present global order has been created and maintained by US - so if you can&#x27;t get along with US, you are going to be a pariah.
