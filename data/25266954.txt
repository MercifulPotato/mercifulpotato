Which will use quite some resources.<p>So to actually use this you would have to reinstall (nearly) all programs once a week or so (no matter if source or binary distribution). While that is quite possible with modern internet connections, I am not sure if it solves all the problems you might think it solves. After all, even nowadays application authors could provide static packages, but many don&#x27;t do it.<p>After using quite a few distributions over the years, I like Arch Linux best at the moment, as the combination of binary distribution, with frequent updates, and the source based AUR, with the very large amount of packages, suits my needs very good.')
