You have chosen to give it away for use in the manner.<p>But the other side of the coin is that this is increasingly unsustainable.  Free&#x2F;open source software development works best when it is based upon mutual self-interest fostering cooperation and collaboration.  At the extreme, it is increasingly an altruistic&#x2F;parasitic arrangement (on the part of producer and consumer, respectively) where the producer gets zero benefit from their efforts but the consumer benefits greatly.<p>It has always been the case that there are more consumers than producers.  That&#x27;s an inevitability, and the number of consumers isn&#x27;t itself the problem.  But this simply cannot be sustainable at scale due to the limitations of available developer resources and ongoing requirement for unavoidable commitment.  It becomes exploitative because it sets up the expectation and demands that people work for free, writing code, reviewing code, maintaining infrastructure, supporting users etc..  This is one reason I&#x27;ve dialled back all my participation; it ends up costing me greatly in time, resources and stress, for almost zero benefit.  At some point, free is actually too costly, and paying for products and services is fairer all around.  We have, after all, invented a monetary system, companies and employment laws to ensure that people are properly compensated for their efforts.')
