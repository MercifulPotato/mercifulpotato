The 386 had both a 3.5 and 5.25 floppy drive so he quickly switched to the more sturdy 3.5 disks and moved a lot of work to the 3.5&#x27;s.<p>Everything was working great until he got a second similarly spec&#x27;d 386. For some reason the machines couldn&#x27;t read each others 3.5&quot; disks. So he called his programmer friend who stopped by and did some testing. Both machines could format&#x2F;read&#x2F;write their respective disks no problem. So he formats and writes a test file to a disk from each machine and takes them home with him.<p>My father gets a call from him the next day: &quot;call the vendor and have them give you a new 3.5 drive in the original machine&quot; Turns out the heads in the original machines 3.5 drive were slightly misaligned mechanically to the tracks. This caused the disk to be perfectly workable in the bad drive but fail to read in any other machine.')
