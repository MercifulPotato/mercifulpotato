This article [1] shows what I am saying, Core devs are funded by Blockstream.<p>You clearly didn&#x27;t read the linked comment because the article doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the arguments presented.<p>&gt;Lightning does not work. It is a centralized &quot;solution&quot; to a decentralized problem. Sure, anyone can make a central database, hold Bitcoin and trade them, that is just an exchange, that is what Lightning is.<p>How is lightning centralized? You can transact with anyone you want, and you maintain a &quot;tab&quot; with them, which can ultimately be settled up on the blockchain. You can also route payments to anyone else on the network.<p>&gt;What Blockstream is selling is not Lightning, their product is called Liquid.<p>Okay, how are they monetizing it?')
