Unfortunately, the real world is never so ordered and predictable that you can know for certain whether the country road you&#x27;re about to speed on is completely empty. Just like you, the rest of us have the right to use that road as well whenever we please.<p>Even if you were the sole victim in such an accident, you&#x27;re ignoring all the second order societal costs. Who will pay for the police time spent investigating the accident, delivering the news to your loved ones, and the cost of bereavement leave on their employers? Who&#x27;s going to pay for removing the wreck and fixing whatever infrastructure (e.g. the road surface) you might have damaged? What about the mental health effects on the unfortunate neighbour who discovers your mangled corpse? And if you&#x27;re only injured, how about the costs of an ambulance and medical treatment? We don&#x27;t all live in the USA where that is (supposedly) borne by the individual.<p>Whether you like them or not, speed limits exist for good reasons.<p>&gt; doing 35 mph in a 30 mph really going to kill anybody?<p>Demonstrably yes. Check out this study by the UK&#x27;s Transport Research Laboratory. The chances of killing a pedestrian rise dramatically from around 10% at 30mph. The likelihood roughly doubles at 35mph. Remember that kinetic energy increases with the <i>square</i> of velocity, not linearly, so even small increases in speed can have dramatic effects on accident outcomes: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nacto.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;usdg&#x2F;relationship_between_speed_risk_fatal_injury_pedestrians_and_car_occupants_richards.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nacto.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;usdg&#x2F;relationship_between_speed_risk_...</a>')
