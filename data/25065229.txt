If you want a build engine for a medium to large sized compiled language project, Apple has no options that make economic sense, since a Ryzen Threadripper will beat everything else hands down. The same is true of every other embarrassingly parallel, linearly-scaling compute problem.<p>In such cases, the &quot;speed&quot; of Apple&#x27;s own silicon doesn&#x27;t help at all.')
