Isn&#x27;t that a bit like jumping from the frying pan into the fire? I guess I was expecting to see the usual Scandinavian suspects, not France. Mind you not that there&#x27;s anything <i>wrong</i> with France, it&#x27;s just they&#x27;re grappling with the same issues the United States is. You don&#x27;t notice it as much because it doesn&#x27;t dominate U.S. news. But let me tell you, Western Europe is in a sinking boat as well. To abuse the metaphor a bit all our boats might be at different levels and rates of sinking, but they&#x27;re all sinking nonetheless. Which is all to say that Western Civilization is dying.<p>If I were to leave the United States I would avoid the West.')
