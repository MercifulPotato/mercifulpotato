Of course I cannot think of a better way of working with code that is not via plain text files (otherwise I would be already rich) but somehow I doubt that programming in 2120 is going to be like programming today: manipulation of code as plain text (although we have to admit that programming has been &quot;manipulation of plain text files&quot; since its very beginnings).<p>Git is still good for tracking changes in plain text files.')
