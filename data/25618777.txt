He perked my interest by mentioning that he thought that _everything_ would have a 5G chip in it one day - garbage cans, mailboxes - but otherwise did not by my judgment give any significant reason that 5G would change something in the market when compared to 4G technology.<p>Does anyone have a strong reason they think that higher speeds and (I assume) low latencies would unlock something in the economy we&#x27;re currently unable to achieve? I just don&#x27;t see it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;audio&#x2F;2020-03-13&#x2F;cristiano-amon-discusses-the-promise-of-5g-podcast" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;audio&#x2F;2020-03-13&#x2F;cristiano-am...</a>')
