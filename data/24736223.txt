Electrical metallurgy is very promising technology. Just replacing what we do now with hydrogen is about as difficult and will end up more expensive.<p>&gt; Check out Boston Metal.<p>MOE will release oxygen at around 1800 degrees Kelvin, making this highly impractical. I don&#x27;t think this could work economically without a major breakthrough.')
