The dairy company that makes Jarlsberg did not look happily at this and was able to get a ruling that Synnøve Finden was not allowed to do this.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dairyreporter.com&#x2F;Article&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;16&#x2F;TINE-and-Synnoeve-Finden-case-over-Jarlsberg-ended" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dairyreporter.com&#x2F;Article&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;16&#x2F;TINE-and-Sy...</a><p>What the article I linked here does not mention however is that Synnøve Finden complied in a bit of a joking matter where for all of the cheese that had already been packaged with such labeling they printed out black stickers that said “CENSORED” over where the wording with Jarlsberg was. In doing so they managed to get an extra bit of publicity.<p>I only ever bought Kongsgård once and prefer the original Jarlsberg, but I know that some people liked Kongsgård.<p>Seems that in a blind test more people liked the original Jarlsberg better too.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tv2.no&#x2F;a&#x2F;8119934&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tv2.no&#x2F;a&#x2F;8119934&#x2F;</a> (article in Norwegian).<p>And it looks like the Kongsgård cheese is no longer being sold since 2018.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dagligvarehandelen.no&#x2F;2018&#x2F;kongsgard-ost-ut-av-hyllene" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dagligvarehandelen.no&#x2F;2018&#x2F;kongsgard-ost-ut-av-hylle...</a> (paywalled, Norwegian)')
