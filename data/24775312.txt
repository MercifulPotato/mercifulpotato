Yahoo mail was irrelevant well before gmail surpassed them in users. The Yahoo comments sections (on news) were as active as reddit until months ago... but boomerland.<p>A topic might have 1,000 yahoo comments, 1,000 reddit comments and 1,000 tweets but what happens on twitter is the culturally relevant one. Reddit&#x27;s weirdo-land  is better than Yahoo&#x27;s boomerland, but Twitter is where politicians, journalists, CEOs, artists and such hang out.<p>Of course, money matters too. But, yahoo lost mindshare well before they lost users.<p>IDK if Google will go this way, but FB probably will. Remember that fb&#x27;s growth strategy was (1)Harvard (2) Ivy League (3) Colleges (4) High schools &amp; everyone.<p>I suspect that whatever fb decides to do vis-a-vid censorship, politics &amp; such...  they will be thinking of who, not just how many, user like and dislike it.')
