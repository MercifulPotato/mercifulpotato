That&#x27;s why it is collateral. However, this is a legal procedure and is not subject to their whims.\nIf they set it as a rent, I&#x27;ll just go to the guys who give me the same money, but I&#x27;ll own the device. Renting it means that I have no legal recourse against unreasonable search for example. This is not a house and I don&#x27;t have any rights written anywhere.')
