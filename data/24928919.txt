There is no such thing as implicit licences at purchase time - that&#x27;s why EULA and the likes of it are worth as much as toilet paper here. And in a lot of countries you can absolutely make copies of the discs you own, no legal issue at all. You usually can&#x27;t show it to large audiences, but that&#x27;s not because of the licence terms, but because the laws of the country prohibit it without paying a fee to the national association of artists. If I want to show a Blu-Ray I bought to a large group of people I need to pay a nominal fee to my country&#x27;s national artist&#x27;s association and then it&#x27;s completely legal - but I don&#x27;t even need to tell the distributor of the movie, or the owner of the copyright at all, that&#x27;s not my problem. Same with playing music at events and such - a fee is paid to a national organisation governing this, the distributor can say whatever they want on the box but it&#x27;s just irrelevant.<p>&gt;&gt;, you can&#x27;t modify it and redistribute it etc<p>Of course you can in certain ways and formats, &quot;fair use&quot; is even allowed in such restrictive countries as US.')
