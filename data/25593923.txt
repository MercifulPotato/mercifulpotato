The states trying to attract those businesses were engaged in a race to the bottom that to a large extent continues to the present.<p>Today, I&#x27;m of two minds about it. Maybe my state would benefit from an influx of jobs. And we&#x27;ve got plenty of land that isn&#x27;t being used for anything but farming, which is becoming an increasingly extractive and polluting industry.<p>On the other hand, whatever we&#x27;ve got to offer right now is apparently not enough, so I would wonder what further concessions my state would offer. We already have lower wages, non-competes, crumbling roads, and a gutted education system. Why isn&#x27;t that enough?<p>I think we&#x27;d all be better off if we could reduce the ability of state governments to pit the common people against one another.')
