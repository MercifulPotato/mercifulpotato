Turns out that there&#x27;s an interesting business story and a timely death tied-in here too.<p>I got curious because some of the tapes bear the name of an audio production company in Greenville, OH, a few miles down the road from my hometown. The booming male voice on the recordings also sounded familiar to me, too. I&#x27;m fairly certain I heard him on the local radio station that my father played over the PA in our family grocery store when I was growing up.<p>I did some searching and learned that back on November 30, the gentleman who founded the audio company, and who acted as the &quot;voice of K-Mart&quot;, died.<p>It looks like he was involved in ventures that persist today. His company EchoSat[1] (which I&#x27;d heard of with some past involvement in the convenience store &#x2F; retail petroleum industry) recently merged with an IT security firm to become &quot;ControlScan&quot;.<p>Quoting the obituary[2]:<p><i>He started Tower Sound and Communications while in Greenville to pursue a venture that would eventually spearhead &quot;in store&quot; broadcasting for companies such as Kmart (he became the voice of Kmart) and Jamesway which evolved into another corporation in KY called EchoSat that would use satellite technology in helping with multiple stores for POS processing and security.</i><p>There&#x27;s an interview with Lee Rutherford in 2011.[3] He absolutely still has that &quot;radio voice&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dandb.com&#x2F;businessdirectory&#x2F;towercommunicationsgroupinc.-lexington-ky-14562153.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dandb.com&#x2F;businessdirectory&#x2F;towercommunicationsg...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legacy.com&#x2F;obituaries&#x2F;dailyadvocate&#x2F;obituary.aspx?n=cecil-rutherford-lee&amp;pid=197199331&amp;fhid=8238" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legacy.com&#x2F;obituaries&#x2F;dailyadvocate&#x2F;obituary.asp...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BQqoQL3pkyI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BQqoQL3pkyI</a>')
