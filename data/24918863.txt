Serving static articles out of a database is always going to have vastly lower performance than generating the page at the time of authorship and setting long cache expiry times.<p>The problem with long cache times is that then some readers might see an out-of-date version of your page. I would argue that that is a small inconvenience to avoid no readers being about to see your article at all.<p>I know there are a lot of WordPress plugins that effectively generate the pages ahead of time and just serve those. I think perhaps that should be the default way WordPress works, at least for single articles. There is little gain in generating the whole page on every hit and everything to lose.')
