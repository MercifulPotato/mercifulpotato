But I probably wouldn&#x27;t do that with, say, openssh.<p>I can certainly sympathize with this:<p>&gt; and then waiting up to 12 months (if I&#x27;m on a six-month release tempo OS) for the fix to be available<p>but the needs of system administrators are not the same as the needs of developers. That&#x27;s why my development machine is on a rolling release, but my servers run Debian stable with as few out-of-repository extras as possible.<p>Those servers are really fucking reliable, and I don&#x27;t need a massive team to manage them. Maybe this sort of &quot;boring&quot; system administration isn&#x27;t as popular as it used to be with all of that newfangled container orchestration stuff, but this is the core of the vendoring argument.<p>Installing who-knows-what from who-knows-where can work if you&#x27;re Google, but it really sucks if you&#x27;re one person trying to run a small server and have it not explode every time you poke at it.')
