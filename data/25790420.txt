For one, I spent a lot more time interacting with people who were actually good at it. And by this I don’t just mean people with many years of experience. Often they were people with little to no real experience who are generally good programmers working on interesting projects and showed extreme aptitude. I’ve also noticed a sort of limit at my learning as I’m having more and more issues grasping what should be simple concepts and find myself unable to really learn the things that interest. When I look at the number of years I’ve been doing this (both as a hobby and professionally) my actual ability is rather embarrassing.<p>I’ll probably keep with it though, I’m too invested at this point to try much else. Most of the realistic alternatives sound even more dreadful and&#x2F;or require a significant drop in pay&#x2F;potential pay.')
