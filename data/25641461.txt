At least among a certain set, he&#x27;s a well-known &amp; respected author (here&#x27;s a NYT review of House of Holes [0]). It&#x27;s perfectly intelligible for a book about sex to be whimsical, raunchy, and intellectually serious all at once. He&#x27;s also written a pacifist take on the Allies&#x27; involvement in WW II [1].<p>I agree that neglecting to include a bio was a strange choice. But, as Jim Geraghty at <i>National Review</i> points out today [2], The venue (<i>New York Magazine</i>) is what puts this hypothesis into the mainstream. Conservatives have been suggesting this was a possibility for a long time, but a NYM piece (potentially) legitimizes the idea to a very different audience:<p>&gt; Baker is pretty blunt about the fact that many scientists have had these suspicions, or at least concerns, since the beginning of the pandemic, but didnâ€™t want to speak publicly about the possibility of a lab accident while the Trump administration was touting the same idea... New York magazine reaches a different audience from National Review, and it is good that a more left-of-center audience will be exposed to all of the evidence and arguments about this possibility. The possibility of a lab accident should not be seen as another crackpot conspiracy theory in a year full of them.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;08&#x2F;08&#x2F;books&#x2F;house-of-holes-nicholson-bakers-book-of-raunch-review.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;08&#x2F;08&#x2F;books&#x2F;house-of-holes-nich...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;03&#x2F;23&#x2F;books&#x2F;review&#x2F;Toibin-t.html?ref=arts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;03&#x2F;23&#x2F;books&#x2F;review&#x2F;Toibin-t.htm...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalreview.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-wuhan-lab-leak-hypothesis-goes-mainstream&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalreview.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-wuhan-lab-leak-hy...</a>')
