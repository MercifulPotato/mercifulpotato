It is &quot;thinking past the sale&quot; that does not treat the subject with the necessary fair-minded big picture consideration.<p>It&#x27;s not clear that reparations are a good idea in practice, or something to be &quot;achieved,&quot; or even strived for (they might do more harm in practice to the group they intend to protect, as many well-intentioned and politically extremist ideologies do) not to mention any considerations involving whether it would be possible to sustain, or affordable, etc.<p>Be careful with your thinking if you care about being even-handed with your empathy. Being empathetic is a fantastic thing, but don&#x27;t allow cynical people to hijack your empathy.')
