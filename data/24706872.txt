There&#x27;s nowhere for me to simply find out &#x27;the latest official information&#x27; for my province&#x2F;country in a reasonable and coherent way - a lot of web sites flush with tons of secondary, bureaucratic information, whereas there should be a &#x27;single web page&#x27; with the current &#x27;highly relevant information&#x27; and another &#x27;single page&#x27; to visit with precautions and up-to-date instructions if you&#x27;re symptomatic. Details on the side.<p>Like the ostensible annual visit to the doctor, I wonder if each healthcare system should put out it&#x27;s annual list of &#x27;key information&#x27; in something easily digestible, written for those with Grade 10 reading ability because that&#x27;s the lowest common denominator and frankly the intellectual level we&#x27;re all at when not focusing.<p>So thanks (I guess?) HN! No more grapefruit juice when I&#x27;m sick or having a headache with the ... <i>Tylenol</i>. Hey zeus.<p>Hw is that not on the label ...')
