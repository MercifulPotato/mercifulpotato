Item(by='monkeynotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605619778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25122816, text='&gt; You will understand this when you become a father<p>Such a BS attitude. For one, it&#x27;s self serving and selfish. It serves only to comfort the parent and has no consideration for the life their child will be handed when they become adults. Heck, even children and teenagers will suffer from freedom sapped by people who offload their agency to the government time and time again in exchange for an insulated &quot;life&quot;. How can you make mistakes and learn if everything is under the eyeball of an authority who has the freedom to do as they please as long as it&#x27;s in the name of public safety.<p>Life entirely without risk and danger, at all costs, is not a life at all, and that&#x27;s what you want to hand your daughters and sons?<p>When you blindly let this legislation through because the first page of the draft reassures you it will get &quot;assholes&quot; off the streets you also tend to become entirely passive about the rest of the legislation. All sorts of side effects and detriments to society can be ushered in if you don&#x27;t question big changes like this.<p>People with the mentality of &quot;at all costs we must be safe&quot; are doing damage that is irreparable. We must accept that life is implicitly hazardous at times.<p>I recognize my objection is futile, it&#x27;s impossible to argue any case in the face of &quot;think of the children&quot;. Genes want to survive and project themselves into the future, it&#x27;s hard wired into us. The more technology and organization we have the more we are going to use it to abstract ourselves the human monument rather than mere organisms. We really can&#x27;t help ourselves.<p>This is possibly one of the most defining and interesting times to be alive. We get to witness the beginning of a madness, what happens when life is able to achieve its goal only to find out it&#x27;s a meaningless dead end.<p>Wow, that got dark quickly.')
