My &quot;you need extra checks&quot; claim was mostly aimed at the additional things you add on to your code assuming that you are now zeroing out freed pointers, which I think can lead to dangerous situations where you may come to rely on this being done consistently when it&#x27;s a manual process that is easy to forget.<p>Left unsaid due to the fact I was out doing groceries this morning when I posted that was that I don&#x27;t think this is even a very good practice in general, as I explained in more detail in other comments here.')
