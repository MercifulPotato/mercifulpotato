More specifically it means to generate highly abstracted interfaces for common tasks and hiding all the boilerplate and problems from the humans.<p>Basically it&#x27;s &quot;decrading&quot; a developer to be a normal user who is just using some software. Which has the benefit that now every non-developer can do the same work as the developer, and they both have the same output and qualification (theoretically).<p>Thinking about, the endgoal of this is similar to a full self-driving car. You just name the target and the software drives you there.')
