It&#x27;s a tricky evaluation problem: The first meeting shouldn&#x27;t feel perfectly comfortable, the whole point is that they&#x27;re going to bring in viewpoints that stress you out. But incorrect viewpoints also stress me out. I&#x27;d love to demand scientific evidence behind all of their assertions, but have (kicking and screaming) come to realize that many important things in life simply don&#x27;t&#x2F;can&#x27;t have studies at my preferred level of rigor.<p>An idea: Hire a coach with the expressed goal of finding another coach. Like an interim CEO who understands they are not being considered for the permanent position. I tried this once, with friend-of-a-friend coach, and she couldn&#x27;t really break out of her reflexive attempts to fix me directly, but that&#x27;s n=1 and a convenience sample at that, so I think there&#x27;s still potential in the idea. Let me know if it works for you!')
