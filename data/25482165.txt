Item(by='tux', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1608419345, title='HN NFR: Hacker News New Feature Request', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I enjoy HN a lot, but I would like to see it improved a bit better. Nothing major, just a few more basic features will do.<p>1. Statistics Page. Counters of total registered users, total posts per category (like Ask HN for exp.), total comments per category, Total upvotes and downvotes for articles and comments.<p>2. Top Users. Similar like ledger, but with a bit more details like total posts&#x2F;comments this users made, and there upvotes&#x2F;downvotes.<p>3. User Profiles. A better way to add specific information like website, email, location, name etc. At least for those who choose to share that on HN.<p>4. Filters &amp; Sorting. This maybe the biggest one for me personally. A better way to search on HN with filters and sorting. Like for example; keyword filter:security sort:byDate<p>5. Keywords or Hashtags. This will be useful for things like Filters and Sorting. Just a third textbox under title&#x2F;url for this will do. Example; word1, word2, word3<p>(Any other ideas share in comments.)<p>And to all HN team thank you for keeping us entertained all this years!')
