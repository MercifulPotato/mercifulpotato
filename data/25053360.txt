Of course, any citizen can do the same if a pollworker is unwilling to do so.<p>In the event that the person refuses to cooperate, you can call the election center to get confirmation that they&#x27;re electioneering and—if so—you can simply call the police and have them deal with it if it&#x27;s egregious enough.<p>Realistically, the situation you&#x27;re asking about just doesn&#x27;t happen often enough to be of concern. Most of the time, people aren&#x27;t &quot;trying&quot; to electioneer. They&#x27;re just excited about their candidate, and when told about the law and asked to take down a sign or remove a hat, they&#x27;ll do so even if begrudgingly. The people who actually want to electioneer aren&#x27;t shy about it and step way over the line. For anything in the middle, simply make a judgment call and go with it.')
