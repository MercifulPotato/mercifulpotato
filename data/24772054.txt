Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602636659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24770657, text='&gt; It allows high-density crowds to continue having high-speed access<p>Is that an actual problem that affects many users and currently can&#x27;t be resolved with LTE? I don&#x27;t disagree that 5G will benefit carriers, but the hype around it being some kind of a revolution for the customer is overblown. The customer&#x27;s problem is very rarely a technical shortcoming of LTE or the earlier technologies and more about how the service is sold and priced, and so far despite 5G indeed allowing much higher capacity there&#x27;s no evidence that the industry as a whole is moving away from the user-hostile &quot;data cap&quot; model.<p>&gt; You can barely make a phone call on NYE.<p>Isn&#x27;t that a failure of the switching&#x2F;call control equipment or the inter-carrier peering as opposed to tower capacity?')
