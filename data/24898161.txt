I have a few free tutorials posted in my profile to get you started.<p>I am working on a complete course in programming for kids.   In my experience it was not till kids reached 9 that they really could run with ideas on their own and make things.   The one exception is if the parent is involved.  In those cases kids as young as 4-5 could do something with the help of the parent.')
