Different encryption models? Different algorithms for who is the active speaker? For how many and which audio channels get mixed and when? What about features like muting someone else or if there&#x27;s a host or multiple hosts?<p>All that&#x27;s just basics before we get into even the simplest extra but still required features like raising your hand, chat, file transfer in a chat, and so on.<p>As someone who&#x27;s worked in the space before, there&#x27;s no obvious or non-controversial way to do <i>any</i> of these. The &quot;common sense&quot; implementation that works in a business meeting case is often the exact opposite of what you&#x27;d want in a remote learning classroom, both of which are totally different from a government meeting.<p>And then at a practical level, differing clients would lead to madness as well. Imagine a training session where the host asks participants to click the &quot;raise hand&quot; button on their clients when they have a question... but half the clients don&#x27;t implement one, and the other 5 clients have it in different places in their interface and everyone&#x27;s confused. No thanks. :)')
