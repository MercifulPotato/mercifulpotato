I think what makes these two systems different are a few things:<p>-Overwatch at least had some method of selecting people that &quot;knew about the game.&quot; People that had never ranked competitively in CSGO couldn&#x27;t make decisions if someone was cheating, whereas it seems that the hopes for this new Twitter feature will be that anyone can &quot;fact-check&quot; a tweet. Even if evidence is required, it is beyond easy to find secondary sources that skew facts or statistics into a different connotation.<p>-Whether or not someone is cheating is pretty binary. They either are or they aren&#x27;t. One of my biggest concerns for Birdwatch is that it was likely be used on tweets that aren&#x27;t binary statements of &quot;write&#x2F;wrong&quot; facts, and will likely be used in mass-reports of those of other political stances. That, or shitposting')
