Everyone does that. That&#x27;s not special at all. The difference is that some people have fought so hard for so long that they realize that the only way they will succeed is if the entire system fails.<p>And these days it&#x27;s actually profitable to complain about the system to help usher in its failure. Just look at Bitcoin.<p>That mindset of focusing on things you can control has been overbought and now it&#x27;s about to tank.')
