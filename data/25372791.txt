It doesn&#x27;t look it is only for die-hard enthusiasts, seeing many beginner&#x27;s guides obviously addressed to non-technical users. Statistics are misleading anyway - they list like 69% of US homes having at least one smart home device, although my home (not in the US) has every one of them carefully disabled. I&#x27;m really curious to know from somebody who &quot;automated&quot; their home, what are their thoughts about security? That it won&#x27;t happen to them? That the drawbacks or possible losses are minimal? Or they put special measures in place to make sure it won&#x27;t happen? Are certain brands more trustworthy or more upgradable than others? Thank you!')
