If even HN readers can&#x27;t get this right, there is no hope of electoral reform in the USA to raise it to an acceptable democratic level:<p>ODIHR election observers must not be blocked anymore.¹ Elections are to be held on a Sunday to not disenfranchise the working population. Votes are always counted and tallied manually.² Postal votes that arrive after the election date must be invalidated. Amend the constitution to require elections to be universal, direct, free, equal, secret, transparent and effective.³<p>If anyone is against these reforms, well, I&#x27;m certain Taibbi will not hesitate to call you too un-American, wrong and other things.<p>----<p>¹ The USA are a member state.<p>² This must be done so that the proper following of the procedure can be verified by anyone. Voting computers cannot be verified by just anyone. –– Using voting computers, being general purpose computers, are inherently easy to manipulate. Cracking just one model enables wide-spread fraud. Counting manually however means that wide-spread voting fraud requires undermining each location separately which is much harder to pull off and also multiplies the risk of detection.<p>³ These words have a specific legal meaning.')
