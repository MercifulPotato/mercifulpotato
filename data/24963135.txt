Shouldn&#x27;t the magic of the &quot;free market&quot; mean that fire insurance explicitly does <i>not</i> hide the cost of living in someplace that has a fire issue?  The insurance company has to take in more than it pays out, even considering that they invest the premiums to maintain buying power, or juice profit margins a bit.  In general, your premiums should be roughly equal to your risk (amount of loss, weighted by probability of loss), plus a bit to go toward the company&#x27;s bottom line.')
