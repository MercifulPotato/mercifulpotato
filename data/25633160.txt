The union exists to serve it&#x27;s members. If serving it&#x27;s members might be slightly more difficult if it actually accommodates the choices of the members it serves, well that&#x27;s it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s job is not to make it&#x27;s job easier, it&#x27;s to serve the members. If the district tries to pressure other members because some make a certain choice, or not provide a safe working environment, <i>That is the fight the union should fight.</i> Not bullying members against making the choice the members feels is the right one to best serve the students.<p>The <i>possibility</i> of adversarial action by the school district is insufficient to justify the union&#x27;s actions, especially when, in the case of my school district, the district has otherwise been very responsive to the concerns of the union with respect to health &amp; safety protocols.')
