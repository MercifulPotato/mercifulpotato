Item(by='mekkkkkk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608299520, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25466138, text='Yeah, I think GTA has been doing a good job at handling these things gracefully.<p>Regarding your second point, I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;ve seen how it&#x27;s handled in CP? Basically all roads in the distance have a string of car&#x2F;headlight sprites (yes, 2D) moving on them. Makes the world look amazingly populated and alive.<p>However the density of the sprite cars is much higher than the actual cars (depending on your settings). So when driving on a long road you always seem to be chasing a large group of cars that you can never reach. There seems to be no connection between actual cars spawning in and the sprite based crowd illusion.<p>And if you use a scope with good zoom to observe the sprite cars, it looks very funny. Basically you have very obvious Doom faux-3D sprites in an otherwise stunning environment.')
