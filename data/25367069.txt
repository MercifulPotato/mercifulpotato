Websites are already liable for any illegal content they host if they don&#x27;t make a good-faith effort to have it removed quickly. Fake news isn&#x27;t illegal, this isn&#x27;t something that would be improved by rescinding section 230.<p>&gt; <i>There&#x27;s also the notion that in a free society, companies shouldn&#x27;t have the freedom to discriminate on the basis of someone&#x27;s politics</i><p>This has no practical meaning because literally anything can be framed as political issue. For example, the efficacy of masks and vaccines.<p>&gt; <i>People who oppose discrimination on the basis of certain protected categories have the opportunity to explain why political views are not one of those categories.</i><p>Protected classes are the few exceptions to the rule, the burden is on you to explain why politics should be added to the list.')
