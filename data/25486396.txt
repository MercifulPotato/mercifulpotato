Judging from my experience, I think the tactical DDD patterns are straight forward to implement. I didn&#x27;t mention this in my post, but the Node.js framework was only concerned with CQRS &amp; Event Sourcing.<p>I fully agree with you that (static) types are inevitable for tackling rich&#x2F;complex domains adequately. Personally, I would often recommend the use of TypeScript over plain JavaScript.<p>As for the book, when I started working on it, I was using plain JavaScript. Over the course of the past four years, there were times, when I considered to rewrite the DDD parts with TypeScript. My current plan is to add an appendix or integrate additional content about (static) typing.<p>While types are an important aspect for the Domain layer, I think the rest of the book works fine without TypeScript. Its absence might even help to keep the code example more concise.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m curious whether you used plain JavaScript on the professional projects?<p>Yes, in both relevant projects we were using plain JavaScript (or CoffeeScript). We had many runtime type checks and a high test coverage to overcome the lack of static types. TypeScript would have definitely been the better choice.')
