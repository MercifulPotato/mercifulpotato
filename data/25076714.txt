The HN crowd may seem fringe, but they are living in the future. I de-Googled my entire life over similar transgressions by Google and several of my friends are gradually going through the same process, albeit more slowly.<p>And even though I just bought an MBP16, Apple monitoring every binary I run makes me want to sell it immediately and never buy another iPhone, Watch or Macbook. No one is going to catch Apple on performance and form factor for a long time, but I&#x27;m willing to invest in a long-term ecosystem that won&#x27;t allow things like this...as long as I don&#x27;t need to debug audio drivers. I am done with that phase of my life.<p>So if I had to choose an alternate path, what would such a path look like that could eventually approach the build quality of an Apple Macbook Pro? That product doesn&#x27;t have to exist yet, it just has to be on the path.<p>(I looked at Alienware&#x27;s M2 and M3, but it cost about the same as an MBP16 but with more blue LEDs.)')
