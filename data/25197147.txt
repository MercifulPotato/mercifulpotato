However, steering a 2D car is simple enough that a linear function is more than sufficient, and neural networks are unnecessary.<p>This depends entirely on the definition of &#x27;steering a 2D car&#x27;. In the model used, throttle is simply proportional to the distance to the nearest wall in front of the car. This means the agent will never accelerate coming out of a corner, because it can&#x27;t know it has the headroom to steer away from the wall as it&#x27;s coming out.<p>Similarly, the model for steering inherently steers the car towards the middle of the track. I would expect the car to wobble from left to right if the road&#x27;s edges are ragged, make up its own corners if the track edges describe a &#x27;fake&#x27; turn on a straight bit, and the car would likely crash if it were to encounter a Y junction or a pit stop. The neural network agents showed smarter behavior here because it is able to capture more complex cross-dependence between different inputs.<p>On the topic of junctions, if the track were to include them, perhaps it&#x27;d be nice if the car chose the quickest route to optimize for lap times. But maybe that stretches the problem statement too much.<p>&gt; Instead of doing anything fancy, my program generates the coefficients at random to explore the space. If I wanted to generate a good driver for a course, Iâ€™d run a few thousand of these and pick the coefficients that complete the course in the shortest time.<p>In theory this is more random and less efficient than an evolutionary algorithm, which searches the problem space in a structured way. If the author really wanted to hammer the point home, a least squares method to one-shot the coefficients would be more convincing.<p>All in all, the author doesn&#x27;t make any hard claims that are false. But I would nuance the point of &quot;neural networks are unnecessary&quot; to &quot;simpler models will do for simpler objectives&quot;.')
