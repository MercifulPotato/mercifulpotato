Or do you have some pointers how to configure it?<p>The EFF site showed two fingerprint ids that were completely unique for my browser: window size (because of my dock) and the http-accept headers (because of my language selection). That&#x27;s with FFs fingerprint-resist option enabled. Chameleon can spoof those, which is great, and it gives access to the fingerprinting option which I think FF does not expose properly outside of about:config. So it should greatly reduce my identifiablity, but according to the site it does not help much, even if the specific categories are now almost unique. Like they explain, the combination seems to be the problem, or maybe they are not exposing the category that gets me.<p><i>Edit</i>: Okay. The solution seems to be: Chameleon with most of the options enabled, so as much spoofing as possible, but without activating FF&#x27;s fingerprint-resist option. Probably sending no data is worse than sending spoofed data!<p>+ Ublock of course.')
