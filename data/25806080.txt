This is not meant to be a metaphysical statement. Perhaps at the metaphysical level, objective truth exists. Regardless, at the scale society needs to verify information, objectivity is inaccessible.<p>Consider how long it took Russel&#x27;s <i>Principia</i> to add 1+1. For the claims we encounter in our everyday lives, an appeal to objectivity will only add another layer of obfuscation.<p>In the case of current crisis in the US, the government claims that the crisis is an attack by the Russians. Perhaps this is true on a superficial level, but the attack is only possible because sources of power in our society abuse that society&#x27;s trust so heavily. This isn&#x27;t only limited to the government, but the entire structure of power.<p>The Q conspiracy is on its face absurd and easily contradicted by reliable observations. Why do adherents engage in it? At some point when you&#x27;re surrounded by lies on every side and no way to understand your environment, your brain just melts.<p>Unfortunately there is no sign that society will even stop digging itself into this hole.')
