I wrote out all the things I depend on, all the things I need to migrate, the alternatives, etc. I researched the alternatives and made a decision to implement it. I then did it in stages.<p>Currently I use my new pixel 3a with grapheneos, no google services, fastmail + k9, ddg, cloudflare dns, signal etc.<p>I still need to sort out office suite. Collabora does have android apks that should just work but I am waiting til it gets into f-droid.<p>The one thing I haven&#x27;t migrated is Chromecast. Once that is done I will be pretty happy.<p>Note that you will never be totally free of Google. You will still be subjected to google analytics, captcha, dns, chrome (and derivatives), etc. The idea is to be less dependent on their services, reduce Google&#x27;s capability to harvest your data, and ultimately reduce their influence, power and control.')
