This feels like the music behind realizing Goethe&#x27;s quip, &quot;architecture is petrified music.&quot; Started my early morning with a snow storm and Max Richter&#x27;s &quot;Sleep,&quot; and practising some Yann Tiersen on guitar, and then stumbled on this. Going to be that kind of day. I think with lockdowns even though I live really well, it&#x27;s the serendipity of finding bits of beauty has been suppressed, and with it, the natural sense of relief it brings. Thank you for this.')
