You can own the hardware and do whatever you want with it because for you to reproduce it would require you to effective be Nvidia. For software you can&#x27;t give a user ownership of exactly 1 copy of software. If the purchaser has all of the rights of ownership they would have the right to distribute copies for free, which obviously make selling the same software impossible.
