The more polarized the environment is, the easier it is to define neutral:<p>Start with a firehose stream of &quot;all information being generated&quot; (which, implicit in your comment is neutral) edit it down.  The extent to which the edited-down stream pisses off one side more than the firehose stream did is the extent to which your stream is not neutral.<p>Note that this isn&#x27;t a suggestion to both-siderism; I&#x27;m not suggesting that the resultant stream will treat both sides equally, just that it&#x27;s precisely as biased as the &quot;firehose.&quot;')
