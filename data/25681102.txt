I don&#x27;t know what the cop&#x27;s demeanor is. He&#x27;s wearing a mask.<p>As a practical matter, what should the police officer have done in this situation, outnumbered in a potentially hostile crowd?<p>I&#x27;m agnostic on what was actually going on here. I feel cautious about how narrative quickly outpaces the evidence to support it. And I&#x27;m honestly not so concerned here about what individual cops do, but whether there was a coordinated conspiracy to insurrection. A coup.<p>Here is what I believe. This is really very Trump. He riles up the crowd, says he&#x27;ll go lead them up to the steps of the Capitol, but then gets in his limo and goes to the White House instead. Perhaps he gets the assistance of the capitol police, but that is not established. But he is slow or refuses to provide them National Guard backup (apparently it was Pence who got it done, going around Trump).<p>All of this is to get a coup with plausible deniability.<p>I might be wrong.')
