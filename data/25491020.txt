Item(by='xoa', descendants=None, kids=[25491125], score=None, time=1608511659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25490807, text='&gt;<i>Orthogonal to your comment, but Apple could say no and walk away.</i><p>&gt;<i>On the other hand, Google did so, and the cost to them is staggering and the reward negligible - they probably regret that decision intensely.</i><p>Wait, what? Who did Google do that to that wasn&#x27;t China? Because the only one I remember is China, and I explicitly acknowledged in my comment that they have the leverage to carve their own rules. Arguably even more-so with Apple than Google, that&#x27;s one place where Apple&#x27;s hardware and vertical integration strategy is a definite weakness vs other players rather than a strength. It&#x27;s certainly not as if Apple has no negotiating chips vs China, but it&#x27;s clear who likely has the strongest hand.<p>But for Google, was there really a &quot;staggering&quot; cost, or any real cost, over refusing the likes of Saudi Arabia or the UAE? I&#x27;d love to read up on that if you could point me to what you&#x27;re thinking of.')
