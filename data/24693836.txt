I wouldn’t use excel where not appropriate, so kindly don’t make assumptions.<p>But more power to you, keep shitting on tools that are more sophisticated than you probably think.<p>People who half know excel are the worse, they are the ones who know it just well enough to think it doesn&#x27;t work at all.<p>Custom solutions are great - but aren&#x27;t always the answer and with proper process Excel will work just fine in many use cases that you might not expect.<p>I could blab on about this forever, because, you know, there is a lot of gray area or whatever.')
