Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=[25615976, 25613872], score=None, time=1609601378, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25613241, text='&gt;  Yeah, this clashes with my experience too.<p>Ultimately, as with all biological systems, its hard to make absolute assertions of the most optimal diet (the sample size in this trial is n=43 which is pretty small when you consider the variation in peoples gut biomes due to genetics and lifestyle) be it full carnivore to the strictest form of veganism, there will always be people who can perform on these diets. But most people fall within the averages, and thus personal experimentation is required to adjust and refine for one&#x27;s own use.<p>I worked at a highly acclaimed Vegan and Vegetarian farm to table, and for the life of me I couldn&#x27;t even get my body to adjust to eating seitan or tempeh as a main source of protein. I&#x27;d eat tons of salads with qunioa and legumes and still feel fatigued all day and I drank tons of kombucha to try and make the most use of the additional fiber. Ultimately I gave up after 2 weeks and just ended up bringing in my own grass fed beef and cooking it in tallow or goose fat after service with all the veg sauted in the pan as sides and felt way better. I had a horrible mental fog and dull headache the entire time, my body felt sluggish and I felt like I was not sleeping well for those 2 weeks and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d cope with that for very long as I have a hard time keeping my weight up as it is.<p>After spending the better part of decade on matters related to diet and longer if I include self experimentation, I&#x27;ve come to realize its far more Art than it is Science and that one shoe does not and cannot fit all.<p>Obviously we should reduce our meat consumption in the West, and opt for smaller, organic and grass fed cuts of better quality meat cooked in good animal fats in our diet but phasing it out entirely seems like an unobtainable panacea to me at best, and a horrible existence for most like myself.<p>But Life is too short to suffer through more than one bad meal a month, and I work to damn hard to not enjoy myself for the 1 meal I eat a day now. Which is often a 4:1 ratio of Veg&#x2F;Carb to meat.<p>Context: I grew up eating tofu as a kid, so I was no stranger to eating soy based protein but it was usually as a side dish or a garnish in a soup rather than meal itself.')
