Surely there are other APTs with hooks in our software&#x2F;hardware; this one was just really big, and sloppy enough to get caught (after 6mo?).<p>The big lesson is that unless you take great pains, you&#x27;re no more secure than your least secure 3rd party vendor.  hopefully this attack will prove that lesson to a bunch of people.   There are so many exciting solutions to that problem, and free software&#x2F;hardware has a big part to play.  .. yeah this feels like good news.  Maybe people will even start asking where their wifi chips come from!')
