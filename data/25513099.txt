They don&#x27;t care about the &#x27;private wealth management teams&#x27; bonuses, they care about their own.<p>AirBnB I guarantee literally had some of the world&#x27;s best bankers on the case.<p>There&#x27;s just a lot of variation in very frothy markets and it&#x27;s hard to estimate demand from far flung corners.')
