I have a bachelor in CS and a masters in AI. I&#x27;ve published  a scientific NLP paper at a top conference in graduate school.  And, co-founded my own software consultancy while in college. Me and my co-founders were able to grow it to twenty people and two offices. At our consultancy I was able to work on a lot of different software projects for our clients, touching a variety of engineering disciplines: design, architecture, front-end, back-end, native mobile development, DevOps, infrastructure. As well as recruit, mentor and coach a great engineering team. I also led a team creating our own SaaS time tracking app, currently serving a lot of users in the Dutch market.<p>After working on web and mobile apps I would now love to further deepen my NLP&#x2F;AI and engineering skills, and work on a hard problem. I&#x27;m looking for an opportunity to work on a wonderful product involving NLP&#x2F;ASR&#x2F;IR&#x2F;AI.')
