C# has so much more ceremony that it is more verbose and it shows even in the code we&#x27;re discussing. You just have to be willing to look.<p>Fair comparison between C# and Go is actually very easy. Those languages are so similar that you can transliterate a given benchmark from one language into another. Then benchmark those versions.<p>There&#x27;s just no way that on an average program Go (language statically compiled to assembly with a very competent code generator) will loose in performance to C# (which compiles to bytecode and then JITs that code at runtime using a much weaker code generator).')
