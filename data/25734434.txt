Tens of thousands of people are silenced by corporations every day for speech that is considered offensive by one metric or another, but is by no means illegal.  An associate of mine was permanently banned for, &quot;deadnaming&quot; someone else.  Certainly very offensive according certain standards but hardly something that you wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to say in the public park.<p>You can reasonably argue about the right of private corporations to choose to do business with who they want, but you cannot reasonably argue that people are only being silenced for explicitly illegal behavior that would also be illegal offline.')
