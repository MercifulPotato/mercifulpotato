Assessing the risk there is beyond my pay grade I don&#x27;t know how smart that&#x27;d be ... but we can observe it&#x27;s not common. If that did happen clients could use that provider&#x27;s IT system to do trading and voila since all data is at one provider, some kinds of reconciliation is easier. In short, market consolidation.<p>There&#x27;s tactical steps too that can partially overcome the independent IT systems, say, getting the custodian to send data realtime, sending it realtime on the trader&#x27;s behalf to the recon entity ... I&#x27;m not sure what custodial service provides think about that ... presumably they would if they could probably hampered by their own IT systems like the rest of us.<p>The final approach is what appears immediately above: traders and custodians --- generally any set of business entities N who need to compose data --- publish to a virtual shared DB. I&#x27;m gonna read the white papers and follow-up afterwards.')
