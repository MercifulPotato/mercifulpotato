If I work $12&#x2F;hr and that pays my rent, food, and not much more.. I literally can’t quit my job. I can’t go get an education because I can’t afford it. I can’t find a better job because everyone I’m surrounded by works near the minimum wage and I’m literally not aware of alternative options. Technically I could get a student loan from the gov, but I 100% do not know that option exists.<p>“Get Busy” sounds good when there is opportunity to improve. My point is that many people who are in a situation where working harder does not result in success. They do not have the tools, knowledge, access, etc to turn hard work into success.')
