It&#x27;s easy to say and then feel foolish by the reaction of the counter-party - that you&#x27;ve made something bigger of it than it is, or that you&#x27;ve inadvertently (been considered to having had) admitted guilt to something serious!<p>&#x27;Sorry&#x27; to me ranges from &#x27;Excuse me&#x27;, through &#x27;ha-ha we both reached for that&#x2F;side-stepped in the same direction at the same time&#x27;, all the way of course to the serious &#x27;I regret and apologise for what I have done&#x27; that it (solely) means elsewhere.<p>On the flip side though, American&#x27;s are constantly telling me that I&#x27;m &#x27;so welcome&#x27; when they don&#x27;t mean it (or perhaps because they&#x27;re used to &#x27;thank you&#x27; having similar infrequency and sincerity to &#x27;sorry&#x27;?) - so I think we&#x27;re even. :)')
