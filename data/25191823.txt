Java, kotlin and Elm (fullstack) is my day job. Core contributor to Elm.<p>If you want to create a language that can run in browsers, you either need to target js or wasm. Wasm seemed like the better fit (i’m done with 53-bit ints), so I googled everything on that.<p>Read a book on GC (wasm has no such thing built in), read two books on Forth (after being intruiged by its syntax), Learned about compilers by looking at Elm source code.<p>I guess I’ve been around so many languages that it’s impossible not to form an oppi ion on what makes a good language, so once I knew the basics it was difficult to avoid making my own.')
