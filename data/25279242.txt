Item(by='cbolton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606932231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277769, text='This article on organic food looks like a rather biased piece to me, more like a grab bag of one-sided arguments looking only at bad examples. The author indeed backtracks in the notes at the end:<p><i>Based on the responses, I just want to make this clear: this is NOT a comprehensive comparison of organic and conventional agriculture, nor is it intended to be. That post would be miles long and far more complex. My overall belief is that there shouldn&#x27;t be a dichotomy in the first place - there are a variety of methods and practices that a farmer can use, each with its pros and cons. The main point here is that something &quot;organic&quot; isn&#x27;t intrinsically better than something that isn&#x27;t, and that you have to approach all kinds of agriculture critically to achieve optimum sustainability.</i><p>I thought so... I would be surprised if the main point (that organic food is not healthier pesticide-wise) applies to all organic labels.')
