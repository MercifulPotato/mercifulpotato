I try my best to find walkthroughs on games on youtube but they very rarely specify that it is using the original hardware. And Xbox og&#x2F;360 longplays are the easiest because they haven&#x27;t been emulated properly so almost all videos are on the hardware afaik.<p>Looking for 1997-2006 PC gaming and PS1&#x2F;PS2.\nI guess I just like videos that aren&#x27;t emulated and people like LGR only provide clips:P')
