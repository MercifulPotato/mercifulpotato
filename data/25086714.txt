And properganda [2] <i>is</i> the way to reinforce that, in those time as well as in today.<p>You will immediately start seeing giant properganda billboards about how great Xi Jingping is when you visit countrysides in China. The poorer the places the more billboards there are, and the more worshipping you would see.<p>Even to these days you would find espeically among long-distance driviers little Mao Zedong ornaments in their cars as protective talismans because people (esp the older generation) actually thought of Mao as some kind of deity, one which they would seek blessings from. (It&#x27;s often hard to tell if they are joking or they actually believe it. That&#x27;s one aspect of this CCP-as-a-religion culture. And the true victims are the poor and uninformed.)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thinkchina.sg&#x2F;600-million-chinese-earn-1000-rmb-month-so-are-chinese-rich-or-poor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thinkchina.sg&#x2F;600-million-chinese-earn-1000-rmb-...</a><p>[2]: In tier 1 cities like Beijing and Shanghai, you would certainly find less properganda today simply because it doesn&#x27;t really work against the well-educated. But dezinformatsiya is still rampant. If you can read Chinese, you would see that so many news articles people consumed on WeChat, Toutiao, Douyin, Baidu, etc, are just full of shit. Sometimes they are state-sponsored (showing false information about HK during the protests), and sometimes it&#x27;s just sensationalism in its worst form (e.g. reporting on covid protests in the States and in EU with gifs that were not from those protest but somewhere else)')
