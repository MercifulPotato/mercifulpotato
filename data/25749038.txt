In the US we have organizations that vet drugs and medication (FDA) as well as to verify the safety of foods (USDA). I believe most US states license restaurants and have a process to ensure they aren&#x27;t poisoning customers.<p>In my opinion, it&#x27;s only in the case of electronic and software products where we are supposed to take so much functioning of the device on faith. Perhaps this is a bad idea and we need an organization to vet these products as well.')
