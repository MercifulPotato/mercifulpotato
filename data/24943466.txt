Our ability to detect cheating tends to go up over time [1], so we can provide more stringent defenses against cheating for future events, in particular by requiring more&#x2F;better evidence of scores. However, our ability to reanalyze older records for evidence of cheating is often more lacking, and so we have to enter in a default judgement.<p>If you&#x27;re dishonest enough to cheat once, why should we expect your other records (both past and future) to be more honest? Once you have been caught cheating, that knowledge colors all of the other records, and you have a stronger burden of proof to demonstrate that those records are indeed valid. If that means that we are stripping you of legitimate records, well, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t have broken the rules if you didn&#x27;t want to suffer the punishment.<p>[1] In absolute terms. Of course, cheaters also get more ways to cheat over time, so the relative capability of cheaters versus anticheat detection will fluctuate over time.')
