This is about best execution, not Reg NMS. See paragraphs 5, 13-4, 43-44 and footnote 2.<p>There are two violations in the order:<p>(1) Securities Act Sec. 17(a) arising from Robinhood&#x27;s failure to fulfill their duty (in this case, of best execution).<p>(2) Exchange Act Sec. 17(a) arising from Robinhood&#x27;s failure to keep adequate records which means that during the course of the investigation the SEC asked for one or documents and Robinhood, for whatever reason, failed to produce the requested document(s).<p>Neither of those violations relate to Reg. NMS or NBBO which was promulgated under Exchange Act Sec. 11A and is not mentioned anywhere in the Order.')
