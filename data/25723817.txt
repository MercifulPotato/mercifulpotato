I learned it using the Kernighan &amp; Ritchie book. I can&#x27;t even remember where I got a C compiler from. Probably a DOS freeware ftp server over dial up.<p>I eventually got Linux installed (probably from a cd-rom included with a very thick book I bought in person at a book store) so I could use gcc.<p>If I can learn it under those conditions, you can totally do it! You&#x27;ve got Stack overflow!<p>I think all you need to really learn programming is a motivation. I was generating rendering instructions for some animation program at the time (ray tracing) and so it seemed like the best thing to do to get the job done. I feel in love.')
