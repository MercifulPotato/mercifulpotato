I find his pages to contain ridiculously large size photos that make the article hard to read.  No tables or organization of information in a consistent way (or across lenses, cameras) that makes comparisons or reading easy.  Very hard to tell if he&#x27;s actually expert at something or his credibility.   All of his observations are just qualitative (as is any typical amateur enthusiast camera website).<p>I much prefer DPreview.com&#x27;s reviews of cameras and lenses.')
