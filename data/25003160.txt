And, every language is &quot;inspired&quot; by the others, but have their own special rules, so the more you learn, the less sure of anything you&#x27;ll ever be.  (For example, &#x27;(&#x27; matches a literal parenthesis in Emacs Lisp regexes, and &#x27;\\(&#x27; starts a capture group!)<p>For matching literal periods, I personally have gotten into the habit of using &quot;[.]&quot; instead of &quot;\\.&quot;.  Less to go wrong in this double-embed scenario, and I have never ever regretted adding the extra byte to my regexp.  (Of course, character classes have their own weirdness.  Your editor that matches bracket paris will love the syntax for matching a literal &#x27;[&#x27;.)')
