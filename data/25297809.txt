It just happens to also work for other languages.<p>If you only need English, the complexity of Hunspell is not required.<p>I still haven&#x27;t found a decent Hungarian spell checker, they get confused by rare words that have the same letters as a very common word, but different accents.<p>E.g.: The word &quot;Ã©s&quot; means &quot;and&quot;, which makes it much more common than &quot;es&quot;, which is the word root for &quot;fall&quot; and is rarely used without a suffix like &quot;esett&quot; or &quot;estek&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m yet to see a spellchecker that&#x27;s smart enough to fix &quot;<i>something</i> es <i>something</i>&quot; but not &quot;le es&quot;.')
