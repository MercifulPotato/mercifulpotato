CNN, MSBC, NYT, WAPO, HUFPO, FOX, CBS. Their level of propaganda is insane. At this point im convinced they are paid to do so.<p>Then you have NBC, they are also biased, but not that much<p>And im not sure about ABC yet, i havent read their news much, but if i read their headlines, it seems they are actually reporting news.
