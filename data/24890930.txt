It replaces a video codec with a GAN algorithm. It takes an initial high-res snapshot your your face (keyframe), maps out a set of keypoints which gets transmitted to the other end. The algorithm at the destination uses a GAN to reconstruct the face. Because keypoints (vectors instead of raster) are an order of magnitude smaller than images, this results in a very high level of compression and very low latency video conferencing on low-bandwidth connections.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NqmMnjJ6GEg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NqmMnjJ6GEg</a><p>This idea is not unlike Apple&#x27;s Memoji which uses facial recognition to create an animated emoji, except this reproduces real faces over the wire.')
