Not rank-and-file people that coded this, not the people who green-lit this, not the asshole claiming this is a &quot;programming error&quot;, not anyone.<p>I know it&#x27;s easy for those people to claim that they didn&#x27;t know what they were doing or that they were told that it&#x27;s fine. But maybe slapping a few would cause others to finally fucking think for a moment &quot;do I wanna go to jail over this?&quot;. If you&#x27;re making decisions that affect the privacy of literally millions of people then, well, maybe you need a little accountability.')
