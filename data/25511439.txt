Item(by='ivojp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608672426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25511104, text='Christ, no wonder communism took over part of the world; arguing with you commies is exhausting.<p>I was going to write more but consider this since you clearly don&#x27;t know what &quot;whataboutism&quot; is or what the meaning of the word conflate is (otherwise you would have understood my argument): imperialist countries practice imperialism. You tied imperialism to capitalism. My argument with bringing in communist countries that practiced imperialism is to show you that regardless of how you organize your economy, you can be imperialist.<p>You don&#x27;t have evidence to show that if a capitalist country was communist instead that it would not have engaged in the conquest that it did.<p>You should ask your city or state for a refund on your AP Language course.')
