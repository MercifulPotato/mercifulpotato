Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[25502004], score=None, time=1608590871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25498661, text='&gt; I think there should be some provision for Police to officially detain someone if they think there&#x27;s an issue (but can&#x27;t quite find a legal reason of doing so...). But at the same time, &quot;abusing&quot; the Jaywalking laws to do so is certainly the wrong way of doing it.<p>why exactly? it&#x27;s hard for me to imagine a situation where a cop reasonably needs to detain someone but can&#x27;t come up with even one possible charge.')
