I do not force anyone into my philosophy, but I will try to keep my offline software functional as long as possible, before maybe I find self-sufficient solution to replace it (like I did with migrating all Evernote documents into Nextcloud).<p>And again, I emphasized &quot;software of that class&quot; for a reason, because migrating &quot;easy stuff&quot; like productivity tools to Linux&#x2F;Mac was not a hassle.

I use automation and I use code generation, which is implemented through .NET API (not .NET Core), which assumes Windows. However, I suppose, 99% of EA users don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;s Windows-only, for many enterprise-class solutions OS is just a wrapper for the software.')
