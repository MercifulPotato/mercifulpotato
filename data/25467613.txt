It&#x27;s a very inferior experience, unless you&#x27;re the type who can be happy with 2020 movies in .3gp format in your old Nokia phone.<p>Well, or if you&#x27;re the type of person who can be happy playing Doom or The Witcher 3 on Switch. Which I assume is a substantial number of people—they keep porting those types of games to the Switch, which means someone has to be buying them.<p>Watching the Digital Foundry analysis, the main thing I&#x27;m wondering is if they should have allowed the dynamic resolution to scale down further at the low-end—for instance, let it go to 540p on the base PS4 and&#x2F;or to 720p on the PS4 Pro. This, again, seems to have been the key to getting games like The Witcher 3 on Switch.')
