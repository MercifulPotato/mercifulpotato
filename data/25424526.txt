Now it takes &gt;20 secs on a broadband connection to give me a white-washed mess of a page with no real discerning advantage over the plain html version.<p>Spot on.<p>As soon as i started seeing the “a new version of gmail is coming soon, click here to try it” banner, i knew that the end of my great gmail experience was nigh.<p>It’s funny because i NEVER even had the slightest doubt that the new UI would be shittier, and it turned out to be just like i expected it.<p>Gmail got big due to their extremely snappy ui and is now used by people who cant be arsed to migrate, like is the case with yahoo mail.<p>And every other google ui is getting worse every week.<p>To the googlers here, please show me a product where the UI has actually improved and is not just a whitespace inferno.')
