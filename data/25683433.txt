For me, this is a mental burden and too much busy work.<p>What&#x27;s more useful to me is forecasting. If the app knows how much money I&#x27;m going to need (e.g for rent, bills, groceries, insurance, etc) and it knows how much I will probably receive by then, it can show me whether I&#x27;m on the right trajectory and how much headroom I have for discretionary spending. My Monzo app does that (somewhat imperfectly).<p>But if I decide to buy a new computer, I don&#x27;t want to manually &quot;borrow&quot; money from three different pots and later replenish them manually. I just want to spend the money and have the app tell me the total amount I have to raise in order to stay solvent.')
