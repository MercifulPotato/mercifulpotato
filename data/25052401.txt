The A12z in the iPad Pro posts a 1120&#x2F;4648. This is a relatively fair comparison because both of these chips were released in ~2018-2019; Apple was winning in single-core performance at least a year ago, at a lower TDP, with no fan.<p>The A14, released this year, posts a 1584&#x2F;4181 @ 6 watts. This is, frankly, incomprehensible. The most powerful single core mark ever submitted to Geekbench is the brand-spanking-new Ryzen 9 5950X; a 1627&#x2F;15427 @ 105 watts &amp; $800. Apple is close to matching the best AMD has, on a DESKTOP, at 5% the power draw, and with passive cooling.<p>We need to wait for M1 benchmarks, but this is an architecture that the PC market needs to be scared of. There is no evidence that they aren&#x27;t capable of scaling multicore performance when provided a higher power envelope, especially given how freakin low the A14&#x27;s TDP is already. What of the power envelope of the 16&quot; Macbook Pro? If they can put 8 cores in the MBA, will they do 16 in the MBP16? God forbid, 24? Zen 3 is the only other architecture that approaches A14 performance, and it demands 10x the power to do it.')
