This is  a puff marketing piece for AWS first and Rust second, you cannot expect 100% fawning adoration (dont worry, there will be plenty still).<p>If by &quot;you appear&quot; you wanted to say &quot;it appears to me&quot; OK. It didnt appear to me.<p>OP is a little big negative, so that&#x27;s great to temper the &quot;a little too positive&quot; comments.So it&#x27;s a win in my book.<p>Yeah I agree with your last point, but I also consider the ones who downvote because that equally as petty, adding more noise to the site.')
