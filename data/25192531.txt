It starts with the premise of teaching you how to be productive, then says that you are what you do, then goes to talk about how and why to be nice, then several ending notes describing mindfulness.<p>It also says doing a something without being mindful is the same as doing nothing.<p>The conclusion is:<p>&gt; What you pay attention to is going to be your life.
