We are seeing children more introvert and more &quot;scared&quot; of the external world. Children that will grow into adults that are not able to deal with unforeseen negative events.<p>I agree with you that this is an issue in any kids physical external activity. But the difference is that these activities are often supervised by an adult and in an event of a bullying the participants are removed and also often punished, and also the victim is helped and assisted. Note that I use the word &quot;often&quot; because I know that there are parents that encourage bullying behavior as ~self-defense~, which I also disagree heavily.<p>We don&#x27;t have adults supervising every Fortnite lobby. Most children do not know how to use reporting tools to report improper behavior by another player. And while they suffer from bad words, psychological threats and such, they can&#x27;t just turn off their devices, because the game always offer them a reward, a new skin, virtual coins, lootboxes, etc, so they keep playing, and therefore we have a loop.<p>Just yesterday I reported a player who cheated on FIFA, by exploiting a glitch that enabled him to play with a team full of superplayers and legends. The whole process took me almost 30 minutes. Sometimes I think that they don&#x27;t want us to report bad behavior because the process itself is tiring.')
