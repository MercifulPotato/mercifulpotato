Then in 2018 switched to using Synology Drive and when my Dropbox yearly subscription came up for renewal, let it lapse, staying with the 2GB or so of free space that Dropbox offers simply because it was easier to make my aging Mother-in-law understand a Dropbox link (which she used at her library) than a Synology Drive link.<p>Early 2020 my wife&#x27;s Dropbox subscription was up, and we switched her over to Synology Drive for everything but kept Dropbox around for the few free gigabytes it offers.<p>This past week we got a new kitchen computer, and it was the first machine that we&#x27;ve purchased in a decade that did not get Dropbox installed on it. And probably in the next month or two, we&#x27;re going to be quietly uninstalling Dropbox from all of our other computers too.<p>Goodbye Dropbox, it was nice knowing you, but beyond basic file sync, all the new bells and whistles have added absolutely nothing of value for our family but you sure love charging us hundreds of dollars of year to look after  (poorly) a small amount of data.')
