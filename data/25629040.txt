Some websites &#x2F; apps do not implement account lockout and OTP expiration mechanisms and have 3-digit codes, which allows for brute-force attacks. Others with these mechanisms can lead to DDoS. Also, some web apps log these OTPs directly in the URLs. In general, I agree with minitech in that WebAuthn with a physical factor would be better, both in terms of usability and security.')
