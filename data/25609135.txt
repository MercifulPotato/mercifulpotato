My kids&#x27; school starts at 8:50 am, but one of them has lunch 11:00 a.m. with 4 hours afterwards during which they can&#x27;t eat. We let him bring a snack and tell him to let his teacher know his parents gave him permission to eat, and they should contact us if there&#x27;s a problem. Though last year he also had a teacher who recognized the problem and had an unofficial &quot;snack time&quot;. Plenty of teachers are not arbitrary &amp; capricious in their rule making.')
