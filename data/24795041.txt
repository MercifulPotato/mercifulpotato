Calling it &quot;autopilot&quot; is even worse (and has been ruled as misleading in at least German courts).<p>If a human has to sit there and monitor the car without interacting with it, then we shouldn&#x27;t allow it on the roads. That means skipping level 2 and probably level 3. Go the Waymo route and go straight to full self driving cars.')
