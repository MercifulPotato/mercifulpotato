Visually appealing for sure. A few things:<p>First, I don’t think that your users’ first exposure to your product should be a comparison to other products.<p>As another user mentioned, I don’t really have an idea of what the site <i>is</i>. I think the comparisons to other products might provide a clearer picture to you since (I’m guessing) those were your initial thoughts about the direction of the project. To others, however, the comparisons seem kind of convoluted.<p>Also, as yet another user mentioned, I would prefer a different authentication option.')
