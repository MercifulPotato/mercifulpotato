I wonder why bridges like matrix-puppet-signal don&#x27;t use it then. Because they currently run the <i>full</i> signal desktop app which is extremely wasteful if you&#x27;re trying to run several bridges on your computer.<p>From what I understood from the LibreSignal discussion: Open Whisper Systems provides the source for transparency only, not to enable others to make clients for their service. They&#x27;re free to build their own servers (which obviously will be unable to communicate with official Signal users!) but not connect to Signal itself.<p>The reason I keep pointing this out is that I&#x27;d really love for them to change their stance on this or at least allow federation from third-party Signal servers. It would really make it an open network. I don&#x27;t want to move to something that is as locked-in as whatsapp as it is similarly dependent on their choices.')
