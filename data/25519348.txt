It&#x27;s not that different than any other widget toolkit anymore, which have all largely converged on the same sort of model for the same reasons.<p>I can&#x27;t think of very many things that affect <i>performance</i>  in big ways. An explicit &quot;I&#x27;m going to do a lot of things to the DOM here, please hold the reflows until I&#x27;m done, I understand that some of the properties may go out of date in the meantime&quot; might be nice. (Perhaps it&#x27;s a death-of-a-thousand-cuts.)<p>The API itself is a bit klunky, but the rough edges are easy to paper over with any number of libraries, and is hardly the world&#x27;s first klunky-but-functional API to be so papered over by libraries that add no significant slowdown. (Note I&#x27;m not talking about &quot;react&quot; here, but just things that make the DOM API a bit less klunky. Thin little wrappers that mostly get JIT&#x27;d out.) Native XPath-like integration into JS would be nice, but honestly, that&#x27;s going to be a net slowdown because people will do lots of slow, easy things rather than write the more tedious, but faster, DOM manipulation.<p>But just being <i>klunky</i> doesn&#x27;t actually make it <i>slow</i>.')
