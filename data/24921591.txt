That perhaps the consequences of the first might lead to the second?  That a rational adult with an IQ in single digits or greater might be able to understand basic cause and effect, and that looking at a certain statement (lets pick a random one and say statement A) might lead to certain conclusions such as (lets pick at random again and pick B).\nCould it be that a basic understanding of human behaviour (Thing causes damage to human &gt; human avoid thing) could have led to this conclusion being drawn?<p>Or would such a concept require further elaboration and perhaps diagrams to help those unable to grasp it?')
