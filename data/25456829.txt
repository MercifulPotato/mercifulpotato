Now that I have a real job and manage people, it&#x27;s &quot;free as in $200&#x2F;hour employee time instead.&quot; It&#x27;s like providing the ingredients for beer for free, and people can have free beer, if they agree to brew it themselves.<p>I want the free-as-in-freedom since if the vendor goes under, I can pick up the pieces myself. If my vendor goes Oracle and decides to milk me, I can find an alternative supplier.<p>I don&#x27;t want free-as-in-beer because I&#x27;d rather pay a vendor $10 or $50 per month or something than pay my IT staff $100 or $200 per hour.<p>I&#x27;d also rather pay the original author $50 per month than pay an off-brand hosting company $25 per month because (1) I&#x27;ll get better support (2) I&#x27;m not a douchebag.')
