It&#x27;s honestly ridiculous to see how people invent &quot;revolutionary new ways&quot; of doing the exact same thing that could be done in a dozen ways already. And they invent those by piling more and more unnecessary complexity on top of existing technology stacks.<p>Electron is a revolutionary new way of making desktop apps. Except they look like they&#x27;re something else and take up all the RAM you have and ask for more. But nah, you don&#x27;t understand, it&#x27;s the future, native desktop apps are dead.<p>Kotlin is a revolutionary new JVM language that will solve all the problems you had with Java... Except I haven&#x27;t had any. Java is simple and predictable. Kotlin is not. To me, Kotlin feels like an abstraction layer that gets in the way. But people will be defending it relentlessly because that&#x27;s what Google says is The Futureâ„¢ for Android development.<p>Web development... That&#x27;s just nasty. &quot;Revolutions&quot; happen every day, so now your news article takes 5 seconds to load on a 100-megabit connection just because someone absolutely had to make it a react app instead of a server-rendered page with just text and maybe some pictures.<p>This overall trend of abstracting the platform (the operating system, the web browser) away is abysmal. It does no good. And lowering the barrier to entry to programming? Honestly, I&#x27;d rather prefer it to remain high. Programming is meant to be an engineering job, not the kind where you throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks and just assume that browsers and operating systems are made of unicorn jizz.')
