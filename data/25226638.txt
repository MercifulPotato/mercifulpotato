Leading naturally into calls for small government, temporarily embarrassed millionaire syndrome, defining fairness along lines of economic success, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a shame we&#x27;re so unaware of the marketing. It&#x27;s actually not very difficult to poke through. I think the fact that so many early settlers came for religious reasons (their home states in Europe didn&#x27;t look kindly on their fundamentalism and fanaticism) set the tone in terms of a people that so easily believes in stories.')
