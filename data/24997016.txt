I would look for the proverbial pony express friendly features and check if they actually make sense in 2020. For example: remove the requirement for it all to happen at the same time. This is clearly a feature that makes paper voting work. In 2020 we should be able to change our vote when we like and have a threshold at which a candidate or party is replaced. (This also gets rid of the election circus and make election promises more binding (rather than the &quot;say whatever you like&quot; paradigm) If you need to make decisions that are unpopular you will just have to work harder to inform and educate people about the logic behind it.)<p>If it is not in real time voting in person is not a problem. A secure room (phones and cameras not allowed) where no one can see what you&#x27;ve voted. (a bus would do fine)<p>4 separate systems with a 5th that checks if they all got the same vote from you. At the regional level the votes are counted continuously, if one of the 4 system produces a different result an investigation is triggered and huge prison sentences may follow.')
