From the articles I&#x27;ve seen, the employees forming a union are the activist employees. So the fear for a non-union tech worker in this scenario would be if the union behaved like many others and demanded a certain ratio of union to non-union workers since the dynamic in this context would boil down to deprioritizing applicants who don&#x27;t have the same political views as the union employees which seems wildly toxic for society.')
