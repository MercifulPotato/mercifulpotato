I don&#x27;t like crafting for loops or maintain indexes. Fortran has something similar. With Matlab many operators operate in an intuitive way on vectors and matrices. It breaks down quite quickly if you try to do something more complex though. This somewhat extends to Julia. In Ruby also you can have .map or .each.<p>Julia:<p><pre><code>    x=10\n    v=[1 2 3 4]\n    x.*v\n    #1Ã—4 Array{Int64,2}:\n    # 10  20  30  40</code></pre>')
