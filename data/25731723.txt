Most people don&#x27;t really care about it.  Even moreso for stuff like what songs did I listen to on Spotify.<p>The better angle is that we&#x27;re becoming digital serfs.  Google decided that they didn&#x27;t want Google Music to exist anymore and poof went my listening history and playlists.  Any service that I use today can do the same thing.  If that data were stored somewhere I had access to I could have imported it in to Spotify.<p>This is an area I think Amazon or CloudFlare could step into.  Sell consumers a NAS type box that keeps their data local.  Sell companies on Lambda&#x2F;Workers @ Home and have their applications run on that NAS.')
