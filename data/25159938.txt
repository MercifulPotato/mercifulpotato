This vaccine is noteworthy for the speed at which it was developed, but its not the first really good vaccine.<p>edit: and because I&#x27;m getting a lot of downvotes for some reason, Anthrax, Measles, Rubella, and Polio also seem to have 90%+ effectiveness ratings.<p>edit edit: and as a corollary, with equivalent n sizes for the trials and higher effect sizes, the p value is by necessity smaller, not that it matters below very small thresholds<p>edit^3: high 80s to 95 isn&#x27;t that noteworthy, and is likely within the margin of error of the clinical trials.')
