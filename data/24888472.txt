The article is talking about totalitarianism not fascism (it uses the two terms interchangeably).<p>Still, most of the article&#x27;s points stand: &quot;fascist&quot; is used to mean &quot;bully,&quot; something that Orwell pointed out in the 40s.  If you&#x27;re going to call Tom Cotton a &quot;fascist&quot; then you should also call any mouthpiece of the CCP &quot;fascist&quot;.')
