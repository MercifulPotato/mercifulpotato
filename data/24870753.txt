So these observations&#x2F;tips to myself are in spite of loving the grind.<p>What helps me a bit to get through the grind is to observe myself while working or applying for jobs. I&#x27;m noticing when I get into things, and when I am not getting into things and asking myself why. Sometimes it&#x27;s really clear why, but sometimes it&#x27;s subtle. In rare cases I can tweak my inner psychology a bit to like things a bit more, i.e. suffer less.<p>Now that I&#x27;m finally working, I have ample of opportunity to see when I&#x27;m in a flow state :)')
