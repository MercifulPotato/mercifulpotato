No, but they sure implied it.<p>Would it be problematic to encourage diverse representations to show up for company photos, if you did not ignore them for advancement? On its own, I think that&#x27;s just common sense, and taking some PR advantage of the costly diversity programs.<p>A random&#x2F;unplanned company photo I was in, was circulated online, to falsely claim that my company only hires white people. Felt really bad, especially for my multiracial colleagues present in that photo. Can you even give this movement what they want, without accusations of pandering&#x2F;fake concern?<p>&gt; Not specifically require Black employees to relocate to different cities while giving non-Black employees the opportunity to work out out whatever the nearest office is.<p>I refuse to believe that Coinbase based that decision on skin color, and I find it hard to believe anyone else sees that differently. As such, to follow this rule, you would have to overturn your decision -- based on rationale --, because it happens to negatively impact a person with a specific skin color. How is this a decent decision: &quot;Sorry Chad, we can&#x27;t let you work from home to care for your mother, because we just told some black-skinned support engineers to relocate, and we don&#x27;t want to specifically require black people to relocate, and allow white people to work from home.&quot;? How is that fair? To who? It suddenly becomes justified if Chad was black, or if you allow everyone to work from home?')
