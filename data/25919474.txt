But I understand their reasoning for not doing that, I think they&#x27;re hesitant to compete in small display market where smartphones rule; but that&#x27;s exactly why I want a pocket computer from reputed brand - <i>to ditch my smartphone</i>.<p>While we wait for Linux smartphones to get better, a pocketable Linux computer as showcased in OT could fill-in the need gap. Use a data dongle for Internet&#x2F;Calls on-demand on the move and have full-fledged computer at hand.<p>I&#x27;ve been telling this for years now, RPi CM4 gives me some hope. Looks like Lenovo-NEC might enter this market at least in Japan and I hope nerds in Japan buy it out and make pocket computers a thing again for rest of the world too.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1netbook.com&#x2F;onemix&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1netbook.com&#x2F;onemix&#x2F;</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KjkpqOn6EJ4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KjkpqOn6EJ4</a>')
