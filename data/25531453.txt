Apple only introduced it in 10.15. It is technically impossible to support anything below 10.15. Now, it would be possible to write two Craft apps (one iOS and one macOS) instead of a shared one, but thatâ€™s much more work and only adds a minority of users (those still below 10.15), so it is understandable they chose not to support it.')
