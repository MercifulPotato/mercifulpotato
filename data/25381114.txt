I LOVED it.  New ideas were popping into my head all the time, and solutions to problems were quick.<p>I&#x27;ll never forget when I was in the first few months, and learned about POLYMORPHISM.  At the time, it utterly blew my mind, and I found so many sweet use cases for it and felt like a GOD of programming.<p>Fast forward 10 years and yea, it gives me a chuckle to remember those days.  I miss how excited my mind was, and how eager to code I was.  Now, I&#x27;m critical of code, less open to learning new things, and new ideas are few and far between.<p>It sucks but as far as I can tell, that&#x27;s just life.  We aren&#x27;t programmed to constantly lose ourselves in any one thing.  If we did, our ancestors may not have survived.  Our primitive brain found great utility in &quot;moving on&quot; to the next thing, the next opportunity, etc.')
