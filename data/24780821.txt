Then not only decided to not pass that savings onto the customer, but actually secretively raised the price $30.<p>I am not suggesting that removing the power brick doesn&#x27;t have any impact on the environment. What I am suggesting is that I don&#x27;t buy for a second that it was the primary motivator for removing it. My guess is that the primary motivator is shipping cost. This has a tangible and significant impact on their profit per unit and that was the driving factor. The fact that they could spin the removal of this device as a painstaking decision they toiled over because they wanted to save the sea turtles is really just a PR spin and was a happy coincidence that they could use.<p>And all those tangible cost savings thanks to the removal of this accessory... not only have those savings not been passed onto the consumer, but they actually increased the price!')
