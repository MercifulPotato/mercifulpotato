Had only a few clients at a time, didn&#x27;t have to work that many hours, and was even able to rent a small office at 501 Studios on E. 6th St. Rent was cheap, no state income tax, lots of cool hangouts. I don&#x27;t live there anymore and prices have went up since then, but still a relative bargain compared to many other states.')
