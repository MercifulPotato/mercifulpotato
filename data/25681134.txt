And it&#x27;s moronic or ignorant to say they weren&#x27;t.<p>That some people were prosecuted doesn&#x27;t negate the overall acceptance by the left of the violent activity as legitimate political activism because it was in support of particular favored political opinions. The very clear message was that as long as you were spouting the approved political mantras the violent activities were OK.<p>Attempting to discern who is or who isn&#x27;t an &quot;insurrectionist&quot; is a distraction. \nTrespassing, breaking and entering, looting, vandalism, destruction of property, arson, assault are all crimes that should be prosecuted and not excused if you are committing them while having the correct political thoughts.<p>BTW, yesterday&#x27;s opportunists have to be the saddest lot of &quot;insurrectionists&quot; I&#x27;ve ever seen. They seemed more interested in posting selfies than overthrowing anything. They should be mocked mercilessly and prosecuted vigorously.')
