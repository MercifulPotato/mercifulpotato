Item(by='domoritz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604072341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24943030, text='JupyterLab outputs have a mime type. Depending on the mimetype, a different renderer is used. For example, text is shown as plain text and an image is binary with the image type (e.g. png). There is also a mimetype for Vega and Vega-Lite JSON.<p>What this means for you as a user is that you don&#x27;t need to install the renderer as it comes with the JL frontend.<p>Vega-Lite is client side so it&#x27;s not running in the kernel.')
