I get it, every company wants to know if I can turn a list into a balanced BST, it&#x27;s not an unfair question, it&#x27;s not particularly hard, but I really get annoyed I have to keep solving it over and over.<p>I really wish there was some certifying body that would put me through the whiteboard guantlet <i>once</i>, and then I could just share my score to companies I apply to.')
