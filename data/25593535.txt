If there&#x27;s nothing after you die, why are people scared to do dangerous things? Why do they work their whole lives and enjoy so little of it?<p>People say this is your only life so they are afraid to lose it but then why wouldn&#x27;t you do all sorts of taboo things in your only life, especially if you know it will end soon, think terminal illnesses etc.<p>Most people claim to believe that there&#x27;s nothing after life but most people also live like there is clearly some evaluation of life that makes a respectable life worth living. Weird to think about it like that.')
