While Android 10 might have sort of &quot;fixed&quot; the Wifi scanning issue, it started enforcing the half-baked Scoped Storage implementation, which creates its own share of problems.<p>I think things have become a bit more saner with Android 11 in that regard (though there might still be some pain points left), but instead the next random thing Google has broken is that you can no longer replace the default camera app - unless whatever random app you might be using specifically whitelists your favourite third-party camera app, you can no longer use it other than in standalone mode (i.e. if I understood things correctly, the same hare-brained situation you were in until very recently on iOS with regards to the default browser or other default apps).')
