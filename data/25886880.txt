I&#x27;ll probably need to due a quick check on how a wrapper might have been created as it looks like a mac app so I can separate out the pure java binary.<p>Memory: As far as I see, there is a built-in profiler within the app showing the memory usage.  It has a high limit to 1gb and I see it rise quickly to about third of the way and repeated (quickly, about every 2 seconds) garbage collect down to 200mb.  So it appears memory consumed very fast and than it garbage collects.  Then repeats.')
