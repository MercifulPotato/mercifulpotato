Iceland is very European in its skeptical and resentful response to the low-tech response to covid: masking, washing hands, social  distancing. That&#x27;s why when people have brought covid over it has spread through society like it has. People in NZ by the sounds of it are acting much more like ppl in SE&#x2F;E Asia, adopting the low tech WHO strategy. That&#x27;s why things are as they are in NZ, and why Iceland keeps suffering from outbreaks. And it&#x27;s why your analogy of Iceland and NZ is a false one.')
