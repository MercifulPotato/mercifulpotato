Very handy to code a game in Basic. Firmware even allowed to draw characters at pixel-precise position (enabled with TAGON, disabled with TAGOFF).\nSince characters are defined with only &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; pixels, this trick was limited to two-color graphics, which is a pity considering the CPC had real bitmapped display with up to 16 simultaneous colors, without any of the colour clash that limited most machines of the era.\nDespite no sprite features in Basic, the CPC firmware (including Basic) is rather complete in the graphics and sound for the era.\nSee <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;meesterturner&#x2F;cpcsprite" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;meesterturner&#x2F;cpcsprite</a> for a replacement usable from Basic.')
