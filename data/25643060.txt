This is why those with the most private property can essentially do as they please; the benefits they derive from their private property are disproportionately high compared to the cost that society incurs protecting their private property.<p>For instance, the workload that the government is tasked with to protect private property of these elites at home (e.g. the large amount of police resources that need to be available for large tech campuses or in rich areas) and abroad (e.g. by tasking the Acronym Agencies with searching for foreign and domestic threats, by using the might of the dollar and the military to basically force their will on other countries through political, physical, or financial violence (FATCA comes to mind...) [0]).<p>Private property needs to stay, but the incarnation we find ourselves in today needs to evolve for it to survive. Either through taxes or government stakeholdership in corporations (e.g. Yanis Varoufakis&#x27; proposal that companies must give X percentage of their shares to a common fund such that the incentives are aligned for both the companies and the government to act in the long-term interests of its citizens), this imbalance of power needs to be corrected for.<p>The one thing undermining this is a distrust in the US government that is rightfully earned after decades of neoliberalism (and, to a different perspective, neoconservatism) has worked hand in hand with the elites to steal and pillage the private property of the common man (e.g. how Warren Buffet&#x27;s secretary pays a higher tax percentage that he does).<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t see this happening. Things are getting worse in the US as public institutions are eroding or becoming more kleptocratic, all the while the elites are starting to act more like feudal lords, thinking that some libertarian wet dream of privatization of everything is the answer (private military and private firefighters come to mind for the extremely wealthy few). This technofeudalism will probably only be stopped by some major shift in global power (e.g. away from the dollar as the world&#x27;s reserve currency, which I suspect would provoke the US into military action one way or another)<p>If anyone wants to read a great article about what happened to America&#x27;s institutions, I recommend Francis Fukuyama&#x27;s America in Decay [1]. His &quot;end of history&quot; argument seems very premature given what&#x27;s happened since he wrote that, but most of his other work is spot on.<p>[0] I certainly don&#x27;t agree that these policies are beneficial in aggregate, as they result in international hostility, the things Snowden revealed, etc. It is, however, a thing that government does provide for the monied elites.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cf.linnbenton.edu&#x2F;artcom&#x2F;social_science&#x2F;clarkd&#x2F;upload&#x2F;Fukuyama,%20America%20in%20Decay.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cf.linnbenton.edu&#x2F;artcom&#x2F;social_science&#x2F;clarkd&#x2F;uploa...</a>')
