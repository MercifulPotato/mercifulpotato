It&#x27;s a word that has a well accepted definition of a philosophical framework where reason is the primary source of justification and (moral) truth.<p>Just using reason to come to conclusions that aren&#x27;t necessarily <i>ultimately justified or deriving truth from pure reason</i> is literally the entire concept of Western philosophy. And by Western, I mean from Iceland to Bagdad and beyond. I&#x27;m fairly certain it&#x27;s also the entire concept of Eastern philosophy too but I don&#x27;t know much about that.<p>Lesswrong is certainly good for introducing concepts and allowing discussions. That does not a philosophy make. I&#x27;m not critiquing the website, nor the community, but the &quot;pure reason&quot; rationalist philosophy that a <i>lot</i> of people there adopted and peddled, without spending enough time justifying it, instead spending vast amounts of time applying. This is exactly what the article was addressing when it talks about rationalism, too.<p>Rationalism is, by definition, idolatry of reason. At the very minimum, to even show any kind of rationalism, you have to believe that somethings are true by virtue of pure reason, independently of the empirical world. Rationalism really doesn&#x27;t have any thing to do with using or not using reason.')
