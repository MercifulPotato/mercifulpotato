And if there is pattern over time, you see pattern.<p>I have seen quite dysfunctional toxic workplaces or teams. If you leave within one month, you have good social understanding and likely have  better ethics then those who stayed. Those who stayed for long were all eventually compromised (meaning their ethics changed and they started to accept or do things they should not).<p>Our company have also few &quot;trap&quot; positions. The people there change quickly, because our hiring manager talks about positives (all true) and does not mention significant negatives. The more capable you are, the quicker you recognize the situation and leave.<p>It is perfectly fine to have some short stints.')
