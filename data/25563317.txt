The challenge is that many numerical kernels and algorithms are just not easily or naturally expressed in this vectorized language. (Think sparsity, irregular access patterns, control flow, etc.)<p>Current languages, runtimes and hardware currently force most work into this dense, rectangular, vectorized style to achieve reasonable performance, but we would like our ideas to not always remain stuck in this &quot;rut&quot; [1].  Dex is one exploration of how we can improve expressiveness and generality while still allowing for performant compiled artifacts.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3317550.3321441" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3317550.3321441</a>')
