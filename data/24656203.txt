But at one point I was flying commercial a lot for work and it became a real hassle. I don’t mind it once in a while, and I’m pretty good at my personal procedure for zipping through the security line, but it’s an emotional drain, all the security and getting to the airport so early. What a drag, I am the same way in that I would prefer a long drive over flying commercial.<p>In recent years I’ve been lucky enough to largely fly private and it feels like it must have felt pre 9&#x2F;11, at least on the security and not having to arrive hours early fronts.')
