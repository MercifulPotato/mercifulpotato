For any grid-scale battery you&#x27;re going to have many thousands of individual cells linked together.  Even if each cell is individually only capable of relatively small charge&#x2F;discharge rates, it shouldn&#x27;t matter at the scale of the whole installation for normal supply&#x2F;demand scenarios.  I would only expect brown-out situations if something bad happens to the grid (like PG&amp;E decides to shut down power distribution elsewhere because of fire risk...)')
