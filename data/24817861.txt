I.e. to log most queries except for usual SELECT&#x2F;INSERTs.<p>Also, @oppositelock pointed out that WAL would contain the destructive query too. How does one remove a single query from a WAL for replay or how does one correctly use WAL to recover after a 23-hour old backup was restored?<p>Finally, how does one work on the WAL level with managed DBs on AWS or DO if they block SSH access?')
