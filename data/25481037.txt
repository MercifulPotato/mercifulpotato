So at least from my perspective as a NYT customer, they have done enough to let me know they messed up here. They&#x27;ve also reassigned the journalist to another beat, which isn&#x27;t loss of a job, but fact-checking is a team effort and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair for a journalist to bear the entire brunt of the fallout.')
