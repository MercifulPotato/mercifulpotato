You don&#x27;t think that people should be able to send mass death threats to everyone, 100 times a day!  Therefore, since you support restrictions on free speech, it is totally OK to arrest anyone who disagrees with the government in any way!&quot;<p>This is the argument that you are making.  And it is a bad one.<p>The reason why it is bad, is because the restrictions on speech, in the US are almost non-existent, and that is not a good justification to do other things that are much more restrictive, such as in my extreme example of arresting anyone who disagrees with the government.')
