We started vaccinations on the 20th and reached 500k yesterday, now up to 100k daily. (out of 8.8m population)<p>The media tried to cover all the how-s, when-s and what-if-s and did okay, and if you google for it you can find a government website with details about the vaccination campaign.<p>Finding out who&#x27;s first in line was also easier than expected, that same info website has a link with a list of groups. The gist of it is: medical teams, elderly people, people aged &gt;65, at-risk, then anyone who wants. It&#x27;s a fairly long list but if you&#x27;re interested see [1].<p>Re: signing up, at first it was via phone calls but later on HMOs (health orgs) made it possible to sign up via their apps. Once you sign up it&#x27;s usually about a week. Some people somehow got an appointment for February but it was moved up to early January very quickly. E.g., my dad.<p>--<p>[1]: From what I know and can find online now, after medical teams we vaccinated: nursing home caregivers &amp; residents; then anyone over the age of 65 who signs up; then immunosuppressed people (implants etc.); then people with majorly reduced lung capacity; then personal caregivers. Those are all titled &quot;first priority&quot;.<p>&quot;Second priority&quot; is: other risk groups such as diabetes, obesity, serious lung disease, hypertension, etc.; then high-exposure groups such as teachers, prisoners and guards, first responders. After that, anyone who wants to be vaccinated can sign up.<p>&quot;Priority&quot; also means &quot;wave&quot; at the moment; meaning until we vaccinated all (interested) people aged &gt;65 I, a healthy person &lt;30, can&#x27;t get the vaccine.')
