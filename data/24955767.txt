Soon the other party develops countermeasures. So you still have 1000 warheads, but the delivery is no longer guaranteed.<p>You develop a better delivery method, and it&#x27;s easier to build another 1000 warheads than repurpose the first 1000. You end up with 2000.<p>It won&#x27;t be long you will have to build more. As the warheads are not consumed, you end up having more and more. But only 1000 of the latest generation, that really counts.')
