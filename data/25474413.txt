Not just academia.<p>The post-war, post-energy boom should have been obvious. Millennials have been complaining about lack of job growth, housing, and affordable education. Their parents had lower-hanging fruit to pluck. (I&#x27;m assuming this isn&#x27;t just some myth I&#x27;ve been told about the 60&#x27;s - 90&#x27;s.) The blame is sometimes placed on &quot;bad Boomer policies&quot;, but I&#x27;m not so sure. It feels as though we burned through the &quot;easy&quot; years.<p>In academia, international students aren&#x27;t flocking to US institutions anymore. The playing field has been leveled.<p>Asian tech is coming into prominence at full stride and is reminiscent of Japan&#x27;s meteoric rise.<p>The manufacturing story is obviously much different.<p>Is this happening because the rest of the world caught up? Or did America put investments in the wrong places?<p>What&#x27;s causing this, and how do we get back to prosperity for all young Americans?<p>Am I simply missing the areas where things have improved?<p>Genuinely curious about thematic ideas &#x2F; shifts, what we might change, or if my views are wrong.')
