Stuff like this doesn&#x27;t help. I could see a small company like GitLab needing to toe the DMCA line, but, Microsoft has the deep pockets and could have built some major community will here by handling this better. Unfortunate that they didn&#x27;t.<p>If MS didn&#x27;t comply with the DMCA takedown notice, then the RIAA could go to court and get an injunction to force it down. Depending on how spiteful the RIAA and the judge are feeling, the injunction could be worded to take down the <i>entirety</i> of GitHub over a single repository. And the impact of actions like these is to make it more likely that such an expansive injunction is sought or granted.')
