They posited questions as folks here do and added to the topic. I for one would not have even known what to ask without the top comment.<p>You assumed a lot of negativity and bad intent from the person and what they wrote that I didn’t see.<p>HN isn’t meant to be a cheer squad for anything new, IMO. It’s meant to be a forum for folks to discuss and people will have differing reactions but so long as they add something interesting, the comments are welcome, again IMO.')
