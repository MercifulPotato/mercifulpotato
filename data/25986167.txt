Microsoft, and anyone else who has anything to offer that they would not like to become overlooked.<p>Then hammer away in committee, especially with the full cooperation of Microsoft and all the great engineers who do have some rare expertise, it should be possible to publish like never before as an international ASTM Standard within a year, and maintain it from that point forward with all revisions rigorously reviewed and documented.<p>After that engineers everywhere will have the technical reference material they have been lacking when they need to make sure their implementations of NTFS are as compatible with each other as they can be, even better allowing for absolute full compliance by all going forward.')
