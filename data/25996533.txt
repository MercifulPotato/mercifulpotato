Hell, maybe we still have blogs but you aren&#x27;t plastered echo-chamber friendly messages you have to actually search for stuff to read or maybe go to a phpbb forum.<p>Trump without Twitter, QAnon,  4Chan would&#x27;ve probably played out differently. Without a way for society to constantly feed his narcissism would he have been so anti-mask - would anti-science even be so big if there weren&#x27;t echo-chambers re-inforcing this?<p>That&#x27;s just social media itself. It&#x27;s literally poisoned our society as much as a social credit score in China probably has there among relationships. Piss someone off and now you&#x27;re an enemy combatant and can&#x27;t travel.<p>I think tech can also fix a lot, but it depends how we use it and what we do with it. I hope we can science our way out of Global Warming but I&#x27;m not very optimistic about us surviving into 2100s.')
