The future of France’s electrical grid is unlikely to be nuclear because their attempts to build replacements have been failures. I just came across this audit today:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.montelnews.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;story&#x2F;more-pressure-for-french-epr&#x2F;1156576" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.montelnews.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;story&#x2F;more-pressure-for-french...</a><p>Of the five attempted new reactors, only two have completed and have not been impressive financially.  The auditing team found gross project mismanagement, but also found that there has been difficulty completing welding properly, and the large nuclear reactors inherently require massive amounts of high precision, high quality welding as a basis for the entire endeavor.<p>Finally, it is quite misleading to generalize Germany’s renewables path to other countries, because they consciously financed the creation of an industry that now has exponentially falling costs. The entire world owes Germany a debt for kickstarting this virtuous cycle of product innovation and falling costs, as we will all benefit from their early work.')
