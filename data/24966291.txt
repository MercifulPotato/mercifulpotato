Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604310677, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24966129, text='Teams uses something equally silly, like Ctrl+Shift+M for mute&#x2F;unmute, IIRC.<p>Which is pretty annoying, because the mute button is about the most important button in a videoconferencing tool, and I want to have it under a <i>single</i> keypress, so it can be used effortlessly, with my left hand (the same that operates Alt+Tab, while my right hand is on the mouse, scrolling ... well, meeting agenda, let&#x27;s say).<p>I&#x27;d fix that for myself with AutoHotkey, but I can&#x27;t, because Teams is just another Electron app, so I can&#x27;t just look at which UI component has the focus to create a rule, &quot;if focused on Teams video call <i>and not its chat</i>, rebind M to Ctrl+Shift+M&quot;.<p>One of the countless reasons I hate it when people do custom UI, instead of using OS-provided controls.')
