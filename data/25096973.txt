The sustained performance gains reflect Apple&#x27;s tremendous dedication and investment in the endeavor.<p>After the A11 chip, though, it became clear there was a non-zero probability that Apple could one day meet or surpass Intel.<p>Which begs the question: what underestimated technologies exist today that could overtake incumbent technologies within 5 years? Put another way: what technologies are in the A11 stage and not yet widely recognized for its potential?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;16226&#x2F;perf-trajectory.png')
