A call has been eliminated. It was in the tail position. It was replaced by something else, which you call the &quot;tail call&quot;. Maybe you&#x27;d prefer RSCITLEIOTC (regular subroutine call in tail location elimination in favour of tail call)?<p>I think tail call elimination is good enough to communicate the concept, whereas (when it&#x27;s not purely an optimisation) tail call optimisation is not good enough, because  calling it an &quot;optimisation&quot; is such a dangerous trap.')
