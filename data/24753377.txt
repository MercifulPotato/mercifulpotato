(Plus non-full time contributors) So it’s no surprise that Unity is ahead of Godot in terms of functionality. Godot may suit your needs just fine, but Unity has a lot more work out into it.<p>When I played with Godot (two years ago, a lot has been improved since), it was definitely a bit raw. It worked, but I found it a bit of a struggle. I’ve been reading their release notes since and they’ve improved a lot, but I haven’t actually tried it out yet.<p>The one thing I personally don’t like about Unity is how much emphasis is put on C#, I just never got into the language and have no desire to use it. Godot is a bit nicer for me in that respect. I prefer Unity’s ECS and job system over Godot’s scene system though, but lots of people say the opposite.')
