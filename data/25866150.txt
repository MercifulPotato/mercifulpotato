Adding a stick shift is just adding complexity for no benefit.<p>That isn&#x27;t true.  Having low gears gives you more torque with less current at slow speeds.  Most EVs take the philosophy of &quot;it&#x27;s easier to just use a more powerful motor than deal with a transmission&quot;.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean that a transmission wouldn&#x27;t be helpful (especially if you want good performance out of a more modest motor, or with fewer batteries that can&#x27;t produce as much current).')
