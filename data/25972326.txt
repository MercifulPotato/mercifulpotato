I&#x27;m still waiting for you to point out what exactly I&#x27;ve said that&#x27;s wrong. Since your comments are full of angry rhetoric and lacking in substance it seems that you strongly <i>dislike</i> what I&#x27;ve said which is actually very different from what I&#x27;ve said being &quot;flagrantly incorrect&quot;. Classic mixup.<p>&gt; often sitting daily with our general counsel on many issues<p>I think you think this somehow bolsters your (again, completely emotional) argument? On the contrary, this is a pretty good indicator you don&#x27;t understand federal securities laws. And I must say, I concur with your former GC&#x27;s assessment.')
