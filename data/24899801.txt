Item(by='nendroid', descendants=None, kids=[24899988], score=None, time=1603738738, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899598, text='&gt; &quot;We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on&quot; is a lie. We know.<p>I&#x27;m not lying, but I could be mistaken. I&#x27;m not mistaken about the rape of nanking or the holocaust. There are pictures of mass slaughter, graves and even severed heads on the pikes of japanese soldiers to confirm the depravity and existence of these events. My own grandfather witnessed the events and tells me first hand accounts of the rivers of blood in nanking. The japanese denial is sickening, and you accusing me, a descendent of victims of such slaughter, as someone who denies genocide displays incredible immaturity.<p>I am not denying genocide, I am simply saying extreme accusations need extreme evidence. So your next task is clear:<p>Show me pictures of the same slaughter that you claim the chinese are doing right now. I promise you I will do a full 180 if you show me some actual pictures of the massacre that you claim is happening right at this very moment. Show me some dead bodies, executions... etc.. etc.')
