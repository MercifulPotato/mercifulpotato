They&#x27;re angry, and much of their anger is based on legitimate economic grievances. Instead of actually addressing that though, they fall back on the much easier conclusion that people with dark skin are to blame. The media plays a part in all this, but individuals need to take responsibility and these particular individuals never will. They don&#x27;t trust anyone who seems &quot;intellectual&quot;, so there&#x27;s literally nothing I could say that would get through to them. Calling them idiots and moving on has the same end result for the target, but will convince a bystander more readily. If instead I engage with them in a debate, that automatically validates their (frankly insane) point of view, which confuses bystanders into thinking that maybe there is something to this &quot;election fraud&quot; nonsense. Deep down most of these folks are just terrible people who need to feel superior to others. Trump and the rest of the Republican party give that to them. They don’t want economic security, they want superiority over others. Until they change from within, they&#x27;re going to continue to be &quot;idiots&quot;.<p>In conclusion, why is it always &quot;the left&quot; that has to do the actual hard work in situations like these?')
