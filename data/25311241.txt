Item(by='namelosw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607136674, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25307663, text='&gt; the only way to become a billionaire is by exploiting people<p>I don&#x27;t if it is the only way to <i>become</i> a billionaire. But the bigger problem is every billionaire <i>is</i> exploiting people.<p>Imagine you are one of the wealthiest guys in the world. You can either:<p>- Hire the best financial guys to take care of your equities (although they are the best they look cheap to you).<p>- Hold a share of the equity of every business you can find in the world.<p>Either way, if the world is growing, you earn money by lying on the bed all day long. And then you can use the money exchange a large amount of people&#x27;s labor for your own pleasure, instead of building costly infrastructures for your country for very small returns.<p>Even if the world is going through a recession, other people would more desperate than you - you would lose part of your money, but people&#x27;s life would crash, small companies would go broke, most of the entities have to do sub-optimal choices, and you don&#x27;t have to. Then you can do the purchase and hold even more equities of the world.<p>In a word, holding extreme large number of equities <i>is</i> exploiting people because they can barely do nothing and enjoy people&#x27;s labor without any risks.')
