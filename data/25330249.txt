The feds do t have as much detail of government tied up in the Constitution that the legislature can&#x27;t amend on its own. The feds don&#x27;t have citizens reserving the powers of recall, referendum, and initiative. The feds don&#x27;t have a higher Constitutional bar for tax increases than passing a budget.<p>And the kind of electoral lopsidedness that occurs in CA wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as stable on a federal level; those no outside party to kowtow to that constrains major parties fromm competitive realignment.')
