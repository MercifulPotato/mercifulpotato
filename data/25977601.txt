(And Mexico seems to be handling covid better than the US anyway.)<p>Being an island has nothing to do with it. The difference is due to different health policies.<p>- We had mandatory masks in all public places here in Melbourne with on the spot fines by police. Over in the US lots of people thought covid is a hoax, and even your president refused to wear a mask.<p>- Australia declared mass gatherings to be illegal - it went through the courts and the judges decided public safety trumped a citizen&#x27;s rights to protest during the pandemic. Germany&#x27;s courts ruled in the opposite direction for an anti-mask protest. And meanwhile the US had BLM protests for months, presidential rallies and the capital hill riot.<p>And so on. These differences have nothing to do with sharing your continent with Canada and Mexico. They have everything to do with culture and public policy.')
