The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.&quot; [2]<p>These trials are explicitly about treating hospitalized patients, which is of course a group with a higher mortality than the general population. Nobody is saying otherwise. Remdesivir is administered intravenously, so it is unlikely you would try to deliver it to people with mild or asymptomatic infections. The comparison between the drugs in the general population would be very hard to do for that reason. Severe illness due to SARS-CoV-2 is such a huge problem that I&#x27;m not sure who would instead investigate a drug specifically for mild cases.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2007764?query=featured_home" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2007764?query=fe...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2022926?query=featured_home" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2022926?query=fe...</a>')
