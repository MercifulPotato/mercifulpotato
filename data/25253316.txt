Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606741639, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25250380, text='&gt; but I think claiming that managing gpg keys is _simple_ is a bit of a stretch.<p>It&#x27;s not simple but it&#x27;s really not too bad. Just make a key that expires and understand the details around revoking certs and backing up &#x2F; restoring and you&#x27;ll be good to go. All of that can be summed up in a few commands and a couple of minutes of video (and it is in the above video).<p>Getting your gpg keypair and pass synced across multiple devices can be done with rsync or whatever mechanism you use to share data between machines (dropbox, etc.). I happen to use rsync to sync it between my workstation and a laptop.')
