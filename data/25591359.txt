Proper nouns (generally capitalised words) are disallowed so June won&#x27;t. Not sure how best to communicate this in the game though.<p>The original had a wall-of-text pop-up of the rules when you first started that I want to avoid and I&#x27;d rather players picked up the rules organically. Maybe showing a &quot;proper nouns and capitalised words not allowed&quot; message when you spelled one would be a nice approach but a list of such words would be massive and inaccurate.<p>I think people generally figure out this rule as they play more but I admit it&#x27;s not ideal!')
