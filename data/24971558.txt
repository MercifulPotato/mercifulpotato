It&#x27;s not rust belt snow bad, but consistently cold and wet for months isn&#x27;t exactly ideal.<p>And SF-proper regularly being fogged in renders too many nights useless WRT enjoying the outdoors, year-round.  It&#x27;s almost pointless to have something like a rooftop deck or outdoor patio.  It&#x27;ll all corrode and rot before you get sufficient use of it.<p>San Mateo manages to escape most of the negative fog effects though, I enjoyed living on the hill by 92 and Hillsdale Blvd.  We&#x27;d regularly watch the apocalyptic fog stall @ Skyline while enjoying dinner outside on our deck.')
