Lots of mayors and local officials use that money for grand local infrastructure projects for which they won&#x27;t have any reasonable money to maintain even in the near future (let alone 30 to 50 years from now), because we have a numerically declining tax-base that is getting older and older (I live in one of those Eastern European countries).<p>But mentioning that issue gets you labeled as a person &quot;against progress&quot; or an anti-European (or worse, a Russian shill who doesn&#x27;t trust the European project). We have a saying in Romanian that roughly translates as: &quot;you should stretch out only as much as your blanket allows you to&quot;, i.e. one should only consume the resources he&#x2F;she thinks are reasonably available to him&#x2F;her, but right at this moment we are &quot;stretching out&quot; further than the bed itself and getting out of the bedroom altogether.')
