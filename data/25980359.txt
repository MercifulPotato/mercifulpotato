You&#x27;re free to add whatever app and install whatever app you want without Apple &#x2F; Google stopping you, and its decentralised.<p>The same has been said for desktop apps (Native or Electron), which have been hosted on the publisher&#x27;s websites for years, without the need of an App Store. I can imagine an &#x27;App Store&#x27; equivalent for Desktop which works like Cydia and F-Droid which allows users to discover and install an app with a simple deep-link into the App Store. Linux has this already, equivalents for Windows and macOS are possible but it should <i>not</i> come from GitHub.<p>The above approaches are already there and are completely decentralised. Unlike the author who is going for another centralised App Store in the hands of GitHub &#x2F; Microsoft (again).')
