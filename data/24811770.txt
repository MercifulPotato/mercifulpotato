And thus an attack on liberty. And the idea of a social contract is that I consent to give away some liberties for being able to participate in a functioning society. But when the social contract isn&#x27;t explicit, and expectations arn&#x27;t stated, I find that unfair, no matter if the force is physical or psychological.<p>Welp, good luck with that.  There&#x27;s tens of thousands of social rules that are understood by 99% of people, and you&#x27;re not going to find an explicit list somewhere of how far to stand away from someone when talking to them, to what kinds of initial conversations are appropriate, to saying &quot;thank you&quot; after someone gives you something, to attributing an idea to someone else, etc.  And failing to follow them will <i>rapidly</i> earn you scorn.<p>&gt; For example, what is Amazon supposed to do here? Should they offer a job? Pay up some amount of money? Cancel their project? Put a banner on amazon.com thanking the contributor?<p>If the product is 98% built upon some open source stuff, you put in the 2nd or 3rd paragraph description that it&#x27;s &quot;built upon&quot; or &quot;powered by&quot; or &quot;makes use of.&quot;  Even a footnote might be OK.  This is pretty obviously the right thing to do, and it&#x27;s also helpful to your users in understanding what your product is.')
