Rightly or wrongly, a significant amount of profit generated in the stock market is from short term moves &#x2F; games, not from buying and holding for long periods.<p>Second, and I don&#x27;t know if this is the case, but what about companies that were issuing equities to raise cash on that day? They had geared up entire investment banking teams, with customers orders lined up, and had a whole game plan for executing the offerings.<p>That all went up in smoke and they will have to re-prepare everything for another day. That&#x27;s true to IPOs, general follow-on offerings, to some extent ATM programs, etc.<p>Those are a couple ideas, maybe there are more?')
