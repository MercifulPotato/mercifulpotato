You just load up an image, it plays a modem sound, and the receiving station has it on loudspeaker, with another phone listening. It works remarkably well as long as the sending &#x2F; receiving environment is relatively quiet.<p>I even had a telegram chat with my kids where we would share memes back and forth as wave files. We called it 56k meme chat lol.')
