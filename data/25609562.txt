The more I read HN the more it feels like being a worker in the US is like riding a horse through the wild west; anything can happen.<p>In my country the overtime pay is mandatory by law and it is also constrained to be a minimum of 75% more than the normal wage.<p>Btw it is also mandatory to enjoy your (minimum of) 23 days of holidays per year; no exchanging for other perks or money, like some comment mentions above.')
