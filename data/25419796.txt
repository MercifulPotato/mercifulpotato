Seems to be effective for me (my feet have a tendency to get very cold when sitting for too long). Plus it&#x27;s better for my health (definitely improved muscle tone, even though I still cheat on the dips).<p>Takes less than 5 minutes every hour. Pair it with walking to the kitchen to top off the glass of water and staying hydrated, and my focus (when I get back) is generally much better than if I just sat at the desk all day with frozen feet.')
