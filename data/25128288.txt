This is the first issue I&#x27;ve had with any of their products, and this was with a brand new thermostat, it&#x27;s likely a light sensor issue which could happen to anyone.<p>I could have returned it to the store, but I didn&#x27;t want to deal with going in person and was hoping to get google to ship me a replacement thermostat.<p>The thermostat works now as a dumb thermostat, so I guess it&#x27;s the cost of convenience.')
