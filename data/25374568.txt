Police should not be escalating things beyond what is necessary and should be the ones acting professionally and not freaking out when people don’t do what they ask. When I worked in dementia care we constantly had to manage people who were not listening and doing inappropriate things. Hint; we did not get out the paddle. \nSo just because someone is not listening does not mean you need to escalate and bring guns to a situation that had none. The escalation should have been “if you don’t come out we will break down your door and take you out” that’s it. You people who justify guns for every situation where someone doesn’t follow very minor law is absurd. Resisting arrest though against the law happens countless times across the country and the police are not supposed to draw guns if they don’t need to. They could use a taser first for example.  Protesters climb trees or barricade them selves to prove a cause. They resist arrest. The last protesters I saw around here the RCMP just said ok screw it let’s just block the roads going in and when they get hungry they will come out. It didn’t last long before they were starved out. So I don’t buy your argument that because she didn’t listen this had to escalate. Not to the point of guns in her face.')
