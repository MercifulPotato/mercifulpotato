The whataboutism &quot;argument&quot; I was replying has no merit and neither does yours, or at the very least you haven&#x27;t thought it out properly. I&#x27;d like to see any self driving car navigate Indian traffic and after that you tell me if it&#x27;s safer.<p>Even a student driver is capable of navigating more complex traffic than the AP after just a few days or weeks of practicing. And at the end of that practice is a test that the AP would fail. After so many years the &quot;FSD&quot; AP still barely manages the most basic of driving feats, expected from a human <i>before</i> they get the driver&#x27;s license.')
