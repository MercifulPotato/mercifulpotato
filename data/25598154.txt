He thinks the concept of mining is a fundamental flaw.<p>But he keeps the door open for different implementations. Personally, I think the whole concept of blockchain-based currencies is flawed. But let’s not go there right now.<p>The value of Bitcoin is very high and that’s <i>very scary</i>. Who is buying? All those investors who have no place else to go? Gambling on Bitcoin to find ‘growth’?<p>Bitcoin is quickly becoming <i>too big to fail</i>. But it will fail at some point, because I believe it isn’t anything. (You may disagree, but hear me out). So when the music stops, I think it could be the event that triggers another 2007&#x2F;2008. Bot big enough by itself. But it triggers the same avalanche of bankruptcies, the dominos will fall.<p>This time though, all financial instruments to save us are exhausted. Interest is zero. The worst may yet to come.')
