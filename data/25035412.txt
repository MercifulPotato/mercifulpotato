I&#x27;d advise anyone offering advice to read &quot;Starting Strength&quot; (Mark Rippetoe), and if you are &gt;40 (or &gt;30 but in very bad physical shape), &quot;The Barbell Prescription: Strength Training for Life After 40&quot;. That second book is actually a good read even if you are not over 40, because a) you will be, b) it contains excellent information on our physiology and biochemistry and a great rationale for doing strength training rather than just cardio.<p>Don&#x27;t base your decisions on what has been written in this thread. Most information here is anecdotal, garbage, or both.')
