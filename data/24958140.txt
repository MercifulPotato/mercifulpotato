That is in other words let’s recreate human society.<p>Going down to particulars, strip individuals of rights to determine who gets their property and another group of people - through the elected or by mob action , should determine it. This creates more incentive to be part of the group that makes that determination than the group that actually creates wealth.<p>Secondly, the question of distribution comes up and the question of citizenry. If this is a high minded idea , not one based of millennial of social constructs of nationhood and citizenry , why not share the resources to everyone in the world, why only in a particular “country”.<p>Would you be happy if you have to make sacrifices to succeed , and I am very sure every success comes with a sacrifice just to give others who have not made such or similar sacrifices .<p>My assumption is that countries that have high inheritance tax create a disincentive to creators of wealth via aggregations &#x2F; efficiency or disruption because such wealth would be stolen from them . You make enough just to be comfortable .')
